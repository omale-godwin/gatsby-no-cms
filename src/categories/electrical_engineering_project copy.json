[{"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div>All modern engineering system includes certain aspects of control system at some point in their broadcast scenes, control engineering and the associated theory are concerned with the means of making system to behave in a desired may. </div> <div>The system on this thesis is a DC \" AC inverter which is an apparatus used in the conversion of direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC).</div> <div>In our contry today, this equipment is not all that in use not because it is not important but because people never give it a thought as per the construction and design.</div> <div>It is meant for use with a 12volts leadacid battery of it's in a car for example a suitable output voltage of 240volts AC  obtainable.</div> <div>This output voltage of 240volts AC can be used for powering small electrical appliances such as lights, electrical tools radio, soldering iron, fan etc. However,  it is with mentioning that the DC generated with this appliance is nothing comparable to the AC generated by big generation duration. This appliance is therefore suitable for short time replacement for the real AC generation especially in the remote areas and it is install where electrical appliances are sold and the need might arise for it to be tested and certified good.</div> <div>Another main area where this equipment can be of great utility is in communication system. In a situation where there is a constant AC power supply failure example in offices DC \" AC inverter is needed and such cases, inverter can be used as a source of light.</div> <div>Most industries in the country do not make use of DC \" AC inverter because the are through to be costly with respect to the task they perform. However, putting into consideration the task, this appliance can perform. It can be concluded that it is cheaper. The construction is simple, cheaper, easy to operate and portable. The usefulness of this device and the function cannot be over emphasized especially now that our country is passage through a very sensitive era in our power generating Authority (NEPA) has been dubbed NEVER EXPECT POWER ALWAYS. In these times when control and monitor of complex field operations have based in computer, a failure of AC, power supply to communication equipment means work stoppage and to some small scale industries a lot of economic and materials losses is avoidable. </div> </div> <div> <div><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></div> <div>Title Page</div> <div>Certification Page</div> <div>Acknowledgements</div> <div>Dedication </div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION </strong></div> <div>1.1 Definition of Term </div> <div><strong>CHAPTER TWO:</strong></div> <div>TRANSFORMER FUNDAMENTALS </div> <div><strong>CHAPTER THREE:</strong></div> <div>DESCRIPTION OF COMPONENTS </div> <div>3.1 Resistors </div> <div>3.2 Capacitors</div> <div>3.2.1 Types of Capacitor</div> <div>3.3 Semi-Conductor Diode </div> <div>3.4 Transistors </div> <div>3.4.1 Bipolar Transistor </div> <div>3.5 Field Effect Transistor (FET)</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER FOUR:</strong></div> <div>OPERATION AND DESIGN CONSIDERATION </div> <div>4.1 Features of the Device</div> <div>4.1.1 Supply Unit </div> <div>4.1.2 Inverter Unit </div> <div>4.1.3 Stepup Transformer Unit </div> <div>4.1.4 Triggering or Switching Unit </div> <div>4.2 Design</div> <div>4.2.1 Required Specification</div> <div>4.2.2 Triggering or Switching Circuit</div> <div>4.2.3 Buffer Stage</div> <div>4.2.4 Transformer Turns Ratio </div> <div><strong>CHAPTER FIVE:</strong></div> <div>CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURE AND TESTING </div> <div>5.1 Casing and Packaging </div> <div><strong>CHAPTER SIX:</strong></div> <div>ASSEMBLING OF SECTIONS </div> <div>6.1 Testing of System Operation</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER SEVEN:</strong></div> <div>INSTALLATION OF COMPLETED DESIGN</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER EIGHT:</strong></div> <div>LIST, QUANTITY AND PRIZES OF COMPONENTS USED</div> <div>8.1 Conclusion </div> </div>\n\nTHE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN INVERTER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN INVERTER", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>The topic of this project is \" Audio Amplifier\".

of technology things are becoming simpler and easier for us. Automatic systems are being preferred over manual system. The purpose of this project is to design and construct A GSM based home automation using AVR. Using GSM networks, in this project a home power control system has been proposed that will act as an embedded system which can monitor and control appliances and other devices locally using built-in input and output peripherals. The system has a delay of 2 minutes after the first call to initiate the next command. This project is made up of four vital units. These units are as follows: GSM module unit, peripheral interface control (PIC) unit, driver unit and a power monitoring and control unit. The GSM module is a GSM transceiver which gives the system access to the GSM service provider. The peripheral interface control (PIC) is programmed to carry out the OFF/ RESET operation according to the GSM commands while the driver and control unit consist of capacitors, resistors, diodes, regulators and electromagnetic relay is to effect power switching. The major component that performed the power control of 220v main supply and the automatic voltage regulation (AVR) is the automated electromagnetic relay.

GSM-SMS technology can be used to control household appliances from remote places. Remotely, the system allows the home owner to monitor and control his house appliances via his mobile phone set by sending commands in the form of SMS message and receiving the appliances status as well. This system provides ideal solution to the problems caused in situations when a wired connection between a remote appliance device and the control unit might not be feasible. The system is wireless and uses the user’s mobilethe system is more adaptable and cost effective. The system uses GSM technology thus providing ubiquitous access to the system for appliance control. With this hypothesis, three different approaches have been proposed and implemented in this project; FIRSTLY, home control switch/household appliances are controlled by server mobile which acts as remote control. SECONDLY, GSM-SMS messaging technology is used to control them from remote places and FINALLY, to provide a multiple agents environment.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENT</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p> 1.0  INTRODUCTION</p> <p> 1.1  PROJECT OBJECTIVE       2</p> <p> 1.2  SCOPE OF THE  PROJECT</p> <p>1.3  OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM</p> <p> 1.4  ARCHTECTURE OF THE SYSTEM</p> <p> CHAPTER TWO</p> <p> 2. 0 LITERURE REVIEW         </p> <p>  2.1 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION</p> <p> 2.1.1 USER GSM MOBILE HANDSET</p> <p> 2.1.2 RECEIVER GSM HANDSET</p> <p>2.2 MICROCONTROLLER BOARD</p> <p> 2.3 SWITCHING MODULE</p> <p> CHAPTER THREE</p> <p> 3.0 SOFTWARE DESIGNING</p> <p> 3.1 TRANSFORMER</p> <p> 3.2 TRANSFORMER CALCULATION</p> <p>  3.3 RECTIFICATION PROCESS</p> <p> 3.4 MICROCONTROLLER SECTION</p> <p> CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p> 4.0 TESTING</p> <p> 4.1 SYSTEM TESTING</p> <p> 4.2 PACKAGING</p> <p> 4.3 TROUBLE SHOOTING THE DESIGN</p> </div> <div> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p> 5.0 PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED</p> <p> 5.1 PRECAUTIONS</p> <p> 5.2 RECOMMENDATION</p> <p> 5.3 CONCLUSION</p> <p> 5.5 APPENDIX</p> <p>  5.4 PROGRAMME CODES</p> <p>  5.6 REFERENCE</p> </div> <div> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Nowadays, people’s expectations in t technology is improving rapidly. People need an affordable system (smart) that can make their lives easier, more comfortable, and offer more safety.GSM based home automation system is an electrical and electronic system designed to control home appliance with a mobile phone. The two main technologies applied in the system are GSM and PLC. GSM stands for global system for mobile communication and PLC stands for power line communication. In this study, Nokia 6100 is chosen as the GSM phone that receives command and transfers it to controller. Due to rapidly advancing of mobile communication technology and widely availability make it possible to incorporate mobile technology into home</p> <p>automation systems. ’’AT’’ command is phone and microcontroller by passing through a serial interface RS232 with the</p> <p>help of its driver.</p> <p>The project is based on the principle of GSM network, which enables the user to remotely control the operations of the appliances by using a mobile phone. In other word it would transform a normal home into an intelligent home. The controlling circuit is the most important component in communication and interface between home appliances. It was implemented by using peripheral interface controller (PIC) interfaced to mobile phone. The user can perform ON/OFF operations of the appliances just by pressing keypad of mobile phone.</p> </div> <div> <p>The user sends GSM data in the form of SMS (short message service) message to switch ON or OFF any appliances at home such as lamp, air condition, fan and etc. the appliances may also provide the user with its current ON/OFF status. The system can be improved to provide the user with information about the status of each appliance.</p> <p> PROJECT OBJECTIVES</p> <p>The objectives of this project are as follows;</p> <p>   1.                 To design and develop home appliances control system over GSM network by using a mobile phone.</p> <p>2.                 To determine and understand on how the GSM works.</p> <p>3.                 To understand the architecture and programming of the PIC.</p> <p>4.                 To learn the troubleshooting and techniques.</p> <p> SCOPE OF THE PROJECT</p> <p> The scopes of works in this project are;</p> <p>1.                 Mobile phone with SIM card enables the user to remotely control the operations of the appliances by communication to the GSM modem.</p> <p>2.                 GSM modem allows the capability to send and receive SMS to and from the mobile phone.</p> <p>3.                 RS-232 is the basic serial communication cable that will be used to interface between GSM modem and PIC microcontroller.</p> <p>4.                 PIC microcontroller will be interfaced to the control circuit that is connected to the appliances. It contains the software components through which the appliances are controlled and monitored.</p> <p>5.                 Relay and control circuit used to detect and control the condition of the home appliances.</p> <p>OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM</p> <p>The system works as a remote sensing for the electrical appliances at home or industry to check whether it is ON or OFF, at the same time the user can control the electrical appliances at home by sending SMS message into the system, for example, turning on the AC before returning home. in case of fire/security the chip will receive signals from the different sensors in the monitoring place and acts according to the received signal by sending an SMS message to user’s mobile phone, it also works as automatic and immediate reporting to the user</p> <p>in case of emergency for home security, as well as immediate and automatic reporting to the fire brigade and police station according to activated sensor to decrease the time required for tracking action.</p> <p>A sketch of overall design of the home appliances control using GSM is shown in the figure below.</p> <p>RS232 interface</p> <p>Mobile</p> <p>device</p> <p>(user)</p> <p>GSM</p> <p>PIC</p> <p>modem</p> <p>Relay interface</p> <p>  FIG; Simplified block diagram of home appliances</p> <p> Control using GSM.</p> <p>ARCHTECTURE OF THE SYSTEM</p> <p>It can be implemented to any levels of the security system. The architecture of the system mainly consists of three components the GSM MODEM and the interface circuit that include the different sensors used. The function of the GSM MODEM is the remote communication between the user and the controller through the RS232 serial communication standard. The function of the controller is to continuously check the inputs coming from the different sensor and send message through the GSM network in case of emergency such that it acts as a 24hours monitoring and continuously checking for any received message from the user through the GSM MODEM to switch on the AC for example</p> </div>\n\nHOME CONTROL SWITCH AUTOMATION USING GSM COMMUNICATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " HOME CONTROL SWITCH AUTOMATION USING GSM COMMUNICATION", "id": 5}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p> T-junction traffic light controller is such a device that will play a significant role in controlling traffic at junctions, to ease the expected increased rush at such junctions and reduce to minimum disorderliness that may arise, as well as allowing the pedestrians a right of the way at intervals rather than being struck down when in a hurry to cross the roads. Such an electrical system with a touch of electronics that control the flow of traffic in a pre-determined sequential pattern at a junction, has its diagram comprising of different components.

Transmission systems are required (a) to enable sources of natural energy (eg water fails – dams, or storage loaves, reservoirs for hydropower station, fuel fields, coal gas, diesel – for thermal generating station), for distant from the centre of energy demand (e.g large works, industrial areas of cities), to be economically utilized, (b) to enable generating plant to be concentrated in a few large. Favourably situated stations; and (c) to per met of the in for connection of network or distributing areas to ensure reliability economy and stability or continuity of supply.</p> <p>There are three main facts in the production and utilization of electricity namely: generations transmission, and distribution generation of electrical energy employs electrical power stations. These power stations generate electrical energy making use of fuel (e.g coal, gas, diesel) as mom raw material; hence thus type is called steam or thermal power station. Other power stations make use of water falls or storage haves – hence called hydro electric power station: etc.</p> <p>No mater the type of the power station employed, the voltage generated is usually in a low level e.g 11KV or 25KV. Owing to the distance between the centre of energy dim and (consumption areas) to the power stations, transmission system of energy times into play. A high voltage is desirable for transmitting large power in order to decrease the 12R losses and reduce the amount of conductor material. Therefore, a transformer is employed to step up the generated voltage to 3300KV/ the highest National Grid voltage although effort are being made to increase it to 765KV for transmission. This 330KV is transmuted to the distribution ends. A very much however voltage, on the other hand, is required for distribution, for various reasons connected with safely and convenience. The transformer also mavies this easily and economically possible as the 330KV is stepped down to 132KV, 66KV, 33KV, 11KV, 415KV and to a minimum level of 240V for distribution to various load centre (consumption area).</p> <p>1.1       BACKGROUND</p> <p>            The device to increase (step up) or decrease (step down) the generated voltage is called the transformer. It is a static (stationary) alternating consent machine.</p> <p>            Basically, transformers are classified according to purpose namely:- power transformer, distribution transformer, Auto-transformer and instrument transformer, power transformer are large transformers generally used at generating stations to step up the voltage, and at the substations to step d0wn the voltage for supplying distribution systems. They may also be used for tionving together two power stations. The power transformer has a high utilization factor, e.g it is arranged that they run with an almost constant load which is equal to their rating. The maximum efficiency is designed to be at fall load. This means that the fall-load winding losses must be equal to the here losses.</p> <p>            According to common usage, a transformer rated over 500KVA is termed a power transformer.</p> <p>            The distribution transformer has a intermittent and variable head which is usually considerable less than fall-head rating. They are therefore, designed to have their maximum efficiency at between half and three – quarter of fall head.</p> <p>            The instrument transformers are of two types depending on the mode of operation voltage or current transformers. The current (series) and voltage (shunt) transformers are used for extending the range of a.c. instruments in preference to shunts and series resistors. </p> <p>1.2              THE AIM OF STUDY</p> <p>The aim of our study is to design and construct an auto-transformer which can step-down 240V from the local supply down to 110V, 80V, 12V, 6V, to sent the various voltage requirements of numerous electrical and electronic appliances, often appliances imported from say America where the domestic voltage level is 110Volts.</p> <p>This auto-transformer can conveniently do at a relatively cheap cost or rate. The output of this transformer is made by making numerous tapping on the primary winding depending on the required output.</p> <p>1.3              SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>The scope of our study is committed to 1KVA auto-transformer (stepdown) that has these tappings as follows 110V, 80V 12V, 6V. In view of this any other thin out side this topic would not be considered.</p> <p>Because of the various voltage levels on the secondary, it can be used to supply voltage to American equipment at 110V, for welding machines and electronic equipment at 12V, 6V and 80V, and for barberry charging at 6V or 12V.</p> <p>1.4              DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>Transformer: A transformer is alternating current machine which is usual to increase (step-up) or decrease (step down) voltage (a.c).</p> <p>Auto- Transformer: This is a transformer with single winding. The single winding is common to both the priming and the secondary of the transformer.</p> <p>Winding: The winding of a transformer is the band of copper conductor which is wound into many farms on the transformer core.</p> <p>Core: The core of a transformer is a pile of haminated sheets of science steel.</p> <p>Turns: This is the number of times or rounds the copper conductor is wound on the core.</p> <p>Lamina: This is a single sheet of the soft iron which is insulated or lamination.</p> <p>Primary Winding: The primary winding of a transformer is the winding that is directly connected to the over is the winding that is directly connected to the supply.</p> <p>Secondary Winding: This is the winding that is directly connected to the head.</p> <p>Tappings: Tappings refers to the connections which are usually made successively in the winding of a transformer especially in auto transformer.</p> <p>Step up: When the primary voltage is lower than the secondary voltage, the transformer is caved a step up transformer.</p> <p>Step down: When the primary voltage is higher than the secondary voltage, the transformer is called a step down transformer.</p> <p>Window: This is the space in the transformer core bounded by the 10Kes and the timbs of the transformer.</p> <p>Varnish: This is an insulating Tigard which used to increase the insulation of the transformer core and winding as well as making it inechanically strong. It so laxities when air acts and it.</p> <p>Copper Conductors: These are bare copper worse which are used in transformer windings.</p> <p>Wire Sleeve: This can be fibre or plastic coating which is used to insulate and isolate the transformer winding terminals.</p> <p>Slot Popper: This is a thick insulating paper which is used to wrap the transformer winding and separate each layer of the winding. It serves as mechanical protection.</p> <p>Center Block: This is a wirden block approximately the size of the central limb of the transformer core. It is on the centre block that the former is made.</p> </div>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A SINGLE PHASE AUTO-TRANSFORM OF RATING IKVA, 240 V/110, 80 12V, 6V<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A SINGLE PHASE AUTO-TRANSFORM OF RATING IKVA, 240 V/110, 80 12V, 6V", "id": 7}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>An inverter is an electronic device that converts direct current (DC­) to alternating current (AC) the converted Ac can be at any required voltage and frequency with the use of appropriate transformers, switching and control circuit. It’s simple put, is an electronic box that makes household electricity for everyday items.  It converts power from eg car batteries, windmills, solar panels or fuel cells, then turns it into normal household power.  That is, supply AC power from DC source.       Solid state inverters have no moving parts and are used in a wide range of applications, from small switching power supplies in computers, to large electric utility high voltage direct current applications that transport bulk power.  The Inverter performs the opposite function at a rectifier.  There is one more thing you need to be very careful about that is, do you want clean or dirty electricity? What I mean here is that there are two types of electricity that inverters can produce.  Pure sine wave Inverters and Modified sine wave Inverters. The difference is that pure sine wave matches the power to that of which you get from you electricity supplier, its clean and you can run any appliances safely even sensitive equipment. Modified sine wave is dirty power, you can use this to power a lot of things that don’t have sensitive electronics.  Kettle for example fridges, cookers, hot plates etc. You cannot run led lighting on these Inverters as they over head and die within a couple of hours. You have to be careful with some Tvs PCs as they do n like it either, but I have heard that lot of people use them for this with no problems, but I like to be safe, rather than sorry.</p> TABLE OF CONTENTS CHAPTER ONE   Introduction                        CHAPTER TWO  Transformer Fundamentals           CHAPTER THREE         <p>3.1    Description Of Components          </p> <p>3.2    Capacitors                         </p> <p>3.2.1 Types of Capacitor              </p> <p>3.3    Semi-Conductor Diode         </p> <p>3.4    Transistors                                </p> <p>3.4.1   Bipolar Transistor                     </p> <p>3.5      Field Effect Transistor (FET)        </p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR         </p> <p>Operation and Design Consideration</p> <p>4.1            Features of the Device                      </p> <p>4.1.1      Supply Unit              </p> <p>4.1.2      Inverter Unit                    </p> <p>4.1.3      Stepup Transformer Unit   </p> <p>4.1.4      Triggering or Switching Unit               </p> <p>4.2            Design                                            </p> <p>4.2.1      Required Specification       </p> <p>4.2.2      Triggering or Switching Circuit</p> <p>4.2.3      Buffer Stage                            </p> <p>4.2.4      Transformer Turns Ratio            </p> CHAPTER FIVE:           CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURE AND TESTING <p>5.1        Casing and Packaging         </p> CHAPTER SIX:             ASSEMBLING OF SECTIONS <p>6.1        Testing of System Operation        </p> <p>CHAPTER SEVEN:       INSTALLATION OF COMPLETED DESIGN                       </p> <p>List, Quantity And Prizes Of Components Used</p> <p>Conclusion                                         </p> CHAPTER ONE <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>        All modern engineering system includes certain aspects of control system at some point in their broadcast scenes, control engineering and the associated theory are concerned with the means of making system to behave in a desired may.</p> <p>        The system on this thesis is a DC – AC inverter which is an apparatus used in the conversion of direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC).</p> <p>        In our country today, this equipment is not all that in use not because it is not important but because people never give it a thought as per the construction and design.</p> <p>        It is meant for use with a 12volts lead acid battery of it’s in a car for example a suitable output voltage of 240volts AC obtainable.</p> <p>        This output voltage of 240volts AC can be used for powering small electrical appliances such as lights, electrical tools radio, soldering iron, fan etc. However, it is with mentioning that the DC generated with this appliance is nothing comparable to the AC generated by big generation duration. This appliance is therefore suitable for short time replacement for the real AC generation especially in the remote areas and it is install where electrical appliances are sold and the need might arise for it to be tested and certified good.</p> <p>        Another main area where this equipment can be of great utility is in communication system. In a situation where there is a constant AC power supply failure example in offices DC – AC inverter is needed and such cases, inverter can be used as a source of light.</p> <p>        Most industries in the country do not make use of DC – AC inverter because there are through to be costly with respect to the task they perform. However, putting into consideration the task, this appliance can perform. It can be concluded that it is cheaper. The construction is simple, cheaper, easy to operate and portable. The usefulness of this device and the function cannot be over emphasized especially now that our country is passing through a very sensitive era in our power generating Authority (NEPA) has been dubbed NEVER EXPECT POWER ALWAYS. In these times when control and monitor of complex field operations have based in computer, a failure of AC, power supply to communication equipment means work stoppage and to some small scale industries a lot of economic and materials losses is avoidable.</p> <p>        Inverters come in different types. Examples</p> <p>Modified sine wave, pure sine wave and grid tie inverter are:</p> <p>Modified Sine Wave: The output of a modified sine wave inverter is similar to square wave output except that the output goes to zero Volts for a time before switching positive or negative. It is simple and low cost, also it’s compatible with most electronic devices, except for sensitive or specialized equipment for example certain laser printers, fluorescent lighting, audio equipment.  Most AC motors will run off this power source about at a reduction inefficiency of approximately 20%.</p> <p>        A pure sine wave inverter produces a nearly perfect sine wave output (&lt;3% total harmonic distortion) that is essentially the same as utility –supplied grid power.  Thus it is compatible with all AC electronic devices.  This is the type used in grid tie inverts. Its design is more complex, and costs more per unit power.  The electrical inverter is a high power electronic oscillator.  It is so named because early mechanical AC to PC converters were made to work in reserve and thus were “inverted” to convert DC to AC.</p> <p>        A grid tie inverter is a sine wave inverter designed to inject electricity into the electric power distribution system.  Such inverter must synchronise with the frequency of the grid.  They usually contain one or more maximum power point tracking features to extract the maximum amount of power, and also include safety features.</p> <p>APPLICATIONS</p> <p>DC Power Source Utilization</p> <p>Inverter designed to provide 115 VAC from the 12 VDC source provided in an automobile.  The unit shown provides up to 1.2 amperes of alternating current, or enough to power two sixty watt light bulbs.</p> <p>Micro –inverter convert direct current from individual solar panels into alternating current for the electric grid.  They are grid tie designs by default.</p> <p>Uninterruptible Power Supplies  </p> <p>An uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) uses batteries and an inverter to supply AC power when main power is not available.  When main power is restored, a rectified supplies DC power to recharge the batteries.</p> <p>        Induction heating inverters convert low frequency main AC power to higher frequency for use in induction heating.  To do this, AC power is first rectified to proved DC power.  The inverter then charges the DC power to high frequency AC power.</p> </div>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN INVERTER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN INVERTER", "id": 8}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This is a technical report presented on the design and construction of an Automatic Three Phase Selector.</p> <p>        In the construction work, an ordinary level knowledge of electronics principles are observed.

A lasting solution is vested on alternative use of the renewable energy source, a project that is yet to be widely applied. Hence, the continuation of the unsettled yearn for sufficient power. Consequently, the power lines are frequently over loaded resulting to a trip of power by the action of switch gears or by the load shading process undertaken by the distribution authorities.</p> <p>        Since it is crystal clear that some institutions such as health related institutions and some other delicate systems should not be allowed to suffer equally with their counterparts, Automatic Phase Selector is used to sustain energy consumption in the time of phase trip. The design of this circuit involves the use of automatic switches but the details of design varies from place to place, time to time and also depends on the type of load involved.</p> <p>        This project involves the use of transistor driven relays to affect the change of phase whenever the voltage condition becomes intolerable in the previous phase connected.  </p> <p>1.1          AIMS/OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT</p> <p>The analysis of this project cannot go without enumerating the goals meant to be achieved in the pursuit of the work. These objectives include:-</p> <p>i.        To develop a simple low cost device aimed at easing the prevalent burden faced by delicate offices, parastatals and institutions who need very low but constant power supply. Since supply is always on along the distribution lines that supply such sites, what pesters on the progress of work thereof is always the unwarranted trip of phases due to power usage from neighbouring consumers. The automatic phase selector therefore, erase this setback form the face of progress of work in such offices.</p> <p>ii.      To stimulate the interest of upcoming students to take up research not only in their field of study “Electrical/Electronics Engineering” but also to extend their arms to other disciplines, thus enhancing the versatility of Electrical/Electronics Engineering.</p> <p>iii.    To create awareness that will stimulate the interest of fellow students who intend to take up research topic on automatic switch of any type.</p> <p>    Emphatically, the purpose of this project is to build an automatic switch system which is capable of selecting a phase with best operating voltage for delicate offices.</p> <p>1.2         SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</p> <p>The significance of this project work cannot be overemphasized. This is because the number of lives that has being lost to the hand of interruption of power in health institutions and the like is not negligible. Delicate appliances have become the main victim of this artificial circumstance. The applicability of the outcome of this research work in several facets of human endeavour makes this work of real importance to humanity.</p> <p>        The use of the device produced from this research work would help to reduce human labour and hazard, going by the fact that many have been handicapped by electric shock because of the attempt they made to select another phase, and that the handicapped are helpless and cannot change phases.</p> <p>1.3          METHODOLOGY</p> <p>The designing of this circuit was accomplished by a constant and detailed study of the c constituent components. This involved the study of their  characteristics in isolation, and when connected together with some other components. A rough design was always made with some theoretical backup. Those designs were implemented and tested using project boards.</p> <p>        The internet was visited for circuit ideas where problems were encountered and the necessary adjustments made on paper and then effected on the projects board.</p> <p>        Each block that works was transferred to the Vero board where it was finally soldered in position.

The negative electrode is of lead and the positive electrode is of lead (iv) oxide (pb02).  The electrolyte is sulphur acid initially of density. 1.21 the initial emf of the battery it about 2.1 volts.  This rapidly decrcoses to 2.0 volts at which figure it remains nearly constant until the battery is almost discharge re-charging should be begin if the emf falls as low as 1.8 volts.</p> <p>        Those substance of the cell which stake active part in chemical combination and hence absords or produces electricity during charging or discharging are known as active materials of the cell.  The active materials of a lead acid cell are.</p> <p>1.           Lead peroxide (Pb02) for positive plate</p> <p>2.           Spong lead (Pb) for negative plate</p> <p>3.           Delute Sulphorine Acid (H2 S04) as electrolyte</p> <p>Lead peroxide (pb02) is a combination of lead and oxygen.  Its dure chocolate brown in colour and its quite hard but brittle substance.  It is made up of one atom of lead (pb) and two atoms of oxygen (02) and its chemical formular is Pb02: As said earlier, it posses the positive action material of the accumulator.  The spong lead (pb) is a pure leads in soft sponge or porous conduction, its chemical formualr is Pb and forms the negative alhra material.</p> <p>        The dilute sulphrine acid is approximately  three parts water and one parts suphurie acid the chemical formular of this is H2 S04.  The positive and negative plates are inversed in this solution known as electrolyte.  The current producers chemical changes in this solution.  Hence the  lead acid cell depend.  For its action of the presence of two plates covered with Pb02 and Pb in solution of dilute H2S04 of specific gravity of 1.21 or ne3ar about as earlier stated.  The basically means of discharging and the charging process of the accumulator is known as chemical charger.</p> <p>        In the process of the accumulator is known as chemical charger.  In the process of dischargings of a battery.  If the cell is fully charged, it s positive plate or anode is Pb02(dack chocolate brown0 and the negative plate or cathode is pb (slate grey) when the cell discharges, the scorda current through the extend lend, then H2 S04 is dissociated into positive H2 and negative S04 ions.  As the current within the cell is flowing from cathode to anode in the process of charging of a battery if the cell is recharged, then hydrogen ions (H2) moves to cathode and S04 ions gas to anode and the following charges would likely placed.</p> <p>        At cathode</p> <p>                Pb S04 + H2                Pb + H2 S04</p> <p>        At Anode</p> <p>                Pb S04 + S04 + 2H20                  Pb02 + 2H2 S04</p> <p>General, it will be noted that during discharging the following are absorbed:</p> <p>i.             Both anode and cathode becomes pb S04 which is whitish in colour</p> <p>ii.            The specific gravity and acid is discharged due to the formation of water</p> <p>iii.          The voltage of the cell decrease</p> <p>iv.          The cells given out energy</p> METHOD OF CHARGING <p>        These are basically four method of charging batteries.   They are includes:</p> <p>a.           Constant voltage</p> <p>b.           Constant current</p> <p>c.           Ride charging and</p> <p>d.           Floating charging</p> <p>But for the purpose of celerity and simplification of works and increase of theirs project it is the constant voltage method that we are going to discuss furt6her.  This method has been employed while testing and constructing the charger.</p> CONSTANT – VOLTAGE METHOD <p>          In the method of charging the voltage is  maintained at a value which is slightly in excess of the end of fully charged battery, act the beginning of the charging period the current is charged.</p> <p>        During the charging process the current fails as the emf of the cell rises to approach the charging voltage when the battery is fully charged it up to its maximum 12 volts, the charger will automatically stop charging with the help of the contact relay, the transistor and the zener dioxide which send the current back to the system.</p> <p>        Then at this moment</p> <p>        The charging current is usually determined from the formular</p> <p>IC     =      V – E</p> <p>

It was created by an unnamed Nebraska inventor in June 20th, 1920. It utilizes the drive shaft to operate its own bell or horn signal when the car is properly moved. This is just a little talk on a car alarm but not a car touch intruder alarm which is a modern, more advanced, and more reliable type of car alarm.</p> <p>        This car touch sensitive alarm project consist of three NE555 timer IC, the first NE555 was wired as monostable  multi-vibrator and the remaining two were wired as tone generator. When the sensor is touch or has contact with human hand perhaps body, IC1 is triggered at its pin 2 and output pin 3 goes high for a time period previously set by the values of R4 (10M) and Q1 (transistor) was bias via R3 and this transistor is in such a way that once it was biased it will supply a negative voltage to tone generator thereby making two NE555 timer which was know as (tone generator) to oscillate to make a bell sound through the buzzer. The tone generators are configured as an astable multi-vibrator whose oscillation frequency can be varied with the help of PR1 and PR2.

In these days depriving  people of electric power is tan tantamount to risk of losing potential investors and also   prolong development.</p> <p>The Power generation can be  through one of the following sources  of energy coal, oil or natural gas, hydro power  (water turbine), nuclear power (stream  turbine), solar-wind or water wave  turbine, solar thermal generator, solar voltaic generator, coal, oil, gas and hydro Power are  abundant in Nigeria.</p> <p>Presently  Nigeria Mostly employ gas fired and hydroelectric Power bring that oil is too expensive and coal-fired station have gone moribund the maximum Power  consumption or  peak demand depends on the population and industrialization of a country. If the maximum supply meets the peak demand there is a surplus otherwise there is a shortfall.</p> <p>However, in Nigeria, the Power supply system is run with a shortfall as demand  tends to exceeds supply.</p> <p>The power holding company of Nigeria (PHCN) is responsible for generating, transmitting distributing and sells electric power to various  consumers  across the country. A major objective of PHCN naturally has been  to provide  regular  and uninterrupted power supply to electricity consumer nationwide.</p> <p>There has  been study of power supply  systems as well as various aspects of their  operations, however very few have investigates  and documented in learned journals  the counterpart (factor affecting) of the system in Nigeria. The establishment and the growth of electricity in Nigeria dates back as far as  1896 when it was first produce in Lagos,  fifteen years after its introduction in England (Niger. Power Review, 1985). The total capacity of the generation used then was  60KW. In other words the maximum demand in 1896 was less  than 60KW  and then in 1946 the Nigeria government  electricity undertaking was established under the jurisdiction of the responsibility of (PWD) to take  over the responsibility of electricity supply in Lagos  State.  And in 1950  a central body was established by the legislative council which transferred electricity supply and development of the care of the body known as the electricity corporation of Nigeria (ECN). Other bodies like native Authorities and the Nigerian Electricity  Supply Company (NESCO) had  licenses  to produced  electricity in some locations in Nigeria.</p> <p>Another body known as Niger Dams Authority (NDA) which was established by an  Act of parliament the Authority was responsible for the construction and maintenance of dams  and other works on the River Niger  and elsewhere  generating  electricity by means of water Power, improving  navigation and promoting  fish brines and irrigation the electricity produced by NDA was bold  to ECN for distribution and sales at unity voltage.</p> <p>In April 1972, the operation of ECN/NDA were merged in anew organization known as the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) since ECN  was mainly responsible for distribution and sales and NDA was created to build and run-generating station and transmission lines, the primary aim for merging the organization were  (Niger Power Review 1989)</p> <p>The capacity in Kilowatt generated by each of the generating system inv various part of the country (Nigeria) has also been studied. The work which also examined the Nigerian Electricity marked and found that the annual growth rate of electricity average about 18 percent  still had low electricity consumption of 60KWH capita (1979 figure) which is less than 1 percent of industrialized countries. The work however pointed out that the low consumption capita in Nigeria is due to the fact that over 80 percent of the population normally resides  in the rural area where they have no access to electricity as well as low level of industrialization.</p> <p>The solar and wind  energy resource in Nigeria was  investigated  and found that the annual mean of solar meter square  and global radiation is as high as 24mj per meter squared per day due to it good  geographical location latitude 4 degree and 14 degree north of the equator. Nigeria’s Power Company-Power Holding Company of Nigeria has an  installed  generating capacity of about 6GW but actual available output is less than 2.5GW Power  outage (black out) is frequent.</p> <p>1.2    Aims and Objectives of the Study</p> <p> This Paper looks into some recent major Power  outage in Nigeria and adequate examined the root causes and dynamic of this problem and possible recommendations for possible solution.</p> <p>1.3       Significance of the Study</p> <p>Electricity as a source of energy is vital to the growth and development of any economy. Its  significance arises from the impact it  has on infrastructure, a range of socio-economic activities and consequently on the country’s  standard of living. This means that transportation, communication, construction, and  other facilities   depend on electricity to function effectively. Electricity has continued  to play a significance role in the development process. In the Nigerian situation the reverse appears to be the case  because Power  outages have continued to affect the country’s  development. Some have argued that  privatizing  electricity  supply through   the unbundling of power generation arm of National Electric Power  Authority (NEPA) Now  Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) will ensure  its  efficiency . Despite this reform, electricity supply I still rationed to the consumers  in ways that are still grossly inadequate.</p> </div>\n\nFACTORS AFFECTING POWER OUTAGE IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FACTORS AFFECTING POWER OUTAGE IN NIGERIA", "id": 13}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Automatic water level controller for both overhead and underground tank is designed to monitor the level of water in a tank. It displays the level of water and when it is at the lowest level; a pump is activated automatically to refill the tank. When the tank is filled to its maximum capacity, the pump is automatically de-energized. Several circuits are put together to ensure proper working of this design, and the block diagram includes the supply unit, the micro-processor unit, the sensor unit, the display unit and the pump drives unit. The power unit is responsible for turning on the entire circuit. Some components are used to set up power unit and they include; a 15v step down transformer, a bridge rectifier circuit, a smoothening capacitor and a voltage regulator IC. The microprocessor (AT89S50) controls virtually all the actions carried out in this design. (AT89S50) is used in the design. The sensor unit is responsible for sensing the level of water and transfer the current position of water to the microprocessor. The display unit in the circuit is use to physically show the current position of water in the tank, the properties of seven segment display are been used.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0 BACKGROUND</strong></em><br/>The project “automatic water level control with an automatic pump control system” is design to monitor the level of liquid in the tank. The system has an automatic pumping system attached to it so as to refill the tank once the liquid gets to the lower threshold, while offing the pump once the liquid gets to the higher threshold. Sustainability of available water resource in many reason of the word is now a dominant issue. This problem is quietly related to poor water allocation, inefficient use, and lack of adequate and integrated water management. Water is commonly used for agriculture, industry, and domestic consumption. Therefore, efficient use and water monitoring are potential constraint for home or office water management system. Moreover, the common method of level control for home appliance is simply to start the feed pump at a low level and allow it to run until a higher water level is reached in the water tank. This water level control, controls monitor and maintain the water level in the overhead tank and ensures the continuous flow of water round the clock without the stress of going to switch the pump ON or OFF thereby saving time, energy, water, and<br/>prevent the pump from overworking Besides this, liquid level control systems are widely used for monitoring of liquid levels in reservoirs, silos. Proper monitoring is needed to ensure water sustainability is actually being reached with disbursement linked to sensing and automation, such programmatic approach entails microcontroller based automated water level sensing and controlling or using 555 timer IC.</p> <p><strong><em>1.1 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</em></strong><br/>The goal or objectives of which the designed device is expected to accomplish is to build an automatic water level control with automatic control system. In this project sensors are place at different level of the tank and with the aid of this sensors, the micro-controller monitor the level of the liquid at any particular point in time, some of the objectives are<br/>1. to design an automatic water monitoring system<br/>2. to incorporate an interactive medium between the end user and the machine<br/>3. to prevent over labor of the pumping machine and prevent it from getting bad<br/>4. to avoid wastage of water<br/>5. since the demand of electricity is very high, automatic water level control saves energy</p> <p><strong><em>1.2 JUSTIFICATION</em></strong><br/>Automatic water level monitor came into existence because of human error and inconsistence that is associated with manually operated water pumping machine. This is because it takes time for individual who is manually operating the water pump to turn off the pumping machine and this may cause water spillage and at times the individual might not know that the water level has drop so low until the tank is completely empty.

That the innumerable traffic junctions in the country by far out-number the staff strength of the traffic wardens available and that the traffic wardens even where they are enough to control all the junctions cannot do so throughout the day is not in doubt. Traffic control at T.junctions or elsewhere ensures orderliness of movements of vehicles, goods and pedestrians while its absence strongly indicates chaos and most at times leads to accidents.<br/>In the light of the above, it is imperative to recognize the need to compliment the physical exhausting efforts of the traffic wardens. In doing so, steps to be taken should assume permanence in nature rather than any ad-hoc exercise. Such is the role expected to be played by an installed operational road junction traffic controller.<br/>This project –DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A THREE WAY JUNCTION TRAFFIC LIGHT CONTROLLER is such a device that will play significant role in controlling traffic at junctions to ease the expected increased rush at such junctions and reduce to minimum such disorderliness that may arise as well as allowing the<br/>pedestrians a right of the way at intervals rather than being struck down when in a hurry to cross the roads.<br/>Such an electrical system with a touch of electronics that controls the flow of traffic in a pre-determine sequential pattern at a junction has its diagram below with blocks representing distinct units.[1]<br/>Fig 1.1: Traffic Light Control System<br/>The power supply unit provides the control unit with specified dc voltage from primary source, which is a 240v, 50Hz ac supply, from public power system.

But the electronics gadgets and some other power operated machines, that we use in our homes, offices and industries requires power with constant or nearly constant voltage for their efficiency, and to avoid damage by the voltage.<br/>Voltage stabilizer is an electronic control circuit or device that is capable of providing a constant or nearly constant output voltage even when there is variation in load or input voltage as low as 90 volt can be boast up to 240 volt by stabilizer at output stage without any voltage fluctuation.</p> \n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN AUTOMATIC VOLTAGE STABILIZER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN AUTOMATIC VOLTAGE STABILIZER", "id": 18}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This project is titled the design and construction of a DC to AC inverter system. It is designed to meet up with the power demand in the offices and in homes in the absence of power supply from the national supply authority, NEPA. In order words the device / item serves as a substitute for NEPA which almost monopolises the power supply to people.<br/>It is designed in such a way that it will take up 12v DC from battery and inverts it to an output of 220v, 50H2 AC. It makes no noise during operation and no hazardous carbon monoxide is generated in the surrounding. <br/>This is a feature that makes it safe to use any were when compared to generator. Also, the circuit is capable of charging the battery (i.e 12v source) when the power from the supply authority is on. This greatly reduces the cost of operation of the system. </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION </strong><br/>The idea behind the design and construction of this system is to make available or alternative means of power supply for household or industrial purpose. This goes a long way in helping to curb the problem frequently encountered as a result of power failure. That not with standing it makes it possible to have other means of providing power our doorstep rather than solely depending on the power from he national grid.<br/>Moreover, rate of power failure in this wantry is high. So there is every need that other means of power supply should be made available for constant running of our electronic equipments and gadgets and also to provide comfort to man. Hence, with the help of a DC to AC inverter system, which has come to solve the problem of frequent power failure of Nigeria, a steady running and operation of our electronic equipments and gadgets is guaranteed. </p> <p><strong>1.2 INVERTER SYSTEM</strong><br/>The inverter system was built to convert a DC voltage to an AC voltage with the help of oscillator <br/>This inverter system also consists of two stages of switching circuits which comprises of power transistors connected in the common drain configuration. <br/>Since the oscillator has two outputs. Each of the switching circuit is coupled to the two output of the oscillator respectively. This is well explained in detail in chapter three below. <br/>When the oscillator is powered from the 12v DC battery, the oscillator of the system generates 60 which is then used to open the gate of the transistors which has specific power and current ratings. <br/>The combined output power and current of the transistors will then be applied to the transformer which then steps up the voltage to an output level of 220V AC. </p>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF ADC TO AC INVERTER SYSTEM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF ADC TO AC INVERTER SYSTEM", "id": 19}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is design to help in the offices, workshops and house hold appliances, due to the unstable power supply being supplied by (NEPA) presently known as Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) usually supply to us.<br/>With the help of the “UPS” we don’t need to depend much on PHCN it is stress free because it don’t need someone to change it over when light goes off, once there is any power failure it will automatically switched on and when power comes it will switch off and start charging the battery.<br/>Another interesting thing in the UPS is that it does not need any external charger for charging the battery when it goes low, it have already built charger inside the UPS when there is light it will be charging the battery. </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p> <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) is used to continue the flow of current and also make voltage to be steady as soon as NEPA source is interrupted. They are divided into various sections, which are<br/><strong>1. INVERTER SECTION</strong><br/>In this section, the Direct Current (DC) voltage is converted into an Alternate Current (AC) voltage with the help of the oscillation. An oscillator is an electronic circuit that produces an output signal without any applied external input signal.</p> <p>The inverter (Not Circuit) performs a basic logic function called inversion or complementation. The prupsoe of the inverter is to change on logic level (High/Low) to the opposite logic level. In terms of bits, it changes a ‘I’ to a ‘O’ and vise versa.</p> <p>This section also consist of two stages of switching circuits which comprises of FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTORS.</p> <p>The oscillator has two output terminals each of the switching circuits is coupled to the two output terminals of the oscillator respectively. This is elaborated in the subsequent chapter.</p> <p><strong>2. AUTOMATIC CONTROL SECTION</strong><br/>This section produces all the required controls needed to meet up with the main aim of the entire system. It controls automatically ‘ON’ of the system into NEPA and hence obtaining a NEPA line as the output of the system and same time linking battery charger into charging the battery. Also switching “ON” of the inverter into functional mode as soon as power interruption is experienced and this is done by the automatic circuit. This automatic circuit makes sure that no line is colliding by properly carrying out the exchange system with the help of the relays.</p> <p><strong>AIM OF THE DESIGN</strong><br/>The Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) provides the efficiency in the use of power appliance by ensuring continuous availability of power supply in the absence of NEPA source.</p> <p>For a better output to be produced, it is advisable to charge the battery to its full condition and also make sure that the battery has enough ampere so as to withstand much load.</p> <p>To eliminate excessive heat in the circuit, proper heat sink should be sued or a cooling fan, so as to reduce any heat that on the transistors.</p> <p>The rated value for this UPS is 1000W at 240V and 50HZ. It is expected at all condition being favourable to carry load of higher power factor at approximation of the power stated. It can last for days depending on the load. It is advisable not to overload it because it can damage the circuit.</p>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SUPPLY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SUPPLY", "id": 20}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This project work is on the construction of an F.M transmitter this system consists of four discrete modules namely the audio frequency (AF) amplifier (class A) the modulator the master oscillator and the radio frequency (RF) amplifier (ClassC) these formed the conventional events for building FM transmitter here the signal (from the microphone) is fed into the (AF) for amplification then to the modulator which combines the modulating signal with the carrier wave transports the modulated signal through (RF) for final amplification to the antenna via the resonance circuit for propagation the transmitter was tested using radio receiver it transmitted clearly at the frequency of 108 MH3 and the coverage was to metres.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong><br/>Information transmission is very vital to human life just as the early men used sticks to produce sound which indicates the location of each other as they wander about also down to the middle era when town crises come into play for the same information propagation to be transmitted from one point to another with the aid of radio communication which necessities the application of radio transmitter and receive.<br/>A radio transmitter is device whose major function is to send information (intelligence) from one point to another in most cases the information to be transmitted are voice music and code signals. However the transmission of radio signal is done with the aid of electrical resonance this is when the frequency of the receiver is equal to the incoming one from the transmitter resonance is observed which is the totality of radio communication I personally decided to work on frequency modulation (FM) transmitter because it transmitted radio signal which is less distorted than other wave bands like amplitude modulation and short wave band. The frequency on the tuning dial ranges from 88MHZ to 108MH3.<br/>In transmitter configuration a sound is fed at the microphone which is the transducer that converts the physical sound into the electrical signal which is usually amplified by the fist electronic circuit (audio frequency amplifier class A) whose output is fed into a modulator which fields a frequency modulated output fed into the final stage (radio frequency amplifier class C) then to the antenna which radiates the radio signal into the atmosphere. All these process were because audio frequency signal cannot be radiated out from the antenna directly because transmission at audio frequency is not particle this is because of audio frequency signals.<br/>1. They have reactively short range<br/>2. It everybody started transmitting these low frequency signal directly mutual interference will render all of them ineffective <br/>3. The size of antenna required for their would be large<br/>Furthermore for proper understanding of this information transmission-using transmitter I here by introduce the concept of modulation and demodulation.</p> <p><strong>CONCEPT OF MODULATION AND DEMODULATION </strong><br/>Modulation is technically the process of combining an audio frequency signal (low frequency signal) with a high frequency oscillator. However the audio frequency signal which is being transmitted super imposes on the carrier wave that transports it to the out put of the radio frequency amplifier into the antenna this audio frequency signal other wise known as modulating signal is being amplifier by the radio frequency amplifier in order to overcome air impendence as it travel from the transmitter to the receiver.<br/>Demodulation in the other hand is the process of separating or recovering the signal (modulating signal) from the modulated earlier wave it is the opposite of modulation and it is performed at the receiving end (radio receiver.)</p> <p><strong>TYPES OF MODULATION </strong><br/>There are three types of modulation namely amplitude modulation (AM) frequency modulation (FM) and phase modulation (PM)<br/>1. Amplitude modulation (AM) is the types of modulation in which the information signal (audio frequency signal) varies the amplitude of the earlier wave without changing it’s frequency. As the name implies it is only the amplitude of the earlier wave without changing it’s frequency. As the name implies it is only the amplitude that is being varied while the frequency is kept constant as the wave travels <br/>2. Frequency modulation (FM) is the type of modulation is which the modulating signal varies the frequency of the carrier wave here it is only the frequency of the signal in frequency modulation carrier information (intelligence) is carried is variations in its frequency. <br/>3. Phase modulation (PM) is the type of modulation that varies the phase of the radiated wave at the modulating frequency and by an angle, which is proportional to the amplitude of the modulating wave from.</p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT </strong><br/>The objective of this project is to construct an electronically operated system known as FM transmitter capable of transmitting a frequency modulated signal with a littler or no distortion into the atmosphere for dissemination secondly to aid the gradating student into a season research activities that will carry them along during the professional practice as a scientist</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT </strong><br/>The project signifies a lot in the electronic communication system which telecommunication is the vital aspect which is usually demonstrated through and radio communication system the frequency modulation transmitter is applied in a lot of instance frequency modulation is unavoidable used in FM radio stations scattered all over the country whose advantage is paramount compared to its counter part AM modulation frequency modulation transmitted is equally used in a miniaturized from as wireless morpheme. </p>\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF AN FM TRANSMITTER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONSTRUCTION OF AN FM TRANSMITTER", "id": 21}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The practical importance of a battery charger in today world cannot be over emphasized.

WE suggest that this our project should be looked into by the school administration to see the possibilities of producing this alarm system in a commercial has been made by so doing we will help encourage our nations policy indigenous technology.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>As the world is developing the need for electronics in human endevour is now taking a lager scope. With the inventions of certain electronic gadgets in our society today. Certain activities become easily handed for example; in communication when the telephone plays a path. In places where safety is needed on alarm system will be of much important. The application of electronic in this modern age is simply inexhaustible and this group take more interest in the case of burglary in homes, cars and industry. The selection of a proper alarm is not a simple matter, because the need of each individual home owner or businessman is different like a set of finger prints.<br/>Some factors and questions which must be answered when selecting an alarm system includes:<br/>a) What system needed to be protected?. <br/>b) What type of senior are needed?.<br/>c) The method of transmission needed forth alarm signal.<br/>The purpose of producing the alarm system is to limit the effect of the criminology in the society by informing us that our properties are in danger. All these will bring alarm the way by which criminal break into private properties by scaring them away once the alarm is trigger on. The type of alarm system been built is called INTRUDER ALARM SYSTEM and it is simple but effective alarm circuit which can reset its self after a time that which have been selected. It has normally closed and normally open triggers which make this door as a switch so as to triggers. It on a 555 timer so that alarm will reset itself after a certain amount of time. The time is varied according to the resister and capacitor been used in the circuit. The alarm has a switch, which we can replace with a key switch to make it more secure and we can change the trigger to other top of the door or window sluitchep too. The alarm uses relay, which is connected to a siren (speaker) but it can be replaced with speaker. The circuit is running off 12volts but can be range from 4 – 16volts.</p>\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF AN INTRUDER ALARM SYSTEM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONSTRUCTION OF AN INTRUDER ALARM SYSTEM", "id": 23}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This is a technical project write-up design and construction were carried out by me with deep intensive and extensive research work under the strict supervisor of Engr K.C Ugwu. <br/>I all give credit to the authors of the textbooks whose I referred to in the cause of writing this project and its subsequent design and construction.

This crisis situation does rarely occur in developed countries of the world such as Britain, American, Germany etc, why?<br/>Their system of generation, transmission and distribution of electricity is such that a devoid of variation of fluctuation in the supplied voltage. Now, by the definition given by K.G Jackson and R. Feinberg, a voltage stabilizer is a piece device incorporated in a circuit to maintain a constant output voltage from a poorly generated power supply. A voltage stabilizer like any other piece of equipment is a combination of many electrical and like any other piece of equipment is a combination of many electrical and electronic and circuit with the aim of getting the assemble to perform a specified desired task or function.<br/>Therefore a voltage stabilizer consist for four basic unit<br/>1. The transformer unit<br/>2. The control circuit<br/>3. The protective system<br/>4. The display of monitor (which is optional)</p> <p><strong>1.1 THE TRANSFORMER UNIT</strong><br/>Thereja B.L. defined a transformer as static piece of apparatus by means of which electric power is one circuit is transformed into power 7 some frequency in another circuit. The power can either be raised or covered. If it is referred to as a step-up transformer but if it is lowered, it is referred to as a step transformer being the one applicable to this project work.</p> <p><strong>1.2 THE CONTROL CIRCUITRY</strong><br/>This is bike an integrated circuit hat is made of microscopically small transistors, diodes, resistors and components connected together. It is used as complete and is amplifier, voltage amplifier is a comparators connected together. It is used as a complete audio amplifier, voltage amplifier is or comparators to mention just a few of its application. An operational amplifier (op. Amp) is widely sued type of IC, which is designed to manipulate very differences in voltage. The op-amp does the same work has comparator simply because it compares two voltages and provide and output signal when one is bigger.</p> <p><strong>1.3 AIM AND OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT</strong><br/>Most electrical appliance this day highly sophisticated to the entreated that cases of intermitted or regular power outages, under voltages or over voltages are not tolerate in them.

It is also one of the objectives of this project work that cost comparison between the imported or factory assembled voltage stabilizer e.g SORTEX OR BINATONE products and a locally fabricated voltage stabilizer be embarked on and that work be done on this project in order to finally produce a device that would perform optimally and also relatively cheaper.</p>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF 1000KWA STABILIZER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF 1000KWA STABILIZER", "id": 25}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This work has been aimed at efficient means of controlling the traffic effectively for twenty-four hours. As the world is growing technologically more and more vehicles jump into the public road adding to the already existing number. Consequently, more efficient way of controlling the traffics becomes more desirable as compared to the obsolete way of using the traffic personnel’s.<br/>The design of this traffic light control is grouped basically into three; digital logic design, the power circuit and the power supply design. The digital logic design is based on integrated circuits which happens to be the modern way of designing digital systems, the power circuit design is aimed at lighting the different LEDS as and when due, while the power supply design strives to achieve a constant 8V dc supply for powering the circuit.<br/>For this work, the frame with the LEDS mounted on it has been constructed, the driven circuit was implemented and the entire system enclosed in the smoothened frame.<br/>The realized work was tested and guaranteed to give a firmly good level of performance.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>In the ever fast-growing world of business and technology today, there has become an increasing column of vehicles on every road in different place of the world. Traffic control light has become a very effective tool for sequential control of the teaming number of vehicles on the road to avert what would have been a recurrent saga of ghastly accidents at the junctions. There have been many ways of achieving this, uppermost among these being the employment of electronic monitoring circuits that which is controlled by presto clock.<br/>In developed countries, the employment of traffic personnels who would be jumped up and down at the centres of the junction just for the motorists to acknowledge their rigorous signs has long come of age. In developing countries where 24 hours traffic flow is involved, many societies are adopting the usage of the traffic light control. The advantage offered by this method of traffic control cannot be over emphasized. For one, it offers a more advanced technology that is less prone to miscalculation and its regrettable occurrence. They stand out better at night, then offer illumination to the immediate surroundings which become important for security purpose and in general add to there entire aesthetic beauty of night life.<br/>The technology behind the design may vary from place to place, but the fact remains that in all cases an electronic (logic) circuit is made to control a power circuit. The electronic logic circuit is normally composed of the basic digital components of electronic design which includes oscillators, timers, counters, decoders, microprocessors, etcetera, while the power circuit includes the lamps and the drivers circuits. The digital circuit is designed to give an output commensurate to the design choice. The power supply unit is designed to generate a steady supply voltage which is used to power the logic circuit.<br/>The output consists of a series of lamps which are expected to light in a particular sequence depending on the design. By the logic circuit design, the lamps are made to come up in a particular sequence depending on the design with each colour meaning different motional status of the vehicles in that column.</p> <p><strong>1.1 AIM OF THE PROJECT</strong><br/>Going by the rapid advancement in technology all over the world, the need for better ways of solving a problem keep coming up every day. Necessity is the mother of invention. It has become imperative for societies, companies, industries, business ventures, clubs etc to offer 24 hour service, hence thereby has to be a way of controlling the teaming column of vehicles which convey both individuals and goods to different destinations of that type. The most elegant way of directing the motorists is by the use of traffic light control. This type of control serves a dual purpose. In the day type it directs the vehicles, whereas it turns out to additionally illuminating the environment in the night, so that at very far distance, its effect is noticeably felt, conveying its message to an oncoming vehicle very far from the point.<br/>The project is therefore aimed at building a prototype four-way traffic light control circuitry.<br/><strong>1.2 METHODOLOGY</strong><br/>Priority was given to the nature of the junction and how far away they are at different seasons of the year. A lot of design research was carried out on digital logic design and choice of digital families. Data books were consulted to make the most suitable choice of components at the most reasonable cost.<br/>After the design, a market survey was conducted and some components used in the design were not obtainable in the market. Hence, alternative components had to be used and the circuit redesigned. The subsequent stage involves physically realizing the design work, constructing and packaging the entire circuitry on the frame. Finally, he work was given a fine finish and tested.</p>\n\nDESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A FOUR WAY TRAFFIC LIGHT CONTROL CIRCUIT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A FOUR WAY TRAFFIC LIGHT CONTROL CIRCUIT", "id": 26}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Until recently applied electricity technical education was meant for those who could not cope effectively with conventional academic pursuits. In Nigeria today, applied electricity technical education had become a thing of National Interest because it has been realized that it has efficacy in producing the dreamed and desired manpower for the nation. It was on this stand that the researcher looked at the factors militating against the performance of Applied Electricity in technical colleges in Bayelsa state.<br/>Thirty Technical Teachers were randomly sampled; research questions guided the study. Data were collected and analyzed. Based on the finding, it was discovered that lack of funds, teaching and learning facilities and obsolete curriculum affect the performance of Applied Electricity students, conclusion were made and recommendations proffered there after.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION <br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>At the twentieth century Nigeria with her abundant human and Natural resources has not been able to achieve much technologically. The inability to achieve much at this period is not unconnected with history since we attained independence; policies and strategies of the various levels government have not been far reaching enough to involve a sound technological foundation for the country.<br/>Previous education policies have de-emphasized technical education in favour of the grammar school type of educational system. Until recently the courses and curriculum of the technical college in Applied Electricity departments across the country are stereotyped and not comprehensive enough to meet the technological needs of the economy for a rapid and meaningful development as witnesses in the advanced countries of the world (Olukosi, 1987). Since the advent of poor economy in Nigeria funding of education by three tiers of government (Federal, state and local government) has never been what it used to be in 70s particularly Applied Electricity in technical colleges which is capital intensive, consequently, the materials tools equipment and facilities required for training are sparingly provided. In these circumstances, it will be very difficult for Applied Electricity students to meet the maximum standard required for a meaningful Applied Electricity development.<br/>With the introduction of the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) in 1986 by President Ibrahim Babangida’s regime the already buttered economy further plunged to the point of no recovery, thereby forcing government and private sectors to tighten their belt move in all their operations without putting into consideration the great implication such irrational decision might have on private sectors.<br/>Paramount among other sectors of the economy, we have technical education essential to technological breakthrough of the country if she has to meet up with present day development required of a country that survive the challenges of the new millennium.<br/>The depreciation of Naira to affects technical students in Applied Electricity due to non-availability of the training equipment, tools and other facilities. Also, the abrupt stoppage of the foreign Applied Electricity studies are malfunctioning of the local alternative, Electrical Engineering (EE) offered in Nigeria, few universities, polytechnics and colleges of technology has fallen due to poor economy.<br/>Furthermore, the withdrawal of external aid to Nigeria as a result of the political imbroglio between 1992 and 1998 did not help matters. Among the foreign organization, which withdrew scholarship opportunities from Nigeria are the United Nations education scientific and cultural organization (UNESCO) United National Development Programme (UNDP) World Bank and common wealth.<br/>The welfare and motivation aspect of Applied Electricity Technical Student services was adversely affected by the ever-escalating dual exchange rate.<br/>With the present changes of emphasis on the part of government, policy wise, electrical technology has been accorded the priority and the deserved attention to its relevance to the technology development and needs of the society as enshrined in the current national policy on education.<br/>The societal attitude which perceives technical education as an education for the under privileged who cannot cope with academic rigours in the secondary school, college or technology also looks at the technology students as early levers of their academic pursuits.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>Job satisfaction among Electrical Engineering Students after graduation from the technology school is very poor, also there is lack of tool and equipment to do their practical work in Electrical Engineering. Without these things there will be poor performance in practical work. The Electrical Students are also lacking of industrial training because of poor performance and poor standard workshop arrangement, curriculum arrangement on the performance of technological students.<br/>In Applied Electricity is not well addressed. This student address these problems:<br/>1. Due to lack of learning environment which contributed to the performance of students.<br/>2. The job satisfaction of the electrical engineering student has affect the performance of electrical technology student.<br/>3. Lack of competent Electrical engineering teaching has affected the performance of technical students.<br/>4. Lack of electrical engineering workshop has affected the performance of Applied Electricity students.<br/>5. Lack of insatiable curriculum has affected the performance of students in Applied Electricity.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This study intends to investigate the factors militating against the performance of Applied Electricity students in Technical Colleges in Bayelsa State.<br/>Specifically the study tends to:-<br/>i. Identify the problems posed by performance of the Applied Electricity workshop in terms of practical.<br/>ii. To assess the condition of learning environment.<br/>iii. To determine the working condition of Applied Electricity workshop in terms of practical.<br/>iv. To asses the effectiveness and efficiency of the Electrical workshop teachers.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The finding of the study will enable the government policy makers. Policy implementations, classroom teachers, industries and society at large becomes aware of certain problem in the programme which can man the march towards the country’s technological advancement. The result of the study will also keep the students abreast of the success recorded so far and to find ways of improving in their study.<br/>The result of the study will keep to improve the practical work and learning of introductory technology specifically practical work will benefit from the result of this study that they will use the instrument to evaluate the students rather than the practical made test. Finally the result of this study will be immense benefit to the Applied Electricity engineering experts.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTION</strong><br/>1. What are the effects of poor economy on provision of training facilities and equipment on Applied Electricity Students?<br/>2. What are the relevance of Applied Electricity students competence to the emergency of industrial growth of Nigeria.<br/>3. What are the effects of skilled manpower requirement for industrial growth?<br/>4. What are the important of (NBTE) National Business of Technical Education Syllabus to the manpower training need in Nigeria.<br/>In the data analysis, the responses were scored to produce or like types of scale of summated rating and their mean were calculated.</p> <p><strong>1.6 DELIMITATION </strong><br/>The study was confirmed to four technical colleges randomly selected in Bayelsa State. Out of the four technical colleges selected known one is own by federal government, four are state owned technical college.</p> <p>LIMITATION <br/>The researcher was handicapped by both time and finances. The time was too short for a study of this magnitude. Also the non-availability of finance to enable the researcher move around was another limitation.</p> <p><strong>1.7 ASSUMPTION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>For the purpose this study, it was assured that:<br/>i. The information gathered from the respondents is authentic.<br/>ii. The staff and students in this study are ideal respondents.<br/>iii.

One of such major renewable power source in use is solar energy, which is energy obtained from the radiation of the sun.</p> <p>To obtain electrical power from the sun, four key components are required to effectively and efficiently convert the sun’s radiation energy. These four key components include:</p> <ul><li>A solar energy-conversion system  (Solar PV modules or array)</li> <li>A regulation system (Charge controllers)</li> <li>Electrical energy storage media (Batteries)</li> <li>DC-AC conversion system (Inverters)</li> </ul> <p> <em>Fig 1.1: Simple diagram of a house hold Solar Power System</em><em>[85]</em></p> <p>Fig. 1.1 above gives the diagrammatic description of a solar power system. As can be seen from the diagram, radiant energy from the sun striking the solar panels is converted into DC voltage which is fed into a battery through a charge controller. The electrical energy stored in the battery is then converted from DC to AC, and stepped up to the voltage level required for the operation of house hold electrical equipment.</p> <p>It is important to note that to efficiently and effectively convert the DC electrical energy from solar PV modules into AC quantity, an inverter must be incorporated into the system. The area of contention, as regards to this project report is in the area of selection of the most efficient and cheap solar inverter.  Knowing how efficient an inverter will be can only be determined through usage and/or testing of the inverter in question, and further analyzing the results obtained, in order to compare them with that of an ideal inverter. This whole idea gave birth to the topic of this project <strong>“Solar power inverters, analysis and test Evaluation”</strong></p> <p>It is our belief that an inverter whose characteristics is close to that of an ideal inverter can be regarded as a good inverter, while that whose characteristics is far from an ideal inverter can be regarded as inefficient.</p> <p>As mentioned before electricity crises is a major problem in the present era. This problem is even more critical for a densely populated poverty corrupted developing third world country like Nigeria. A lot of people live here without the basic facility of electricity. Daily, electricity crises and price is increasing whereas no other solution is left for us without using the solar power or diesel turbine to generate electricity in remote areas which seems to be very expensive to run. Again, not only do we face electricity crisis but also, the cost of gas and other natural resources like fuel, diesel , petroleum etc. is on the increase, beyond the reach of the general populace. To this effect, a system capable of not only reducing the electricity crisis but also the need for petroleum or other natural resources used in energy generation is therefore the desired choice in Nigeria today.</p> <p>Presently, the demand for solar power generating system is on the increase, as the world today is seeking better sources of electricity lees capable of causing damage to the environment.  </p> <p><strong>1.1 Statement of problem</strong></p> <p>            This report will have no understandable meaning or importance without it being able to present solutions to some of the problems posed while embarking in a solar power installation project, as well as provide answers to some of the questions commonly asked by electrical engineering students when faced with solar power system installation.

I endeavor to create a cost effective, small-scale electrical generator which could be used to power consumer electronics. Solar energy has proven its worth as an alternative energy source because it is low-impact and emission free. It has been implemented with much success for power grids with hundreds of acres of enormous solar concentrations. In the small-scale, solar energy has been harvested through the use of photovoltaic (PV) panels and have been used to power anything from an iPod to a residential home [1].</p> <p>Although PV systems are considered part of the green energy revolution, materials utilized for it construction (like silicon) are extremely dangerous to the environment and much care must be taken to ensure that they are recycled properly. PV cells also only utilize the energy stored in specific wavelengths of light and therefore have an approximate efficiency between 14-19%. Sunlight, however, produces immense amounts of heat which only serves to heat up the surface of the solar cell. Although there are some PV cells that have reached efficiency levels over 40% (world record is 41.6%), they are enormously complex and expensive [2].</p> <p>Cell phones have become an extremely popular device in the entire world and it is easy to say they are part of our daily lives. In the year 2010 there was an estimate of over 4.6 billion cell phones worldwide and the number has been growing by more than a billion ever since; this translates to more than half the world’s population. Both the developed and the developing world countries are buying more cell phones, but it is in developing countries where the cell phone growth stays the strongest [3]. However, cell phones need electric sources to charge their batteries in order to work, but there are people in developing and third world countries that find it hard to access electric sources. For example, one resident of a village in Tanzania describes how he takes all seven of the village‘s mobiles down to a nearby town with electricity to charge all seven mobiles. Obviously, this is quite different than what we see in the United States or other developed countries. Their inability to access a centralized power grid is due to either or the combinations of two things; the cost of constructing transmission lines to their homes, or the inability to construct transmission lines due to their location.In an attempt to provide an alternative means of charging to those unfortunate areas in third world and developing countries, a solar powered multiple cellphones charging booth is to be designed and constructed in this project. However, the focus of this project is specifically to design and construct a multiple cell phones charger powered by solar energy.</p> <p>Solar power is the practical add-on to the existing sources of energy. It effectively supplements the current sources of energy. With intelligent designs, the solar cells can be integrated into the final consumer electronic or portable devices. This reduces the dependence of recharging these with the electricity, thus making this ideal choice for the locations where electricity may not be actually available. The solar panels are costly today but their costs are coming down to affordable levels. Also many a times the government aids are available especially for the remote areas [4].</p> <p>With the solar panels being available in various form factors, a range of consumer electronic devices making use of the solar panels are making entry into the market place and it is expected that this trend would continue in the future. As of now there are speakers, earphones, calculators and other small power consuming devices already available. The trend is to integrate the solar power in the small form factor that enhances the battery life and acts as an additional source of energy to supplement the battery power from other sources. As the efficiency of the solar panels and conversion would become better, a lesser area would be able to generate more energy and<br/>eventually the solar charging may become the sole energy source in many consumer devices [4].</p> <p><br/><strong>1.2     Aim and Objectives                                         </strong></p> <p>The aim of this project is to design and construct a working solar powered multiple cell phones charging booth to charge a number of cell phones simultaneously.</p> <p>The objectives are as follows:</p> <ol><li>To design a working solar charger circuit for the project.</li> <li>To arrange and solder the component according to the design circuit.</li> <li>To connect the solar charger circuit with the solar panel.</li> <li>To construct a well packaged housing for the project.</li> <li>To test and evaluate the performance of the developed device.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.3     Scope of the Project</strong></p> <p>The proposed project will be capable of charging 10 phones simultaneously.</p> <p><strong>1.4     Problem Statement</strong></p> <p>According to the International Energy Agency, in 2011 1.4 billion people around the world did not have access to electricity [3]. And most users of cell phone in rural areas find difficulty in charging their cell phones. Therefore this project is to overcome the problem and also to create a means of charging a number of cell phones simultaneously. The Solar cell phone charging booth runs solely on produced sustainable energy in the form of DC power. The project has no dependence on the power grid.</p> <p>The system consists of Solar PV, a solar charge controller, USB port and cell phone battery. A solar charger is similar to the voltage regulator. It regulates the voltage and current that is coming from the solar panels and going to the battery [5].

It has been in focus worldwide and solar installations of capacities in megawatts order are reality today. The efficiency of the solar panels remains low even today and the requirement of ensuring highest efficiency outside the panel remains stringent.

As a result, there is need for the performance evaluation of various power inverters in order to determine the cost efficiency of the power inverter as an alternative source of power. The aim of the present study is to investigate the performance index of 3.5KVA/48V inverters for domestic source of electric power supply. Four types of inverters (Mercury, Safer Power, Sinergy and Su-Kam) commonly available in the market were considered. And three performance indices (resistive load test, inductive load test and output waveform) were used to determine the cost effectiveness of one inverter over the other. Results showed that the Sinergy Power Inverter has the best performance. In terms of the battery discharge current, Sinergy is 35% (for the resistive) and 61% (for inductive test) more efficient compared to Mercury at an output load of 1 kW.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p> INTRODUCTION 1.1     Background to the Study </p> <p>Electric power interruptions are quite common in every place, especially after a heavy down pour or a severe storm. To counter this power outage, a search has been to find a reliable and economical alternative source of electricity. Although this kind of project has been dealt with for quite a number of time but the fact still remains that an improvement needs to be done. This in essence makes the project topic “Investigation of the performance index of 3.5KVA/48V inverter” purposeful and resourceful.</p> <p>        An inverter is a device or an electronic that converts or inverts a direct current into a conventional alternating current. A power inverter is a great tool used to run household / office appliances, where there is no electricity. The input voltage and frequency of the inverter may be fixed or it may vary depending on its application. Inverters finds several applications of which are the valuable speed, alternating current motors, uninterrupted power supply etc. They can be used as the front stage of dc to dc converter. Standby inverters are mostly used to provide emergency supply to the main frequency (50Hz). In the event of main failure, the inverter immediately operates with no loss of waveform. This unique ability makes it related to an automatic change over switch but it differs in a way in that it has a battery, which stores energy when the mains is on and gives out energy when the mains is off while the automatic change over switch operates on contactor (open and close).</p> <p>         There are many types of inverter as described in chapter 2, but they all have the same principle of operations and it all depends on the component used, whether with a thyristor or a bipolar junction transistor for switching the current ON/OFF. The need for man to prevent his activities from being interrupted in order not to render it incomplete which may subsequently become an unfinished job (loss of files in the computer when there is a sudden power outage) has motivated engineers across the globe to design a device which will be more economical, durable and efficient.</p> <p>It is pertinent to note that in a well organized company in a developing country like Nigeria, where a lot of transactions are made, if there is an epileptic power supply, the flow of transaction will greatly be hindered and there will be no open ground for the infant companies to spring up and wax great. Power should not be an obstruction between companies and their maximum profits, this in essence makes the use of a power inverter relevant and recommended to all and sundry. Hence, the need for the investigation of the performance index of various inverters comes to play. And this helps to determine which inverter is more efficient, portable, durable, and cost effective.</p> <p> 1.2     Statement of the Problem </p> <p>The primary aim of engineers in the society is to solve the problems militating against technological growth, provide solutions to challenges facing humanities and bringing about efficient flow of ideals and innovators in the world of technology throughout the society and all nation of the earth. Inverter is that device which is being employed by the engineers to tackle and support the power supplies. This support comes to play when there is power outage. Immediately, the power inverter begins to act in place of the main power. Inverter are used in the conversion of direct current to a conventional alternating current, but the need for a reliable and more efficient, stable power supplies make the inverter indispensable especially in developing country like Nigeria where there is an epileptic power supply. Hence the need for investigation of the performance index of 3.5kVA/48V inverter in relation to other inverters becomes vital.</p> <p>           Although, the electric power in an alternating current form is very difficult to store due to power loss which are associated with the alternating current and when converted, it can be in stored in the battery of which can be recharged.</p><p> 1.3     Aim of the Study </p> <p>The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance index of 3.5KVA/48V inverters for domestic electric power supply.</p><p> 1.4     Objectives of the Study </p> <p>                The objectives of the study are stated as follow.</p> <ol><li>To determine the output wave form of the inverter</li> <li>To determine the battery discharging current/voltage on load and the effect of load on the inverter</li> <li>The determine the  power efficiency (real-time output power ratings)</li> </ol> <p>1.5     Methodology </p> <p>`        The methods adopted to achieve the set objectives are as follows.</p> <ol><li>The Cathode ray oscilloscope was used to measure output wave form.</li> <li>The resistive and inductive load tests were applied to determine the battery discharging current/voltage on load and the effect of loads on the selected inverter</li> <li>Clamp meter, amp meter and volt meter were utilized.</li> </ol> <p>1.6     Scope of the Study </p> <p>In this study, the capacity of power inverters considered is 3.5KVA/48V with an output of 220-230V, frequency of 50Hz.

It is the solar array that produced a D.C voltage due to the energy received from the sun during the day , thereby making the battery to charge, as a result, keeping the streetlight into operation when it get dark. The basic circuitry on solar powered streetlight is the solar charge controller which essentially consists of an automatic battery charger, fed by the solar panel and a lighting controller, automated for dust to dawn operation. This street light jus designed to operate or triggered automatically by a photocell or a timer.</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0       INTRODUCTION  </strong></p> <p>The importance of light to every mankind cannot be over emphasized, even when the earth was created; the earth was illuminated with light which makes it a place of living. This means, without light, the whole world is in darkness and as a result of this, living things be it plants, animals or human beings cannot exist.</p> <p>            When talking about lighting, it comes from two different sources, which could be natural or electrical. The former comes from the Creator (God) while the latter is a result of our natural resources being utilized effectively by human beings. Since there is need for lighting, electric energy generation is employed to solve the problems people are facing during the day, especially at night when there is total darkness everywhere.</p> <p>            Since the invention of electrical energy for lighting, it is quite obvious that it requires human intervention to control the switch either off when not in use or ONM when the need arises. Due to this factor and poor supply of electricity, we have been able to find and alternative way of generating electricity for the purpose of illumination which is highly efficient and effective through the energy from the sun known as solar energy.</p> <p>            This involves the use of a module called solar panel, which receive the energy from the sun and convert it to electricity.</p> <p>Basically, this project focused on the design and construction of a solar operated automatic streetlight. This is a commercial quality light that can easily illuminate the streets and other areas of choice giving the potential of many years of trustworthy use with a minimum of maintenance required.</p> <p>            The four major components needed to build construct a solar powered streetlight are: The solar panel, high efficiency d.c. Temperature, charge controller and a battery.</p> <p>            The solar panel has its major task to convert the sun’s energy into electricity, precisely D.C voltage. The basic circuitry on solar powered streetlights consists essentially of a automatic battery charger, fed by the solar panel and a lighting controller automated for dusk to down operation.</p> <p>            The charge controller projects the battery from over-charging, maximizes the charging voltage and current output of the solar panel.</p> <p>            To achieve the automatic operation of the streetlight, a photocell or a time, which senses the period of darkness and lightness, is used to trigger.</p> <p>            The type of battery employed here is a maintenance free one, which is capable of supplying few days of back up power in case of bad weather or charger failure. Also the lamp used in this project work is a D.C operated lamp.</p> <p><strong>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This project is carried out so as to provide an alternative means of generating electricity through sunlight for lighting purpose.</p> <p>Also, the effective utilization of natural resources (sunlight) is ensured by the design of this project.</p> <p>            The components required in carrying out this project which are solar panel, battery charge controller, bulb are efficient enough to yeild the desired result without the use of power converter.</p> <p>            Therefore, the use of Direct Current (D.C) operated lamp are employed, specifically, LED (Light Emitting Diodes).</p> <p><strong>1.2       AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The aims and objectives of this project are:</p> <p>To power up a street lighting system through solar energy.</p> <p>To protect the solar battery from quick deterioration as a result of continuous day and night working.</p> <p>To control a solar powered streetlight automatically.</p> <p>To utilize the naturally endowed resource (sun).</p> <p><strong>1.3       SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This project design is centered on solar energy as fast growing technology for street lighting with the use of a solar module. The automatic control process of the light can be achieved by a photocell. Or a timer which eliminates human intervention for manual switching or control/</p> <p><strong>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The significance of the design and construction of solar operated Automatic Street light cannot be overemphasized in the sense that it is financially viable particularly in areas where the cost of providing a main supply is prohibitive. It has the capability of illuminating large surface area of land due to high efficiency of the lamp used. Also, it does not require human intervention to control its operation and finally, power outages have no impact whatsoever on it.</p> <p><strong>1.5       METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>In the process of searching for information on this project, relevant textbooks, journals and related past project reports in the library were consulted. Also, several visits to relevant web sites on the Internet cannot be overloaded.</p> <p><strong>1.6       LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Every project’s have its limitation. The major limitation of this project is that sunlight used to generate the electricity is not readily available especially at winter period.</p> <p>As a result, the streetlight requires the need for a large battery to use in order to provide at least three days of stand by operation during cloudy weather without discharging the battery below its safe operating limit.</p>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A SOLAR OPERATED AUTOMATIC STREET LIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A SOLAR OPERATED AUTOMATIC STREET LIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM", "id": 32}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Water is an indispensable and inevitable substance to all living things due to its usability and high priority among other substance and materials. Provision of large volume of waters essential due to its significant purpose, which therefore called for a means by which sufficient, and good quality water can be obtained. There are different types of water namely; well water, pipe-borne waters, rain water, stream water, river water e.t.c.</p> <p>            In the earlier days, the use of buckets and calabash is employed in fetching water for homes, agricultural and domestic’s uses. Later, hand pumps were developed to reduce the stress and the inconveniences and other forms of contamination’s which arise due to direct contact of the body to the available water for consumption. Besides, only a small quantity of water can be made available due to physical factors such as tiredness, distance and climatic factors like dry season.</p> <p>            Hence, to eliminate these difficulties, pumping machines is employed to perform the job of fetching water and storing it in storage tanks for future purpose. The system consists of connecting pipes, water pump, which is connected to electric power supply and operated manually. In order to fully eliminate the stated problems and future needs for large volume of water, the concept of automatic pumping machine is developed.</p> <p>            This project emphasizes on the construction of automatic pumping machine which in turns provide a simple logical, versatile and economical/circuit which turns on the pump when water in the tank fall below the minimum level and also off process is achieved by the incorporating of the following to the pumping system:</p> <p><strong>The sensor: </strong>This measures the physical states such as the level of the water.</p> <p><strong>The responder: </strong>which responses to what is being sensed, it comprises of electrical and mechanical devices.</p> <p><strong>The actuator: </strong>This actuates the responder to sense the water level in the tank to perform the switching operation.</p> <p>In summary, the automatic control system is very effective, efficient and consequently reduces labour cost, flooding, man power and provides enough water for usage.</p> <p><strong>Background of the study</strong>.</p> <p>This project is carried out so as to provide a means of reducing stress involved in fetching water, wastage of water and flooding which may result from overfilling of the tank and eventually reduce to minimum, if not eliminating damages to the pumping machine.</p><p> Aim and Objectives </p> <p>The aims and objectives of this project are:</p> <ol><li>To reduce the labour involved in operating pumping machine manually.</li> <li>To prevent or protect the coil of pumping machine from being burnt as a result of continuous work beyond its operating time.</li> <li>To pump water automatically from water sources.</li> <li>To prevent wastage of natural resources (water in particularly) and flooding of premises.</li> <li>To prevent the machine from sucking mud and or air when there is no water in the well or source of water supply.</li> </ol><p>Scope of the Study </p> <p>The project is design to provide a means of storing water for the benefit of mankind and industrial purpose.

As the world is growing technologically more and more vehicles jump into the public road adding to the already existing number. Consequently, more efficient way of controlling the traffics becomes more desirable as compared to the obsolete way of using the traffic personnel’s.</p> <p>          The design of this traffic light control is grouped basically into three; digital logic design, the power circuit and the power supply design. The digital logic design is based on integrated circuits which happens to be the modern way of designing digital systems, the power circuit design is aimed at lighting the different LEDS as and when due, while the power supply design strives to achieve a constant 8V dc supply for powering the circuit.</p> <p>          For this work, the frame with the LEDS mounted on it has been constructed, the driven circuit was implemented and the entire system enclosed in the smoothened frame.</p> <p>          The realized work was tested and guaranteed to give a firmly good level of performance.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0     INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>In the ever fast-growing world of business and technology today, there has become an increasing column of vehicles on every road in different place of the world. Traffic control light has become a very effective tool for sequential control of the teaming number of vehicles on the road to avert what would have been a recurrent saga of ghastly accidents at the junctions. There have been many ways of achieving this, uppermost among these being the employment of electronic monitoring circuits that which is controlled by presto clock.</p> <p>          In developed countries, the employment of traffic personnels who would be jumped up and down at the centres of the junction just for the motorists to acknowledge their rigorous signs has long come of age. In developing countries where 24 hours traffic flow is involved, many societies are adopting the usage of the traffic light control. The advantage offered by this method of traffic control cannot be over emphasized. For one, it offers a more advanced technology that is less prone to miscalculation and its regrettable occurrence. They stand out better at night, then offer illumination to the immediate surroundings which become important for security purpose and in general add to there entire aesthetic beauty of night life.</p> <p>          The technology behind the design may vary from place to place, but the fact remains that in all cases an electronic (logic) circuit is made to control a power circuit. The electronic logic circuit is normally composed of the basic digital components of electronic design which includes oscillators, timers, counters, decoders, microprocessors, etcetera, while the power circuit includes the lamps and the drivers circuits. The digital circuit is designed to give an output commensurate to the design choice. The power supply unit is designed to generate a steady supply voltage which is used to power the logic circuit.</p> <p>          The output consists of a series of lamps which are expected to light in a particular sequence depending on the design. By the logic circuit design, the lamps are made to come up in a particular sequence depending on the design with each colour meaning different motional status of the vehicles in that column.</p> <p><strong>1.1     AIM OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>Going by the rapid advancement in technology all over the world, the need for better ways of solving a problem keep coming up every day. Necessity is the mother of invention. It has become imperative for societies, companies, industries, business ventures, clubs etc to offer 24 hour service, hence thereby has to be a way of controlling the teaming column of vehicles which convey both individuals and goods to different destinations of that type. The most elegant way of directing the motorists is by the use of traffic light control. This type of control serves a dual purpose. In the day type it directs the vehicles, whereas it turns out to additionally illuminating the environment in the night, so that at very far distance, its effect is noticeably felt, conveying its message to an oncoming vehicle very far from the point.</p> <p>          The project is therefore aimed at building a prototype four-way traffic light control circuitry.</p> <p><strong> 1.2    METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>Priority was given to the nature of the junction and how far away they are at different seasons of the year. A lot of design research was carried out on digital logic design and choice of digital families. Data books were consulted to make the most suitable choice of components at the most reasonable cost.</p> <p>          After the design, a market survey was conducted and some components used in the design were not obtainable in the market. Hence, alternative components had to be used and the circuit redesigned. The subsequent stage involves physically realizing the design work, constructing and packaging the entire circuitry on the frame. Finally, he work was given a fine finish and tested.</p>\n\nTHE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A FOUR – WAY TRAFFIC LIGHT CONTROL CIRCUIT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A FOUR – WAY TRAFFIC LIGHT CONTROL CIRCUIT", "id": 34}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This is a technical report presented on the design and construction of an Automatic Phase Selector.</p> <p>          In the construction work, an ordinary level knowledge of electronics principles are observed.

A lasting solution is vested on alternative use of the renewable energy source, a project that is yet to be widely applied. Hence, the continuation of the unsettled yearn for sufficient power. Consequently, the power lines are frequently over loaded resulting to a trip of power by the action of switch gears or by the load shading process undertaken by the distribution authorities.</p> <p>          Since it is crystal clear that some institutions such as health related institutions and some other delicate systems should not be allowed to suffer equally with their counterparts, Automatic Phase Selector is used to sustain energy consumption in the time of phase trip. The design of this circuit involves the use of automatic switches but the details of design varies from place to place, time to time and also depends on the type of load involved.</p> <p>          This project involves the use of transistor driven relays to affect the change of phase whenever the voltage condition becomes intolerable in the previous phase connected. </p> <p>1.1  AIMS/OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT</p> <p>The analysis of this project cannot go without enumerating the goals meant to be achieved in the pursuit of the work. These objectives include:-</p> <p>i.        To develop a simple low cost device aimed at easing the prevalent burden faced by delicate offices, parastatals and institutions who need very low but constant power supply. Since supply is always on along the distribution lines that supply such sites, what pesters on the progress of work thereof is always the unwarranted trip of phases due to power usage from neighbouring consumers. The automatic phase selector therefore, erase this setback form the face of progress of work in such offices.</p> <p>ii.      To stimulate the interest of upcoming students to take up research not only in their field of study “Electrical/Electronics Engineering” but also to extend their arms to other disciplines, thus enhancing the versatility of Electrical/Electronics Engineering.</p> <p>iii.    To create awareness that will stimulate the interest of fellow students who intend to take up research topic on automatic switch of any type.</p> <p>    Emphatically, the purpose of this project is to build an automatic switch system which is capable of selecting a phase with best operating voltage for delicate offices.</p>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN AUTOMATIC PHASE SELECTOR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN AUTOMATIC PHASE SELECTOR", "id": 35}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p>              During the invention of security system alarms, in the early 80s technology of system shadow which involves lighten and sensing of objects was at that age found during their experiments using a special material know as light dependent resistor which its family lies in the resistance serials. The development of technology in the world today has yielded many design purposes to inventors depending in the requirements of their design. The growth of theft around the world has led to the inventions of different security system; from their came in the new technology know as intruder alarm security system. The intruder alarm security system alert is an electronic device which is use in different places in sensing intruders from the point of intrusion when installed in different points.

However, Nigeria as a developing country has a lot of challenge in the area of electric power supply. The challenges include inadequate of electric power generating which causes instability of electric power supply in Nigeria. This problem is the course of low productivity in Nigeria, which highly affects our economy. In the above challenges, several efforts have been made to over come this challenge of power instability of electricity, but present outcome are difficult or rejected for its high disadvantages, which as generating set heavy duty diesel engine, solar panel, etc when this alterative source of energy for electric power supply are presented, it create another challenges such as fueling, replacement of parts and producing pollution all over the area. The inverter system is one substituted for these lapses seen in the above mentioned alternative sources. The inverter system is an electronic system that converts stored chemical energy in battery into electrical energy. Therefore, an inverter system is an electronics circuit that convert Direct  Current (DC) to Alternating Current (AC). The capacity of an inverter depends on the application of the appliances and the area by which appliances are to be used. For the purpose of being clearly, the inverter as we are discussing it here may have another scope, but is purely designed for domestic use with its maximum capacity of 5KVA is about 4000watts.

This is because most of Nigerians looks at insurance industry as a weak and poor industry with little or no impact in the Nigerian economy. However, the researcher carefully x-ray the implication of effective contribution of insurance services to the Nigerian economy and also review the relationship between insurance industry and other economic activities in Nigeria. The researcher also examined the role of the Nigerian insurance industry in the economic development of Nigeria. Based on the findings, the researcher observed that the majority of the Nigerians lack better understanding of insurance, the result of the testing indicates that insurance industry has made a tremendous impact in the growth and development of Nigerian economy and will  do more.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.9     </strong><strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Insurance which has existed from thousands of years, has emerged in today’s world as a very large field With many dimensions and specification. Today’s world is dominated by great changes. Anywhere in the world, industrialization is becoming a truly world wide phenomenon-within the frame work which accompanied by the organization of independence within global interdependence, everything is trusted into new and large dimension including risk and uncertainty.</p> <p>Insurance been one of the most important ways of organizing security is at the crossroads of both phenomena.</p> <p>This assertion does highlight the unique position of the insurance industry in contemporary business world. It also put into focus the overwhelming scores that accrue to this commercial organization in the changing times of our society. The developing of the insurance industry has now come to be regarded as a key feature in the economics on-goings of the business world and so it is first natural that Nigeria when it finally attained independence in 1960 identified insurance as one of the economic activities. She is however witnessing some tremendous progress in the field.</p> <p>Before the existing of modern insurance, man lived in a subsistence though the environment was still exposed to hazards of risks. (natural disasters and fire accidents) the gradual development of man’s totality of life (economics, social, political and of course technological) has been equally followed by exposure to society become complex, the need to eliminate these risks or ameliorate the effects they might have on man and society makes a way of achieving social security.</p> <p>In the Nigerian economy, modern insurance, which is a follow-up to the traditional arrangements by the extended family and other traditional societies, and organizations (to help any members who suffered any loss by way of accident or death) is at the early stage of development. As a result of this, we are experiencing the usual problems of late comers. Those problems coupled with an array of socio-economic leaves us with wider scope for development in this filed. This not withstanding, the Nigerian economy is witnessing a tremendous impact has attracted the researcher’s interest and as such, hence carefully look at this industry in the economy; the technicalities of insurance and the volume of business operation.</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF INSURANCE SERVICES IN THE NIGERIAN ECONOMY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF INSURANCE SERVICES IN THE NIGERIAN ECONOMY", "id": 39}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>As the growing population of human race widens the gulf between energy supply<br/>and energy demand, the imbalance in energy availability sent researchers into<br/>excavating for a way of settling this age long squabble. A lasting solution is vested<br/>on alternative use of the renewable energy source, a project that is yet to be<br/>widely applied. Hence, the continuation of the unsettled yearns for sufficient<br/>power. Consequently, the power lines are frequently over loaded resulting to a<br/>trip of power by the action of switch gears or by the load shading process<br/>undertaken by the distribution authorities.<br/>Since it is crystal clear that some institutions such as health related institutions<br/>and some other delicate systems should not be allowed to suffer equally with<br/>their counterparts, Automatic Phase Selector is used to sustain energy<br/>consumption in the time of phase trip. The design of this circuit involves the use<br/>of automatic switches but the details of design varies from place to place, time to<br/>time and also depends on the type of load involved.<br/>This project involves the use of transistor driven relays to affect the change of<br/>phase whenever the voltage condition becomes intolerable in the previous phase<br/>connected.<br/>~ 2 ~<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND<br/>The intelligent phase selector is a system that is capable of comparing three<br/>phases and switching automatically to any of the three phases. The system<br/>consists of three main parts namely; the transformer, comparators (which is the<br/>brain of the system) and electrical switching device (relay).<br/>The transformer used here is the step down type of transformer (it step down<br/>240v to 12v) and these transformer is feed in with different phase voltage,<br/>rectified and smooth. Then fed in to a voltage regulator that has positive output.<br/>The regulator outputs were connected to comparators. Here the comparators are<br/>three in number. We call the comparators the brain of the system because these<br/>comparators are connected in a way that each of them will give out an output.<br/>The relay in the system is where the output voltage is connected. In this project<br/>we even went as far as using pictures for illustration of some components.<br/>1.2 AIMS/OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT<br/>The analysis of this project cannot go without enumerating the goals meant to be<br/>achieved in the pursuit of the work. These objectives include:-<br/>i. To develop a simple low cost device aimed at easing the prevalent burden<br/>faced by delicate offices, parastatals and institutions who need very low but<br/>constant power supply. Since supply is always on along the distribution lines<br/>~ 3 ~<br/>that supply such sites, what pesters on the progress of work thereof is always the unwarranted trip of phases due to power usage from neighboring consumers. The automatic phase selector therefore, erases this setback form the face of progress of work in such offices.<br/>ii. To stimulate the interest of upcoming students to take up research not only in their field of study “Electrical/Electronic Engineering” but also to extend their arms to other disciplines, thus enhancing the versatility of Electrical/Electronic Engineering.<br/>iii. To create awareness that will stimulate the interest of fellow students who intend to take up research topic on automatic switch of any type.<br/>1.3 RELEVANCE OF THE PROJECT<br/>The issue of selecting or switching over manually is now a thing of the past. Nowadays we know that homes and offices enjoy steady power supply once the three phases are available (i.e. red yellow and blue phases). Is just a question of making a quick and automatic three phase selector?<br/>1.4 SCOPE OF THE PROJECT<br/>The scope of the project covers aspects like the features of automatic three phase selector, its applications, and its operations. Its advantages and its components. Finally, it covers the importance on the need of automatic three phase selector<br/>~ 4 ~<br/>and contributions toward a greater sharing load balance and a better three phase power distribution and monitoring for domestics consumers.<br/>1.5 LIMITATIONS<br/>Owning to the nature of this project, the research centers and the resources were not easy to come by within the immediate environment. Some of the limitation encountered on the course of this project include financial and time constrains which did not really take much room for additional capacity beyond what is at hand.</p> </div>\n\nDESIGN AND CONTRUCTION OF AUTOMATIC PHASE SELECTOR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONTRUCTION OF AUTOMATIC PHASE SELECTOR", "id": 40}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1           Introduction</p> <p>A wireless signal jammer is a device which blocks transmission by</p> <p>creating interference. This wireless signal jammer can be categorized into the Radio Frequency (RF) jammer and GSM jammer.</p> <p>A Radio Frequency jammer is a device used to disrupt or prevent communication via a broadcasted RF signal. It is an RF and GSM frequency disrupter commonly known as wideband radio frequency (RF) and GSM cell phone jammer. Simultaneously, they can blocks all commercial FM broadcast band (87.5 MHz to 108 MHz) and GSM signal transmissions within the jammer's transmission range.

These places include worship places, university lecture rooms, libraries, concert halls, meeting rooms, and other places where silence is appreciated.</p> <p>The solution to these annoying and disrupting noises is to install a device which can block the signal transmission from mobile phones and radio sets and thus, disrupt the triggering of bombs by these wireless signals.</p> <p>1.2             Project Background</p> <p> The technology being used by this device is very simple. The mobile phone transmission is being blocked and interfered by RF which creates high noise.

Thus, all phones and radio devices in the 200m radius of the jammer will be having the same situation.</p> <p>Radio Frequency (RF) and Mobile signal jammer is an illegal device in many countries. It is because the device is blocking the signal which has been approved by government agency as a legal communication transmission system.

The radio receiver jammer is also sub-divided into the Amplitude Modulated (AM) signal jammer and the Frequency Modulated (FM) Signal jammer.

An inverter is a system that converts a direct current to an alternating current.  However, inverter is of different categories base on power rating such as 1KVA, 1.5KVA,2KVA, 5KVA etc. Moreover, since the invention of inverter, some problem associated with alternative power supply had been drastically reduced. Meanwhile, the problems such as: noise, production of fumes, cost of procurement of oil, fuel and maintenance of plant is over. </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0   INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The quest to convert D.C. power to A.C power to run some essential appliances results due to erratic power supply being experience. Although, between the 19th century to mid 20th century, D.C. to AC power conversion was accomplished using rotary converters or motor generator set (M-G set). In early 20th century, vacuum tubes and gas filled tubes began to be used as switches in inverter circuit. In contrast the early A.C. to D.C. converters used an induction or synchronous a.c motor directly connected to a generator (dynomo) so that the generator’s commutator reverses its connections at exactly the right moments to produce D.C.</p> <p>Considering the above reasons, for the study, many electrical equipments have either developed a problem or even stopped working entirely. As a result, many businesses have been crippled thereby affecting the economy as a whole with respect to Nigeria.</p> <p>Again, power disturbances occurrence are on increase resulting to high voltage spikes and momentary voltage drops, this often affect the performance of sensitive electrical electronics equipment.</p> <p>Unincessant supply of electric power can not be over-</p> <p>emphasized in Nigeria presently, this has become the order of the day and many Nigerians now presume power outages as a normal routine in the power sector. There are factors responsible for this ugly situation such as natural disasters, vandalism, maintainability, sustainability, inadequacy and lack of vision by the political leaders to invest adequately in power sector, also absence of replacement policy resulting in absolute abandon of electrical equipment or project, unsustainable human capacity and inadequate and remuneration system to motivate human resources term to perform well on their course.</p> <p>The progress made some decades ago in developing alternate source of energy has proved that independent power system are not only possible but as well practical. A wide variety of generating equipment is now available to allow individuals take advantage of any prefer renewable resources of energy. Most of these systems produce only direct current (DC) for a number of reasons and at low voltages. However, it is well known that the alternating current is the greatest and most useful form of current being generated by the power grid due to its advantages over direct current. Thus, most of the appliances and equipment are built using a.c. input source.</p> <p>Therefore, there arises the need for converting direct current (DC) to an alternating current (A.C.) having a constant frequency. This process is known as inverting.</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this project is to design and construct a circuit that will take a 24V dc input from battery and produce a 200VA (AC) output at 200V – 220V, 50Hz with under voltage and over voltage protection. The study intends:</p> <p>i)            To design an electrical system that converts d.c. power to a.c. power to drive various appliances used in the laboratories, theatres, rural areas etc.</p> <p>ii)          To have a source of generating electricity that has no negative effect on the environment (i.e. no greenhouse effect).</p> <p>iii)        To provide an exposition to the HND students to simple electrical design, analysis and building of circuits.</p> <p>iv)         To provide a noiseless and weightless source of electricity generation.</p> <p>v)           The study will also serve as a means of impacting practical knowledge and skills to students, lecturers and other who may wish to acquaint themselves with the principles of operation of an inverter system.</p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>THE SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of this study is to design and construct of an inverter system with an output power rating of 2KVA, maximum output current rating of 9.09A, and output voltage of 200V a.c. at 50Hz from a 24V dc input. A few most widely used applications of inverter include running of computers, microwaves and electrical power tools etc.</p> <p>The scope of this project shows how low voltage d.c power supply is used to energized an inverter circuit.

Thus for any closed loop path, the sum of the length element times the magnetic field in the direction of the length element is equal to the permeability times the electric current enclosed in the loop.</p> <p><strong>1.5.3               </strong><strong>Faraday’s Law of electromagnetic induction: </strong>It states that whenever there is a change in magnetic flux linked with a circuit, an emf is always induced in it and the magnitude of the induced emf is equal to rate of change of flux linkage.</p> <p>e.m.f generated = </p> <p><strong>1.5.4               </strong><strong>Lenz Law</strong></p> <p>When an emf is generated by a change in magnetic flux according to Faraday’s law, the polarity of the induced emf is such that it produces a current whose magnetic field opposes the change which produces it.</p> <p>The induced magnetic field inside any loop of wire always acts to keep the magnetic flux in the loop constant.</p> <p><strong>1.5.5               </strong><strong>Ohm’s Law</strong></p> <p>This states that the ratio of potential difference (V) between any two points in a circuit is directly proportional to the current (I) flowing through them, provided temperature and other physical materials remain constant.</p> <p>V = IR</p> <p>I = V/R</p> <p>R = V/I</p> <p><strong>1.5.6               </strong><strong>Kirchoff’s Voltage Law</strong></p> <p>This states that the algebraic sum of voltage in each of the conductors in any closed path in a network is equal to the algebraic sum of emf</p> <p><strong>1.5.7               </strong><strong>Kirchoff’s Current Law</strong></p> <p>This states that the algebraic sum of currents in a network of conductors meeting at a point is zero. i.e. At any node (junction) in an electrical circuit, the sum of currents flowing into that node is equal to the sum of currents flowing out of that node.</p>\n\nTHE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF 2KVA INVERTER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF 2KVA INVERTER", "id": 42}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This project which comprise of many chapters that deals extensively with designs and construction of battery charger with auto-cut off which is capable of charging a 12 volts battery. In this construction research, designs was carried out which historic research was used to break down and evaluate to a low level understating of what an auto-cut of charger system is all and how it can be constructed and the main purpose of the project. The charging current as well as the power to the circuit is obtained from 1 0 – 18 volts 2 Ampere step down transformer. The law voltage AC can be rectified by the bridge rectifier comprising D1 through D4 and made ripple free by the smoothing capacitor C1 for charging purpose, 18V DC is used while to power the circuit, 9 volts regulated DC form IC1 is used. IC2 (CA 3140) is used as a simple voltage comparator drive the relay. After the series steps of inversion pure DC is achieved that can charge a specified DC battery. The relay saves as the Tripping command to the pin i.e to operate automatically when the battery is fully charged and when is weak.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>7.0     </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>7.1     </strong><strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>In the context of renewable energy source, a device which consists of electrodes and electrolytes for the storage of chemical energy, but brings about a reaction between it’s electrodes and the electrolyte in a ways to cause the flow of electrons through an external circuit is known as a battery the circuitory to recharge the batteries in a portable product is an important part of any power supply design. The complexity and cost of the charging system</p> <p> primarily depends on the type of battery and the recharge time.</p> <p><strong>7.2     </strong><strong>Charging Formation</strong></p> <p>In the realm of battery charging, charging methods are usually separated into two general categories.</p> <p>Fast charging: is typically a system that can recharge a battery in about one or two hours.</p> <p><strong>Slow charging: </strong>This is usually refer to an overnight recharge, i.e it is usually defined as a charging current that can be applied to the battery indefinitely without damaging the cell. (This method is sometimes referred to as a trickle charging).</p> <p>The maximum rate of trickle charging which is safe for a given cell type if dependent on both the battery chemistry and the cell construction when the cell is fully charged, continued charging causes gas to form within the cell. All of the gas formed must be able to recombine internally, or pressure will build up within the cell eventually leading to gas release through opening of the internal vent (which reduces the life span of the cell).</p> <p>This means that the maximum safe trickle charge rate is highly dependent on battery chemistry, but also on the construction of the internal electrodes.</p> <p><strong>7.3     </strong><strong>Types of Batteries</strong></p> <p><strong>7.4     </strong><strong>Primary (Dry Cell): </strong>are those whose electrolyte dries up when used to it’s ampere – hour rating and cannot be recharge. Dry cell batteries are different from wet cells because their electrolytes are contained in a low-moisture paste. Regardless of their sizes, they have the same basic components. At the center of each is a Rod called the cathode which is often made up of carbon and surrounded by an electrolyte paste. Different chemicals can be used to create this paste such as ammonium chloride and managanese dioxide, depending on the type of battery. The cathode and electrolyte paste are wrapped in paper or cardboard and sealed into a metal cylinder called an anode which is typically made of zinc.</p> <p><strong>7.5     </strong><strong>Secondary (Wet Cell): </strong>It is the type of whose chemical energy can restored through a charging process. Although there are different types of secondary battery which comprises lead acid, nickel-cadmium, and silver zinc battery.</p> <p>A wet cell is a type that operates by liquid electrolytic solution, it often runs down move quickly in a hot climate because the heat causes the plates to either from the electrolyte solution.</p> <p>Furthermore, a battery is a combination of cell connected together and a cells is of importance partially where maximum performance and life are obtained. As long as a battery is in use, it stores chemical energy which is being converted to electrical energy falls. This falls in chemical energy leads to a corresponding fall in terminal voltage.</p> <p>A constant potential method of charging is adopted in this project work it is a phenomenon whereby the alternating voltage from the main is converted to direct voltage through rectification.</p> <p>The direct current from the rectifier is then passed through the battery that is being charged in the  reversed direction in which the battery supplies current to the external circuit. The charger is intended to charge batteries with terminal voltage up to 12 volts. In incorporates a sensing technique to monitor when the battery has been charged to its rated terminal voltage so as to automatically cut off supply to the battery.</p> <p>Centuries ago the use of tricycle was established with the help of coal engienes or horses to ride on the same paved horizon. Before the charger circuits with nIcke-cadmium, Nickel metal hydride, and lithium-ion batteries. Which can be charged and can retain charged particles inside until it is used up with it’s connected circuit for operation.</p> <p><strong>7.6     </strong><strong>Aims and Objective</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of this project work is the major of constructing a system that has the ability measures of recharging a battery when it runs down. The design conforms an auto charging cut off circuit that operates when the battery is fully charged.</p> <p><strong>7.7     </strong><strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The battery charger is a device that is well design to perform the function of converting 50Hz or 60Hz Ac into an equivalent variable DC output. The DC produced after the rectification process is then applied directly in charging of our batteries. The battery charger can perform the function of charging 12V battery, 24 volt battery depending on the desired specification of construction.</p> <p>This project design function basically to recharge batteries not exceeding 36 volts and a line up of batteries not exceeding ten in numbers. The current supply of the charging system does not exceed 3amp per charging ratio of line.</p> <p><strong>7.8     </strong><strong>Report Organization</strong></p> <p>Six chapters were converted in the course of design and development of this project. The chapters and their contents are as follows:</p> <p>Chapter one is the introductory chapter that gives the aims, scope and limitation of the project.</p> <p>Chapter two is the literature review, it deliberates on different related works done by several authors with dates.

All over the world, there is a significant electrical power supply interruption. Because of these electrical power supply interruption, many electrical equipments have either developed problems or even stopped working entirely. Hence this has crippled much business thereby affecting even the economy of many countries as Nigeria. Also there is increase in occurrence of power supply disturbance, which can be viewed as a form of power pollution. High voltage spikes and momentary voltage drops are therefore common. These power disturbance may affect the performance of sensitive equipment in private and corporate organization causing loss of data ad even damage to equipment.</p> <p>             In Nigeria today, it is not an over-statement to talk about the epileptic supply of electrical power. This has become the order of the day such that many Nigeria now view these power outages as “Normal” and part of their daily life. A wide range of factors have been identified for this problem. They include natural disasters, vandalism, maintainability and sustainability and lack of local content. The problem of poor quality power supply cannot be properly addressed without a review of other factors such as lack of political will to invest adequately in power sector, absence of replacement policy resulting in obsolete equipment, unsustainable human capacity building and inadequate reward and remuneration system to motivate human resources team to perform well.</p> <p>               According to the recommendation made by the Institute of Electrical Electronics Engineering (IEEE), the supplies that should be available for use should be continuous, uninterrupted with constant frequency and within the load determine in terms of voltage and current. These requirements have become even more relevant in view of the high sensitivity and sophistication of modern technological equipment in use today.</p> <p>               The progress made in developing alternate source of energy over the last decades has shown that independent power systems are not only possible but also very practical. In fact a wide variety of generating equipment is now available to allow individuals take advantage of just any renewable source of energy, for number of reasons, however, most of these system produce only direct current (DC) and often do so only at low voltages. Nonetheless, it is generally agreed that the greatest and most useful form of current is the Alternating current (AC), since these exist in the vast majority of homes.</p> <p>Therefore, there arises the need to able to convert Direct Current (DC) to Alternating Current (AC) that will be of a constant frequency and also be used to power electrical circuits either in homes or in industries. Such electrical device is called an <strong>INVERTER.</strong></p> <p>             An inverter is a power electronics device or apparatus which converts direct current to alternating current, allowing the direct current power from these generators to be used with ordinary a.c appliances and or mixed with the existing electrical grid.</p> <p>An inverter is an electrical device that converts direct current (DC) to alternating current (A.C); the converted A.C can at any required voltage and frequencies, with the use of appropriate transformer, switching and control circuit. Inverters are commonly used to supply A.C power from D.C sources such as panels or batteries.</p> <p>This inverter is designed to provide uninterrupted 220volts a.c supply to the loads connected at its outputs socket. It provide a constant a.c supply to the output socket even when the a.c mains supply is no longer available. When the a.c main supply is available, it goes to the a.c mains sensor, relay and battery charging section of the inverter. This a.c mains sensor informs the relay about the availability of a.c mains supply. When this relay receives a.c mains signals from the main supply, it directly passes the a.c main signals to the inverter output socket.</p> <p>             The electrical inverter e.g. 5000watts or 5KVA, 220-240v, 50Hz, is high power electronic oscillator. It is also named because early mechanical AC to D.C converters were made to work made to work in reverse and thus were “<strong>inverted</strong>” to convert D.C to A.C. the inverter performs the opposite function of a rectifier.</p> <p>If one want to select an inverter, like 5000watts,</p> <p>Total load to be connected = 5000watts</p> <p>Power factor = 0.8(all inverters have a power factor between 0.6 and 0.8)</p> <p>Inverter VA = 5000/0.8 = 6250 VA</p> <p>So select a 7000VA inverter to run 5000watts loads</p> <p><strong>1.1    OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>             In this project, a 5KVA D.C to A.C inverter will be constructed and analyzed. The primary objectives or undertaking this project is for the following reasons:</p> <p>1.

To design an electrical system capable of producing power from a 12v D.C battery that will produce an output of 5000watts, 50Hz–240v which Will be used to drive electrical appliances.</p> <p>   3. To improve our understanding on simple electrical designs, building of electrical circuits and basic principle of operation of inverter.</p> <p>4. To actualize in practice the principle of circuit design and analysis.</p> <p><strong>1.2 SCOPE OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>           This project covers the design and construction of 5KVA, 220-240volts inverter with the following stages.</p> <p>i. Power Supply unit.</p> <p>ii. Inverting unit</p> <p>iii. Power transformer unit</p> <p>iv.

It will also show how the inverter units convert the low voltage D.C into a low voltage A.C in form of square wave. The triggering unit provides the trigging pulse needed by MOSFET to operate.</p> <p>In general, an inverter system has many benefits and features such as:</p> <p>1.   Noiseless, Fuel and Maintenance free.</p> <p>2.   High charging current for quick recharging up to 5 times faster.</p> <p>3.   Bypass mode allows for charge only.</p> <p>4.   Generator compatible allows longer runtime.</p> <p>5.   Unlimited battery expansion capability to increase runtime.</p> <p>6.   UPS Function for auto changeover.</p> <p>7.   automatic voltage regulator</p> <p>8.   Brownout and over voltage protector</p> <p>9.   Small and light in dimension</p> <p>10.

The present AC power lines are based in spike surges, transients, sags and noise. This result in failure of electronic equipment and without adequate protection; all electronic equipment is at a great risk.</p> <p>The fundamental purpose of a UPs is to provide an uninterruptible source of power for the equipment it protects. For instance, an electric device plugged into the wall has only one source of power, thus if there is a blackout, the electricity is cut and the device obviously goes off immediately. A  UPs changes all this equation by providing its equipment two sources of power. UPs are designed so that there is one source and another source that kicks in if the primary is disrupted, called the secondary power sources, and the battery contained within the UPs in the other.</p> <p>          While there are many less expensive methods one can employ to provide some degree of protection for ones PC (for example) from power problems, none of  them c an insulate your system from trouble as well as good UPs with a voltage analyzer.</p> <p>          The idea behind a UPs is pretty obvious from the name. In addition to filtering, enhancing or modifying the utility power, special circuiting and batteries are used to  prevent the PC (for example) from losing power during a disruption (black out) or voltage sap.</p> <p>SCOPE AND SPECIFICATION</p> <p>The project work is limited to the design of a standby UPs with a voltage LED indicator.</p>\n\nTHE DESIGN OF A 500WATTS UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SUPPLY WITH VOLTAGE LEO INDICATOR [INVERTER]<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE DESIGN OF A 500WATTS UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SUPPLY WITH VOLTAGE LEO INDICATOR [INVERTER]", "id": 46}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE </p> <p><strong>1.0            </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     BACKGROUND OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>          Fire detection system are safety system.

Engineering have researches deep into the different methods of achieving to both manual and automatic types.</p> <p>          It may not be taken seriously in some places where power supply is up to 90 constant or where intermittent outage causes no great damage. However, place where they have business centers, industrial centers and even cold rooms need to almost 100% supply. So in this case there is need to provide a standby power supply in the event of power outage. The most important task is just to provide a standby power supply by great attention is paid to the reliability of the system. That is immediately and change over without fluctuations.</p> <p>          The first type of change over switch were purely manual operated. They usually have three switch able position, main, off and generator. An arm is provided from where the operator can have access to the switching. Here, the effectiveness of the switching (i.e how fast it is effected each time power needs to be changed) largely depends on the operator. The change over system will be ineffective when the operator is not around.</p> <p>          The second generation of change over switches were made semi-automatic in which the mains power supply directly powers the contactors. This arrangement is wired is such a way that if the mains power supply fails, the contractors will all drop leaving the supply to the generator position. The effectiveness of the system will now depend on the operator top start up the generator on time.</p> <p>          The main problem suffered by the above mentioned two versions of the change over switch is that the operator must have to be continuously on duty for it to be very effective.

The reason while fire in always able to engulf our household or industry are as a result of poor security system or bad (faulty) fire security system. Owning to all these, it is of a paramount important to include a smoke detector in our security system which I do advice should also be in co-operated with a microcontroller display unit.</p> <p>        This project design is the simple use to display visible write up on the screen a with on alarm which simultaneously alert the security officer the present of smoke, either from any electrical equipment, connection or any burning material, needed to be extinguished before resulting to a fire outbreak.

When the lights are off and you are about to start any industrial or computer-based projects,  all your efforts will be wasted. Even when your system acts as a server, a sudden shutdown could disrupt the processing of many others. You can make your work immune to the intransigence of rolling blackouts and protect against many other types of unexpected power disturbances. Your secret weapon is the <strong><em>uninterruptible power supply or uninterruptible power source. </em></strong>Commonly called the UPS, this devices is a cleaver threefold package-a set of battery, an inverter that transforms the low-voltage direct current of the batteries into the standard alternating current equivalent to your wall outlet, and a battery changer that assures that reserve power storage system (the batteries) with interfaces to mach it to utility power and your computer system. A UPS differs from an auxiliary emergency power system orstandby generator in that it will provide instantaneous or near-instantaneous protection from input power interruptions by means of one or more attached batteries and associated electronic circuitry for low power users, and or by means of diesel generators and flywheels for high power users. While not limited to protecting any particular type of equipment, a UPS is typically used to protect computers, data centers, telecommunication equipment or other electrical equipment where an unexpected power disruption could cause injuries, fatalities, serious business disruption and/or data loss. UPS units range in size from units designed to protect a single computer without a video monitor (around 200 VA rating) to large units powering entire data centers, buildings, or even cities. The UPS is designed to project against changes, specifically a temporary loss of electrical supply.</p> <p>This project focuses on conversion of AC to DC and from DC to AC power inverters, which aim to efficiently transform a DC power source to a high voltage AC source, similar to power that would be available at an electrical wall outlet. Inverters are used for many applications, as in situations where low voltage DC sources such as batteries, solar panels or fuel cell must be converting electrical power from a car battery to run a laptop, TV or cell phone.</p> <p><strong><em>DC and AC Current</em></strong></p> <p>In the world today there are currently two forms of electrical transmission, Direct Current (DC) and Alternating Current (AC), each with its own advantages and disadvantages. DC power is simply the application of a steady constant voltage across a circuit resulting in a constant current. A battery is the most common source of DC transmission as current flows from one end of a circuit to the other. Most digital circuitry today is run off of DC power as it carries the ability to provide either a constant high or constant low voltage, enabling digital logic to process code executions. Historically, electricity was first commecially transmitted by Thomas Edison, and was a DC power line. However, this electricity was low voltage, due to the inability to step up DC voltage at the time, and thus it was not capable of transmitting power over long distances.</p> <p><em>V </em>=<em>IR</em></p> <p><em>P</em>=<em>IV = I2R</em></p> <p>As can be seen in the equations above, power loss can be derived from the electrical current squared and the resistance of a transmission line. When the voltage is increased, the current decreases and concurrently the power loss decreases exponentially; therefore high voltage transmission reduces power loss. For this reasoning electricity was generated at power stations and delivered to homes and businesses through AC power. Alternating current, unlike DC, oscillates between two voltage values at a specified frequency, and it’s ever changing current and voltage makes it easy to step up or down the voltage. For high voltage and long distance transmission situations, all that is needed to step up or down the voltage of the transformer. Developed in 1886 by William Stanley Jr., the transformer made long distance electrical transmission using AC power possible.</p> <p>Electrical transmission has therefore been mainly based upon AC power, supplying most Nigerian homes with a 220 volt AC source. It should be noted that since 1954 there have been many high voltage DC transmission systems implemented around the globe with the advent of DC/DC converters, allowing the easy stepping up and down of DC voltages. Like DC power, there exist many devices such as power tools, radios and TV’s that run off of AC power.</p> <p>It is therefore crucial that both forms of electricity transmission exist; the world cannot be powered with one simple form. It then becomes a vital matter for there to exist easy ways to transform DC to AC power and vice versa in an efficient manner. Without this ability people will be restricted to what electronic devices they use depending on the electricity source available. Electrical AC/DC converters and DC/AC inverters allow people this freedom in transferring electrical power between the two.</p><p> Offline / standby </p> <p><strong><em>Inverters and Applications</em></strong></p> <p>Power inverters are devices which can convert electrical energy of DC form into that of AC. They come in all shapes and sizes, from low power functions such as powering a car radio to that of backing up a building in case of power outage. Inverters can come in many different varieties, differing in price, power, efficiency and purpose. The purpose of a DC/AC power inverter is typically to take DC power</p> <p>supplied by a battery, such as a 12 volt car battery, and transform it into a 220 volt AC power source operating at 50Hz, emulating the power available at an ordinary household electrical outlet. Power inverters are used today for many tasks like powering appliances in a car such as cell phones, radios and televisions. They also come in handy for consumers who own camping vehicles, boats and at construction sites where an electric grid may not be as accessible to hook into. Inverters allow the user to provide AC power in areas where only batteries can be made available, allowing portability and freeing the user of long power cords. However, most UPS units are also capable in varying degrees of correcting common utility power problems like:</p> <p>1.           Power failure: defined as a total loss of input voltage.</p> <p>2.           Surge: defined as a momentary or sustained increase in the mains voltage.</p> <p>3.           Sag: defined as a momentary or sustained reduction in input voltage.</p> <p>4.           Spikes, defined as a brief high voltage excursion.</p> <p>5.           Noise, defined as a high frequency transient or oscillation, usually injected into the line by nearby equipment.</p> <p>6.           Frequency instability: defined as temporary changes in the mains frequency.</p> <p>7.           Harmonic sinusoidal waveform distortion: defined as a departure from the ideal expected on the line</p> <p>Factors to consider when designing an inverter is</p> <p>·        The input voltage</p> <p>·        The output voltage</p> <p>·        The frequency of the oscillators</p> <p>·        The rating of the load to be powered by the inverter</p> <p>·        The ampere range of the charging unit</p> <p>·        The cost of the construction</p> <p>·        The relative importance of the inverter</p> <p>·        The ampere ranger of the charging unit    </p> <p>·        The cost of the construction</p> <p>·        The relative importance of the inverter at that time specification</p> <p>·        D.C input voltage (12V-24V)</p> <p>·        A.C output voltage (220v-240v)</p> <p>·        Output frequency (50Hz-60Hz)</p> <p>·        Output power (450-550)</p> <p>·        Maximum power (550)</p> <p>·        Continuous output power (500)</p> <p>·        Overload shutdown</p> <p>·        Low voltage shutdown</p> <p>1.11 <strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The objective of this project may be summarized as listed below</p> <p>·        To give a brief introduction on what UPS.</p> <p>·        To highlight the basic components used in the construction of a UPS and their functions .</p> <p>·        To describe the way in which there are designed and</p> <p>·        Finally to highlight its application and relevance in the society</p>\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SUPPLY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONSTRUCTION OF UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SUPPLY", "id": 51}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This report is on stability study in electrical power system. The ability of an electric power system to reestablish the initial state (or one practically identical) after any disturbance manifested as a deviation from the initial parameter values for the system’s operation. The electric power sources in a power system are usually synchronous generators, which are coupled together by a common electric network in such a way that the rotors of all generators are in synchronized rotation. This mode, called the normal, or steady-state, mode, should be stable; that is, the power system must return to the initial state (or one practically identical) every time after a deviation from the steady-state mode.</p> <div> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>•         <strong> Background of Study</strong></p> <p>Electric power system analysis software ran on mainframe computers in the early years after the introduction of digital computers.</p> <p>Although there are many software applications in the market today that performs the analysis of electric power system on PCs, most are intended for professionals. These programs take detailed input data about the system, use fast algorithms to perform the solutions, and then present the result obtained. Such software is most useful when only the final results are sufficient for the user.</p> <p>A problem for electric power system students is the solution of problems in textbooks. In the case of load flow problems, most of the effort is focused on iterative calculation, not on how the problem is solved. The same is true for stability studies. Professional software for analysis of electric power systems can help such students to prove their solution; however, only the validity of the final result can be checked.</p> <p>The transient stability is a fast phenomenon and usually occurring within 1sec for a generation close to the cause of disturbance. The time domain simulation method is the most commonly used method to solve the set of non linear equations describing the system dynamic equation, in order to determine the transient stability. From the inspection of the solution, conclusion can be drawn whether the system is stable or unstable.</p> <p><strong>1.2 THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>In this project we the student should be able to know the operation and working rules of a computer based analysis for the purpose of stability studies. How it is developed, the interface with java language for efficient and accurate output result and its need in electrical power system field.</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBLIGATION OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>The requirement and aims of this project work is to develop a java language program that can be use in a computer based analysis of electrical power system for the purpose of stability studies.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>Java is most important in the current IT sector, because java is platform independent that means a program written in java language can execute on any platform, any machine architecture, any operating system which helps you to save the time by not modifying the code every time on every machine you use. Also java is one of the most popular programming languages used to create web applications and platforms. It was designed for flexibility, allowing developers to write code that would run on any machine, regardless of architecture or platform.</p> <p><strong>1.5 CONCEPT OF POWER SYSTEM STABILITY</strong></p> <p><strong>1.5.1 Definition of Power System Stability</strong></p> <p>Power system stability can be defined as the ability of the power system to return to steady state without losing synchronism. Power is generated by synchronous generators that operate in synchronism with the rest of the system. A generator is synchronized with a bus when both of them have same frequency, voltage and phase sequence.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Classification of Power System Stability</strong></p> <p><strong>1.6.1 Steady State Stability</strong></p> <p>These studies are restricted to small and gradual changes in the system operation conditions. In this, we basically concentrate on restricting the bus voltages close to their normal values.  We also ensure that phase angles between two buses are not too large and check for the overloading of the power equipment, and transmission lines. These checks are usually done using power flow studies (CIGRE Report, 2011).</p> <p><strong>1.6.2 Transient Stability</strong></p> <p>From (IEEE, 2012), this involves the study of the power system following a major disturbance. Following a large disturbance, the synchronous alternator the machine power (load) angle changes due to sudden acceleration of the rotor shaft. The objective of the transient stability is to ascertain whether the load angle returns to a steady state value following the clearance of the disturbance.</p> <p><strong>1.6.3 Dynamic Stability</strong></p> <p>This is the ability of a power system to maintain stability under continuous small disturbance. This small disturbance occurs due to random fluctuations in loads and generation levels. In an interconnected power system, these random variations can lead catastrophic failure as this may force the rotor angle to increase steadily.</p> </div>\n\nCOMPUTER BASED ANALYSIS OF ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEM FOR THE PURPOSE OF STABILITY STUDIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMPUTER BASED ANALYSIS OF ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEM FOR THE PURPOSE OF STABILITY STUDIES", "id": 52}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The main aim of any electric power supply in the world is to provide uninterrupted power supply at all times to all its consumers. Although, in developing countries, the electric power generated to meet the demands of the growing consumers of electricity is insufficient, hence power instability and outage.</p> <p>Power instability or outage in general does not promote development in the public and private sector. The investors do not feel secure to come into a country with constant or frequent power failure. These limit the development of industries. In addition, there are processes that cannot be interrupted because of their importance for instance, surgery operation in hospitals, transfer of money between banks and lots more<em>.</em> Power instability and outage in developing countries (Nigeria) creates a need for alternative sources of power to backup the mains supply.</p> <p>Automatic changeover switches find a wide application scope wherever the reliability of electrical supply from the utilities is low and it is used in lighting/motor circuits wherever continuity of supply is necessary, for switching to an alternative source from main supply and vice versa.</p> <p>This project is a design of an automatic changeover switch. This means that when there is any mains failure, the automatic changeover switch will change to an alternative power supply (Generator), and back to the main supply when it is restored. The purpose of this project is to maintain constant supply to the main circuit that is being supplied by making-up for the time lapse or delay that usually accompanies the manual switching from one source to another.</p> <p>The design comprises of the power connection circuit and control connection circuit. The main components to be used include; contactors, relays and timer.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The need for continuous power supply and its reliability has increased rapidly over the years, especially in all those areas where uninterrupted power supply is a must. Modern systems are power dependent. Their complexity has increased as continuous information and communications are needed to control automated process, be in industries, commercial complexes, hospitals, hotels or even modern residences. The need, as such, for independent standby power system has therefore increased manifold. The power distribution, control, monitoring and protection of standby power systems need to be integrated. Standby generator systems, for example are required to serve:-</p> <p><strong>Sensitive Loads- </strong>are supplied by UPS systems. The period of non-availability of power, before the standby supply takes over, is bridged by battery banks. Typical loads are computers, hospital equipments, micro processor controlled industrial machines etc.</p> <p><strong>Critical Loads- </strong>thesemostly involve standby generator systems which supply power to lighting systems, air conditioning, elevators etc in Airports, Hotels and commercial complexes.</p> <p><strong>Essential Loads- </strong>thesealso use standby generator systems mostly in process industries as they relate to high restarting times or high down times. Automatic transfer from mains supply to standby supply is vital for all the above kinds of loads.(11)</p> <p>In the event of power failure, the standby power is usually expected to take over automatically. Electrical starting equipment, battery bank and diesel generator are required for the automatic operation. The automatic transfer is achieved mostly by automatic mains failure systems. The process of on-load transfer has to be monitored and controlled for a smooth Changeover and within safety limits of all elements of the system. This is achieved by an Automatic Changeover Switch.</p> <p>Changeover switches find a wide application wherever the reliability of electrical supply from the utilities is low and they are used in lighting/motor circuits wherever continuity of supply is necessary, for switching to an alternative source from mains supply and vice versa. They are switch disconnectors with independent manual operation capable of making, carrying and breaking currents under normal circuit conditions which may include operating overload conditions and also carrying currents under specified abnormal circuit conditions such as those of short circuit for a specified time.(1)</p> <p>Automatic changeover switch (also known as automatic transfer switch ATS) is an integral part of a power generation process, allowing smooth and immediate transfer of electric current between multiple sources and load. When the generator is in operation, the transfer switch prevents any feedback current to the load. It also ensures that the different power sources are synchronized before the load is transferred to them. The transfer switch senses when there is interruption if the mains supply remains absent. Fluctuations and voltage drop below a particular level within a specified time in the mains supply will also cause the automatic transfer switch to transfer the load to the generator. The starting of the generator is done by a relay which switches the battery voltage to the ignition coil of the generator. In about a few seconds when the generator is producing full power, the transfer switch disconnects the load from the mains supply and connects it to the generator supply, restoring electricity to the load. The transfer switch continues to monitor the mains supply and when it is restored, it switches the load from the generator back to the mains supply. Once the generator is disconnected, it goes through a cool down routine and shuts down automatically.(2)</p> <p><strong>1.1 PROJECT AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The aims and objectives of this project is to</p> <p>1.     Design and construction of an automatic changeover switch that will switch load from the mains power supply (PHCN supply) to a back-up power supply (generator) with simplicity.</p>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN AUTOMATIC SINGLE PHASE CHANGEOVER SWITCH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN AUTOMATIC SINGLE PHASE CHANGEOVER SWITCH", "id": 53}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1.         </strong><strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>The industrial Electronics has changed the whole field of Engineering and technology is occurring so rapidly, even in developing countries.

Power control and automation is a part of this field which is applied in virtually anywhere electrical power is used, generated or transmitted. Manual power change-over switches have been in existence and in different forms and shapes. 1959, the advent of microelectronics has paved way to modify the manually operated change-over switches. This project deals with the design and construction of automatic change-over switch with indicator. It eliminates the time and energy spent in operating the manual change – over and starting of Gen.

Electric power is transmitted by means of transmission lines which deliver bulk power from generating stations to load centres and consumers. For electric power to get to the final consumers in proper form and quality, losses along the lines must be reduced to the barest minimum. A lot of research has been carried out on analysis and computation of losses on transmission lines using reliability indices, but hardly any on the minimization of losses using analytical methods. In another vein, a large body of literature exists for the solution of optimal power flow problems using evolutionary methods, but none of them has employed the versatile tool of mathematical modelling.</p> <p>Thus, the goal of this work is to use the classical optimization approach coupled with the mathematical modelling technique to minimize the transmission power losses. Specifically, the objectives of the study were to:</p> <p>(i.) develop mathematical models for power flow and power losses along electric power transmission lines and solve the mathematical models for electric power flow along transmission lines using an analytical method; (ii.) develop empirical models of power losses as functions of distance; and (iii.) minimize the power losses using the classical optimization technique.</p> <p>In the research, I employed Kirchoff ’s circuit laws and a combination xiii of corona and ohmic losses in obtaining the mathematical models for the power flow and power losses respectively. Empirical models of the power losses were developed using regression analysis.</p> <p>The findings of this study were:</p> <p>(i.) the models for power flow along transmission lines evolved as homogeneous second-order partial differential equations which were solved analytically using the method of Laplace transform; (ii.) the model for power losses over the transmission lines was obtained as the sum of the ohmic and corona losses; (iii.) the empirical models developed are monotonic increasing functions of distance. Thus, establishing that power losses increases with distance; (iv.) power losses are minimized when the operating transmission voltage is equal to the critical disruptive voltage.</p> <p>With the above results, a workable strategy can be formulated to reduce to the barest minimum electric power losses along transmission lines so as to ensure availability of electric power, in proper form and quality, to consumers.</p> <p>Hence, this research work has addressed the problem of minimizing electric power losses during transmission.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1<strong> BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Energy is a basic necessity for the economic development of a nation. There are different forms of energy, but the most important form is the electrical energy<strong>, (Gupta, 2008)</strong>  A modern and civilized society is so much dependent on the use of electrical energy. Activities relating to the generation, transmission and distribution of electrical energy have to be given the highest priority in the national planning process of any nation because of the importance of electrical energy to the economic and social development of the society. In fact, the greater the per capital consumption of electrical energy in a country, the higher the standard of living of its people. Therefore, the advancement of a country is measured in terms of its per capital consumption of electrical energy, <strong>(Gupta, 2008)</strong>.</p> <p>Power plants’ planning in a way to meet the power network load demand is one of the most important and essential issues in power systems. Since transmission lines connect generating plants and substations in power network, the analysis, computation and reduction of transmission losses in these power networks are of great concern to scientists and engineers.</p> <p>A lot of research works have been carried out on the above listed aspects.<strong>(Zakariya, 2010)</strong> made a comparison between the corona power loss associated with HVDC transmission lines and the ohmic power loss. The corona power loss and ohmic power loss were measured and computed for different transmission line configurations and under fair weather and rainy conditions. It was pointed out in the work that the general trend of neglecting the corona power loss is not always valid. It was found from the comparison that, when the transmission line is moderately or lightly loaded, the percentage of corona power loss to ohmic power loss could reach up to one hundred percent especially if the transmission line is operating at a voltage well above the corona onset value. This percentage is also found to increase substantially under rainy conditions. Finally, it was also discovered that, the ratio of corona to ohmic power loss, decreases with increasing number of bundles. <strong>(Numphetch et al., 2011)</strong> worked on loss minimization using optimal power flow based on swarm intelligences.</p> <p><strong>(Thabendra et al., 2009)</strong> considered multi-objective optimization methods for power loss minimization and voltage stability while <strong>(Abdullah et al., 2010)</strong> looked at transmission loss minimization and power installation cost using evolutionary computation for improvement of voltage stability.<strong>(Bagriyanik et al., 2003)</strong> used a fuzzy multi-objective optimization and genetic algorithm-based method to find optimum power system operating conditions. In addition to active power losses, series reactive power losses of transmission system were also considered as one of the multiple objectives. (<strong>Onohaebi</strong>, <strong>2010</strong>) considered the relationship between distance and loadings on power losses using the existing 330 KV Nigerian transmission network as a case study in his empirical modelling of power losses as a function of line loadings and lengths in the Nigeria 330 KV transmission lines while (<strong>Moghadam</strong>, <strong>2010</strong>) developed a new method for calculating transmission power losses based on exact modelling of ohmic loss. <strong>(Ramesh et al., 2009)</strong> looked at minimization of power loss in distribution networks by using feeder restructuring, implementation of distributed generation and capacitor placement method. <strong>(Lo, 2006)</strong>considered feeder reconfiguration for losses reduction in distribution systems. Others who researched into power losses include<strong>(Rugthaicharoencheep, 2009),</strong></p> <p><strong>(Crombie, 2006)</strong>, to mention a few, various researchers have also worked on the flow of power on electrical networks. <strong>(Pandya, 2008)</strong> presents a comprehensive survey of various optimization methods for solving optimal power flow problems. The methods considered in the work include linear programming, Newton-Raphson, quadratic programming, nonlinear programming, interior point and artificial intelligence. Under the artificial intelligence method, the following were also considered artificial neural network method, fuzzy logic method, genetic algorithm method, evolutionary programming method, ant colony optimization method and particle swarm optimization method. It was found in the paper that the classical methods have a lot of limitations. In most cases, mathematical formulations have to be simplified to get the solutions because of the extremely limited capability to solve real-world large-scale power system problems. The classical methods are weak in handling qualitative constraints and they have very poor convergence. The methods are also very slow and computationally expensive in handling large-scale optimal power flow problems. It was also discovered in the paper that the artificial intelligence methods are relatively versatile for handling various qualitative constraints and that the methods can find multiple optimal solutions in a single simulation.</p> <p>They are therefore suitable in solving multi-objective optimization problems.<strong>(William, 2002)</strong> looked at alternative optimal power flow formulations while<strong>(Claudio et al., 2001)</strong> worked on comparison of voltage security constraint using optimal power flow techniques.</p> <p><strong>(Roya et al., 2008)</strong> considered power flow modelling for power systems with dynamic flow controller. Other researchers who also worked on power flow include <strong>(Bouktir et al., 2004).</strong></p> <p>In addition, several researchers have also worked on electric power systems. <strong>(Aderinto, 2011)</strong> worked on an optimal control model of the electric power generating system. In the research work, she developed a mathematical model for the electric power generating system using the optimal control approach and characterized the mathematical model by prescribing the conditions for the optimality of the electric power generating system and the analytic requirements for the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. The optimality condition for the model was determined and the model was solved analytically and numerically. In the study, two control variables were identified, the first for load shedding among the generators in the system and the second for restriction on the capacity of the generators. The problem was formulated based on the second control variable since the first control variable can only be on or off as the case may be. The optimality conditions for the system were imposed implicitly on the controls and the mathematical model represents a stable loss-free generating system. From the work, it was shown that the generation loss can be controlled and stabilized. <strong>(Oke et al., 2007)</strong> considered the perspectives on electricity supply and demand in Nigeria while <strong>(Ibe, 2007)</strong>looked at optimized electricity generation in Nigeria. <strong>(Bamigbola, 2009)</strong>characterized an optimal control model of electric power generating system.<strong>(Karamitsos, 2006) </strong>considered an analysis of blackout for electric power transmission systems while <strong>(Aderinto et al., 2010)</strong> looked at optimal control of air pollution with application to power generating system model. Others whose researches touched on electric power systems include <strong>(Savenkov, 2008) </strong>to list a few. As such, much emphasis has been on proper design of electrical power systems and reduction of losses using feeder reconfiguration and evolutionary techniques.</p> <p>Loss minimization is a critical component for efficient electric power supply systems.</p> <p>Losses in an electric power system should be around 3 percent to 6 percent,<strong>(Ramesh et al., 2009).</strong> In developed countries, it is not greater than 10 percent. However, in developing countries it is still over 20 percent, (<strong>Ramesh et al., 2009)</strong>. Therefore stakeholders in the power sector are currently interested in reducing the losses on electric power lines to a desired and economic level. The purpose of this research work, therefore, is to develop mathematical models for power losses along transmission lines and to minimize the losses using classical optimization techniques.</p> <p><strong>1.2 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Power losses result in lower power availability to the consumers, leading to inadequate power to operate their appliances. High efficiency of power system is determined by its low power losses. The goal of this research work therefore is to use classical optimization techniques to minimize the transmission power losses on transmission lines. The objectives of the research work are to:</p> <p>(i.)     Develop mathematical models for electric power flow and power losses along electric power transmission lines;</p> <p>(ii.)    Solve the mathematical models for electric power flow along transmission lines analytically;</p> <p>(iii.)    Develop empirical models of power losses as functions of distance;</p> <p>(iv.)   Minimize power losses using the classical optimization technique.</p> <p><strong>1.3 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The mathematical representation of power flow along transmission lines provides a better understanding of the flow of electric power on transmission lines and the evolution of voltage and current along the lines. The mathematical representation of power losses along transmission lines gives an insight into the major problems on electric power transmission.</p> <p>The minimization of losses on electric power transmission lines using classical optimization technique provides a solution, in a compact form, to the major problem encontered in power transmission.</p> <p><strong>1.4 ORGANIZATION OF THE THESIS</strong></p> <p>This dissertation report is divided into five chapters. The first chapter is an introduction of the work done. The second chapter is the literature and background review of the work. Chapter three handles methodology, design and implementation of the work done while chapter four is the data presentation and analysis of the work.

The application of microprocessor based (numeric) relaying protection has improved performance over time but, this has not led to a major impact on speed, sensitivity, and selectivity of primary protective relays. However decision making based on elements of artificial intelligence (AI) can, in my view, lead to a major impact in the aforementioned especially as quick fault removal in lines maintenance is concerned here.</p> <p><strong>1.2.  </strong><strong>POWER SYSTEM PROTECTION</strong></p> <p>Designing a fail-free power system, is neither economically justifiable nor technically feasible (Nagrath et al, 1994). Failure of apparatus due to surges or other causes leads to faults on a power system. Strictly speaking, a fault is any abnormal state of the system. In general faults consist of ‘short circuit’ (Stevenson, 1982). Open circuit faults pose potential hazards to personnel, but, they are less server that short circuit faults. Hence they (short circuit faults) must be removal from the system as fast as possible. In modern power systems, this short circuit fault removal process is done automatically, and the equipment that does it is called ‘protective system’ (Stevenson, 1982). This is a combination of transducers, relays and circuit breakers. Although this thesis does not concern the isolation of any part of the system in event of fault, the above premises is inevitable since fault location is a measure for ensuring speedy fault clearing, and fault clearing can only take place if the system is adequately protected.  </p> <p><strong>1.3.  </strong><strong>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) TECHNIQUES IN POWER SYSTEM PROTECTION</strong></p> <p>In the last two decades, much of the efforts in power system analysis (control and protection has moved from the methodology of formal Mathematical modeling to the less rigorous techniques of artificial intelligence (AI) (Agggarwal et al, 1995). Today the main AI techniques found in power system applications are those utilizing the logic and knowledge representation of expert system (ES), fuzzy systems (FS), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and recently, evolutionary computing (EC).</p> <p>The application involves developing a programmable logic (PROLOG) for the manipulation of symbolic information in a manner that emulates human reasoning. It concerns, constraints satisfaction, and nevertheless, provides a rich in-depth look at the use of PROLOG to develope a problem description (Schalkoff, 1990). The overall goal of the application concerns the development of a reasoning  system involves developing a strategy to operate (Open) appropriate circuit breakers in the event of fault. Sample application of the above approach to power system fault clearing include fault location.</p> <p><strong>1.4.  </strong><strong>COMPARISON OF AI TECHNIQUES</strong></p> <p>The goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to produce intelligent machines which simulate or emulate human being’s intelligence. Artificial Neural Networks, Expert Systems and Fuzzy Systems all attempt to meet these objectives. The difference in them lies essentially in the way knowledge is represented in the system, and how it is obtained.</p> <p>·        <strong>ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS (ANN)</strong></p> <p>ANNs and fuzzy systems are similar in many ways; first they both store knowledge and use it to make decisions on new inputs. Both can generalize and produce correct responses despite minor variations in input vector. However, there are some fundamental differences. ANN has a major advantage of acquiring knowledge through training. Often the training set can be composed of actual observations of the physical world, rather than being formed from the human opinions used for fuzzy (or expert) systems. In other words, the neural network lets the data speak for itself; they cannot directly handle fuzzy information (Song et al, 1997).    </p> <p>·        <strong>FUZZY SYSTEMS (FS):</strong> Like expert systems, fuzzy systems rely on If-Then- rules. These rules, while superficially similar, allow the input to be fuzzy, i.e. more like the natural way that humans express knowledge. For instance, we may say the system is ‘somewhat secure’. This linguistic input can be expressed directly by a fuzzy system. Therefore the natural format greatly eases the interface between the knowledge engineer and the domain expert, thus, a fuzzy system can represent knowledge in which an expert system may have difficulty (or needs a large set of rules). Fuzzy and expert system differ in one critical respect (Song et al, 1997). Fuzzy systems allow the representation of imprecise human knowledge in a natural, logical way, rather than forcing the use systems. Fuzzy systems allow the approximate terms that are nearly always employed by humans to express their judgments, thereby permitting more accurate knowledge representations. Thus fuzzy systems are more robust, more compact and simpler.</p> <p><strong>1.5.  </strong><strong>FUZZY LOGIC FOR POWER SYSTEM PROTECTION</strong></p> <p>Fuzzy logic can be said to be a problem-solving control system methodology, which provides a simple way to arrive at definite conclusion based upon vague, blurred, ambiguous, noisy, imprecise input information (Kaeler,2005). It was first conceived by professor Lofti Zadeh of the University of Clifornia in 1965. It incorporates a simple rule-based “IF X and Y THEN Z” approach to solving control problem rather than attempting to model a system mathematically. Fuzzy logic allows complex system design directly from engineering experience and experimental results, thus quickly rending solutions that can effectively describe the vagueness of the real world. It uses an imprecise but very descriptive language to deal with input data in a way that mimics a human operator.</p> <p>Mathematical formulations of real-world problems are derived under certain restrictive assumptions. Conversely, there are many uncertainties in various power system problems because power systems are large, complex geographically widely distributed and influenced by unexpected new challenges. These facts make it difficult to effectively deal with many power system problems through strict mathematical formulations alone. Fuzzy logic, among others is a powerful AI tool in meeting challenging power system problems.</p> <p>The following are the uncertainty and imprecision in power systems which pose significant difficulties when applying conventional techniques:</p> <p>·        Imprecise information caused by human beings involved in the planning, management, operation and control of power systems.</p> <p>·        Changing power system operating conditions such as changes in load or generation and changes in the topology of power systems.</p> <p>·        Inaccuracies caused by voltage and current transducers or SCADA measurements/state estimations or noise introduced through electromagnetic interference,</p> <p>·        Many fault conditions, include fault inception, fault location, fault types and fault path resistance.</p> <p>The aforementioned problems are compounded by their random nature. In this respect, fuzzy logic (FL) has been investigated as a powerful tool in the development of novel protective relays for transmission systems (Aggarwal et al, 1997).</p> <p><strong>SOME FUZZY LOGIC BENEFITS INCLUDE</strong></p> <p>ØFuzzy logic is based on natural languages and is conceptually easy to understand</p> <p>ØFL can resolve conflicting objectives</p> <p>ØFL is tolerant of imprecise data and can handle ambiguity</p> <p>ØFL is flexible and relatively easy to implement</p> <p>ØFL can be built on top of the experience of experts or can be implemented with other techniques.</p> <p>When developing a fuzzy logic control system, there are eight tasks we need typically to perform in an iterative development cycle (Song et al, 1997).</p> <p>·        Define the problem</p> <p>·        Define the linguistic variables</p> <p>·        Define control surface (fuzzy sets)</p> <p>·        Define the behavior of the control surface (Fuzzy rules)</p> <p>·        Define reasoning mechanism (Fuzzy inference)</p> <p>·        Build the system</p> <p>·        Test the system</p> <p>·        Tune and validate the system.</p> <p><strong>1.6.  </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Uncertainty imprecision, and ambiguity of power system conditions pose serious challenges of complex mathematical modeling when we apply conventional relay based protection techniques. These challenges are compounded by the fact that the input parameters needed for the design of protective systems are not always clear and distinct.</p> <p><strong>1.7.  </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This thesis is aimed at:</p> <p>vImproving power efficiency by providing alternative and improved solutions to the challenges in the convetional maintenance scheme for high tension transmission lines and even distribution lines.</p> <p>vRemoving accident risks that are always encountered by maintenance crew when location faults.</p> <p><strong>1.8.  </strong><strong>THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This thesis covers the existing conventional relay based fault location schemes and the application of artificial intelligence (Fuzzy logic) concept to provide improved solutions.</p> <p><strong>1.9.  </strong><strong>LIMITATIONS OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This thesis does not seek to design a completely new fault location scheme.

When it comes to the safety of cars, car owners should be very careful. These days, the market is flooded with many safety devices. Typically, the most successful ones among all is the ‘alarming device’. Car alarms are good but they cannot give 100% satisfaction. Smart thieves know how to dismount the smartest car alarm security systems in a car and before the police could start a search, thieves can export various parts of the car to countries like China, and the owner may never come to know if that car ever existed on this planet. In that case, a car tracker system with code using GSM can be a great option to ensure maximum safety. The car tracker system with code using GSM is designed for its users to control their vehicle anywhere in the world using mobile phone. If the vehicle is being stolen, the user can demobilize the vehicle while the GSM network provider carries out the tracking of the vehicle using GSM tower triangulation network. A registered GSM SIM card with a MODEM is used to get access to the GSM network and as well provides an interface between the vehicle and the owner. Other basic components used in the construction of the project are 9013 bipolar junction transistors, controller IC, electromagnetic relays, 7812 and 7805  DC regulators, and light emitting diodes, (LED). With this project, it does not matter if the vehicle key is there or not, or whether the vehicle is in motion or not the system must stop the vehicle. Therefore, the risk of theft or car missing is highly reduced, or completely eliminated.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>Concept of Study</strong></p> <p>Over the past years, automobile manufacturers have been integrating all manner of security system, to its automobile, so as to ensure that users are provided with all the security needed to ensure the safety of the vehicle. Considering the lifestyle of most users, the companies realize that its customers are always busy and most times have little or no information about lifestyle beyond their work place. Also from their search it was found that a large percentage of vehicle users use cell phones as their primary means of staying in contact with their family, friends and offices, (Joann Muller (2005-11-28,).This led to the idea of developing a system that allows drivers and vehicle owners to stay in constant communication with the world outside their automobile.</p> <p>Since the concept of security has become a major concern for our world, and to most vehicle users, automobile manufacturers employed the idea of  vehicle security system which do not just help the human agent but could on their own completely provide all the necessary security requirements without supervision.</p> <p>An Automobile Security System (ASS) as a form of a vehicle security system combines the installation of an electronic device in a vehicle, or fleet of vehicles with purpose-designed computer software to enable the owner to track the vehicle’s location while collecting data in the process. In this kind of security system, a telecommunication system and method is used for instructing a device interfaced with a vehicle’s electrical system to activate or deactivate specific electrical device such as the ignition, car lock system and the electronic fuel injector using a cellular network. This can be accomplished by utilizing a mobile terminal or a unit containing the mobile terminal receiver, herein after referred to as a “GSM MODEM” or “Radio Interface Unit” (RIU), which is interconnected to a “Power Interface Unit” (PIU).</p> <p>The PIU directly interconnects to the vehicle’s electrical system and ignition. This system enables the vehicle user to access their vehicle’s electrical system from remote places simply by dialing the cellular phone number (a number associated with the RIU/GSM MODEM) from another mobile phone. The RIU when triggered will either send notifications via SMS or call to the vehicle user or receive instructions from the same user to activate or deactivate electrical devices depending on the nature of instruction given by the user.</p> <p>With ASS the user can perform functions such as locking the doors, switching off ignition, monitoring temperature, turning on light, cutting off the electronic fuel injector and having different reactions for several situations.</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>CLASSIFICATION OF AN AUTOMOBILE SECURITY SYSTEM (ASS)</strong></p> <p>There can be many differentiating factors used to classify Automobile Security Systems   but in this work, we will classify them under two major headings;</p> <p>·        Intelligent systems.</p> <p>·        Non-intelligent systems.</p> <p>We could simplify it further as microcomputer based and non-microcomputer based security systems.</p> <p><strong>intelligent systems: </strong>These are security systems that have an intelligent device, which monitor the space area or variable under guard, and provide a response signal when there is a bridge in normalcy. These systems are made up digital devices like the microprocessors and microcontrollers and posses a level of intelligence by which they measure the variables under guard. They can also be completely un-manned or partially un-manned. In the design of these systems, sensors and transducers become a major part of the circuitry. Sensors and transducers are the actual components that work with the processor to achieve a fully automated system.</p> <p>Non-Intelligent Systems: Non-intelligent systems are systems that do not have any processor in their circuitry. This ranges from the manual crude method that employs human effort and the manually run machines that aid the individual to the monitored cameras and laser monitoring intruder devices which blare alarms.</p> <p><strong>1.3  </strong><strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The aim and objective of a car tracker systemis to have a reliable and highly precision security means to ensure the safety of vehicles. If the vehicle was snatched, the device can help make searching more efficient. Without a car tracker system with code using GSM, there may be chances of someone not getting a stolen vehicle back. The objective of a car tracker system with code using GSM is to give its users the reassurance that they will definitely have their car restored in a shorter time.</p> <p><strong>1.3.2 SCOPE</strong></p> <p>The car tracker is use to immobilize or demobilize a vehicle when the authorized user calls the vehicle security number through a GSM mobile cell phone. Only the coded users/numbers can control the vehicle through their GSM phone. The GSM hardware system of the car tracker enables the mobile service provider to know the position of the vehicle anywhere in the world through their network using GSM tower triangulation.</p> <p><strong>1.4    COMMON USES OF AUTOMOBILE SECURITY SYSTEM (ASS)</strong></p> <p>Automobile security systems are commonly used by fleet operators for fleet management function, such as routing, dispatch, on-board information and security. Along with commercial fleet operators, urban transit agencies use the technology for a number of purposes, including monitoring schedule adherence of buses in services, triggering changes of buses destination sign displays at the end of the line (or other set location along a bus route) and triggering pre-recorded announcements for passengers. This can refer to the external announcements. Identifying the next stop, as the bus approaches a stop. Data collected as a transit vehicle follows its route is often continuously fed into a computer program which compares the vehicle’s actual location and time with its schedule, and in turn produces a frequently updating display for the driver telling him or her how early or late he or she is at any given time, potentially making it easier to adhere more closely to the published schedule. Such programs are also used to provide customers with real-time information as to the waiting time until arrival of the next bus at a given stop. Some transit agencies provide a virtual map on their website, with icons depicting the current locations of the buses in service on each route for customer’s information.</p> <p>Other applications include:</p> <p>·        Stolen vehicle recovery where both consumer and commercial vehicle can be outfitted with Radio Frequency (RF) units to allow the police to do tracking and recovery. The tracking unit can be activated directly and tracking signals followed by police or vehicle owner to track or monitor the vehicle.</p> <p>·        Asset tracking where companies needing to track valuable assets for insurance or other monitoring purposes can now plot the real-time asset location on a map and closely monitor the movement and operation status of the asset.</p> <p>·        Field service management companies with a field service workforce for services such as repair or maintenance, must be able to plan field workers’ time, schedule subsequent customer visit and be able to operate this department efficiently. Vehicle tracking allows companies to quickly locate a field engineer and dispatch the chosen one to meet a customer’s request.</p> <p>·        Surveillance: here a tracker may be placed on a vehicle to follow the vehicle’s movements.</p> <p>·        Transit tracking: here users ensure that the assets do not stop on the routes or do a U-turn in order to ensure the security of assets.</p> <p><strong>1.4.1   THEFT PREVENTION</strong></p> <p>Security is the topmost priority of any individual, group. This outlines security focus on cars for mitigating security risks to car owners. The ultimate goal of the security system is to prevent access to intruders thereby protecting the monitored device. This helps safeguard property of individuals, groups and organizations. The alarming increase in theft and related cases of intruders has necessitated the improvement on security infrastructure.</p> <p>‘Immobilizer’, which is a type of vehicle anti-theft device, reduces a thief’s chances of starting or driving away a target vehicle. Immobilizers usually consist of a switch wired into some parts of the electrical section of the vehicle’s power unit, thus enabling the engine to be easily disabled.</p>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A CAR TRACKER SYSTEM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A CAR TRACKER SYSTEM", "id": 59}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT:</strong></p> <p>This project deals with the design and implementation of a radio controlled car lock with 5-minutes ignition deactivation facility capable of locking a vehicle using a remote control from a distance. The system is designed in two functional units; the transmitter which is an RF handheld remote control, and the receiver units. The receiver unit is realized in several modules. A tuned radio frequency receiver (TRF) output is used to trigger a bistable multivibrator configured using CD 4013 whose output is used to trigger the car lock switch. The four doors of a conventional car are represented using four push and hold switches wired to trigger a 5-min delay circuit realized with Ne555 timer in monostable mode. The system works in such a way that if your car is snatched at gunpoint, you simply press the remote and the car locks by switching off a green LED before the armed robber zoom off. And once any of the doors is opened and closed, the vehicle automatically comes to a stop after five minutes. And the ignition lamp goes off too. The system also contains a reset switch installed at a recessed location in the car for resetting the locking system when the car is found.

Because of this, a thorough research was embarked on Remote control car lock with 5-minutes ignition deactivation facilities. This system prevents car snatchers from disappearing with the vehicle. It frustrate them five minutes after closing of any of the car doors.

It is a hateful and deliberate defacement/destruction of somebody else’s property or national assets like thehigh-voltage transmission power lines, transmission towers and distribution transformers, etc.The high-voltage transmission power lines strung from support towers form the backbone of the nation's electric power grid. Many of those 158,000 miles of lines, supported by nearly 800,000 towers, run through isolated areas as they deliver electricity from generating plants to cities. These high-voltage transmission power lines around the world are vulnerable to terrorism, vandalism, physical deterioration and extreme weather. Every year in Nigeria bad citizens vandalize the power line, towers, transformers, generators and other power transmission/distribution facilities. This causes frequent power failure and power surge that seriously affects over 50 million business firms and manufacturing industries in the country. These companies depend on electricity power supply from the power line for their productions. If the power line is vandalized, some of their machines cannot be powered on a generator then income, investments and commodities worth billions of Naira will be lost. If electricity is available during the power line vandalism incident, the lives and properties of the people within the area can be affected as a result of electric shocks, power surge and fire outbreak, etc. Vandalism is now largely driven by the soaring values of copper and aluminum in the international metals market due to increased world market demand fuelled by China and India’s growth in industrialization. Consequently, the vandals now operate in well organized syndicates complete with offices and hierarchy and accumulate large volumes of stolen materials which they eventually consign for export as scrap. Transformer oil, copper and aluminum are the main targets of these vandals. The uses of the stolen transformer oil are:</p> <p>·        Mixed with diesel and sold as fuel,</p> <p>·        Used as fuel for industrial furnaces and as cooling for welding sets,</p> <p>·        Mixed with vegetable oil and sold as cooking oil.</p> <p>·        Used as a cosmetic and treatment for wounds.</p> <p>·        On the other hand, copper and aluminum have been in the past been used on a minimum scale by the informal sector for welding sets but are now mainly exported as scrap. It is this later use that is behind the recent escalation of vandalism.</p> <p>Vandalism of an electrical transmission line is considered as a deadly national security threat.</p> <p> The diagram below shows the picture of a vandalized transmission tower.</p> <p><strong><em>Figure 1.1: Transmission Towers Vandalism</em></strong></p> <p>Power line vandalism affects the economy badly this is due to the burglar gadgets been made every year for the supervision and protection on the power lines. Millions of dollars are used every year to replace, maintain and improve the electricity network, yetthe power delivery system is being threatened by acts of vandalism. Today NEPA and PHCN have been privatized, since in 2013, there were more than 12 incidences of vandalism recorded on the Alaoji-Owerri 132kV line, Jebba-Shirioro  330kV lines, Osogbo-Ayede 330kV line, Oshogbo-Benin 330kV line, Oshogbo Ikeja 330kV line, Jebba-Shirioro 330kV line, Benin-Ikeja West 330kV line, Sapele-Benin 330kV line, Delta-Sapele-Benin 330kV line, Sapele-Benin 330kV line, Benin-Ajaokuta 330kV lines and the Abuja-Keffi 132kV line. Some of these transmission lines were vandalized more than three times.</p> <p>Vandalism of power installations though inexcusable and unjustified has seen the vandals carting away equipments worth billions of naira. Recently, a series of vandalism of transmission installations in the Southern part of the country were reported because there are no electronic gadgets secretly installed to monitor these lines. This project, the design and construction of a power line vandalism alarm system present a solution to these problems</p> <p> </p> <div> <p><strong><em>Figure 1.2: Cable Vandal</em></strong></p> </div><p>     </p> <p><strong>1.1    </strong><strong>Power Line Vanadalism</strong><strong>Detector System</strong></p> <p>A power line vandalismdetector system is a high-voltage transmission line anti tampering electronic security device specially designed to remotely monitor and protect the lineagainst vandals.  The system detects when the transmission line is vandalized and as well when the vandals entered in the vicinity where there the transmission line tower is installed. This means that the system can sense unauthorized movement of objects (caused by humans or nature) around the transmission lines. The system circuitry consists of sensor nodes, buffer, alarm circuit, a power supply unit and a controller which processes data and triggers an alarm. The alarm sound comes from an output transducer called buzzer. The system at the same time communicates wirelessly to the power line operators and the law enforcement using radio frequency (RF) signal network.</p> <p><strong>1.2    </strong><strong>Design Considerations</strong></p> <p>The first design consideration of the project is the availability of the components to actualize a power line vandalism monitoring system. The available electronic components in the country, with considerations based on sound economic overview for its availability and affordability. In the design the following below are also considered for the effectiveness and further development of the system.</p> <p><strong>1.3    </strong><strong>High frequency alarm system:</strong></p> <p>A high frequency alarm sound is used to alert the people at the power station when the vandalism is about to take place. This assist the police, military and Para-military in their duty to ensure adequate monitoring and protection of power lines. The law enforcement bodies cannot be everywhere at every time, so when this alarm sounds at the power station, then they can alert the security agency close to the targeted destination. This is why in this project design included a high frequency alarm which can give an attractive high frequency sound that can alert anyone around when the vandals intruded to the power line vicinity.</p> <p><strong>1.4    </strong><strong>Aims and Objectives</strong></p> <p>The aim of this project is to design and construct a power line vandalism monitoring system using electronic system that can monitor and report vandalism of the power line. The objectives are to properly secure transmission power lines and towers against vandalism, which would enable the PHCN to transmit quality and reliable bulk power in a viable and efficient manner.</p> <p><strong>1.5    </strong><strong> Significance of the Project</strong></p> <p>The project is very significant for power line security and maintenance access control. It provides security to installations that in most out of sight areas. Other significant of the project are:</p> <p>1.      It effectively monitors movement of these vandals when they cross their boundary and alerts the power line operators and the people around since it is also the duty of every citizen to protect and guard national asset. </p> <p>2.      This project can be deactivated or reconfigured when an authorized personal are present in the power transmission line zone.</p> <p>3.      The project can be used in any place around the world</p> <p>4.      It secures utility facilities, transformers, substations, power plant generation, transmission and distribution facilities located which at the end of this project, the vandalism of PHCN properties will be greatly reduced.</p> <p><strong>1.6    </strong><strong>Scope of Project</strong></p> <p>The project detects when the power line cuts that is immediately the cable is disconnected, whether there is power or not.</p> <p><strong>Limitations and Suggestions for Further Developments</strong></p> <p>One of the major constraints to this project work is funding while its limitations and suggestion for developments are:-</p> <p>·        The backup power supply of the project is battery. Batteries do not last longer as result of excess power consumption so in the future it will be better to use a standalone power supply system, (solar energy).</p> <p>·        The system did not have a television surveillance system to automatically record the activities of vandals.</p> <p>·        The project does not have a GPS or auto alert system by sms to alert the nearest security agency.</p> <p>·        The project does not have a light dependent motion sensor which can detect a vandal meters away before he starts operation.</p>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCT A POWER LINE VANDALISM MONITORING SYSTEM USING ELECTRONIC SYSTEM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCT A POWER LINE VANDALISM MONITORING SYSTEM USING ELECTRONIC SYSTEM", "id": 61}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This project presents the design and construction of a battery charger. A battery charger is an electrical/electronic device used to put energy into a secondary cell or rechargeable battery by forcing an electric current through it. <strong>The system </strong>consists of a step down transformer, an AC to DC converter and a DC voltage regulator. The circuits are designed using copper wire, rectifier diodes, electrolytic capacitors, resistors with other passive and active component of electronics. A battery charger is an indispensible device for battery users because battery is an essential element that powers any electronic products like UPS inverters system, <strong>photographic equipments, hand-held lamps (flashlight or torch), computer-memory standby, toys, novelties</strong> and automobiles, etc. These products will become useless if there is no charger to refill their battery when it runs down. In this project, a sophisticated class of battery charger is designed not just to refill rechargeable batteries but to conserve the battery life because wrong<strong>handling and charging of a battery can permanently damage the battery even if is brand new.</strong> With this project, people can recharge both alkaline, NiCad and lead acid batteries by themselves and then save money on battery purchases.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong> Background of Study</strong></p> <p>Few modern electrical appliances receive their power directly from the Utilitygrid like National Electricity Power Authority (<strong>NEPA</strong>) or Power Holding Company of Nigeria (<strong>PHCN</strong>), while a growing number of everyday electronic and electrical devices require electrical power from batteries in order to achieve greater mobility and convenience. Rechargeable batteries store electricity from the utility grid for later use and can be conveniently recharged when their energy has been drained. According to <strong>Woodbank Communications Ltd</strong> in their <strong>2005</strong> battery chargers and charging methods review in<strong>http://www.mpoweruk.com</strong>, battery charging involves three key functions: getting the charger into the battery (charging), optimizing the charging rate (stabilizing) and knowing when to stop (terminating). Appliances that use rechargeable batteries include everythingfrom low-power mobile cell phones to high-power industrial fork lifts. The sales volume of suchproducts has increased dramatically in the past decade. Hundreds of millions of theseproducts are sold annually to businesses and consumers, with close to a billion in U.S and Nigeria.</p> <p>While designers of battery chargers often maximize the energy efficiency of their devices to ensure long operation times between charging.  They often ignore how much energy is consumed in the process of converting ac electricity from the utility grid into dc electricity stored in the battery. In this project design, significant energy savings are possible by reducing the conversion losses associated with charging batteries in battery-powered products. We could save a lot of electric power using new electronic technology in our charging system and then highlight several design strategies for improving the efficiency of other chargers. We introduced a smart or intelligent battery charger that does not only recharge batteries but conserves AC electrical energy and as well save the battery life. Most battery chargers require human attention say <strong>Chu, Kim-Chiu</strong> the writer ‘development of intelligent battery charge’ (<strong>1989</strong>), from the University of Hong Kong, but in this project, an automatic battery monitor is used to reduce human attention to about 85 per cent to eliminate overcharging of batteries.</p> <p><strong>1.2 <strong>What is A Battery Charger?</strong></strong></p> <p>A battery charger is a system that draws energy from the grid, store it in a battery, and release it to power a device is called a battery charger system.</p> <p> A system designer in ADACC(<strong>Engr. A.A Ndubuisi) </strong>in his <strong>1999</strong>article describes a battery charger is an electrical and electronic device that is used to put energy into a secondary cell or rechargeablebattery by forcing an electric current through it.The charging protocol of a battery charger depends on the size and type of the battery being charged. Some battery types have high tolerance for overcharging and can be recharged by connection to a constant voltage source or a constant current source; simple chargers of this type require manual disconnection at the end of the charge cycle, or may have a timer to cut off charging current at a fixed time. Other battery types cannot withstand long high-rate over-charging; the charger may have temperature or voltage sensing circuits and a microprocessor controller to adjust the charging current, and cut off at the end of charge. A trickle charger provides a relatively small amount of current, only enough to counteract self-discharge of a battery that is idle for a long time. Slow battery chargers may take several hours to complete a charge; high-rate chargers may restore most capacity within minutes or less than an hour, but generally require monitoring of the battery to protect it from overcharge.</p> <p><strong>Christine T. Bryant, (1990) </strong>say not all chargers can recharge alkaline batteries. It makes sense to use alkaline batteries while powering electronic systems even though they are difficult to recharge but they do not have a self-discharge. This is because alkaline batteries have long shelf lives and do not suffer the 'memory effects' of Nickel-cadmium batteries. The term 'memory effects' refers to the batteries becoming weaker with continued use, particularly when the batteries have seen light use and do not respond well to further charging. The problem stems from low battery currents which flow from only a small part of the active anode area of the battery. If higher current had been drawn or if the battery had been completely discharged, the whole active area of the anode would have been involved. The unused area essentially 'films over' and acts as a barrier to current flow. Further charging does not restore the active area. This is a chemical change causing the electrodes to degenerate in Nickel-metal hydride and Nickel-cadmium batteries. It is reversible by charging and discharging several times. Batteries that are not recharged before use will not supply the full amount of stored energy. None of the above happens with common alkaline batteries. The rate of self discharge in Nickel-cadmium is about 2% per week, in Nickel-metal hydride it is about 3% per week. At temperatures higher than room temperature, these rates increase. Using the wrong charger on alkaline batteries can be downright dangerous. If you read the warning labels printed on ordinary batteries, you will observe that a NiCad charger should never be used on alkaline batteries. Such a charger would supply currents in excess of safe values, would not turn off automatically when battery voltage exceeds safe limits, and would continue unchecked until the battery was damaged.In order to achieve ten times extension of the normal life of an everyday alkaline battery, you will have to recharge it frequently, many more times than ten. With this project it is possible to recharge both alkaline and NiCad batteries because the system has anautomatic battery monitor which monitor and adjust the charging rate of batteries. Charge rate is often denoted as C or C-rate and signifies a charge or discharge rate equal to the capacity of a battery in one hour. For a 1.6Ah battery, C = 1.6A. A charge rate of C/2 = 0.8A would need two hours, and a charge rate of 2C = 3.2A would need 30 minutes to fully charge the battery from an empty state, if supported by the battery. This also assumes that the battery is 100% efficient at absorbing the charge. A battery charger may be specified in terms of the battery capacity or C rate; a charger rated C/10 would return the battery capacity in 10 hours, a charger rated at 4C would charge the battery in 15 minutes. Very rapid charging rates, 1 hour or less, generally require the charger to carefully monitor battery parameters such as terminal voltage and temperature to prevent overcharging and damage to the cells.</p> <p> </p> <p> 1.3 Aims and Objective </p> <p>The major aim and objective of this project is to design and construct a battery charger that can be use to charge any kind of 12v rechargeable batteries including alkaline, NiCad or lead acid batteries. With the lack of centralized power grids, car batteries have taken the place of oneof the main energy sources available in developing countries. With this in mind, ourobjective will be to design a cheap, versatile and efficient lead acid car battery charger which will interest and appeal to the “cost-minded” customer.One of our main incentives in developing this project is for a low-cost charger (affordable) to integrate or combine with otherdevice. After carrying out our project research on the targeted users, they have been able todevise a list of particular features that would be essential in the project, like designing   battery charger to be universal. Using a standard AC power, ability to charge a typical 12 Volt lead-acid (automotive) battery.We used these requirements as guidelines to implementing our product as well as include additional features that we thought are important to the functionality.</p> <p><strong>1.4  </strong><strong>Scope</strong></p> <p>The scope of this project is to have a direct current battery charger of 12 Volts and 10 Amp maximum which can be suitable for car batteries and electric vehicles. Electric vehicles need high-rate chargers for public access.</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong> Significant of the Project</strong></p> <p>The significant of this project is not just to recharge batteries but it works as a D. C power adapter for experimentation. It may, however, require an externalcapacitor to be connected across its output terminals in order to \"smooth\" the voltage sufficiently, which may be thought of as a DC voltage plus a \"ripple\" voltage added to it.  The project is also significant because children will be attracted to charging their own batteries in their toys and possessions. Managing their own batteries is fun, and they know it helps the environment by not having to throw batteries away when they can recycle them.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Limitations</strong></p> <p>The project is limited to 12V batteries. It is not advisable to use it on rechargeable batteries above 12V.  Also there is no internal resistanceconnected in the battery charger to limit the short circuit current.</p> <p><strong>1.7  Constraints</strong></p> <p>The biggest setback experienced during the course of this project is financial difficulties in funding the design of the project. Secondly, sourcing of materials and components used was not easy. Finding the rectifier diode and DC regulator for this charger was not an easy task. We had to destroy many electronic devices for solution. Some of the components we used for this project were very difficult to find. Furthermore, we received a severe electric shock while trying to plug in the workbench power supply to test our design and that made us to almost give up.</p><p> </p>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF 12V BATTERY CHARGER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF 12V BATTERY CHARGER", "id": 62}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The evolutionary trend in industrial electronics and automation has engulfed all parts of the world and proved more challenging to as third world like Nigeria.

Power control and automation is a part of this field which is applied in virtually anywhere electrical power is used, generated or transmitted. Manual power change-over switches have been in existence and in different forms and shapes. 1959, the advent of microelectronics has paved way to modify the manually operated change-over switches. This project deals with the design and construction of automatic change-over switch with indicator. It eliminates the time and energy spent in operating the manual change – over and starting of Gen.

It is a multi-circuit transformer that has one input as the primary and tappins to produce the output (secondary). It is considered as a single coil in series with the supply and a common coil to the head. It is experimentally done using flat metal shocks of cast steel to form the “E” and “I” shaped laminations and coils of various turns.<br/>Not much progress has been made by those who were in the field in the production of a much circuit auto-transformer. While working this project, we got information from some textbooks on auto-transformer and some expert in the field.<br/>However, the write up goes beyond the perspectives of an ordinary layman’s belief that the theory behind the construction of an auto-transformer cannot be achieved practically by Nigerian Engineers in this country. Every aspect of the auto-transformer.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>Electrical energy has been considered as one of the numerous form of energy and it distinguished itself vividly by the widest application in the recent years.<br/>Electrical energy is particularly useful by reasons of the case with which it can be distributed and converted to other desired forms lighting effects, heating effect magnetic effect of electrical energy can be used to ran our inclustrus, boil our water, provide light for our homes as well as servicing and easing other human endeavours.<br/>The wide use of electricity has necessitated the development of systems of transmission and distribution. Transmission systems are required (a) to enable sources of natural energy (eg water fails – dams, or storage loaves, reservoirs for hydropower station, fuel fields, coal gas, diesel – for thermal generating station), for distant from the centre of energy demand (e.g large works, industrial areas of cities), to be economically utilized, (b) to enable generating plant to be concentrated in a few large. Favourably situated stations; and (c) to per met of the in for connection of network or distributing areas to ensure reliability economy and stability or continuity of supply.<br/>There are three main facts in the production and utilization of electricity namely: generations transmission, and distribution generation of electrical energy employs electrical power stations. These power stations generate electrical energy making use of fuel (e.g coal, gas, diesel) as mom raw material; hence thus type is called steam or thermal power station. Other power stations make use of water falls or storage haves – hence called hydro electric power station: etc.<br/>No mater the type of the power station employed, the voltage generated is usually in a low level e.g 11KV or 25KV. Owing to the distance between the centre of energy dim and (consumption areas) to the power stations, transmission system of energy times into play. A high voltage is desirable for transmitting large power in order to decrease the 12R losses and reduce the amount of conductor material. Therefore, a transformer is employed to step up the generated voltage to 3300KV/ the highest National Grid voltage although effort are being made to increase it to 765KV for transmission. This 330KV is transmuted to the distribution ends. A very much however voltage, on the other hand, is required for distribution, for various reasons connected with safely and convenience. The transformer also mavies this easily and economically possible as the 330KV is stepped down to 132KV, 66KV, 33KV, 11KV, 415KV and to a minimum level of 240V for distribution to various load centre (consumption area).</p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND</strong><br/>The device to increase (step up) or decrease (step down) the generated voltage is called the transformer. It is a static (stationary) alternating consent machine.<br/>Basically, transformers are classified according to purpose namely:- power transformer, distribution transformer, Auto-transformer and instrument transformer, power transformer are large transformers generally used at generating stations to step up the voltage, and at the substations to step d0wn the voltage for supplying distribution systems. They may also be used for tionving together two power stations. The power transformer has a high utilization factor, e.g it is arranged that they run with an almost constant load which is equal to their rating. The maximum efficiency is designed to be at fall load. This means that the fall-load winding losses must be equal to the here losses.<br/>According to common usage, a transformer rated over 500KVA is termed a power transformer.<br/>The distribution transformer has a intermittent and variable head which is usually considerable less than fall-head rating. They are therefore, designed to have their maximum efficiency at between half and three – quarter of fall head.<br/>The instrument transformers are of two types depending on the mode of operation voltage or current transformers. The current (series) and voltage (shunt) transformers are used for extending the range of a.c. instruments in preference to shunts and series resistors.</p> <p><strong>1.2 THE AIM OF STUDY</strong><br/>The aim of our study is to design and construct an auto-transformer which can step-down 240V from the local supply down to 110V, 80V, 12V, 6V, to sent the various voltage requirements of numerous electrical and electronic appliances, often appliances imported from say America where the domestic voltage level is 110Volts.<br/>This auto-transformer can conveniently do at a relatively cheap cost or rate. The output of this transformer is made by making numerous tapping on the primary winding depending on the required output. <br/><br/><strong>1.3 SCOPE OF STUDY</strong><br/>The scope of our study is committed to 1KVA auto-transformer (stepdown) that has these tappings as follows 110V, 80V 12V, 6V. In view of this any other thin out side this topic would not be considered. <br/>Because of the various voltage levels on the secondary, it can be used to supply voltage to American equipment at 110V, for welding machines and electronic equipment at 12V, 6V and 80V, and for barberry charging at 6V or 12V.</p> <p><strong>1.4 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>Transformer: A transformer is alternating current machine which is usual to increase (step-up) or decrease (step down) voltage (a.c).<br/>Auto- Transformer: This is a transformer with single winding.

The queuing delay is the time a job waits in a queue until it can be executed. It is a key component of network delay. The possible factors, arrangements, and processes related to queue is known as queuing theory.  </p> <p>In this report, the queue concerns ‘queue monitoring and control’ in regards to human beings. Although, the device can be used for any other applications such as monitoring and controlling vehicles in a fuel refilling station queue. Therefore, this project will simply be defined as a queue management electronic device specially designed to be used to monitor and control queues in an organization. Queues of people form in various situations and locations in a queue area. The process of queue formation and propagation is defined as queuing theory. The picture below illustrates people standing in a queue where the queue management system is been installed.</p> <p><strong>Fig 1.1: Illustration of People Standing in a Queue.</strong></p> <p>The system consists of a denouncing switch which serves an input transducer, microcontroller unit, seven segment display unit for queue information display, a buzzer for call up alarm and a regulated DC power supply unit. The system was designed around a low cost 8 bit microcontroller integrated circuit (IC) and entirely software controlled. The control programs have been developed using assembly language. And, the systems have been tested under different conditions to evaluate its performance.</p> <p><strong>1.2  </strong><strong> Statement of Problem.  </strong></p> <p>It is very hard to manage queue because human beings sometimes can be hard to control. Nobody wants to wait in a queue. In long queues or crowd places, chaos or disorder usually occurs. More especially when waiting time is high are many people are late and wish to be attended before the closing time. This makes people to jump queue and creating problems among themselves. The past queue management devices are very expensive and scarce. Only few organizations can afford it, yet, they have some limitations like size, immoveable and not visible which makes it inconvenience to be use outdoor or for multipurpose. Hence, our project focuses on a portable queue management system to control queue which can be moved from place to place such as in a ticketing counters, school premises and in health consultancy centers, etc.</p> <p>Many organizations have tried to manage queue using manual counting but this method is not effective, transparent, straightforward and visible because people can cheat, be confused or stressed up .Queue always occur in schools when students must enroll on time to avoid late entry, or when they need to collect their examination registration number or receipt to be able to sit for an exam when the exam has started.  Queue can occur in banks where customers are rushing to deposit money, open an account to leave the banking hall for another appointment or when registering for the BVN before the closing date or hour. </p> <p>Public organization can be busy with people who quarrel and jump queues. Customers will complain, scatter the line and leave due to confusion, stress and time wastage. Queues of people form in various situations and locations can seriously cause problem, negatively affect abusiness resulting to fewer sales and loosing valuable customers.Because of the above listed problems, a queue management device has been developed.</p> <p><strong>1.3  </strong><strong>Aims and Objectives</strong></p> <p>The primary aim and objective of this project is to design and construct a portable microcontroller based intelligent queue management systems device to maintain and control queue with order and efficiency.</p> <p>Our objectives are to develop a queue management system that can be moved among places. By using this system, queue in our ICT department can be arranged accordingly. People can wait in a queue and see the next person number being displayed.In order to achieve our objectives, the following sub-objectives were pursued:</p> <p>üTo develop a queuing algorithm for queue management system.</p> <p>üTo have a cost effective, simple and reliable electronic queue-reductionsystem that can assist any organizations or institutions reduce and manage queues.</p> <p>üEliminate quarrel and stress as to satisfy people and makes life more efficient and comfortable.</p> <p><strong>1.4  </strong><strong>Scope of </strong><strong>work</strong></p> <p>The project was divided into two main parts: hardware and software. The hardware emphasized on the architecture and the specifications as well as the circuit connection of the system while the software scope emphasized on the development of the coding which will be programmed to meet the hardware specifications.</p> <p>In this project work, the queue monitoring and control system have been developed for the purpose of controlling queue in the school ICT department, banking halls, hotel  reservation counters, school hostels, ticket counters, insurance companies, customer service centers, etc.</p> <p><strong>1.5  </strong><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>Retailers can use queue monitoring system to reduce queues, making customers happier and also increases sales. By seeing the queuing time they will know when to perform tasks like re-stocking shelves and looking after customers. It also provides managers with evidence that they need resources for more staff at busy periods.Monitoring queues manage the queue in election voting center, saves time and prevent confusion in a queue area. It offers a greater degree of freedom when an organization is attending to their customers since the customer know the number of people currently in a queue.Queue management system can be installed at airport to guide people at the counter where their ticket is called. For example airports, use queue monitoring to see how long people are waiting to go through security, and banks improve their service by measuring queue lengths.It can be used schools, institutions, transportation company, busy super market, or for vehicles in a filling station.Measuring and counting can be particularly useful in situations such as airport security where a large volume of people pass through an area in varying flow patterns and constantly varying physical locations.</p> <p><strong>1.6  </strong><strong> Organization of the work.</strong></p> <p>This project report is written in such a way that each chapter is related to the next as shown in the block diagram below. The organization of the project report is well detailed and vast in its coverage.

A central wireless switch for electrical and electronic appliance is a GSM based online power control switch system that controls the entire appliance in the EEE general office using GSM network. It will act as an embedded system which would monitor and control appliances and other devices locally using built-in input and output peripherals. This device can control the inflow of electricity power supply in a building or turn off the equipments when there is emergency using a GSM cell phone. The device consists of a special arrangement of GSM signal amplifier, PICl2f629 micro controller (the peripherals interface control), capacitors, resistors, diode, regulators and electromagnetic relay to effect power switching. After successful design of the system various sub sections of it were tested for efficiency and proper functioning. The results confirm that the system is ok.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>1 </strong><strong>Background of Study</strong></p> <p>Due to the stress and risk of controlling electrical appliance in the school <br/>building at night, we are motivated to design and build a central wireless <br/>remote switch for the electrical and electronic department. A central wireless switch for electrical and electronic appliance is an electronic device specially designed to use GSM mobile cell phone to shut down electrical power supply to the entire appliance in the EEE general office where there are ugly power situations such as fire outbreak, lightning strikes, switching surges, transients, neutral failure and other abnormal conditions or malfunctions that can destroy lives and properties. Ndubuisi (2011).</p> <p>The system implements the emerging applications of the GSM technology <br/>which enable the users to carry out some task from anywhere in the world via a GSM network. The system is made up of a GSM amplifier unit, PIC12f629 micro controller, power control and a power supply unit. These sub circuits are designed using passive and active electronic components like capacitors, resistors, diode, regulators, transistors, electromagnetic relay, microcontroller and battery.</p> <p> New age of technology has redefined communication; Most people nowadays have access to mobile phones and thus the world indeed has become a global village. At any given moment, any particular individual can be contacted with the mobile phone. But the application of mobile phone cannot just be restricted to sending SMS or starting conversations. New innovations and ideas can be generated from it that can further enhance its capabilities. Technologies such as Infra-red, Bluetooth, etc which has developed in recent years goes to show the very fact that improvements are in fact possible and these improvements have eased our life and the way we live. Remote management of several homes, offices and the school appliances is a subject of growing interest and in recent years, we have seen many systems providing such controls. Appliances of a certain location <br/>are eliminated with the use of this system. These days, apart from supporting voice calls a mobile phone can be used to send text messages as well as multimedia messages (that may contain pictures, graphics, animations, etc).</p> <p>Sending written text messages is very popular among mobile phone users. Instant messaging, as it is also known, allows quick transmission of short messages that allow an individual to share ideas, opinions and other relevant information. We have used the very concept to design a system that acts as a platform to receivemessages which in fact are commands sent to control different appliances and devices connected to the platform. We have designed a control system which is based on the GSM technology that effectively allows control from a remote area to the desired location. The application of our suggested system is immense in the ever changing technological world. It allows a greater degree of freedom to an individual whether it is controlling their appliances or office equipments. Shizhuang (2007)</p> <p>There is no need to be physically present in order to control. I have implored the use of both hardware and software to bring about the entire project. The hardware components are solely coordinated by the micro controller chip while the c programming language is used to program the chip.</p> <p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>2 Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>Surge may occur in power line which may damaged a lot of <br/>sensitive electrical and electronic appliances in various homes and offices. When the occurrence is not being solved or controlled it may lead to sudden explosion and fire outbreaks. And in most cases the users of the electrical appliance are busy and may not be close to switch-off the appliances when surge occurs. Also, it is also stressful to do the monitoring and switching off the load. Hence, the need for using a remotely controlled device for electrical appliances so as to be able to control the appliances for safety.</p> <p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>3 Aim and Objectives</strong></p> <p>This project focuses on design and construction of a central wireless switch that controls the entire appliances for electrical and electronic engineering general office. Therefore, the specific objectives are as follows;</p> <p>1. To design a device that controls electrical and electronic appliances.</p> <p>2. To provide a wireless system that can switch off and on electrical and electronic appliances</p> <p>3. To design and construct a system that uses GSM network for control of the entire appliances for electrical and electronic engineering general office</p> <p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>4 Scopes </strong><strong>of Work</strong></p> <p>The central wireless switch for electrical and electronic appliances project uses GSM network to cover a wide area of operation but it is limited to network failure and airtime subscription.</p> <p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>5 Major Constraints</strong></p> <p>Along the course of project completion we encountered various problems <br/>and obstacles. Not everything that we had planned went smoothly during the project development span. Also we had a limited amount of time for its <br/>completion so we were under a certain amount of pressure as well. We had to start from the research phase at the beginning and needed to gain knowledge on all the devices and components that we had intended to use for our project. Other phases of the project included coding, debugging, testing, documentation and implementation and it needed certain time for completion so we really had to manage the limited time available to us and work accordingly to finish the project within the schedule. One of the major constraints of this project is the funding and sourcing of some components like the signal transistors and microcontroller chip used.</p> <p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>6 Constraints Considerations</strong></p> <p>The following is a list of constraint Considerations</p> <p>o                   The controlled appliances will need an electrical control interface. This system is only capable of controlling electrical devices.</p> <p>o                   The control module will need to be shielded against electrostatic discharges. This will increase the reliability of the system.</p> <p>o                   Battery backup for controlling unit can be implemented in case of power disruption.</p> <p>·       <strong>Technology Considerations: </strong>The considerations for this system will include a choice of networks, communication protocols and interfaces.</p> <p>·       <strong>Cellular Networks: </strong>The widely available networks are based on <strong>GSM. </strong>This network provides wide area coverage and can be utilized more cost-effectively for this project.</p> <p>·       <strong>Communication Protocols:</strong> The available communication protocol that we have used is SMS. The SMS is the most efficient because this project requires a cellular communication and limited data to be sent.</p> <p>·       I/O interfaces between microcontroller and devices: Serial I/O is considered as options for connection between the GSM receiver and the micro controller. Using the micro controller, a control circuit will be implemented to control the electrical appliances.</p> <p><strong>1.7 Significance </strong><strong>of the </strong><strong>Project</strong></p> <p>This project when realized will;</p> <p>1.                 Help to save electricity bill and protects your electrical appliances <br/>simply by remote controlling of the appliance any day any time.</p> <p>2.                 Reduce the stress that is preventing people from going to switch off their appliances when not in used.</p> <p>3.                 Give a fast turning off of appliances during power surge or any electrical faults in the building.</p> <p>4.                 Serves as a lasting solution to the electricity problems that <br/>usually occur when people forget to put off their appliances. It gives a fast response to power control.</p> <p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>8 Limitation of the project.</strong></p> <p>The project has certain limitations and a list of such is mentioned below: -</p> <p>A.   The receiver must reside in a location where a signal with sufficient.Strength can be received from a cellular phone network.</p> <p>B.   Only devices with electrical controlling input ports will be possible targets for control.</p> <p>C.   Operation of the controlling unit is only possible through a cell phone with SMS messaging and calls capabilities.</p> <p>D.   The Controlling unit must be able to receive and decode SMS messages or calls.</p> <p><strong>1.9 Report Organization</strong></p> <p>The remaining parts of this project report are organized as follows: In <br/>Chapter two, the past and current research on the systems is briefly overviewed. This is done in order to justify the topic of this project, and to <br/>show that a research gap exists. Chapter three presents the system design <br/>module by module. Here, the structure of the device is discussed in detail. <br/>Chapter four describes the integration and testing of the project</p>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A CENTRAL WIRELESS SWITCH THAT CONTROLS THE ENTIRE APPLIANCES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A CENTRAL WIRELESS SWITCH THAT CONTROLS THE ENTIRE APPLIANCES", "id": 68}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1             </strong><strong>Background of The project</strong></p> <p>The increase rate of epileptic power supply especially in tropical African countries where Nigeria forms a part has become a major concern. The power supply instability in developing countries creates a need to device means for alternative power sources. The automation of electrical power generation or alternative sources of power to back up the utility supply could lead to power stability. This automation becomes necessary as the rate of power outage becomes predominantly high. The residence, commercial and industries dependent on generators and public power change-over between these two power supplying sources are manual, human error during change-over connections may occur; leading to machine damage, electric shock/electrocution as well as increased down time consequently introducing massive losses (Mazur and Rocks, 2010). However, when automation takes place between the mains supply and generator it will automatically switch from mains to the generator when there is power failure by starting generator and cut off the generator switching to the mains when there is public power. This help to reduce down time thereby maintaining constant power supply.</p> <p><strong>1.2        </strong><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Nowadays securing constant power supply is becoming more important. In Nigeria, power supply for domestic use, commercial and industries is highly unstable. The applications of alternative sources are associated with challenge of switching smoothly and timely between the mains supply and the alternative sources whenever there is power failure on the mains source. The use of an automatic changeover switch with generator cut off and starter eliminate the stress encountered when switching from mains supply to generator Vis visa and reduce time loss for increase productivity.</p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong>Aim and Objectives</strong></p> <p>This project focuses on the design and construction of an automatic change-over switch with generator cut off and starter.</p> <p>Hence, the specific objectives are as follow;</p> <p>1.  To provide a system that automatically switches on the generator and switch over the load to the generator whenever there is mains power failure.</p> <p>2.  To provide a device that automatically switches over to mains supply once restored and simultaneously switches off the generator.</p> <p><strong>1.4     </strong><strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The scope of this project is centered the on the design and construction of a change-over switch with cut off and starter of a generator with a capacity of 3.5 KVA.</p> <p>The project is designed for power supply applications. It involves automatic changeover between the main power supply and an auxiliary power supply, such as a generator. The project implements an automatic switching or starting of the power generator whenever the main power fails.</p> <p><strong>1.5     </strong><strong>Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>The automatic changeover switch with generator cut off and starter does not function with a faulty generating set.</p> <p>It does not function with generators that have a manual starter which is a sine quo non to the function of the automatic change-over.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The significance of this work cannot be overemphasized. Therefore, benefits that are associated to the change-over switch are;</p> <p>1.  It minimizes damages to lives and equipment since it has its own monitoring system and its switching requires no human contact with the switch, thus eliminating human error.</p> <p>2.  It reduces change-over time to a minimum, due to its fast response to power restoration.</p> <p>3.  It maintains high quality of service through its fast and prompt response.</p> <p>4.  Moreover, the unit is portable, easy, convenient and safe to install.</p>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN AUTOMATIC CHANGE-OVER SWITCH WITH GENERATOR CUT OFF AND STARTER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN AUTOMATIC CHANGE-OVER SWITCH WITH GENERATOR CUT OFF AND STARTER", "id": 69}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Inductive power transmission has become a more and more popular method to deliver power to mobile electronic devices and small appliances with a power consumption of up to 100W [1]. In its large meaning, inductive power transfer can take the form of electricity, light, heat or even sound and wind. The inductive power transfer involves a starting point (source) and an ending point (receiver) without intermediate material that would be intentionally added to achieve some purpose. In the scope of this thesis, the starting and ending points are both characterized by electric energy, with in between no additional wires or material.</p> <p>Light energy transfer can be obtained by photons travel from a source such as the sun or a laser, to a receiver that is generally a photovoltaic cell. The advantage of the laser as a source is that it provides a very directional illumination thanks to its high degree of temporal and spatial coherence. However, the efficiency of light energy transfer is very low, because the losses at each step of the transfer processes are important, namely in the source, in the air and in the receiver. Furthermore, the economical aspects are not attractive [45]. For these reasons, light energy is interesting only for applications that require a transfer over a very large distance, for example in the space.</p> <p>The microwaves can also transfer energy over a relatively large distance that can be greater than the emitter and receiver sizes. They are electromagnetic waves ranging from 1 GHz to 300 GHz and are used for far-field energy transfer [83]. The most common source for domestic applications is the magnetron thanks to its unexpensive cost, but high frequency waves can be also generated by antennas. The receiver is a rectenna which is actually an antenna with a rectifier used to convert microwaves into DC electricity. The main drawbacks of this technology are the health risks and the relatively low efficiency that can be obtained.</p> <p>The most used way to transfer contactless energy is the magnetic induction whose principle is shown in Fig. 1.1. It uses near-field electromagnetic waves in the range of frequencies between 10 kHz and a few MHz. The characteristic distance of transfer is the same order as the size of the receiver (secondary coil) and the emitter (primary coil). Such inductive power transfer systems are based on the coreless transformers theory. The working principle consists in applying a high frequency current in a primary coil. In the surrounding air, it generates a magnetic field that induces a voltage to a secondary coil if placed in proximity. It is necessary to operate at high frequency because coreless transformers suffer from weak mutual coupling. To enhance the coupling between primary and secondary, both coils must be well aligned and the air gap must be as small as possible. With this description, a distinction can be made between inductive inductive power transfer and RFID systems.</p> <p>Indeed, the former involves a transfer of power through a relatively short distance as defined above, while the latter is used to transfer information (with power generally lower than 100mW) through a large distance.</p> <p><strong>Figure 1.1: Principle of Inductive Power Transfer</strong></p> <p><strong>1.2 Scope of the thesis</strong></p> <p><strong>1.2.1 Historical context and current state</strong></p> <p>Nicola Tesla proposed the first theories of inductive power transfer in 1899-1900. He carried out various wireless transmission and reception experiments through air or matter. At his Colorado Springs laboratory, he experimented for example a remote supply of 200 light bulbs through the ground from a distance of about 40 km [14].</p> <p>The first reported researches on the so-called energy transport by inductive coupling date from the 1960s [71]. Although the principle of inductive inductive power transfer was known for a long time, this technology has remained immature for a long time as the first industrial applications appear in the 1990s with the electric toothbrushes. Even nowadays the number of electric devices supplied by inductive power transfer is relatively low. This absence is probably due to the lack of standards and regulations for this technology, and also to the uncertainty from the average population concerning the inherent health dangers.</p> <p>In 1998, a scientific committee has published general guidelines [25] to avoid any kind of health risks concerning the exposure of the population to electromagnetic fields. Basically these recommendations provide the restrictions for the public exposure as a function of the operating frequency, the immersed body proportion and the size of the coils. However, in practice, they are not relevant according to [10]. Therein, a study on the maximum power transfer, based on these restrictions, shows that common applications including coils size of 40mmto 100mmcould transfer no more than about 30mW, which is roughly two orders of magnitude lower than existing products on the market.</p> <p><strong>1.2.2 Technical and industrial background</strong></p> <p>More and more electric applications require an energy transfer without wires and contacts.</p> <p>Especially in the domain of desktop applications such as computer peripherals, wireless technologies (Bluetooth, ZigBee, RF, IR,WiFi) that allow transfer of information are very trendy, while the supplying process uses massively wires or batteries. In a desktop environment, removing the cables between the power source and electronic devices would be convenient. It would allow to gain a certain amount of place and to clean the surface from wires pollution.</p> <p>In this context, the contactless energy transfer by inductive coupling meets more and more success. Some products are already available for a few applications, such as mice or mobile phones. However, a full platform enabling to supply simultaneously several consumers is still not to be reported.</p> <p>In the framework of collaboration between Logitech SA and the Laboratory of Integrated Actuators (LAI), inductive power transfer systems are studied for notebook and desktop applications. This collaboration is divided into two different practical applications:</p> <p>1. The <strong>inductive notebook charger </strong>is aiming to realize the prototype of a inductive power transfer system from a platform to a static notebook. The said platform is a product already available on the market under the commercial name <em>Alto </em>(Fig. 1.2);</p> <p>2. The <strong>Inductive Power Transfer</strong><strong> table </strong>is aiming to realize a prototype of a inductive power transfer system embedded in a table in order to supply multiple desktop peripherals.</p> <p>Logitech [9] is a Swiss company developing and marketing products such as peripheral devices for PCs, including mice, keyboards, loudspeakers, microphones and webcams. They are responsible in the above-mentioned projects for providing the equipment and sharing their know-how on hardware and manufacturing of electronic peripherals.</p> <p>Figure 1.2: Pictures of the <em>Alto </em>platform. (a) Without notebook [1]. (b) With notebook [2].</p> <p><strong>1.2 Problem of Statement</strong></p> <p>Inductive power transfer systems can be classified into two categories. The first one concerns fixed position systems wherein the devices to be supplied are static. The second one concerns the free position systems involving devices that can be freely moved on the charging surface. With such a definition, it is obvious that the inductive notebook charger belongs to the first one and the Inductive power transfer table to the second one.</p> <p><strong>1.3.1 Fixed position systems</strong></p> <p>The fixed position system is the simplest inductive Inductive power transfer method. Nowadays, it involves almost all the existing industrial applications. It usually charges one load and the energy is transferred from a single primary coil to a single secondary coil. Furthermore, both coils have to be approximatively the same size and well aligned to ensure a good mutual coupling, a sufficient amount of transferred energy and a good efficiency.</p> <p><strong>Induction cookers</strong></p> <p>Fixed Inductive power transfer is traditionally the method used in induction cookers, except that the secondary coil is replaced by the cooking vessel made of ferromagnetic and conductive metal. The initial researches and patents date from the early 1900s, but the first production of induction cookers was performed in the 1970s by the <em>Westinghouse Electric Corporation</em>[15].</p> <p>The principle of the induction heating is shown in Fig. 1.3. The magnetic field generated by the primary coil creates Eddy currents in the pot that cause the heating Joule effect. The wires of the primary coils generally exhibit a flat and spread geometry in order to enhance the distribution of the magnetic field that reaches the cooking vessel. The transferred power is in the order of 1 to 2 kW and the operating frequency is situated in a range from 20 kHz to 50 kHz.</p> <p><strong>Figure 1.3: Principle of an induction cooker</strong></p> <p><strong>Electric toothbrushes</strong></p> <p>Inductive power transfer is interesting for applications that require no exposed electrical contacts, such as devices that are used in a moist environment or even immersed in water. Since the early 1990s, rechargeable toothbrushes (for example from the Oral-B brand [7]) use this technology that allows to enclose and therefore fully insulate the wires. It gives the advantage to protect the user against electric shocks due to apparent contacts and to prevent short-circuits that could damage electronics. The system generally includes a ferromagnetic core that increases the coupling between the coils. The operating frequency is around 10 kHz or more, and the transferred power is between 10 and 15W. Similar inductive power transfer systems are also integrated into electric shavers.</p> <p><strong>Desktop peripherals and mobile phones</strong></p> <p>The first inductive power transfer studies dedicated to mobile phones were realized in the early 2000s. For example, the prototype of a small platform allowing recharging a mobile phone battery is proposed in [33]. A picture of the prototype is given in Fig. 1.4(a). The coreless transformer is made of printed circuit board (PCB) coils that have to be precisely aligned to start the charging process.</p> <p>The operating frequency is ranged between 920 and 980 kHz, and the power transferred to the battery is 3.3W, but the transformer has been tested to transfer up to 24W.</p> <p>More recently, many desktop applications have been marketed. An example of existing inductive power transfer application is the battery-free optical mouse from A4 Tech [8] (<em>c.f.</em>Fig. 1.4(b)). Instead of batteries, the mouse uses inductive CET to provide energy via the included mouse pad, which is connected to a computer USB port. Mice are very low powered devices, generally the amount of transferred power is less than 1W. In a similar way, the HP Touchstone is a small Dock station powered by the USB port and can transfer the power (5W) to recharge a phone or a Palm device [6].</p> <p>Concerning systems involving inductive power transfer to multiple devices, many products are commercially available. They remain in this category of fixed position charging because they do not offer the possibility to supply the devices freely placed on the whole surface, but only at predefined places. For example, the first inductive power transfer table developed by Fulton Innovation under the denomination of eCoupledallows transferring power to multiple but fixed devices [5]. This application has the ability to communicate with the devices thanks to a process specifically developed by Fulton, which allows transferring the exact amount of power required by each load on the platform.</p> <p>The common points to these applications are the low power devices that they can supply (generally less than 5W), the predetermined position of the devices on the platform and the integrated intelligence that detects and recognizes the devices.</p> <p><strong>Figure 1.4: (a) One of the first prototypes involving an inductive power transfer system to charge a mobile phone [34]. (b) Inductively charged mouse from A4 Tech [8]. (c) Portable Powermat station that allows to charge up to three devices simultaneously.</strong></p> <p><strong>Electric vehicles</strong></p> <p>A new niche market that may explode in the future for fixed positioning inductive power transfer systems is the electric vehicles charging. Many researches are ongoing in this domain [49], prototypes are being tested by Siemens or BMW [4], and some applications are on the verge to be commercially available [19]. For instance, the typical specifications for a prototype consist of transferring a power of 30 kW to the vehicle battery. The operating frequency is 20 kHz. The main issue here comes from the large airgap of 45mmwhichmakes the coupling low.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Thesis structure</strong></p> <p>The thesis presents the design and modeling of inductive power transfer system.</p> <p>It is divided into six main chapters in addition to the introduction and conclusion. In the present chapter is given a general introduction on inductive power transfer system with a state of the art of the field and the main objectives of the thesis research.</p> <p>Chapter 2 is dedicated to the modeling of the coreless transformers. First the “magnetic” part of the modeling allows to calculate resistances and inductances of the coils based on the geometry of the coreless transformers. Then the “electric” part allows to determine power magnitudes, current and voltage intensities, based on the resolution of an equivalent electric circuit of coreless transformers. Concepts of resonance and reactive power compensation are introduced then.</p> <p>Chapter 3 deals with the high frequency effects in the coils. After defining the problem and providing the main inherent hypotheses to resolve it, two methods to compute the AC resistances that vary with the frequency are provided. The first one is based on the resolution Of Maxwell’s equations in a particular case, and the second one is derived from finite-element method (FEM) simulations. The issue of losses in the coils is then addressed and the impact of the high frequency is discussed.</p> <p>Chapter 4 is probably the most important one because it provides innovative tools to design and optimize different inductive power transfer systems. In the first part, a sensitivity analyzis of the main parameters of coreless transformers is presented. This allows to identify the ones that need to be optimized, as well as their variation range. In the second part, the optimization method itself is described. The main concepts of genetic algorithms and, in particular, multi-objective genetic algorithms are introduced. The implementation of a new algorithm based on a very common one (called NSGA-II) is then presented. It integrates notably several improvements that make it highly efficient. It is then tested with some often-used functions for multi-objective algorithms evaluation, and successfully applied to different inductive power transfer system problems.</p> <p>Chapter 5 presents the different prototypes built during this thesis work. The design the electronics are discussed in details. Notably, for the inductive power transfer system table, the strategy used to control the detection and the local activation of the table is thoroughly presented.</p> <p>Chapter 6 ends with a general overview of the results obtained in this thesis. The perspectives and main contributions are also analyzed.</p>\n\nMODELLING AND CONTROL OF INDUCTIVE POWER TRANSFER SYSTEM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MODELLING AND CONTROL OF INDUCTIVE POWER TRANSFER SYSTEM", "id": 70}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This project is on design and construction of transformer rewinding machine with digital counter. A coil winding machine is a machine for winding coil onto a spool, bobbin and many more. This coil winding machine is one of types of winding machine that available in industries today. From multi speeded machines to medium, large and extra-large machines, these machines come in various types and categories, performing a range function. The common applications for a coil winding machine are to wind coils for transformer, inductors, motor and chokes. To complete a coil using manual coil winding machine will be inconvenience and waste of time. Therefore, fabrication of coil winding machine will be done in this project which is controlled by one stepper motor using software program.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background of the Project</strong></p> <p>Typically, a winding machine winds a material such as metal wire, thread, or paper, onto a core, spool, or bobbin. There are several different types of winding machines, from simple manual feed machines to complex computer-numeric-control (CNC) machines. Some of the more common uses for winding machines are coil winding, rope winding, and continuous filament winding. Many industries use these devices, including textile, electronics, and wire industries (Pansini, 2009).</p> <p>A manual winding machine usually has a core on a spindle and the user feeds wire, rope, or other material onto the core. The user controls the spindle speed and feeds the material through user hand, guiding it to control the tension and load pattern. These simple machines may be of a bench-top size or large stand-alone winder.  Winding machines may be used for transformer or motor (Henry, 2011).</p> <p>Transformer rewinding machine is a machine for rewinding coil in a transformer. This transformer rewinding machine is one of types of winding machine that is available in industries today. The transformer rewinding machine can be classified according to speed levels and capacity. From multi speeded machines to medium, large and extra-large machines, these machines come in various types and categories, performing a range function and can be manual, automatic, analogue or digital (Peri, 2010).</p> <p>Transformer rewinding machine with digital display design is dictated by a coil’s complexity, material tension limitations, machine versatilities, and automation/operator intervention, production volume and budgetary considerations (Bill, 2013).</p> <p><strong>1.2 Problem Statement</strong></p> <p>The problem to be solved in this project will include;</p> <p>1. The design an automatic transformer rewinding machine</p> <p>2. Integrating a digital counter into the transformer rewinding machine</p> <p>3. Sourcing of local components for construction of automatic transformer rewinding machine</p> <p>4. Production of a user friendly and easy to operate automatic transformer rewinding machine</p> <p><strong>1.3 Objectives of the project</strong></p> <p>The aim of this project is to design and construct a transformer rewinding machine with digital counter.</p> <p>Basically, this project has four main objectives;</p> <p>1. To design an automatic transformer rewinding machine</p> <p>2. To integrate a digital counter into the transformer rewinding machine</p> <p>3. To source local components for construction of automatic transformer rewinding machine</p> <p>4. To produced a user friendly and easy to operate automatic transformer rewinding machine</p> <p><strong>1.4 Scope and Limitation </strong></p> <p>The design of the machine will be limited to a table size winding machine. This study limited its scope for winding coils of small transformers of about 12KV with an input voltage of 220v-5v dc and an output voltage of 5v,the number of turns the machine can wind is in the range of 0-999 turns . The size of the copper wire for winding other machines like large turbine, heavy transformers e.t.c that has 14 to 34 SWG or specifically 0.078-0.3125 diameter copper wire is beyond the machine capability. Specifically indoor appliances commonly found in household like electric fan, grinder.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Importance of the Project</strong></p> <p>The significance of this project cannot be overemphasized this is because it would serve as a low cost machine when produced in bulk. And this will aid the small business man who cannot afford to buy the bigger machine by affording this one. Also it can be used for training students in winding of small transformers &amp; relay coils.</p>\n\nTRANSFORMER REWINDING MACHINE WITH DIGITAL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " TRANSFORMER REWINDING MACHINE WITH DIGITAL", "id": 71}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This project is on design and construction of a three phase automatic changeover switch with generator starter and cut-off. <br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Public power supply is a major contributor to economic development in every nation. In developing nations like Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire and underdeveloped parts of the world, the public power supply for industrial, commercial and domestic use is highly unstable (Peter,2002). This has negative effect on the economy in such that most of them had to depend on frequent use of alternative power sources such as generator, inverter, solar to meet up with the energy demands. One of the common alternate sources depended on is the use of generator set which is usually connected to a changeover switch and the public power supply also connected to the switch also. The application of alternative sources of power supply is being faced with the challenge of switching smoothly and timely between the mains supply and the generator supply whenever there is power failure on the mains source and vice versa. (Ransorne,2009).</p> <p>Automatic Changeover switch with generator cut off and starter is one of the electrical devices that can aid smooth switching from public supply to generator and vice versa. It automatically switches from one power source to another. When there is power failure in the public supply it starts the generator and switches to the supply (generator) and it equally switches over to the mains supply when power is restored and turns off the generator automatically. The automatic power changeover switch with generator cut off and starter is a device that links the load and mains supply or the alternative supply together. This enables the use of either the mains supply or an alternative source when there is outage on the mains source without the user intervention.</p> <p>The changeover switch can either come in with three phase or single phase. This device maintains constant power supply to the load by automatically activating the generator when there is need. Since the user might not always be in need of the generator, provision has been made to prevent the generator from starting should an outage occur.</p> <p>Therefore, in view of these considerations, the project aimed at designing and constructing a workable automatic change-over switch with generator cut off and starter functions.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Problem Statement</strong></p> <p>The frequent of power outages in developing countries like the case of Nigeria creates a need for automation of electrical power generation or alternative sources of power to back up the utility supply. This automation becomes important since the rate of power outage becomes predominantly high. Most industries and commercial processes are partly dependent on generators and public power supply which is epileptic especially in Nigeria. Therefore, if the processes of power change-over between these two power supplying sources are manual, human error during change-over leading to machine damage, electric shock/electrocution as well as increased down time consequently introducing massive losses. However, if the starting of the generator is automatically done by a relay which switches the battery voltage to ignition coil of the generator while the main power relay switches the load to either public supply or generator, the down time would greatly be reduce thereby maintaining the tempo of production. In view of the background, this project tends to focus on the design and construction of an automatic changeover switch with generator cut off and starter.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Aim and Objectives</strong></p> <p>       This project is centered on design and construction of an automatic change-over switch with generator cut off and starter. However, the specific objectives are as follow;</p> <p>1. To design a device that automatically switches on the generator and switch over the load to the generator whenever<br/>there is mains power failure.</p> <p>2. To sort and examine various components to be used for the construction of automatic changeover switch</p> <p>3. To design and integrate the sub-units of the automatic changeover switch</p> <p>4. To carryout a test on the sub-units design of the automatic changeover switch</p> <p><strong>1.4 Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The scope of this project is focus on designing and construction of a change-over switch with cut off and starter of a generator with the capacity of 3.5KVA. It also revolves around a project that is designed for power supply applications. It involves automatic changeover between the main power supply and an auxiliary power supply, such as a generator. The project implements an automatic switching or starting of the power generator whenever the main power fails.  </p> <p><strong>1.5 Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>       Some of the limitations of the automatic changeover design are;</p> <p>1. The design cannot function with a generator that is not auto-start.</p> <p>2. It does not function properly for a generator higher than 3KVA.</p> <p>3. The design of the automatic changeover switch with cut off and starter does not function with a faulty generating set</p> <p>4. The design will not function properly when there is no engine stopper in the generator.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The significance of this work cannot be overemphasized. Therefore, benefits that are associated to the change-over switch are;<br/>1. It minimizes damages to lives and equipment since it has its own monitoring system and its switching requires no human contact with the switch, thus eliminating human error.</p> <p>2. It reduces change-over time to a minimum, due to its fast response to power restoration</p> <p>3. It maintains high quality of service through its fast and prompt response.</p> <p>4. Moreover, the unit is portable, easy, convenient and safe to install.</p> \n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A THREE PHASE AUTHOMATIC CHANGE OVER SWITCH WITH GENERATOR STARTER AND CUT-OFF<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A THREE PHASE AUTHOMATIC CHANGE OVER SWITCH WITH GENERATOR STARTER AND CUT-OFF", "id": 72}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.1            <strong> INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The light sensitive alarm is an electronic circuit that detects a sudden shadow falling on the light sensor and sounds the bleeper. When this happens, the circuit will respond to gradual charges in brightness to avoid false alarm. The beeper sounds for only a short time to prevent the battery from running flat. Normal light can be use. The circuit will work best if a beam of light is made to fall on the light sensor. Breaking this beam will then cause the bleeper to sound. The light sensor is a light dependent resistor (LDR); this has a low resistance in bright light and a high resistance in dim light. The light sensitivity of the circuit can be adjusted by varying the 100kiloohms (K) preset. The length of bleep can be varied from 0.5 to 10 seconds using 1 milliohm (M) preset. using the 7555 low power timer ensures that the circuit draws very little current of about 0.5 milli-Amps except for the short time when the bleeper is sounding, this uses 7 milli-Amps. If the circuit is switch on continuously, an alkaline 9V battery should last for about a month.</p> <p>1.2             <strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The project is actually designed to promote high level of security in workshops, industries and home. It enhances a recorded indication of visitors and to summon staff or personnel to fulfill a service as in domestic and industrial use.</p> <p>1.3            <strong> PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to provide maximum security round the world.</p> <p>1.4            <strong> SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This project “light sensitive alarm” is design mainly to alert the user by a bleeper when the circuit detects a sudden shadow falling on the light sensor the bleeper duration can be controlled by varying the I ohms – preset resistor.</p> <p>1.5            <strong> LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The limitations of this study are: the bleeper sound for only a short time to prevent the battery from running flat. If there is any little mistake during soldering, there will not work well. Also by met being able to purchase some components and their exact value couple with transportation problems has also gone a long way to reduce the efficiency of this project.</p> <p>1.6             <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>This project helps to provide security in offices, hotels, homes etc. it also promotes and encourage researches involving in security research projects.</p>\n\nTHE CONSTRUCTION OF A LIGHT SENSITIVE ALARM SYSTEM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE CONSTRUCTION OF A LIGHT SENSITIVE ALARM SYSTEM", "id": 73}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>A wireless signal jammer is a device that blocks the transmission by createing interference. This wireless signal jammer can be classified as Radio Frequency Interference (RF) and GSM jammer. A radio frequency jammer is a device used to disrupt or prevent communication through a broadcast RF signal. It is a GSM RF frequency and disruptive commonly known as broadband radio frequency (RF) and GSM Cell Phone Jammer. Simultaneously, they can block commercial band FM broadcast (87.5 MHz to 108 MHz) and GSM signal transmission within the transmission range of the jammer. The device can block these frequencies by transmitting a dirty signal (such as noise) on the same frequency at which the GSM system and radio operates. A radio frequency jammer is a device that emits a radio frequency signal on the same frequency at which the radio system operates and manages the interference when the radio stations in the area where the interferer is located are disabled. A GSM interferer is a device which emits a signal on the same frequency with which operates the GSM. Jamming succeeds when mobile phones in the area where is located the jammer are disabled. Recently, when the bombs are planted and triggered by GSM or radio frequency signals, this device may be an advantage by scrambling the signals necessary for the detonation of the bomb. Currently, mobile jamming devices become civilian products rather than electronic warfare devices, because with the growing number of mobile phone users from the need to turn off mobile phones in particular places where the ringing cell phone would be disruptive increased. These locations include places of worship, university classrooms, libraries, concert halls, meeting rooms and other places where silence is appreciated. The solution to these annoying noises and disturbing is to install a device that can block the transmission of the signal from mobile phones and radio and thus disrupt the trigger bombs by these wireless signals.</p>\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF A RADIO FREQUENCY GSM SIGNAL JAMMER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONSTRUCTION OF A RADIO FREQUENCY GSM SIGNAL JAMMER", "id": 74}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>A<strong>BSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The project work titled Design and construction of a metal detector. When fully design and implemented would be able to detect any metallic material that is passing or coming close. This function would serve as a security check for dangerous metallic material as an alarm. Going by the sophisticated means of armed rubbers adopt these days in the breaking into bank supermarkets offices and highly secured area. No security system will be optimized or complete without the installation of metal detector. This will stop or reduce to the bearest minimum the activities of men of the underworld. The device we then build we function as a metal detector that can scout out metal objects, such as coins, nails, keys such as car keys you may not be able to fine, and even gold if you’re looking for it in a beach (through this one may not have industrial strenght). This metal detector can detect certain kinds of metal- especially iron –containing metals, which are called ferrous meat, even if under a half-inch of drywell or sand.           </p> <p><strong>TABLE

Study</strong></p> <p>It has been observed that the rapid growth in the technological knowledge across the world has been accompanied by a rapid rise in crime rate. These criminal acts takes the form of breaking of private and official homes and making away with a huge sum of money, valuable and in most cases hosts of lives. The background of this project work comes into play for the removal or minimization of the above criminal act by a way of a METAL DETECTOR, which will be handly or connected to a strategic position in our homes and offices.</p> <p>Detection and clearance are still very often carried out in humanitarian demining ways using manual methods or computer as primary procedure. When operating in this way, detection phase still relies heavily on metal detectors, whereby, each alarm needs to be carefully checked until it has been fully understood or its source removed. This is normally done visually and prodding or excavating the ground. Metal detectors are probably going to remain in use for some time.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Problem Statement</strong></p> <p>Going by the sophisticated means armed robbers adopt these days in breaking into banks, super markets and highly secured areas or the activities of assassins in conference hall, airport, hospital e.g. there are every indication that they are out for the worst and a better way of lessening the harshness of these menace is to get highly alerted security wise. No security system will be optimized or complete without the installation of metal detector. This will stop or reduce barest minimum, the cases of men of the underworld breaking into banks, hotels, conference hall, homes, hospital e.t.c systematically undetected.</p> <p>The exigency of Metal detector involvement in security outfits whether national, sub-national and domestic level cannot be over emphasized.</p> <p>The researcher was motivated to design a project which will demonstrate the undisputable wide use of transistors in field of electronics to produce the kind of sound that should be able to alert people for special attention, and serves as a danger signal in a nutshell.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Objective of the Project</strong></p> <ol><li>To construct a walk through metal detector that is capable of detecting the presence of a metallic device.</li> <li>To the walk through metal detector world also incorporate the functionality of metallic object.</li> <li>The walk through metal detector will be capable of producing an alarm on reception of a metallic object.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4   Significant of the Project</strong></p> <p>The significant of this project is to construct a functional electronic detector security system, which will be beneficial technology to human beings. This project will also bring technology nearer home especially to the student, and to me as the designer, and the contribution in the advancement of technology, thus helping them to assemble, design and construct projects based on simple component and material locally or foreign.</p> <p>Again, this project will encourage indigenous technology and discourage the large expense being made on foreign security systems. All these were born in mind during the assembling, designing construction and casing of this project.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Methodology</strong></p> <p>This system is developed using several electrical and electronic principles. The principle of electromagnetism is a major principle applied. When the coil which serves as the sensor is placed over a metal and the system is switched ON, the electric current passing through the coil makes it magnetic and being placed over a metal, the metal generates a very small voltage (in micro volts) in form of eddy currents. This generated eddy current is received by the sensors and thus it causes a disturbance to the main current flow. The difference is harnessed by electronics and connected to an amplifier from where it is fed into the audio output which serves as the transducer to the system.</p> <p><strong>1.6   Scope of the Project</strong></p> <p>The metal detector designed in this project will make use of technology called Beat Frequency Oscillator (B.F.O). this technology employs two oscillators at resonance and a variation of the frequency of oscillation of one of the oscillators due to the presence of a metallic object would be picked up by a tiny receiver within the control box which creates an audible series of tones (beats) based on the difference between the frequencies.</p> <p><strong>1.7   Project Outline</strong></p> <p>The first chapter of this project write up gives an introduction to the work intended.

Also, a sign utilizing a fixed light source to provide a message  in text, images pictures, and / or symbols that may appear to move or may appear as on/off messages. This is contrast to traditional non-electronic signs where the copy displayed is physically applied to the sign surface by printing, painting or otherwise attaching it onto the sign. The materials or substrate to which the copy is applied is typically paper, wood, plastic or the wall of a building.</p> <p>          In this modern time, solid materials have helped man to show that he really exists by doing wonders in the world of electronics. One major development, made possible by the enormous advances in solid state technology, is the “digital revolution”. Circuits are designed to implement the basic digital logic functions fundamental to all digital systems. Digital electronics therefore comprises the design, manufacture and use of circuits for processing information in digital form (Simpson, 1978).</p> <p>          An information display is a way of providing information and it is also used as an object for promotion. It can be seen in a form of cardboard or tarpaulin at stores / shops, sign posts, placards, notice boards and electronic display boards. But the advent of new technologies has made the information in the form of an electronic display in the world of advertisements and promotions (Gupta, Shukla and Nagwekar, 2013). The ability to display a short message can be useful application to be available for any business. Electronic digital display system is perfect for this application. It can be used for both indoor and outdoor which makes it universal fit for any business or event. Electronic digital display system is very efficient and cost effective way to spread messages to thousands of people, without any personal contact or door to door sales. Light-Emitting Diode (LED) is a solid state light source with several attractive properties for display application. LED is a diode that gives off visible light when forward biased (Mehta and Mehta, 2014). It is chosen as the main component for displaying messages because, today LED is the most energy efficiency example and other useful systems.</p> <p>          The birth of signs and display can be said to be as old as the existence of man on the planet earth. From the beginning of the world, different types of displays have been in use, each mode to serve the purpose of invention efficiently. Signs are any kind of visual graphics created to display information to a particular audience (David, 2013). In 1389, King Richard II ofEnglandcompelled landlords to erect signs outside their premises (Manton, 2008). In ancientRome, signboards were usually made from stone or terracotta (Chris, 1995).</p> <p>          With the advancement in technology, man started carving woods and trees. The use of special dyes on wood as a means of identifying special locations. With the discovery of Bronze and iron, man started using the materials to display sign, thus the advent of metal sign boards were born, which are mostly used in developing countries. On semiconductors and vacuum tubes technology, light displays and sign boards were built to add more beauty in the old system and as a way to increase visibility. LED technology is frequently used in signs now instead of Neon signs, introduced in 1910 at the Paris Motor show (Bellu, 2006). The use of electronic is now  becoming very important. It is extensively applied in almost our day to day activities.</p> <p>          Electronic digital display system is also used for outdoor advertisement. Before, outdoor advertising was mainly characterized by the use of paper. Every bus stop and billboard had a paper advertisement inside. The reason for this was simple paper was easy to use and extremely cheap. It had some draw backs as  well. Before an image is actually on the street, it first has to be printed, pasted and placed. The journey from design to placement is quite long. Another disadvantages is the considerable amount waste generated by the use of paper. Finally, many people ignore a paper advertisement and there attention is drawn to the vibrant environment around them and not  to a still image.</p> <p>          The extent of development in information dissemination has made it possible that the well known method of displaying information using sign posts, notice boards, etc has to be modified by using electronic digital display system. In today’s rapidly advancing technology market, most conventional digital display system are not being implemented using individual logic gates and integrated circuits (ICs) such have been used in the past instead, programmable devices such as microprocessor and microcontroller chips which contain the circuitry necessary to create logic functions are being used to implement digital systems. The use of 555 timer as a stable multivibrator and decade counter (CD4017) can be used to build less expensive electronic display system. The use of these two major ICs will bring about less board space, less power consumptions and overall, low cost in manufacturing.</p> <p>          This project however; emphasizes mainly on the display of information using two major integrated circuits (ICs) namely NE555 timer (ICI) and CD4017 (IC2) to control the lighting of LEDs. This message display circuit is built around readily available, low cost components. It is easy to fabricate. A total of 250 LEDs will be used to display the message “GREAT NIGERIAN STUDENTS”</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>          Due to limitation of the sign board or local sign board which could not display clearly at night expect light shines on it, it is then necessary that electronic display system is employed to counter the limits of the local sign board. The information displayed on the local sign board is less attractive compared to the information displayed using electronic digital display system.</p> <p>          Thus, researchers are prompted to tirelessly hold up to these challenges by initiating some means of improving the above among which is the design and construction of an electronic digital display system.</p> <p><strong>1.3     Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>          The main objective of this study is to design and construct an electronic digital display system. Specifically this study will achieve the following:</p> <p>i        To display “Great Nigerian students”</p> <p>ii       To use the electronic digital display system constructed as a sign post for federal polytechnic, Oko.</p> <p>iii      To have more knowledge on what electronic digital display system is all about.</p> <p>v       To know the benefits of electronic digital display system.</p> <p>v       To design and realize the moving message display panel.</p> <p><strong>1.4     Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>In all field of human endeavour, electronic digital display system plays very vital role, such as means of advertisement, means of communication, presentations, exhibitions, identification and direction. It is also used in giving warning or safety instructions, such as warning signs, traffic signs, exit signs or signs conveying rules and regulations. This project write-up will be a guide to future designing in a related work.</p> <p><strong>1.5     Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This project covers the use of peripheral solid state electronic components alongside with two major integrated circuits (ICs) namely NESSS timer and CD4017 decade counter to solve above stated problems.

(<em>The Authoritative, 2000</em>). The input voltage, output voltage and frequency, and overall power handling depend on the design of the specific device or circuitry. The inverter does not produce any power; the power is provided by the DC source. A power inverter can be entirely electronic or may be a combination of mechanical effects (such as a rotary apparatus) and electronic circuitry. Static inverters do not use moving parts in the conversion process. (<em>Power Inverter, 2014</em>)</p> <p>A solar inverter, or PV inverter, converts the variable direct current (DC) output of a photovoltaic (PV) solar panel into a utility frequency alternating current (AC) that can be fed into a commercial electrical grid or used by a local, off-grid electrical network. It is a critical balance of system (BOS) –component in a photovoltaic system, allowing the use of ordinary AC-powered equipment. Solar inverters have special functions adapted for use with photovoltaic arrays, including maximum power point tracking and anti-islanding protection. (<em>Solar Inverter, 2014</em>)</p> <p>This project work involves the design and construction a 1kVA mobile solar power inverter system.</p> <p>1.2       Statement of the problem</p> <p>Uninterruptible power supply units are common electrical items found in most private and industrial buildings in Nigeria as a result of the never-stable and not-always-available power supply situation in the country.

According to the United Nations, one in six Africans is Nigerian. It is a regional power, listed among the “Next Eleven” economies, and a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was revised in 2013. As a consequence of the re-basing, the estimate for Nigeria’s GDP in 2013 was revised upward from 42.4trillion Naira to 80.2trillion Naira ($500 billion), an 89% increase. But for over two decades, Nigeria has experienced problems in the area of electricity generation, transmission and distribution. The extent of this is underlined by the fact that Nigeria is the largest purchaser of standby electricity generating plants in the world. (Braimoh and Okedeyi 2010). The population growth rate is projected to be between 2.5 and 2.7% per annum in the next 20 years. The population of Nigeria is therefore forecast to potentially grow to 310 million by 2035.</p>\n\nA SEMINAR ON THE POTENTIALS OF THE MINI-GRID AS A DRIVER OF THE NIGERIAN ECONOMY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A SEMINAR ON THE POTENTIALS OF THE MINI-GRID AS A DRIVER OF THE NIGERIAN ECONOMY", "id": 78}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This project proposes a new type of voltage regulator based on single-phase converter otherwise known as transformerless AVR that compensates wide range voltage variations. This is not only capable of compensating variations at a much higher bandwidth but also does not experience mechanical wear down and is cost effective. The proposed device employs a pulse width modulation (PWM) z-source ac–ac converter along with a simple closed loop control. High speed MOSFETs are used as bi-directional switch of the ac–ac converter and the circuit ultimately can easily and steadily maintain regulated voltage supply to the end user. The whole system operating principle and analysis are provided.</p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE WORK</strong></p> <p>          In the world today for example our country Nigeria, the electricity power delivered to consumers either at their homes or offices is not upheld at an agreed voltage approximately 220volts as a result of voltage fluctuation from the supply of the power system. This voltage fluctuation occurs as a result of sudden changes in the real and reactive power drawn by loads. This fluctuating current that is drawn from the supply causes an additional voltage drops in the power system leading to fluctuation in the supply voltage [1]. Nevertheless, it is relevant to maintain a constant voltage level so as to protect and elongate the life span of the various delicate electrical and electronic gadgets used in our homes and offices from the effect of over voltage and under voltage that may occur as a result of faults arising in the power system through the use of an automatic voltage regulator [1].</p> <p>According to [2], an Automatic voltage regulator is an electrical device that is used to sense inappropriate voltage levels and correct them to produce a stable output at the port where the load is to be connected. However, this project was designed and constructed using double conversion electronic voltage regulator (EVR) method that uses a rectifier to convert AC power toDCpower and then uses an inverter to convert the DC power back to AC.</p>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN AUTOMATIC VOLTAGE REGULATOR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN AUTOMATIC VOLTAGE REGULATOR", "id": 79}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>As a result of recent increases in demand for electric power, utility transmission systems have been forced to operate under stressful conditions, often close to instability limits. Efforts to construct new transmission lines or enlarge networks are limited due to economic and environmental constraints. According to U.S. Department of Energy, since 1982, the growth in peak demand for electricity has exceeded transmission growth by almost 25% every year. The deregulation of electricity market has resulted in increased bulk power across interconnected systems. In some utilities, the amount of transactions previously purchased in a year is now managed in one day. Operating power systems under such conditions along with inadequate reactive power reserves initiates a sequence of voltage instability points and can ultimately lead to a system voltage collapse. Special attention is being paid to determine methods for assessing voltage stability in real time and developing strategies to mitigate instability issues once they have been detected. Synchronized phasor measurement technology, which is already available at most substation location through protection relays for instance, is capable of directly measuring power system variables (voltage and current phasors) in real time, synchronized to within a millisecond. Together with the improvements on high-speed communication infrastructures, it is possible to build wide area measurement and protection systems to complement classic protection, applications and to prevent cascading system level outages. With this new direction on wide area measurement systems, come new approaches for wide area protection and control functions including generating indices for voltage collapse prevention. There are many studies on voltage stability indices including those based on phasor measurements. Some comparisons between these different indices can be found in later in this work as we proceed.</p>\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL ALGORITHM FOR VOLTAGE STABILITY ASSESSMENT USING SYNCHROPHASORS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL ALGORITHM FOR VOLTAGE STABILITY ASSESSMENT USING SYNCHROPHASORS", "id": 80}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Energy is a basic necessity for the economic development of a nation. There are different forms of energy, but the most important form is the electrical energy. A modern and civilized society is so much dependent on the use of electrical energy. Activities relating to the generation, transmission and distribution of electrical energy have to be given the highest priority in the national planning process of any nation because of the importance of electrical energy to the economic and social development of the society. In fact, the greater the per capital consumption of electrical energy in a country, the higher the standard of living of its people. Therefore, the advancement of a country is measured in terms of its per capital consumption of electrical energy. Power plants’ planning in a way to meet the power network load demand is one of the most important and essential issues in power systems. Since transmission lines connect generating plants and substations in power network, the analysis, computation and reduction of transmission losses in these power networks are of great concern to engineers. a lot of research works have been carried out on the above listed aspects Electrical energy is the most important form of energy in the present world. it is an energy that drives the economy of any society or country and makes the common citizen happy.

This study was carried out to assess the state of power supply and use in Gyel District of Jos- South Local Government Area of Plateau State. Four communities were selected to constitute the sample population using the simple random sampling technique. A structured questionnaire was the major instrument used for data collection. 120 copies of one questionnaire were administered on 30 respondents each drawn from the four sampled communities. Descriptive statistical technique was used in data presentation which involved the use of simple percentage tables, bar graphs and charts while analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for data analysis. The statistical test showed a significant variation in the duration of electricity supply in the study area. The study found that power supply in was inadequate, ineffective and replete with a number of problems such as overloading of transformers, illegal connection and use of obsolete equipment to mention a few. The study further made recommendations on how to tackle the problems experienced, ways to improve power supply in the study area and suggested the need for further research in other aspects pertaining to power supply and use in the study area that were covered by this study.    </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Power supply is very important to the social, economic and technological development of any nation. All aspects of the life of the citizenry is affected by power supply, ranging from keeping a clean home to running multinational companies. Without adequate power supply, businesses, homes and the society at large cannot function to their full capacity. One of the key indices for measuring the development status of any country is the state of power supply. This is because the power sector is the real engine that drives a nation’s economic growth and development. Indeed, the role which reliable and sustainable power supply plays in the socio- economic development and technological advancement of a nation cannot be underestimated. This is because inadequate power supply in an economy is detrimental to the overall productivity of small, medium and large scale industries.</p> <p>Nigeria is the most populous black nation in the world and despite its huge natural resources it is still one of the poorest countries in the world with an estimated GDP of 2162 dollars (Iwayemi, 2008). Over the years, the importance of attaining a regular and steady power supply has been at the center of developmental debate in Nigeria. Sambo (2008) has traced the history of electricity in Nigeria to 1896 when electricity was first introduced in Lagos, 15 years after its introduction in England. He observed that despite the fact that the emergence of electricity in Nigeria is over a century; its development has been at a slow rate. Sambo further observed that for over 20 years prior to 1999, the power sector did not witness substantial investment in infrastructural development. There were no new investments and existing ones were in a deplorable state. In 2001, generation went down to an average of about 1750MW, as compared to a load demand of 6000MW. According to the same author, only nineteen out of the seventy- nine installed generating were in operation.</p> <p>Nigeria is richly endowed with various energy resources; crude oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, solar energy, wind energy and fissionable materials for nuclear energy. In spite of these, Okafor (2006) observed that the country consistently suffers from energy shortage, a major impediment to industrial and technological growth. There is an extreme electricity deficiency in Nigeria and the causes of this deficiency are related to financial, socio- political and structural issues which lead to the power sector in Nigeria to be recording high energy losses from power generation and billing as a result of these inefficiencies (Iwayemi, 2008).</p> <p>The power situation in Nigeria is very is regrettably grim. What is often projected for generation by the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) now Power Holdings Company of Nigeria (PHCN), a government parastatal saddled with the responsibility of managing plants as well as distribution of power nationally is not commensurate with demand.  Consequently, individuals, 0rganisations and industries resort to internal generating plants. An estimated 60- 70% of the Nigerian population does not have access to electricity. Energy demand in Nigeria is dominated by fuel wood and women and children are the most affected in the energy crisis. At present only 10% of rural households and 30- 40% of the country’s total population has access to electricity (Sambo, 2007). The energy sector in Nigeria totally rely on government subsidize fuel and funding of major energy plants and energy capital projects by the federal, states and government agencies.</p> <p> Okafor (2008) has reported that the current per capita consumption of electricity in Nigeria as at 2008 was about 106kwh/person compared to what Ghana’s 430, India’s 470 and Brazil’s 1800. Expected increase in consumption was 379MW annually at 2.5% population annual growth rate and 5% annual growth of the economy.</p> <p>Studies and experiences have shown that power generation in Nigeria has been dismal and unable to compare with what obtains in small African countries. A recent survey on power distribution to the industrial sector in Nigeria showed that average power outage in the industrial sector increased from 13.3 hours in January 2006 to 14.5 hours in March 2006. In a worsening experience, the outage increased to 16.48 hours per day in June. In other words, power distribution in the month of June, 2006 to the industrial sector, on the average was 7.52 hours in March of the same year. In Bompai area in Kano state, power outage increased from 10.3 hours in January to 13.0 hours in March, while in Enugu/Anambra zone, it increased from 17.2 hours to 18.5 hours within the same period. In Edo/Delta zone the average power supply to industrial area is put at 4.4 hours per day. The Ikeja industrial area of Lagos enjoyed power for 21.5 hours per day, the highest in the country. Industrial estates in Bauchi, Benue and Plateau zone receive power supply for 4.5 hours per day which amounted to near blackout in real sense (Nwoshai, 2006; Odiaka, 2006).</p> <p>Studies further revealed that power supply in virtually all the states in Nigeria has been dismal and irregular. For instance, in Benue state, only Makurdi the state capital receives electricity supply for about five hours a day. Also in Delta state some communities never had power for upwards of six months. In Lagos, the commercial nerve centre of the country, the situation is also bad as power supply in many in many residential parts of Lagos is about four hours per day with cuts at short intervals. It is a total blackout in some areas for about three days or more (Akpan, 2005; Odiaka, 2006; Ogunmodede, 2006).</p> <p>Table 1: Comparative Analysis of electricity consumption world wide</p><p> </p> <p>Country</p><p> </p> <p>Population</p><p> </p> <p>Power generation</p><p> </p> <p>Per capita Consumption</p><p> </p> <p>United States</p><p> </p> <p>250.00 million</p><p> </p> <p>813,000 MW</p><p> </p> <p>3.2   KW</p><p> </p> <p>Cuba</p><p> </p> <p>10.54 million</p><p> </p> <p>4,000      MW</p><p> </p> <p>0.38 KW</p><p> </p> <p>United Kingdom</p><p> </p> <p>57.50 million</p><p> </p> <p>76,000    MW</p><p> </p> <p>1.33 KW</p><p> </p> <p>Ukraine</p><p> </p> <p>49.00 million</p><p> </p> <p>54,000    MW</p><p> </p> <p>1.33 KW</p><p> </p> <p>Iraq</p><p> </p> <p>23.60 million</p><p> </p> <p>10,000    MW</p><p> </p> <p>0.42 KW</p><p> </p> <p>South Africa</p><p> </p> <p>44.30 million</p><p> </p> <p>45,000    MW</p><p> </p> <p>1.015 KW</p><p> </p> <p>South Korea</p><p> </p> <p>47.00 million</p><p> </p> <p>52,000    MW</p><p> </p> <p>1.09 KW</p><p> </p> <p>Libya</p><p> </p> <p>5.50 million</p><p> </p> <p>4,600      MW</p><p> </p> <p>1.015 KW</p><p> </p> <p>Egypt</p><p> </p> <p>67.70 million</p><p> </p> <p>18,000    MW</p><p> </p> <p>0.256 KW</p><p> </p> <p>Nigeria</p><p> </p> <p>140.oo million</p><p> </p> <p>4,000      MW</p><p> </p> <p>0.03   KW</p><p> </p> <p>Source: Agbo (2007)</p> <p>            Nigeria presently has an installed capacity of approximately 10,000MW of which 25% is hydro and 75% is gas fired thermal plants but this has been grossly underutilized as only about 4200MW is generated on the average compared to the installed capacity. Although no official estimates for electric power demand exist, electric power demand has been estimated at over 10,000MW and is expected to grow at the rate of 10% per anum from 2010-2020. This shortfall in power supply is posing a major setback to the country’s ability to reduce poverty and achieve the millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Perhaps it is only individuals that are neither living nor doing business in Nigeria who will be oblivious of the fact that lack of adequate power supply, especially electricity is the major challenge the country is facing to fully utilize its economic potentials in order to achieve economic development. This is also the most significant factor which is affecting the country’s race to be one of the biggest and top twenty economies of the world by 2020 (vision 20- 20- 20).</p> <p>            The desire to find lasting and permanent solutions to the problems of power supply in Nigeria has remained a priority of every successive government in the last ten to fifteen years. In recognition that the problem of power supply is a challenging one scuttling socio- economic activities across the country, the civilian administration in Nigeria since its inception in 1999 started making huge investment in the energy sector. Available records showed that by the end of 2001 the generating capacity had increased from 1824MW (from 19 generating units) in March, 2000 to about 4000MW (from 40 generating units) and a new peak of 2934MW was recorded in the process. This was made possible through rehabilitation of existing units, installation of new generating plants and the procurement of power from independent operators (Makoju, 2002; Adegbamibe, 2007; Agbo, 2007). Nigeria’s government had set up 10,000MW target to be achieved by the end of 2007 as it had invested in new power projects that would be privatized after completion (Owan, 2005).</p> <p>            Till today, the power sector in Nigeria is still undergoing one form of reform or another, be it privatization or deregulation. Despite these efforts the power situation in Nigeria has not improved significantly. The Nigerian government has not been able to find permanent solution that will resolve the problems due to the adaptation of short term, hasty policies and also still undergoing energy projects which are detrimental to long term energy policies that will help the nation to achieve sustainable energy and energy efficiency. For example, what the country has done is still usage of the various alternatives that are still within the limits of fossil fuels, which are the only source that currently powers the nation’s economy (J. Kennedy-darling, N. Hoyt, K. Murao, A. Ross, 2008).</p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE STUDY PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>There is no gain saying the fact that power supply plays a critical role in the overall development of a nation. There is a growing concern among researchers, government and citizens alike that power supply in Nigeria is grossly in inadequate and epileptic. Access to uninterrupted power in Nigeria is also proving increasingly difficult. An estimated 60- 70% of the Nigerian population does not have access to electricity and at present, only 10% of the rural households, and 30- 40% of the country’s total population have access to electricity (Sambo, 2007). The distribution of electricity shows great disparities between rural and urban, and between residential and industrial areas in the urban centers (Ali- Akajiak &amp; Pyke, 2003). It is common knowledge that the power system in Nigeria is plagued with frequent power outages and high energy losses. This stems from weak development and maintenance of the power system.</p> <p>Plateau state and indeed Gyel in particular is no exception to this problem as it experiences long duration of power outages and in some cases  total black out for couple of days occasioned by load shedding. The frequent interruption of power often experienced in Gyel creates serious problems for residents (household electrical and electronic appliances are damaged, food and beverages stored in refrigerators get spoilt, clothes are not ironed, and heating water for bathing and cooking get difficult), organizations (smooth day- to- day running of their activities is hampered) and also hampering the smooth and efficient running of commercial activities (businesses that depend on electricity) not leaving out small and medium scale industries located within the study area thereby compelling them to resort the use of petrol/diesel generating sets at exorbitant prices.</p> <p>It is therefore, against this background that the present study addresses itself with the following questions;</p> <p>i.                    What are the sources of power (electricity) in Gyel?</p> <p>ii.                  What is the duration of power (in hours/day) supplied to Gyel?</p> <p>iii.                What are the problems associated with power supply and use in the study area?</p> <p>iv.                What are the major determinants of power supply and use in the study area?</p> <p>v.                  What are the various uses of electricity in Gyel?</p> <p><strong>1.3       AIM AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The primary aim of the study is to assess the state of power supply and use in Gyel district of Jos- South Local Government area of plateau state.</p> <p>The specific objectives are;</p> <p>i.                    To identify the sources of power supply in the study area.</p> <p>ii.                  To determine the various uses of electricity in the study area.</p> <p>iii.                To measure the duration of power supplied (in hours per day) to the study area.</p> <p>iv.                 To find out the problems of power supply and use in the study area</p> <p>v.                  To find out the major determinants of power supply and use in the study area.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is expected to increase the knowledge base and update information on power supply and use in Gyel district of Jos- South Local Government Area of Plateau state.

However, interruptions which are largely unavoidable contribute to the unavailability of power and thus prevent power system from achieving this. In most cases, it is the sustained interruptions that greatly affect both the utility company and its customers. Hence, it is necessary to find means of determining which component failure contributes most to the unavailability of the distribution system, and how this unavailability actually affects the customers. This is to enable system planners and designers to seek better ways of improving the reliability of a typical secondary distribution substation system having a single-end fed radial configuration. By using analytical method and network reduction technique, the substation reliability was analyzed based on the outage data gotten from the utility company. The conclusion from this work shows that transformer failure followed by the fuse failure contributes most to the substation’s unavailability. The overall system availability shows that the system’s performance is poor.</div> <div> <div><strong>CHAPTER 1</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1</strong>        <strong>BACKGROUND</strong></div> <div>Electric power system is basically set up to supply electricity with little or no interruptions to its customers. The number of interruptions that occur while the system performs its intended function is part of what determines the overall reliability of the system. The other factor that determines its reliability is the quality of electricity delivered. Furthermore, the capability of a power system to continuously deliver quality electricity means that the customers are satisfied and the electricity providers are having favorable returns on their investment as they continue their business of supplying electricity. As electricity consumption has become an important factor that affects the drive needed for technology to grow and to facilitate the development of modern society, it is very important therefore to take seriously the issue of reliability of an electric power system.</div> <div>Generation, transmission and distribution are the three subsystems of an electric power system. At the generating station, electricity is generated and transmitted through the high voltage transmission lines to the distribution substations. The distribution substation system considered covers the electrical system between the substation fed by the subtransmission system and the supply line to the consumers’ meters i.e. 11kV to 0.415kV transformation (Theraja and Theraja, 2005). The distribution substations are usually sited relatively near the customers for effective delivery, monitoring and maintenance of the substation and the customer end and are usually referred to as secondary distribution substation system. Distribution systems basically serve as the link from the distribution substation to the customer. Reliable and safe transfer of electricity to the customers covered by the distribution area is ensured by this system and is the main subject studied in this dissertation.</div> <br/> <div>In terms of reliability evaluation and modeling, generating stations have justifiably received more attention than the other systems because they are individually capital intensive. In addition, in the event of generation inadequacy and generation loss there is usually widespread catastrophic effects on the society and environment. It impacts directly on the whole system and even distribution system will not be able to perform its duty because there will be no electricity to supply to customers. However based on published research work and studies, distribution systems have begun to receive moderate attention compared to past decades. In most cases, when there is disturbance in form of failure which results in outages in the distribution system it affects only the localized territory. Only in few cases does the fault move up in to the system largely as a result of protection failure. Analysis of the customer failure statistics of most electricity companies shows that the distribution system makes the greatest individual contribution to the unavailability of supply to a customer (Gonen, 2014). In effect, the purpose of establishing generating stations and the hurdles overcome to transmit electricity is defeated when it does not get to the user end as a result of distribution system failure. This makes distribution system to be highly important. The distribution systems account for up to 90% of all customer reliability problems, improving distribution reliability is the key to improving customer reliability (Billinton and Jonnavithula, 1996).</div> <div>Meanwhile, as the main aim of a power system is to meet the electricity needs of the customers and this can only be achieved when the components making up the system are performing their intended function properly for as long as the system is in operation, it is important that the demand for electricity and its supply be properly viewed and included in setting up the system. Therefore, due to its high impact on the cost of electricity and its corresponding effect on customer satisfaction, distribution reliability is very important. However, as in any other viable engineering system, there are challenges that face power distribution system which tends to make the system unreliable. One of these is the issue of serving its main purpose which is to supply quality electricity with little or no interruptions. This problem is inevitable in power systems across the world but the way they are managed is what makes it different from country to country. For instance in the United States, there is nearly an uninterrupted delivery of quality electricity to its numerous customers which makes it rank among the most dependable in the world. It is in management of the power systems that reliability evaluation becomes significant. Reliability evaluation does not in any way make a system more reliable but it helps in system planning and identification of weak components.</div> </div>\n\nRELIABILITY EVALUATION OF SECONDARY DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RELIABILITY EVALUATION OF SECONDARY DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IN NIGERIA", "id": 84}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This project work is aimed at developing an efficient Algorithm for the management of Electric Power network using fuzzy logic.

At the same time, operation and development of the system network is influenced by a variety of uncertain and random factors. As a result, the development strategy can be chosen from a large number of possible alternatives. Obviously, among a set of possible alternatives the developer attempts to find the best, or in accordance with accepted term, the optimal alternative. Thus, the complexity of the problem related to power systems planning is mainly caused by presence of multiple objectives, uncertain information and large number of variables.</div> <p>In this research work, effort is devoted to consideration of the methods for development management of electric power network.</p>\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF A POWER MANAGEMENT ALGORITHM FOR ELECTRICAL POWER NETWORK<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DEVELOPMENT OF A POWER MANAGEMENT ALGORITHM FOR ELECTRICAL POWER NETWORK", "id": 85}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT`</strong></div> <p>To improve the overall efficiency of the power system, the performance of transmission system must be improved. Some of the vital ways of achieving this objective is by reducing power losses in the system and also improving voltage profile. An important method of controlling bus voltage is by shunt capacitor banks in the transmission substations. The capacitor absorbs reactive power flow in the system, thus improving power factor. When this is done, active power is also improved. In this work, a 10-bus transmission system is taken as model. Newton-Raphson’s power flow program is executed using MATLAB toolbox to obtain p. u nodal voltage ranging from 0.8890 to 1.0564, total real power line losses (0.09438 p.u), and total reactive power line losses (0.36970 p. u). By using power loss reduction, power loss index is evaluated and normalized in the range [0, 1]. These indices, together with the p. u nodal voltage magnitude, is fed as inputs to the Fuzzy Inference System to obtain Capacitor Suitability Index (CSI). The CSIs obtained, ranges from 0.244 to 0.897. The values of the CSIs determine nodes most suitable for capacitor installation. Experimentally, highest values of CSIs are chosen for capacitor installation. As a result, 3 buses (3, 8, and 10) with CSI values of 0.680, 0.750, and 0.897 respectively, are chosen. Capacitor sizes of 50MVar, 85MVar, and 60MVar (obtained from Index Based Method) are installed on the buses. Voltage profile improves by 3.74%, 3.27%, and 3.33% respectively, while total real power loss in the system reduces by 17.55% and total reactive power injection to the network reduces by 8.70% respectively. Overall, system stability and efficiency, hence, reliability, are improved by installation of capacitors at suitable locations in a transmission system.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background of Study</strong></p> <p>Electrical energy is generated at power stations which are usually located far away from load centres [1]. Thus, a network of conductors between the power stations and the consumers is required in order to harness the power generated. This network of conductors may be divided into two main components, namely, the transmission system and the distribution system [1]. As power flows in the lines, a significant amount is lost. Accurate knowledge of these power losses on transmission lines and their minimization is a critical component for efficient flow of power in an electrical network. Power losses result in lower power availability to final consumers. Hence, adequate measures need to be taken to reduce power losses to the barest minimum.</p> <p>Power plants' planning in a way to meet the power network load demand is one of the most important and essential issues in power systems. Since transmission lines connect generating plants and substations in power network, the analysis, computation and reduction of transmission losses in these networks are of great concern to scientists and engineers.</p> <p>Studies have indicated that as much as 9% or more of total power generated is consumed as <strong><strong>[1]</strong></strong></p> losses at the transmission level [2]. The losses can be separated to active and reactive component of branch current, where the losses produced by reactive current can be reduced by the installation of shunt capacitors. Capacitors (capacitor banks) are widely used in transmission systems to reduce energy and peak demand losses, release the MVA capacities of transmission apparatus and to maintain a voltage profile within permissible limits [3]. The objective of optimal capacitor placement problem is to determine the size, type, and location of capacitors to be installed on the transmission network to achieve positive economic response. The economic   <p>12</p> </div> <p> <br/> </p> <div> <p>benefits obtained from the loss reduction weighted against capacitors costs while keeping the operational and power quality constraints within required limits. Fuzzy logic provides a remedy for any lack of uncertainty in the data. Fuzzy logic is a subset of conventional (Boolean) logic that has been extended to handle the concepts of partial truth-values, between ‘completely true’ and ‘completely false’.</p> <p>The ideas of fuzzy logic dates all the way back to Plato who proposed that there is a third region between true and false. Fuzzy logic is a technique of making a choice answer to questions, other than ‘yes’ or ‘no’. It resembles human reasoning in the use of approximate information and uncertainty to generate decision. The fuzzy logic is a designed technique used in providing tools for dealing with imprecision that are intrinsic to many problems. The fuzzy set theory implements clauses of data that are not sharply defined. To that effect, the degree of power loss incurred in transmission lines is evaluated using Fuzzy logic in MATLAB toolbox.</p> <p>Furthermore fuzzy logic has the advantage of including heuristics and representing engineering judgments into the capacitor allocation optimization process.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement Of The Problem</strong></p> <p>Presently, many electrical energy companies in a number of countries are experiencing very high losses. Studies show that about 9% of total power generated is wasted in the form of losses at the transmission level in Nigeria [1]. Similarly, voltage drops and/or over-voltages are frequently experienced by TCN in transmitting electricity. To reduce these losses and improve voltage profile, shunt capacitor banks are installed on transmission sub-stations. With active power loss reduction and voltage profile improvement as objectives, the optimal capacitor placement problem aims to determine the optimal capacitor location and capacitor sizes in the transmission systems. Efficient methods are required to determine the best location and sizes.</p> <p>13</p> </div> <p> <br/> </p> <div> <p><strong>1.3 Objectives Of The Study</strong></p> <p>The aim of the research is to reduce loss of electrical power in Nigeria’s 330KV system using Fuzzy logic technique.</p> <p>The specific objectives of this research include;</p> <p>i.             Using Newton-Raphson’s method to perform a load flow analysis on the chosen 10-bus transmission model to determine line losses, bus voltages and load angles.</p> <p>ii.             Applying Fuzzy Inference System to determine the buses suitable for capacitor placement so as to reduce active power losses on the chosen bus system and also improve voltage profile, thus, improving on the stability and efficiency of the power system.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>Shunt capacitor installations enhance an improved voltage profile, power factor, and reduction in real power loss in the transmission system.

The bus system (which cut across 2 of the 8 TCN regions), is carefully chosen as a case study for this work. This is because of higher losses and voltage drops experienced in the regions. Power flow analysis of this sub-network is conducted to obtain losses. ‘Capacitor placement method’ is applied using Fuzzy logic technique to determine the sizes and locations of buses to install the capacitors. Sizes of capacitors to be installed are equally evaluated.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Organization of Thesis</strong></p> <p>This work is organized in five chapters. Chapter one presents a general introduction of the work. Chapter two presents an overview of power systems, power losses (both technical and non-technical), fuzzy logic technique, power flow analysis etc. Chapter three deals with the modeling of the selected 10-bus system, capacitor placement method, algorithm of the proposed approach, calculation of loss reduction &amp; loss indices, calculation of capacitor sizes using Index Based method etc. Chapter four present fuzzy logic as simulation software used. Various results obtained from load flow analysis, fuzzy logic implementation, calculation of capacitor sizes and improvement recorded in voltage profile and reduction in total power losses were also presented and discussed in this chapter. Conclusion is drawn and necessary recommendation made in chapter five</p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1 Background of Study</strong></div> <div>Electrical energy is generated at power stations which are usually located far away from load centres [1]. Thus, a network of conductors between the power stations and the consumers is required in order to harness the power generated. This network of conductors may be divided into two main components, namely, the transmission system and the distribution system [1]. As power flows in the lines, a significant amount is lost. Accurate knowledge of these power losses on transmission lines and their minimization is a critical component for efficient flow of power in an electrical network. Power losses result in lower power availability to final consumers. Hence, adequate measures need to be taken to reduce power losses to the barest minimum.</div> <div>Power plants' planning in a way to meet the power network load demand is one of the most important and essential issues in power systems. Since transmission lines connect generating plants and substations in power network, the analysis, computation and reduction of transmission losses in these networks are of great concern to scientists and engineers.</div> <div>Studies have indicated that as much as 9% or more of total power generated is consumed as</div> <div> losses at the transmission level [2]. The losses can be separated to active and reactive component of branch current, where the losses produced by reactive current can be reduced by the installation of shunt capacitors. Capacitors (capacitor banks) are widely used in transmission systems to reduce energy and peak demand losses, release the MVA capacities of transmission apparatus and to maintain a voltage profile within permissible limits [3]. The objective of optimal capacitor placement problem is to determine the size, type, and location of capacitors to be installed on the transmission network to achieve positive economic response. </div>\n\nAPPLICATION OF FUZZY LOGIC TECHNIQUE FOR POWER LOSS REDUCTION IN THE NIGERIA 330KV SYSTEM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " APPLICATION OF FUZZY LOGIC TECHNIQUE FOR POWER LOSS REDUCTION IN THE NIGERIA 330KV SYSTEM", "id": 86}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>Abstract</strong></div> <div>This work investigates an improved protection solution based on the use of artificial neural network on the 330kV Nigerian Network modelled using Matlab R2014a. Measured fault voltages and currents signals decomposed using the discrete Fourier transform implemented via fast Fourier transform are fed as inputs to the neural network. The output plots of the neural network shows its successful application to fault diagnosis (fault detection, fault classification and fault location). The neural networks application to fault location shows a mean square error of 3.5331 and regression value of 0.99976 which shows a very close relationship between the output and target values fed to the neural network. Unlike conventional protection schemes, the neural network can be adapted to distances which can cover the entire length of the protected line. Numerical assessment carried out on the neural network fault locator shows a reduced time of operation of 5.15miliseconds as compared to the 0.350seconds with the use of ordinary numerical relays. This work also investigates the adaptive auto reclosure scheme implemented using artificial neural network. The adaptive reclosure scheme has been adapted for use in the Nigerian Network successfully to distinguish transient and permanent faults. Simulation results prove that the adaptive reclosure scheme was able to detect a line-to-ground transient fault and clear this fault in 0.1s while the line-to-ground permanent fault is cleared after 0.14s. The auto reclosure scheme is designed using two separate neural networks, one nework to distinguish the faults either as transient or permanent fault, and using this fault distinguishing network as input to the second network to classify decision, either as ‘safe to reclose’ represented by logic ‘1’ or ‘do not reclose’ represented as logic ‘0’. The Fault diagnostic algorithm designed using artificial neural network (A.N.N.) for the 330kV network was tested on a 132kV network. Results show and prove that the algorithm is flexible and can be adopted to other networks.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1 Background of the study</strong></div> <div>The demand for constant power supply in Nigeria is ever increasing; however the demand is met with lots of constraint. One of them being system faults. Faults on transmission line in particular is of great interest to the power holding company of Nigeria as more investment is put into restructuring the current infrastructure and also expanding existing ones.</div> <div>The power sector of Nigeria is subdivided into policy, regulations, customers, operations. The operations division brings to light the activities of the transmission company of Nigeria that controls the high voltage delivery of power from generating plants to the substations for transmission to distribution stations. T.C.N handles a 330kv system capacity of 6870MW over a total distance of 5650Km[1], their focus is to maintain power system stability, reliability and sustainability.</div> <div>The major protection schemes currently employed are distance protection, over current protection, differential protection e.t.c. distance protection being the predominant suffers from inaccuracy due to restraints of relays on protection schemes i.e. reach settings. The relay cannot fully adapt to fluctuations in power system conditions especially in parallel lines as well as distinguish between transient and permanent fault following a short circuit.</div> <div>This work brings to view the application of artificial neural network for enhanced power system protection in regards to fault detection, fault location, and application of the adaptive auto reclosure schemes as opposed to conventional approach; travelling wave approach, synchronous compensators to name a few.</div> <div><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem</strong></div> <p>Among several power system components, transmission line is one of the most important components of the power system network and is mostly affected by several types of faults. Generally, 80%-90% of the fault occurs on the transmission line and the rest of substation equipment and bus bar combined. The necessary requirement of all the power system is to maintain reliability of operation which may be done by detecting, classifying and isolating various faults occurring in the system. It is required that a corrective decision should be made by the protective device to minimize the period of trouble and limit outage time, damage and related problems. If any fault or disturbances occurred in the transmission is not detected, located, and eliminated quickly, it may cause instability in the power system and causes significant changes in system quantities like over-current, under or over voltage, power factor, impedance, frequency and power. The appropriate percentage of occurrence of single line to ground fault is about 70-80%, line to line to ground faults is 10-17%, line to line fault is 8-10% and three phase is 3%. The three faults occur rarely but if it exists in a system it is quite expensive.</p>\n\nAPPLICATION OF ARTIFICAIL NEURAL NETWORK FOR ENHANCED POWER SYSTEMS PROTECTION ON THE NIGERIAN 330KV NETWORK<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " APPLICATION OF ARTIFICAIL NEURAL NETWORK FOR ENHANCED POWER SYSTEMS PROTECTION ON THE NIGERIAN 330KV NETWORK", "id": 87}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong><em>ABSTRACT</em></strong></div> <div>This work is concerned with the features, analysis and design of a stand-alone solar energy based power supply with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) scheme. The features and operations of various types of solar cells and panels and the performance characteristics under varying temperature and irradiance conditions are studied. Subsequently, various methods of maximum solar power point tracking methods are reviewed. From the results of the review of similar works in literature, two most popular maximum power point tracking methods were selected and their detailed operational features were analyzed, designed and the performance characteristics presented. Those methods are the perturbation and observation (P&amp;O) method and the incremental conductance (InCond) method using the Cuks or SEPIC dc to dc converter operating in the discontinuous capacitor voltage mode (DCVM) and/ or discontinuous inductor current mode (DICM). The results of the analysis show that incremental conductance method has superior performance characteristics when compared to the perturbation and observation method. With the incremental conductance method, the problem of sustained oscillation around the maximum power point of the solar panel which is the usual characteristic of the perturbation and observation method is essentially absent. Furthermore, the power available for the load when MPPT is applied is 1.1 kW which gives a tolerance of 0.1% to the load it powers. But without MPPT, the available power is 0.9 kW using the same number of PV panels and batteries. MPPT has 17.65% edge in power delivery over non-MPPT PV powered energy supply. An experimental prototype of a 1kW, 230V, 50Hz stand-alone solar based power supply with the incremental conductance scheme was successfully built and tested. The experimental results agreed with the predicted results.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER 1</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0             </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div>In this work,a maximum power point tracking Scheme for stand-alone solar energy based power supply is explained, analyzed and implemented. Global climatic change, world-wide increase in energy demand, uncertainty in price and availability of non-renewable energy and world energy policies on using environmental friendly source of energy have made Photovoltaic (PV) systems suitable for energy generation in recent times.</div> <div>Energy is one of the most basic and essential of all the natural resources given to mankind. Sun is the bedrock of all the energy used in this planet earth due to fission or fusion of atomic nuclei in the sun. Energy released from the sun if properly harnessed will go a long way in ameliorating the world energy problems. Nigeria for instance, receives 5.08 x 1012 kWh of energy per day from the sun and if solar energy appliances with just 5% efficiency are used to cover only 1% of the country's surface area then 2.54 x 106 MWh per day of electrical energy can be obtained from solar energy [1]; this is the basis of this research investigations. Stand-alone photovoltaic power supply system is established as a reliable and economic source of electricity in rural areas, especially in developing countries where the population is dispersed.This is because rural areas have low incomes and the grid power supply is not fully extended to these areas due to viability and financial constraints; or even due to intermittent power supply in areas where grid system is available. It is defined as autonomous systems that supply electricity without being connected to the electric grid.</div> <div>It is worthy to note that for ages the world energy sources depend on conventional sources such as fossil fuel, hydro, coal, radioactive decay etc. But all these have their peculiar problems of scarcity, rapidly depleting, causes pollution and harmful to both man and other living organisms.</div> <div>It is in an attempt to solve the above problems, that necessitated this research work, since renewable energy sources are clean, pollution-free, harmless, recyclable, distributed throughout the earth and inexhaustible that makes it a better substitute. Moreover, global climatic change world-wide increase in energy demand, uncertainty in price and availability of non-renewable energy and world energy policies on using environmental friendly source of energy have made PV systems suitable for energy generation in recent time. Similarly, with the cost ofsolarcells decreasing [2-4],the conversion ofsolarenergy toelectrical energy isincreasingly becomingeconomicallyviable. This isparticularly true in aCountry like Nigeriawhere there isabundant solarenergy available throughout the yearwith reserve estimate of 3.5 – 7.0 kW/m 2/day [5].</div>\n\nA MAXIMUM POWERPOINT TRACKING SCHEME FOR STAND-ALONE SOLAR ENERGY BASED POWER SUPPLY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A MAXIMUM POWERPOINT TRACKING SCHEME FOR STAND-ALONE SOLAR ENERGY BASED POWER SUPPLY", "id": 88}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>CONSTRUCTION OF MICROCONTROLLER BASED VEHICLE SPEED ALARM</strong></div><div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>The project is based on Construction of microcontroller vehicle speed alarm system which automatically warns the driver by activating a panic alarm which is triggered on when the driver exceeds the speed limit set in the system which also stops the alarm when the speed is reduced below the set speed limit.

The job of the speedometer is to indicate the speed of a car in milesper hour, kilometers per hour or both.

Considering the importance of transformer insulation the investigation is borne out of the need to develop the capacity for local production of transformer dielectric. Natural esters of vegetables origin have been found to have the suitable dielectric properties for them to be used as replacement dielectric fluids for mineral oil. However vegetable oil has poor resistance to oxidation, hence the need for inhibiting the vegetable oil for use as insulation fluid.

Background of the Study</strong></div> <div>Electrical faults that occur in power transfers accounts for over fifty percent of transformer failure’s expenditures . Fifty percent of transformer failure’s expenditure is caused by insulation, dielectric, and oil-related faults [1]. The need for better dielectrics and transformer oils for insulation is unequivocal. In a liquid-filter transformer, the insulator liquid plays an important function by providing both the electrical insulation and the means of transforming the thermal losses to the cooling system. Insulating oil in a transformer must ensure the transfer of heat. This function is realized both by thermal conductivity and convection [2].</div> <div>Nowadays, transformers can be filled with three basic types of insulating liquids: (i) mineral oils, (ii) synthetic oils or (iii) natural esters [3]. The use of each type is fortified by the application. However, in the face of increasing demand for the use of environmentally friendly products in the industry, more and more companies are working towards developing the use of esters and specifically natural esters for use in the majority of their products.</div> <div>Transformers have been filled with mineral oil for more than one century. This type of oil is a petroleum based product, essentially composed of hydrogen and carbon atoms. Carbon and hydrogen are assembled in different structures: napthenic (CnH2n), paraffinic (CnH2n+2) and</div> <div>aromatic (CnH2n-6)[3]. The distribution of carbons in napthenic and paraffinic structures define</div> <p>the type of mineral oil. This distribution is controlled by the crude oil and the refining processes used. Because of its wide availability, good properties and low cost, mineral oil is the fluid most used in the electric power transformer industry. New mineral oils have to be in accordance with the IEC 60296 or ASTM D3487. </p>\n\nINVESTIGATION AND EVALUATION OF LOCAL LIQUID DIELECTRIC FOR POWER TRANSFORMER INSULATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INVESTIGATION AND EVALUATION OF LOCAL LIQUID DIELECTRIC FOR POWER TRANSFORMER INSULATION", "id": 90}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Long term evolution (LTE) Network is often faced with the challenge of meeting up with the quality of service (QoS) requirement of the different services supported in the Network. Maintaining a trade-off between system throughput and fairness among users when making radio resources scheduling decisions is a very sensitive issue. Several algorithms have been proposed to this effect by different researchers in an attempt to manage the limited radio resources. One of well-known packet schedulers known as M-LWDF algorithm is known to support both real time and non-real time services. This algorithm has been found not to support real time services at a sufficient level. This is due to the fact that head of line (HOL) delay and packet delay not sufficient to balance the scheduling decision to real time services thereby degrading its performance. This research work was an attempt to improve the performance of MLWDF by incorporating bandwidth of flow,, which is directly proportional to flow weight and reserved rate .This approach used the uncertainty principle of fuzzy logic to calculate new weight for the different flows, by considering two input parameters from the network which are latency requirement for real time traffic and throughput for non-real time traffic .The performance of this algorithm was compared with PF,M-LWDF and EXP/PF schemes using system throughput, packet loss rate, delay and fairness as a performance indices in an LTE simulator. Results showed that when I-MLWDF was used, the aggregate throughput for video and VOIP increases considerably by 9.8% and 0.1% respectively when the cell was loaded by 60 users and the throughput for non- real time flow showed degraded performance of about 90%as against MLWDF. The improved scheme showed that the packet loss rate for video flow decreases by about 35.71% and 75% when compared with EXP/PF and MLWDF respectively. The acceptable packet loss rate for VOIP flow is under 3% for both algorithm and the improved scheme showing better result by about 20%compared to MLWDF. The packet loss rate for non-real time flow for I-MLWDF showed a poor performance of about 95% as against MLWDF.The delay for video, VOIP for the improved scheme is under 0.05s and 0.007s respectively as against MLWDF with delays under 0.07s and 0.02s for video and VOIP respectively, when the cell was loaded with 60 users. Also the delay for I-MLWDF showed higher delay of 98% as compared to MLWDF. Fairness index for video flow for I-MLWDF is 20% better than MLWDF. Both algorithms showed performance level between 98.5% and 99.5% for fairness index for VOIP flow with I-MLWDF showing improved performance of about 0.2% increase better than M-LWDF. However, the highest fairness index was presented by MLWDF and PF that reach a level above 99% whereas I-MLWDF showed the worst result that reach a level of about 93%.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></div> <div>Cellular communication was designed to ameliorate the flaws of traditional wireless and wired communication networks providing communication between moving units and/or stationary units and vice versa[1]. The moving units are referred to as mobile stations while the stationary units are referred to as land fixed units. Some of the flaws encountered in traditional wireless communication networks range from their inability to cope with the travelling speed of fast mobile units; to its low capacity and poor data rate.</div> <div>Cellular communication divides its coverage region into small regions called cells; hence, the terminology “cellular”. This concept of cellular co mmunication began to appear in Bell System proposals during the late 1970s [1, 2]. Cell size is dynamic and is dependent on the population (traffic) in the region to be covered. However, it is set by the transmitter power and the frequency of operation of the cell. To manage scarce frequency resources and meet the requirement of users, cells apply techniques like frequency hopping, frequency re-use and cell splitting [3].</div>\n\nIMPROVED SCHEDULER FOR LONG TERM EVOLUTION (LTE) DOWNLINK TRANSMISSION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPROVED SCHEDULER FOR LONG TERM EVOLUTION (LTE) DOWNLINK TRANSMISSION", "id": 91}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Providing quality of service is a challenging issue in UMTS mobile networks for multimedia traffic (video, voice and data). Critical services such as real-time audio, voice and video are given priority over less critical ones, such as file transfer and web surfing. One of the approaches that efficiently provides standard quality of service for multimedia traffic in wireless networks is to dynamically allocate bandwidth to varying traffic load and channel conditions. There are several of such dynamic bandwidth allocation approaches developed in the recent time by researchers. The choice of which one to implement at an instance and for a specific condition is an issue in mobile communication networks. In this work, the popular Code-Division Generalized Processor Sharing (CDGPS) was analyzed. The CDGPS variations – priority and non-priority – were compared, the two techniques were modelled and simulated using MATLAB Simulink object oriented environment. Simulation results show that priority CDGPS provides the best performance and improvement in the delay and loss rate, while still maintaining a high bandwidth utilization of percentage value of 98.2%.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1             </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></div> <div>Today, mobile communications play a central role in the voice/data network arena. From the early analog mobile first generation (1G) to the third generation (3G) the standard has changed. The new mobile generations do not pretend to improve the voice communication experience but try to give the user access to a new global communication reality [1]. The aim is to reach communication universality and to provide users with a new set of services. The cellular networks are evolving through several generations; the first generation (1G) wireless mobile communication network was analog system which was used for public voice service with the speed up to 2.4kbps. The second generation (2G) is based on digital technology and network infrastructure. As compared to the first generation, the second generation can support text messaging [2]. Its success and the growth of demand for online information via the internet prompted the development of cellular wireless system with improved data connectivity, which ultimately leads to the third generation systems (3G). It is now time to explore new demands and to find new ways to extend the mobile concept. The first steps have already been taken by the 2.5G, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), which gave users access to a data network (e.g. Internet access, Multimedia Message Service).</div>\n\nDYNAMIC BANDWIDTH SCHEDULING FOR WCDMA UPLINK TRANSMISSION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DYNAMIC BANDWIDTH SCHEDULING FOR WCDMA UPLINK TRANSMISSION", "id": 92}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Most ATMs employ one means of authentication (single factor authentication) by using the PIN. These kinds of ATMs are vulnerable to ATM frauds like Card Skimming: where a device placed at the slot for the ATM Card copies all the information stored in ATM cards including the PINs and then copies of the original cards will be made, afterwards money will be stolen from the accounts concerned. This work presents the design of ATM software that employs a two factor authentication method that utilises the PIN and a One Time Password (OTP) which will be sent to the client’s mobile phone through SMS. This process will be initiated by the ATM as soon as the user slots his ATM card and the system accepts it. By employing this technology, a fraudster who has access to someone’s ATM Card and PIN will still not gain access to their bank account if he has no access to the SMS containing the One Time Password. This work employed Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) as its methodology and this includes the use of the Unified Modelling Language (UML). In order to realise the system using the OOAD approach, C#, an oriented programming language was used. The result obtained at the end of this project is the prototype of ATM software that employs two factor authentication. Finally, the performance of the system while it was being tested shows that the objective of providing additional security using two factor authentication was achieved to a large extent.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1</strong>       <strong>Background to the Study</strong></div> <div><strong>Brief History of the ATM</strong></div> <div>The concept of self-service in retail banking has evolved through various stages. These stages include cash machines developed in the early 1960s through independent and simultaneous efforts of engineers in Britain, Sweden and Japan. The first of such commercial cash machines was put into use in the UK on the 27th of June 1967 by the Barclays Bank. These and other developments (which were championed by efforts in Asia, Europe and America) gave rise to the automated (automatic) teller machine (ATM). The first modern ATM came into use in December 1972 and was designed by IBM for Lloyd Banks. The machine was called the IBM 2984 and popularly known as the CIT: Cash Issuing Terminal. The CIT was considered the first true cash point and is similar to what we have nowadays [1].</div> <p>The ATM is a networked computer terminal that provides Bank clients with access to financial transactions from a public space without the need for one to visit the bank branch.</p>\n\nDESIGN OF TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (PIN AND SMS PASSWORD) FOR AN AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINE (ATM)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN OF TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (PIN AND SMS PASSWORD) FOR AN AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINE (ATM)", "id": 93}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <p>The work presented in this thesis explored the potential of using a mix of renewable energy resources (hybrid power systems, HPSs) to generate electricity that meets power needs of mobile base stations at rural areas in Nigeria. The study was based on theoretical mathematical modeling and simulation using the hybrid optimization model for electric renewables (HOMER) software. A sample of eight hypothetical off-grid remote telecommunication base station (BTS) sites at various geographical locations in Nigeria was used for the study. These locations include: Abaji (Abuja, FCT), Nkanu-West (Enugu), Ikwerre (Rivers), Nembe (Bayelsa), Mopa-Muro (Kogi), Kauru (Kaduna), Guzamala (Borno), and Tureta (Sokoto), and were selected to reflect the various climatic conditions in Nigeria. Eight different combinations (HPS options) of four energy resources [small-hydro power (SHP), wind turbine generator, solar photovoltaic (SPV) and diesel generator (DG)] were studied and compared for each of the eight selected BTS sites. These are: Hybrid (Solar, Wind &amp; Hydro) + DG; Hybrid (Solar &amp; Hydro) + DG; Hybrid (Wind &amp; Hydro) + DG; Hydro only + DG; Hybrid (Solar &amp; Wind) + DG; Solar only + DG; Wind only + DG. Total Net Present Cost (NPC) and total CO2 generated are used as indices for measuring the optimization level of each energy solution, and the option with the highest optimization value is considered to be the best energy solution for that base station site. The quantitative results of the study (as reported here) show that the hybrid power system can be more cost-effective and environmentally friendly in providing energy to BTS sites than diesel generators. The results also show that there is no general least-cost option for powering GSM base station sites at different locations. It all depends on climatic conditions and available renewable energy resources. A major contribution of this work is the demonstration (by these results) that it is possible to develop an optimized energy map for appropriate locations of GSM Base Station sites in Nigeria, both as a design guide for network operators and for the formulation of energy use policies by the national telecommunications regulatory authority (the NCC). One of such policies could be the requirement that any network operator intending to site a base station in any location should first produce an optimized energy feasibility study of the location before an approval would be granted.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0 Introduction</strong></div> <div>Communication services have faced several challenges with the increasing spread of wireless voice and data signals into remote areas [1]. Power supply is one of the critical challenges the telecommunication operators confront in deploying their networks. This challenge is readily overcome in the developed countries as a result of well-developed power infrastructure. In the developing world, where national electricity grid exists, it is always the energy solution of choice for powering Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs). Unfortunately, it is not always reliable and has limited coverage. This is complicated in developing countries like Nigeria as mobile communication extends more and more into rural areas outside the reach of national grid. The electrification by grid extension or secondary power station can only reach a small minority of the population in rural areas. In view of the dispersion of localities, the cost of production, transmission and especially distribution of electricity, would be expensive.</div>\n\nENERGY OPTIMIZATION AT GSM BASE STATION SITES LOCATED IN RURAL AREAS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ENERGY OPTIMIZATION AT GSM BASE STATION SITES LOCATED IN RURAL AREAS", "id": 94}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>The design of this 30 volt Audio Amplifier with volume, table and bass control which was done wit ht he combination of five (5) different circuit which are interconnected during or after construction.  This amplifier operates with an option of a left and right channel.</div> <div>The combination of these circuit include this main amplifier circuit (which consist of a left and right channel, two treble and bass pre \" amp circuit and the power supply circuit.</div> <div>The main amplifier circuit consist of an interpreter circuit (IC) and lots of resistors, electrolytic capacitor with few a mp circuit of a transistor with some resistors and paper capacitor.</div> <div>The power circuit which is used to power all the circuit 6f a 30 volt step down transformer, double rectification circuit, with 2 diodes and capacitor (Electrolyic).

<div><strong>PREFACE</strong></div> <div>The purpose of this text is to present at a primary and intermediate level a comprehensive over view of the construction principle and indeed the operation of a Digital Incubator.  We want to present a situation where by as the temperature in going up let the resistance be decreasing and as the temperature decreases let the resistance be going up.</div> <div>The history and importance of Electronics as a unique branch of science cannot be over emphasized Electronic as its history might have it, is divided into two periods.  The first began with the invention of the vacuum tube, the second, occupying the later half of the twentieth century in based on the invention of the transistor.</div> <div>Since Electronic is the branch of science and Technology relating to the conduction and control of electricity flowing through semi-conductor materials through vacuum are based.  Its application to industry will be concerned with the design, manufacture and application of transistors, dides, integrated circuits and other semi-conductor devices and to a much lesser extent vacuum tubes.</div> <div>Therefore, it is a fact crystal clear, that it is from the above breed and follow up from the electronic industry that such devices like Digital incubator was able to be made, Digital incubator is therefore device designed to keep chicken and babies at a required temperature when they are delivered prematurely especially as it applies to babies.  It is used to keep them worm.</div> <div>It is commendable to note here that with the help of

Now a day the road accident is increasing clay by day due to careless driving. Breaking of traffic rules. Insufficient traffic police and absence of traffic control system on the road. Everyone has different types of vehicles resulting in rise to the numbers of vehicles. Traffic light is the one of the vital public facilities plays an important role to the road user. Traffic signal light is used to control the movement of vehicles and passengers so that traffic can flow smoothly and safety. Traffic signals lights have been around for years and arc used to efficiently control traffic through intersection. Although traffic signal light are relatively simple, they are critical for ensuring the safety of the driving area. That’s why traffic lights are used to avoid traffic jams and accidents. The growing use of traffic lights attests to their effectiveness in directing traffic flow, reducing the number of accident.</p> <p>                                           <strong>  Figure1.1 traffic signal light</strong></p> <p><strong>1.2 Project:</strong></p> <p>These projects consist of two IC 555 and 4017. IC 555 is connected as astable multivibrator which generates the square wave which is determined by resistor, capacitor and potentiometer. The square wave is generated at output pins of IC 555 is given to the IC 4017, because the output pin of IC 555 is connected to the input pin of IC 4017.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Advantages:</strong></p> <p>Traffic signals lights will improve the road safety and reduce congestion by providing the signals orderly through junctions. Traffic control lights are provided for traffic control on streets and highways. The traffic signals are cyclically displayed through a suitable timing and control mechanism. A traffic light has three colours which are RED, Yellow and green. Each colour has their own signs. The red light means the driver has to stop their driving. The yellow light indicates that driver has to ready to stop their ride. However if the driver is too close to the line that is not safe to stop, they have to continue driving. Green light gives the driver free license to drive through the intersection. Traffic light has proved to be an amazing way to slop the vehicular collision and control the traffic jams. <br/><strong>1.4 Disadvantages:</strong> <br/> 2. Failure of signal due to electric power failure. <br/> 2. Improper design and location of signal may lead to violation of control system. <br/> 3. Circuit diagram is complex so there are chances of short circuit. </p> <p><strong>1.5 Future </strong><strong>Scope:</strong></p> <p>Nowadays there are so many researches that have been done in order to enhance the traffic light function to improve the movement of the vehicle flow on the road especially at the junctions. Based on observation and researches, the condition now is fixed time mode. It means the timer for all of roads are constant timer. It cannot detect a busy and non-busy road we use the traffic signal in which delay time is displayed on the signal this project is using Verilog HDL (hardware description language) to write coding for simulation and using gate logic to implement in hardware. </p>                                                         \n\nCONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN OF TRAFFIC LIGHHT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN OF TRAFFIC LIGHHT", "id": 101}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>DEDICATION</strong></p> <p>We dedicate this project work to Almighty God, the source of all knowledge, wisdom and understanding, for being there for us throughout the period of our study and to our lovely parents, Mr. and Mrs. Abido, and Sir &amp; Lady Christopher Korugbo for their parental care, who has always been our inspiration.</p> <p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</strong></p> <p>Thanks to God Almighty, the source and supplier of all potential, the father of all creation for the privilege to go through our first degree without Him, nothing would have been accomplished.

This lets us recognize the battery level. Here we present a circuit that lets us know the battery level of a device from the number of LED s that are glowing It uses 10 LED’s in all. In this we used LM3914 IC.......</p> <div> <pre>CHAPTER 1</pre> <pre>INTRODUCTION</pre> <pre>1.1  PROJECT OVERVIEW</pre> <pre>            Battery level indicator is a circuit that is used to check the battery life. We can easily recognize the battery level with the help of LED’s. It uses a LM3914 driver IC use to drive 10 leds by passing through it sufficient amount of current. Brightness of leds are controlled by reference adjustable pin and reference out pin. A variable resistor is also deployed in the circuit to have variable input voltage at pin 5 of the driver IC. Since the driver IC has two modes of operation which is bar graph mode and dot mode, it enables us to have indication of the battery life either in bar form or in dot form.                                                                                               We can have coloured lods to indicate state of the batteries like first three leds will indicate low battery. Green leds will indicate full battery. Thus by using various coloured leds representation of battery life will be made easy to understand. Cascading the driver ICs we can increase the range of battery input in terms of voltage.                                                             In the below given block diagram we have 4 blocks. One is the power supply. other is the driver IC itself. We will have a led block and an input block. A reference input for comparison purpose. Leds will glow according to the input given and the reference Input present.</pre> <pre>            Power supply is ranging around 12 to 18V. Reference voltage is pre decided which is 1.25mV. Any dc signal lying in the range of the power supply is judged and the level is indicated by the leds. The current through the leds is controlled by the internal adjustment.    </pre> </div> <p><br/></p> <p>2         The battery level indicator consists of very less component and thus occupies very little space of the surrounding. Since only DC input voltage levels are indicated, components which work in AC supply can be used to detect AC levels. Since AC voltage having continuously varying amplitudes the leds will turn ON and OFF continuously making a good looking pattern. Thus our battery level indicator can be used for decoration purpose also.</p> <pre><strong>1.2</strong><strong>ADVANTAGES</strong></pre> <pre>v  A battery level indicator is with electronic appliances to arrange as to display, on an indicator, a real time voltage detected by voltage indicator.</pre> <pre>v  Indicator indicates how much power the battery will be able to supply to electronic apparatus.</pre> <pre>v  It is used to check the battery level with the help of LED’s for example if three LED’s, indicates battery capacity of 30 percent. And if 10 LED’s glow then it is 100 percent.</pre> <pre>v  Easily indicate the battery level</pre> <pre>v  Enhanced version of this circuitry is the present mobile phone battery level indication system</pre> <pre>v  This circuit can be used in household applications like INVERTER. This circuit connected to inverter can help the users to know when to charge and when to leave the inverter idle</pre> <pre>v  Minimized version of this circuit can be also used for automobiles to indicate the battery level and low cost.</pre> <pre><strong>1.3</strong><strong>DISADVANTAGES</strong></pre> <pre>v In case of voltage matching, correct level wouldn’t be indicated</pre> <pre>v 1f input voltage is higher than the calibrated voltage, for full scale input error will be shown.</pre> <pre><strong>1.4</strong><strong>FUTURE SCOPE</strong></pre> <p>This project can be further extended in a useful manner, The basic design of battery level indication using single IC LM39 14 can be further improved by adding display control function and alert mechanisms to enable the easy knowing of the battery level. Instead of using the LED’S and LED controller in this circuit using a microcontroller can enable battery level indication as in mobile phones.</p>                                                         \n\nCONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN OF BATTERY LEVEL INDICATOR CIRCUIT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN OF BATTERY LEVEL INDICATOR CIRCUIT", "id": 102}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>DEDICATION</strong></p> <p>I dedicate this project work to Almighty God, the source of all knowledge, wisdom and understanding, for being there for me throughout the period of my study and to my lovely parents, Mr. and Mrs. (write name here) for their parental care, who has always been my inspiration.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE===================================1</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION==================================1</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1  </strong><strong>Overview====================================== 1-2</strong></p> <p><strong>1.2.

The document contains the procedure right from drawing the circuit diagram on the page to its implementation on the Printed Circuit Board. It includes the information of the basic components of electronics like the capacitor, resistor, diodes and also a little bit information of the integrated circuit CD4047. It has the information about the software used that is the Proteus software which is very useful in designing the very important part of the project i.e., the PCB layout without which one cannot imagine to implement the circuit in its materialistic form. The Proteus schematic capture module also provides a very high degree of control over the drawing appearance, in terms of line widths, fill styles. Fonts, etc. although the designing of the circuit on proteus software is a tedious job. it is just very much useful for the operator to get the signal that the circuit is working on software basis. But it does not mean that the circuit will also run in the materialistic form. </p> <p>Also the books which were referred for accomplishment of this project work are quite helpful. The project has an abstract of all those books which are written in the reference section of this file report. One can also refer those books instead of referring this, but that would be very much tedious job to find each and every topic in those books, it would be rather easy to read this material and get an overview. For further information one is advised to refer the books. This project file will also help the reader to implement the same project and other projects of this type to implement on their own. </p> <p>The project also reveals the hard work done by the writer to make this page printed project in material form. It is the reflection of dedication which the implementer of the project has towards it. Although it was all done by the student it would not be wrong to describe here that the guide of this project work has helped a lot and at the same time encouraged to implement this all new project and a very new and interesting things in our course of engineering. <br/><strong>1.2. Basics of the </strong><strong>project</strong>:</p> <p>In this document one can understand the very basics of electronic</p> <p> Components, PCB designing, the software Proteus and all the questions which one may come across while doing sonic electronics project for the first time. This abstract contains information about the software Proteus, right from its manufacturer the Lab-center Electronics to the key components used in the design procedure for the inverter circuit. It also includes the problems which the circuit may have to face if there is some kind of distortion in the applied input or some voltage fluctuations may also occur as result of improper power supply and the project deals with all these problems.</p> <p> One can also know about voltages and currents flowing through each component in the circuit as per the mathematical calculations done in the record. The abbreviations included in the record are easy to understand and are explained in detail at the end of chapter 04 with all their long forms. The reference in the same chapter will help the reader to go to the particular sites and will help the reader to clear his)her doubts, if any. Chapter 03 includes analysis of the mini-project which will help him understand about the circuit of inverter that how it works, the basic ideology used in the designing of circuit. One would be able to understand about why a particular component of particular ratings only is used in the circuit in this chapter. The same chapter also includes the circuit diagram of simple 100w inverter along with the ratings of the components. </p> <p>We will also come across Proteus Virtual System Modeling (VSM which combines mixed mode SPICE circuit simulation, animated components and microprocessor models to facilitate co-simulation of complete microcontroller based designs. As an abstract one can say that the overall project helps to learn about the smallest component in detail. A person who is very much unknown to these components will get the basic idea as well as a little bit of deep idea for example about the polarities of the components used, which capacitors require to he connected in correct polarity and which no. how much power or current is required for LEDs which is a light activated device. </p> <p><strong>1.3 Block diagram and </strong><strong>its description:</strong></p> <p>The block diagram of simple 100w inverter consists of a battery which is the power source for the entire circuit. In the block diagram battery supply is given to the MOSFET driver where it will convert DC to AC and the resulting AC is given to the step up transformer from the step up transformer we will get the original voltage.....</p>                                                         \n\nCONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN OF 1.5KVA INVERTER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN OF 1.5KVA INVERTER", "id": 103}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</strong></p> <p>Thanks to God Almighty, the source and supplier of all potential, the father of all creation for the privilege to go through my first degree without Him, nothing would have been accomplished.

It measures the closeness of body to obstacles (both animate and inanimate) that may not be visible to the driver or that the driver may yet not have realized (NEMA, 2013).</p> <p>Previous researcher has discussed the proximity issue in construction including injury and fatality statistics of collisions between construction equipment and workers. Because construction projects often involve many repetitive tasks, construction workers can experience decreased awareness and loss of focus (Pratt et al. 2001, Teizer et al. 2010). Construction equipment operator visibility, specifically operator blind spots, can be a major factor in contact collisions between construction equipment and ground workers (Fullerton et al. 2009). A real-time proximity detection and warning system is needed on construction jobsites to warn equipment operators of hazardous proximity situations.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>The problem statements regarding this project are:</p> <p>Ø The usage sensors of are on the rise from time to time but there are no cheaper design that is constructed to detect object (animate and inanimate at closed proximity.</p> <p>Ø The most common type of proximity sensor is the infrared, ultrasonic types and when they are faulty component are rare to see in the market.</p> <p>Ø An alternate method of designing distance proximity sensors needs to be developed to curb the scarcity of electronics for measuring distance.</p> <p>Ø Scientific laboratory experiment are carried out without safety awareness, safety consciousness has to be improved in schools laboratories.</p> <p><strong>1.3   AIM AND OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT  </strong></p> <p>The aim and objective of this project is to highlight and construct a distance proximity sensor using Light Dependent Resistor (L.D.R). Proximity sensors have been constructed in many different ways but this Light dependent resistors type is more sensitive than inductive and capacitive sensors which are rarely used in circuit designs. This is because it is a photocell that works on the principle of photoconductivity whose resistance value decreases when light intensity of light decreases. Light dependent resistors are also called optoelectronic devices when exposed to source of light with high intensity will automatically lights up the light emitting diodes.</p> <p><strong>1.4      </strong><strong>SCOPE OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>Proximity sensors comes in various design voltages and ohms the choice of a particular sensor then depends on its function either for construction of automatic street light circuit, simple fire alarm circuit, light activated circuit,, automated LED emergency light and night security light. The project tends to cover the design of distance sensor using light dependent resistors and LED to indicated obstacles at close proximity to the device.</p> <p>1.5   LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The project work deals on the construction of proximity sensor for light meters thus the limitation of study could be likened to financial constraint, time consumption and difficulties encountered while getting materials for the design.</p>                                                         \n\nDISTANCE PROXIMITY SENSOR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DISTANCE PROXIMITY SENSOR", "id": 104}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><em>ABSTRACT</em></p> <p><em>In this project work, we are mostly concern about building a simple power streetlight which is automatically operated.

This means, without light, the whole world is in darkness and as a result of this, living things be it plants, animals or human beings cannot exist.</p> <p>          When talking about lighting, it comes from two different sources, which could be natural or electrical. The former comes from the Creator (God) while the latter is a result of our natural resources being utilized effectively by human beings. Since there is need for lighting, electric energy generation is employed to solve the problems people are facing during the day, especially at night when there is total darkness everywhere.</p> <p>          Since the invention of electrical energy for lighting, it is quite obvious that it requires human intervention to control the switch either off when not in use or ONM when the need arises. Due to this factor and poor supply of electricity, we have been able to find and alternative way of generating electricity for the purpose of illumination which is highly efficient and effective through the energy from the sun known as solar energy.</p> <p>          This involves the use of a module called solar panel, which receive the energy from the sun and convert it to electricity.</p> <p>Basically, this project focused on the design and construction of a solar operated automatic streetlight. This is a commercial quality light that can easily illuminate the streets and other areas of choice giving the potential of many years of trustworthy use with a minimum of maintenance required.</p> <p>          The four major components needed to build construct a solar powered streetlight are: The solar panel, high efficiency d.c. Temperature, charge controller and a battery.</p> <p>          The solar panel has its major task to convert the sun’s energy into electricity, precisely D.C voltage. The basic circuitry on solar powered streetlights consists essentially of a automatic battery charger, fed by the solar panel and a lighting controller automated for dusk to down operation.</p> <p>          The charge controller projects the battery from over-charging, maximizes the charging voltage and current output of the solar panel.</p> <p>          To achieve the automatic operation of the streetlight, a photocell or a time, which senses the period of darkness and lightness, is used to trigger.</p> <p>          The type of battery employed here is a maintenance free one, which is capable of supplying few days of back up power in case of bad weather or charger failure. Also the lamp used in this project work is a D.C operated lamp.</p> <p><strong>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This project is carried out so as to provide an alternative means of generating electricity through sunlight for lighting purpose.</p> <p>Also, the effective utilization of natural resources (sunlight) is ensured by the design of this project.</p> <p>          The components required in carrying out this project which are solar panel, battery charge controller, which contains the resistors, capacitors, led and diode, bulb are efficient enough to yield the desired result without the use of power converter.</p> <p>          Therefore, the use of Direct Current (D.C) operated lamp are employed, specifically, LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes).</p> <p><strong>1.2     AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The aims and objectives of this project are:</p> <p>To power up a street lighting system through solar energy.</p> <p>To protect the solar battery from quick deterioration as a result of continuous day and night working.</p> <p>To control a solar powered streetlight automatically.</p> <p>To utilize the naturally endowed resource (sun).</p> <p><strong>1.3     SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This project design is centered on solar energy as fast growing technology for street lighting with the use of a solar module. The automatic control process of the light can be achieved by a photocell. Or a LDR (Light Depending Resistor) which eliminates human intervention for manual switching or control/</p> <p><strong>1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The significance of the design and construction of solar operated Automatic Street light cannot be overemphasized in the sense that it is financially viable particularly in areas where the cost of providing a main supply is prohibitive. It has the capability of illuminating large surface area of land due to high efficiency of the lamp used. Also, it does not require human intervention to control its operation and finally, power outages have no impact whatsoever on it.</p> <p><strong>1.5     METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>In the process of searching for information on this project, relevant textbooks, journals and related past project reports in the library were consulted. Also, several visits to relevant web sites on the Internet cannot be overloaded.</p> <p><strong>1.6     LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Every project’s have its limitation. The major limitation of this project is that sunlight used to generate the electricity is not readily available especially at winter period.</p> <p>As a result, the streetlight requires the need for a large battery to use in order to provide at least three days of stand by operation during cloudy weather without discharging the battery below its safe operating limit.</p>                                                          \n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AUTOMATIC SOLAR STREET LIGHT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AUTOMATIC SOLAR STREET LIGHT", "id": 105}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>TITTLE PAGE</strong> </p> <p><strong>CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN</strong></p> <p><strong>OF </strong><strong>POLICE SIREN</strong></p> <p><strong>BY</strong></p> <p><strong>(NAME HERE)</strong></p> <p><strong>(MAT NO HERE)</strong></p> <p><strong>A PROJECT WORK SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS, FACULTY OF SCIENCE, MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY, </strong></p> <p><strong>NEW YORK.</strong></p> <p><strong>IN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS</strong></p> <p><strong>FOR THE AWARD OF B.Sc (HONS).

Civil defense sirens are mounted in fixed locations and used to warn of natural disasters or attacks. Sirens are used on emergency service vehicles such as ambulance, police cars and fire trucks. There are two general types of siren:</p> <p>1-Pneumatic Siren <br/> 2-Electronic Siren <br/> Many fire sirens (used for calling the volunteer fire fighters) serve double duty astornado or civil defense sirens, alerting an entire community of impending danger. Most fire sirens are either mounted on the roof of a fire station, or on a pole next to the fire station. Fire sirens can also be mounted on or near government buildings, on tall structures such as water towers as well as in systems, where several sirens are distributed around a town for better sound coverage. Most fire sirens are single tone and mechanically driven by electric motors with a rotor attached to the shaft. Some newer sirens are electronically driven by speakers. Though, these are not as common. <br/> Fire sirens are often called “fire whistles”, “fire alarms”, or “fire horns.” Although there is no standard signaling of fire sirens, some utilize codes to inform fire fighters of the location of the fire. Civil defence sirens pulling double duty as a fire siren often can produce an alternating “hi-b” signal (similar to a British police car) as the fire signal, or a slow wail (typically 3x) as to not confuse the public with the standard civil defense signals of alert (steady tone) and attack (fast wavering tone). Fire sirens are often blasted once a day at noon and are also called “noon sirens” or ‘noon whistles”. <br/> Pneumatic Siren consists of a rotating disk with holes in it such that the material between the holes interrupts a flow of air from fixed holes on the outside of the unit. As the holes in the rotating disk alternately prevent and allow air to flow it results on alternating compressed and rarefied air pressure i.e. sound. It consumes large amount of energy. <br/> Electronic Siren incorporate circuits such as oscillators, modulators and amplifiers it synthesize a selected tone which is played through external speakers. It is not unusual especially in the case of modern engines, to see an emergency vehicle equipped with both types of siren. <strong><br/>1.2 PROJECT OBJECTIVE <br/></strong>          The main objective of this project is to implement Electronic Siren in both the software and hardware version. We are going to learn the PCB designing, Proteus software handling in an effective manner. At the end of this project student will be able to learn all these things. Electronic Siren is basically high-performance sound signal electronic amplifiers. These siren works with substantially higher outputs and specific demand are placed on them in terms of desired extreme reliability and different methods of control on them. Moreover control infrastructure must also be reliable and usually two independent control channels are required. <br/> The loudspeakers for these amplifiers are placed in specially- designed sound battles and they play the signals stored in the siren’s digital memory or signals fed to the siren from external sources. <br/><strong>1.3 FUTURE SCOPE</strong> <br/> It is possible to add an external signal source with these devices.

Through turns of wire is translated into a reading of voltage. Other types of voltmeter which use electrostatic forces and these are only voltmeters to measure voltage direct rather than by the effect of current. The potentiometer operates by comparing the voltage to be measured with known voltage. It is used to measure very low voltages the electronic voltmeter which has largely replaced the vacuum – tube voltmeter, uses amplification or reification (or both) to measure either alternating or direct – current voltages the current needed to activate the meter movement is not taken from the circuit being measured, hence this type of instrument does not introduce errors of circuit leading.</p> <p>However, the growth in technology, it has necessitated the use of computer for controlling the output of the voltmeter. Whereby, the display of the voltage being read is being viewed from the monitor. His kind of display could be either graphical or numerical, but the most popular type is that of numerical display, this is achieved by a series of switching actions of a micro controller, whereby the internal flow at the analog inputs.</p> <p>Meanwhile, one cannot freely talk about the computer controlled ac voltmeter, without first discussing the Analog is digital (AD) converter which has many degrees of complexity associated with testing an (A/D) converter, one of the simplest tests is to apply a known analog input voltage to the converter and use LEDS to display the resulting digital output code.</p> <p><strong>VOLTMETERS</strong></p> <p>Ac electromechanical meter movement comes in two basic arrangements. Those based on Dc movement designed and those engineered for ac use. Permanent – magnet moving coil (pmmc) meter movement will not work correctly if directly connected to alternating current, because the direction ofneele movement will change with each half cycle of the AC.</p> <p>i. <strong>Passing Ac through D’ Arsonval Meter</strong></p> <p>This causes useless flutter of the needle. In order to use a Dc style, meter such as C’ arsenal design the alternating current must be rectified into Dc. This is most easily accomplished through the use of devices called Diodes we will see diodes used in a circuit that demonstrates, the creation of harmonic frequencies from a distorted (or rectified) sine wave. Another strategy for a practical ac meter movement is to redesign the movement without the inherent polarity sensitivity of the Dc types. This means that the use of permanent magnet should be avoided.</p> <p><strong>ii. Iron Vane Electromechanically Meter Movement</strong></p> <p>Electrostatic attraction between two metals plates separated by air gap is alternative mechanism for generating a needle –movement force proportional to applied voltage. This works just as well for Ac as it does in dc or probably poorly. The force involved is small much smaller than the magnetic attraction is small much smaller than the magnetic attraction between an energized coil and iron vane and as such these “electrostatics meter movement tends to be fragile and easily disturbed by physical movement.</p> <p>With some the advantages and disadvantages of these meters movement technologies having been discussed already, there is nether factor crucially important to be designer and user of ac metering instrument to be aware of. This is the issues of Rms measurement. As we already know, Ac measurements are often cast in a scale of Dc power equivalent called RMSCRoot- Mean –Squired for the sake of meaningful comparism with Dc and with other Ac waveforms of varying shape. None of the meter movement technologies boyar discussed in gently measures RMS value of an Ac quantity. Meter movement relying on the motion of mechanical needle (“rectified D’ Arson Val, Iron-vane and Electrostatic) all tend to mechanically average the instantaneous values into an overall average value for the waveform. This average value is not necessarily the same as RMS, although many times it is mistaken as such. Average and RMS seems to be the kind of measurement most people are interested in obtaining with an instrument and electromechanical meter movement naturally deliver average measurement rather than RMS, what are Ac meter designers to do? Cheat of course! Typically the assumption is made that the wave form shape to be measured is going to be sine and then the meter movement scale is altered by the appropriate multiplication factor. For sine waves we see that RMS is equal to 0.77 times the peak value while average is 0.637 times the Reek, so we can divide one figure by the other to obtain an average to RMS conversion factor of 1.109.</p> <p>=&gt; 0.707 =1.1099</p> <p>0.637</p> <p>With square waves, the RMS and Average value are identical! An Ac meter calibrated to accurately read RMS voltage or current on a pure sine wave will not give the proper the proper value while indicating the magnitude of anything other than a perfect sine wave. This includes triangle waves, square waves, or kind of distorted sine wave. With harmonics becoming an ever- present phenomenon in large Ac power systems,. This matter of accurate RMS measurement is no small matter.</p>                                                         \n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AC VOLTMETER USING COMPUTER INTERFACE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AC VOLTMETER USING COMPUTER INTERFACE", "id": 107}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE ELECTRICAL DESIGN AND INSTALLATION REQUIREMENT FOR A MEGA FILLING STATION</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>A mega filling station can be described from its name –MEGA; which means larger in size.

The increase in automobile ownership resulted in a greater demand for filling stations. A filling station can be described as a fuel station outlet where motorists, cyclists, industrial fuel-users, commercial fuel-users and Domestic fuel users purchase fuel of various forms for use. At these outlet, three major fuels stand out, which are PREMIUM SPIRIT (PMS), DIESEL (AGO) and KEROSENE (DPK). The premium spirit is used by motorists whose engines are designed for it, the diesel by diesel-engine automobiles and the kerosene mostly by domestic user at their various houses.</p> <p>As of 2007, there were 9,271 petrol stations in the U.K, down from about 18,000 in 1992. the U.S.A had 12, 446 filling stations (gas stations) in 2000 according to the census. In the Canada, the number on the decline to about 14,000. In the following countries numbers of stations are rising. Turkey- 12,139 petrol stations (2008), -8,200 petrol stations (2008), South Africa -6,500 petrol stations, Kenya -1,300 petrol stations, Tazania -1000 and Malawi - 500 [from internet: filling station – Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia].</p> <p>As the demand for fuel consumption around the world increases, the need to build more filling stations in various forms and types becomes inevitable. As a result of these development, the name “MEGA FILLING STATION” resulted as one of the various forms and types of filling stations that sells fuel to the public. Other people may choose to call theirs MINI, MEDIUM or any other mane depending on what they have in mind as oil-marketers around the world. The point of interest to us here, is the MEGA FILLING STATION.”</p> <p><strong>1.1 A MEGA FILLING STATION</strong></p> <p>It can be described from its name- mega which means some thing bigger or larger in size. This implies that Mega Filling station is a large-scale fuel station outlets where fuels of various forms are sold. A typical example is the NNPC MEGA FILLING STATION around our various states in Nigeria. Each of the NNPC MEGA FILLING STATION has nothing less than twenty fuel dispenser pumps (Ten double nozzle dispensers) and the one in Abuja has twenty eight fuel dispensers pumps (fourteen double nozzle dispensers).</p> <p>The NNPC mega filling station has a steel canopy, a 360 sqm shop building for Abuja (and 160 sqm for other states) with office and attendant’s room. The facility also has bullet proofed casher room, car workshop, sound-proofed generator house, a forecourt and perimeter fence.</p> <ol><li><ol><li> <p><strong>ELECTRICAL DESIGN</strong></p> </li> </ol></li></ol> <p>The design of a mega filling station and its attendant gadgets makes electricity an inevitable source of power supply. Base on this fact, there must be an electrical design that must give a blue-print on which a Mega filling station must be wired.</p> <p>An electrical design is a design describing a blue-print or pattern in which structures like a building, an industrial lay outs, a community or such like can be wired electrically. It is designed by an electrical engineer with various symbols representing various features or electrical accessories in the actual structure based on the Architectural design from an Architect.</p> <p>Along side an electrical design is a table of symbols called “LEGEND”. The legend contains all the symbols found in the electrical design of the structure with an explanation attached to each symbol, telling those who look into it what they mean.</p> <p>Another feature attached to the electrical design, is the ‘LOAD CHART AND BALANCING TABLE”. This feature explains how loads are distributed and balanced in the Distribution Board of the structure design electrically by the electrical engineer. Another important feature of the electrical design, is the FUSE ARRANGEMENT. This feature is so important to the design because it specifically stipulates the ratings of each fuse and the circuit coming into it from the designed structure. It shows whether the structure is a single phase or three phase system and the ratings of fuses allocated to each phase. It also reveals that the earthling must be connected to the body of the Distribution Board which links the whole Earthing of the structure. The various sizes of cables required can be seen at a glance from that fuse arrangement design. Things like gear switch and change-over switch are also necessary for such a structure like filling station.</p> <ol><li><ol><li> <p><strong>ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION REQUIREMENT</strong></p> </li> </ol></li></ol> <p>The electrical installation requirements differ from one design to the other and from one structure to the other. The following are necessary in an electrical installation of a building:</p> <ul><li> <p>Lighting points</p> </li> <li> <p>Switches</p> </li> <li> <p>Socket outlets</p> </li> <li> <p>Air condition outlets</p> </li> <li> <p>Hot water Heater</p> </li> <li> <p>Pvc cables of the required sizes</p> </li> <li> <p>Earthing system</p> </li> <li> <p>Accessories of the required types</p> </li> <li> <p>Distribution board of the required types</p> </li> <li> <p>Change-over switch</p> </li> <li> <p>Main control Gear switch</p> </li> </ul> <p>The list above is just to give an idea of some basic electrical installation requirements for a building. These requirements can be used for surface, concealed conduit or trunk wirings.</p>                                                          \n\nTHE ELECTRICAL DESIGN AND INSTALLATION REQUIREMENT FOR A MEGA FILLING STATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ELECTRICAL DESIGN AND INSTALLATION REQUIREMENT FOR A MEGA FILLING STATION", "id": 108}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This project is all about Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR), and is a circuit that monitors the input voltage at any point and display the regulated voltage level on the analog meter.

The voltage source and the load are each connected to two taps, one tap at the end of the winding is a common connection to both circuit (source and load).

Since insulators cannot resist indefinite amount of energy, with enough voltage applied, any insulating material will eventually succumb to the electrical pressure and electron flow will occur and once current is forced through an insulating material, breakdown of that material’s molecular structure has occurred.

Chapter 3 deals with the function of the individual components of the equipment, the working principle as well as the circuit diagram. Chapter 4 deals with the main project design, testing, results and the observations while Chapter 5 presents the conclusion and the recommendations.</p> <p><strong>Chapter One</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Insulation is the isolation between conductors of electrical power system. It may be solid, liquid, gas or vacuum. The insulation deterioration and its effects are two phenomena that must be familiar with by any electrical or maintenance engineer if adequate safety of equipment and personnel and continous service to consumers are to be maintained.</p> <p>Since the introduction of electricity in the 19th century, there has been a growing demand for electrical energy. Higher voltages led the researchers to develop new types of insulators. Many natural insulators, which were widely used at the beginning of this century, have been replaced by ceramic or porcelain materials. Many of these suffer from low impact strength, inflexibility, cracking during the manufacturing process, etc. A great variety of organic insulating materials are being used as electrical insulation in cables, machines, switch boards, outgoing lines and since these devices are being used under severe ambient conditions, breakdown of the insulating material has become a serious problem and it has a strong influence on safety and reliability of the insulators. </p> <p>Deterioration of insulators occurs as a result of ageing and stresses imposed on them during their normal working life. The end result of the occurrence is the damaging or shortening of the life span of electrical equipment being protected by these insulators. Occasionally, personnel and environment in which such system is being operated are negatively affected. Also, the cost of replacement of the equipment is another effect that must not be over-looked.</p> <p>This project deals with the determination of dielectric strength of insulators by investigating / determining the voltage that can breakdown a particular insulator. The result of this preliminary study on solid insulator show that every insulator has a particular voltage that it can withstand without breaking down that insulator’s molecular structure.</p> <p>Generally, a survey of previous equipment used by the various researchers was found to be very complicated and expensive and such equipment cannot be afforded by local Nigerian researchers due to cost. It was this that necessitated us to come up with a locally made equipment to detect the breakdown of insulators due to excess voltage in practical system. The construction is simple, cheap and reliable.</p>\n\nTHE CONSTRUCTION OF LABORATORY EQUIPMENT FOR THE DETERMINATION / INVESTIGATION OF ELECTRICAL INSULATOR BREAKDOWN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE CONSTRUCTION OF LABORATORY EQUIPMENT FOR THE DETERMINATION / INVESTIGATION OF ELECTRICAL INSULATOR BREAKDOWN", "id": 110}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The term “critical point” is sometimes used to denote specifically the vapour-liquid critical point of a material.

For example, a mercury-in-glass thermometer converts the measured temperature into expansion and contraction of a liquid which can be read on a calibrated glass tube. A thermocouple converts temperature to an output voltage which can be read by a voltmeter. For accuracy, all sensors need to be calibrated against known standards.</p> <p>A sensor is a device which receives and responds to a signal or stimulus. Here the term “stimulus” means a property or a quantity that needs to be converted into electrical form. Hence, sensor can be defined as a device which receives a signal and converts it into electrical form which can be further used for electronic devices.</p> <p>Sensor sensitivity indicates how much the sensor’s output mercury in a thermometer moves 1 cm when the temperature changes by 1°C, the sensitivity is 1cm/°C. Sensors that measures very small changes by changes must have very high sensitivities. Sensors also have impact on what they measure; for instant, a room temperature thermometer inserted into a got cup of liquid cools the liquid while the liquid heats the thermometer. Sensors need to the designed to have a small effect on what is measured; making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other advantages.</p> <p><strong>CLASSIFICATION OF MEASUREMENT ERRORS</strong></p> <p>A good sensor obeys the following rules:</p> <p>1) It’s sensitive to the measure property;</p> <p>2) It’s insensitive to any other property;</p> <p>3) It does not influence the measured property.</p> <p>Ideal sensors are designed to be linear. The output signal of such a sensor is linearly proportional to the value of the measured property. The sensitivity is then defined as the ratio between the output signal and measured property. For example if a sensor measures temperature and has a voltage output, the sensitivity is a constant with the unit [V/K]. This sensor is linear because the ratio is constant at all points of measurement.</p> <p><strong>TYPES OF TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT SENSORS </strong></p> <p>1) THERMOCUPLE TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT SENSORS:</p> <p>Thermocouple consists essential of two strings or wire made of different metals and joined at one end. Changes in the temperature at the juncture induce a change in electromotive force (emf) between the other ends. As temperature goes up, this output emf of the thermocouple rises, though not necessarily linear.</p> <p>2) RESISTANCE TEMPARATURE DEVICES (RTD)</p> <p>Resistive temperature devices capitalize on the fact that the electrical resistance of a material changes as its temperature changes. Two key types are the metallic devices (commonly referred to as RTD) and thermistor.</p> <p>As their name indicates, RTD rely on resistance change in a metal with the resistance rising more or less linearly with temperature. Thermistors are based on resistance change in a ceramic semi conductor. The resistance drops nonlinearly with temperature rise.</p> <p>3) INFRARED TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT DEVICES</p> <p>Infrared sensors are non-contacting devices. They infer temperature by measuring the thermal radiation emitted by a material.</p> <p>4) BIMETALLIC TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT DEVICE</p> <p>Bimetallic device takes advantage of the difference, if rate of thermal expansion between different metals strips of two metals are bonded together. When heated one side will expand more than the other and the resulting bonding is translated into a temperature reading by mechanical linkage to a pointer.</p> <p>5) FLUID EXPANSION TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT DEVICES</p> <p>Fluid-expansion devices, typified by the household thermometer, generally come in two main classifications: the measuring type and the organic-liquid type. Versions employing gas instead of liquid are also available. Mercury is considered an environmental hazard, so there are regulations governing the shipment of devices that contain it. Fluid-expansion sensors do not require electric power. They do pose explosion hazards, and are stable even after repeater cycling.</p>\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF CRITICAL TEMPERATURE ALARM SYSTEM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONSTRUCTION OF CRITICAL TEMPERATURE ALARM SYSTEM", "id": 111}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div align=\"center\">EFFECT OF FRAUD MANAGEMENT ON A SURVIVAL OF A COMPANY<br/></div><div align=\"center\">(A CASE STUDY OF FIRST BANK NIGERIA PLC, UGHELLI BRANCH) <br/></div><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>        This topic is on “Effect of Fraud Management on a Survival of a Company” with special reference to First Bank Nigeria Plc.

This is as a result of the oil boom expansion in the 1970s which led to the massive expansion of economic activities and consequent increase in the number of banks complied with the indigenization policy of the federal government at a time.<br/>          It has to be noted that a fraudulent act without damage or damage without fraudulent act is not actionable. But fraud is actionable if it leads to the expenses of another.<br/>          The state of condition of ours should not be allowed to go on as this may cripple very seriously into the financial system of the country. This is, if not properly addressed, the need to properly check this pervasion therefore geared this research work. Therefore, the work is based on a survival of the company without First Bank of Nigeria Plc Ughelli branch as case study.<br/>         This type of fraud, modes of execution, causes a fraud and recipes are all going to be examined.<br/><div>    <br/></div><div>Statement of the Problem</div>           Banks are industries that are mainly dealing with cash and other financial instrument; therefore the degree of the fraud will be much higher than any other industry, this has exposed banks to a persistence target for fraudsters.<br/>           The effect of fraud on the survival in our banks cannot be over emphasized. The effect is so large that huge amount of financial loss of both banks and their customers, the deflation of shareholders fund and bank capital based sources of extreme embezzlement to bank cannot easily be qualified in terms of monetary.<br/>          The time, money energy and other measurable equity use to checkmate the fraudulent attitude would have been explained in improving customer’s services and also the staff of the bank, in fact all the shareholders. Very unfortunately, all these can lead to increases in running cost and major setback for the nation’s effect at promoting bank habit.<br/>          Frankly speaking, it is on read that had led to the closure of banks and financial pains in other part of the world and this may not be possible if the current trend is not checked.<br/>          The rate of occurrence has reached a dangerous height in which all shareholders find way if not eliminating it but minimizing it as a reasonable consideration. This project, by way of contribution is designed to examine the effect of fraud management on a survival of a company with First Bank Plc, Ughelli Branch as a case study.<br/><div><br/></div><div>    Research Question</div>         The work is guided by the following;<br/>    How can the problem be controlled in our bank?<br/>    What is the magnitude of fraud in the banks?<br/>    How effective are fraud control measures in our banks?<br/>    Can we ever have sufficient information to predict the occurrence of fraud?<br/>    What are the causes of fraud in bank?<br/>    What are statutory laws relating to fraud and financial malpractice in bank?<br/>From above questions of the problems of this work there need to provide a workable solution.<br/><br/>Objectives of the Study<br/>           The main objectives of lives research work is to look for practical ways of reducing the incidence of fraud in our companies especially the banking system using first of Nigeria Plc, Ughelli branch as a case study of the immediate objective of the following;<br/>    To review the existing literature in respect of frauds in the banking system.<br/>    To examine the internal control system with respect to the selected banks in Nigeria, and evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the system as a tool for fraud control.<br/>    to ascertain degree of companies of the banks staff with the internal control measures.<br/>    To identify possible defects or loopholes (if any) in the system.<br/>    To offer useful recommendation based on the finding on how best to curb the incidence of fraud in the banking system.<br/>    To examine the relevance and appropriateness in preventing fraud.<br/>    To identify the means through which the recommendation can be effectively be implemented.<br/><div><br/></div><div>        Scope of the Study</div>           The topic has been chosen to highlight the effect of fraud management on a survival of the company. However, the study covers banking segment of the banking industry in Nigeria with reference to FIRST BANK (NIG) Plc Ughelli Branch as a case study.<br/>          As at the end of the December, 1998, there were 64 commercial banks in Nigeria with 229 branches nationwide that are insured with the Nigeria deposit insurance cooperation. But because of the negative use of human ingenuity and endowment, most of the banks collapse.<br/>          Indeed, fraud has long been perpetrated in our bank identified and classified as follows;<br/>    Theft of cash suppression of lodgement<br/>    Opening and operating of fraudulent loans account<br/>    Clearing fraud<br/>    Falsification of account<br/>    Cashiering fraud<br/>    Forged cheque with forged signature<br/>    Cross firming of cheque and kite flying<br/>Many measures have been introduced especially at the individual bank level to combat this menacing problem with much success. The most threatening aspect; however is that the control of identified types of fraud is destructive indication of the negative use of human ingenuity and endowment.<br/>The need to provide effective solution that is dynamic to the justified way of this work. The type of fraud, method of perpetrating, fraud, cause of bank fraud nature of fraud, magnitude of fraud and recommendation ways of fraud prevention and minimization will be highlighted in this research work.<br/><br/>    Significance of the Study<br/>           It is a general consensus that the financial system in any economy is the fulcrum around which the economy resolves without this preview banks strategically occupy on indispensable position in the economy. This is a result of their primary function of servicing as channel or intermediary between the surplus economic unit hence the efficient functioning of the economic.<br/>          In carrying out this study, the researcher intends to highlight the applying and benefit of cost effectively applying appropriate and correct fraud and prevention and detection measure. This will serve as a bench mark particularly to the distressed banks whose unfortunate fraud and other malpractices. Analysis will definitely be of importance to the policy makers in that it will help them in assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of the existing statutory loans and policy and highlight the areas that need further efforts.<br/>          The study also aims at treating how a well designed, carefully installed and a resolutely implemented internal control system will aid in checking the incidence of fraud internal control is strongly believed will be important not only to the regulatory and supervisory authorities and companies or bank management but the banking system for the country.<br/>         The study will at its end to be important to the general public who’s confident and trust have been vehemently shakes as result of the alarming magnitude of fraudulent activities failure and distress syndrome in our in our banking system. It will make them to be aware of unrelenting concerted efforts that have been made and being made by government and the regulatory authorities to bring an end to the cankerworm called frauds.<br/>         Furthermore, the study is designed for all those who may be interested in carrying out further study on the interest control system as it relates to fraud prevention in Nigeria companies.<br/><br/>    Research Hypothesis<br/>          Research on fraud risk explains frauds as the interaction of three causal influences affecting a potential perpetration, incentive, opportunity and attitude. Incentive or motivation results from a perceived pressure on a person to commit fraud. For example, management may be given large incentive bonuses based on accounting income. Alternatively, an employee may have significant obligations that exceed his or her earning power. Opportunity results from conditions or situation that would allow a person to commit fraud. For example, lack of sufficient board oversight may allow to in appropriately manipulating reported earning to reach analysis forecasts. Alternatively, lack of appropriate monitoring or segregation of duties may allow an employee to embezzle funds. Attitude or character is what allows a person rationalize selfish gain at the expenses of the others will commit fraud when incentive and opportunity exist. Importantly each of these factors is necessary but not a sufficient condition for fraud effect assessment should consider the interaction of these factors.<br/><br/>    Definitions Terms<br/>    It is act courses of deception deliberately practice to gain unlawful and unfair advantage.

(A CASE STUDY OF MARKETS IN OWERRI)</b><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>Fire safety in market is determined by a number of factors: the provisions of means of regulation against  fire out break, the ability for a building to resist the effects of fire and to minimize the spread of fire and smoke and the provision of means of access to enable fire-fighters to effect rescue and fight fire.<br/>Building (Planning) Regulations which include the requirements for fire resisting construction, means of escape and means of access for fire fighting and rescue to market. In addition, it also provides guidelines on the testing standards for the fire properties of building elements and components, fire safety management of market and the alternative approach in fire safety design, i.e. fire engineering approach. <br/>Research Methodology: The aim of this chapter is to briefly intimate the reader with various research designs used by the researchers. And Chi-square were used to analyse the techniques used.<br/>presentation, analysis and interpretation of data: This chapter deals with the presentations, analysis and interpretation of the da8ta collected. The data collected will be used to answer the research questions and test the hypothesis.<br/>In conclusion Fire drills in markets are usually conducted as a part of orientation program for traders latter the drills are supplemented with in service training for the traders personnel, including the emergency procedures.<br/>  CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>According to Bryman and Bell (2003) in the research work of Omoniyi (2011), Fire safety and evacuation plans outline traders duties and responsibilities in time of emergency. Ongoing training is required to help ensure that traders is aware of those duties and responsibilities. Fire drills serve as an opportunity for traders members to demonstrate, under simulated fire conditions, that they can perform those duties and responsibilities safely and efficiently. It’s also a time for them to show that they are aware of defend-in-place strategies and can take advantage of your facility’s fire safety features and egress facilities to protect the people in their care. Fire drills are more than an exercise designed to evaluate traders response to a simulated emergency. They are also a test of your facility’s fire safety/evacuation plans and traders training programs. Not all fire drills run smoothly. That’s okay, so long as traders and management learn from them and correct mistakes made. It’s important, therefore, that there be a critique of each drill so that any problems encountered can be addressed. Perhaps the problems are due to incomplete or outdated fire safety/evacuation plans. Perhaps there’s a need for additional traders training.<br/> OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The main objectives of this Fire Drill and Emergency Evacuation procedure are as below:<br/>• To provide an orderly emergency response plan for all occupants.<br/>• To ensure all exit routes, emergency staircases are not obstructed and can be used in an orderly fashion during emergencies.<br/>• To ensure fast, organised and smooth evacuation of market during emergencies.<br/>• To train fire drill and emergency evacuation officers to conduct their duties successfully.<br/>• To test the working conditions and effectiveness of all fire and emergency equipment for all markets in Imo State.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY<br/>There have been a lot of fire outbreak in most of the market  in Imo State and the world at large. Owing to this fact, the findings of this research work will be of great significant to most markets in Imo State. Though the research work was carried out within Owerri Municipal, the findings will be of great help to all the Markets in Imo State at large.<br/>1.5    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The issue of fire out break and unsafe condition in most of our markets in Owerri has become a dilapidating issuse in the state. The quest to eradicate this treat within our market is the major and primary problem that is associated with this it. The secondary problem is on how to apply the ergonomic specification in the eradication of these problems.<br/>1.6    STATEMENT OF RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>The following questions will be treated in the course of this research work thus:<br/>1. What types of work are most likely to pose fire outbreak in the market?<br/>2. Can carelessness of the traders in the market result to fire outbreak<br/>3. If yes what are the factors?<br/>4. Can we control fire outbreak in our markets?<br/>7. Do you believe that Ergonomic specification help in the control fire outbreak in the market?<br/>1.7    STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS<br/>A hypothesis is a proposition that is stated in testable form and prediction of particular relationship between two or more variables.<br/>Ho:   There is no significant relationship between Ergonomic specification and the control of industrial accident rate in agro allied industry<br/>Hi:    There is great significant relationship between Ergonomic specification and the control of industrial accident rate in agro allied industry<br/> 1.8    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>For the sake of coherency and clarity, the scope of this work does not involve in totality all the means to eradicate fire out break in our market but limits itself to the application of ergonomic specification in the eradication of accidents within the market premises. For the sake of precision, the research work will be carried out within markets in Imo State, though references of some authors will be convoked.<br/>1.9    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>SUITABILITY<br/>This can be seen as the right type or quality for a particular purpose or occasion<br/> ERGONOMIC SPECIFICATION<br/>those factors or qualities in the design of something, especially a workplace or equipment used by people at work, that contribute to comfort, efficiency, safety, and ease of use  Ergonomics, also known as human engineering or human factors engineering, the science of designing machines, products, and systems to maximize the safety, comfort, and efficiency of the people who use them.<br/> CONTROL<br/>The act of putting in order or reducing the effect of a particular entity.<br/><br/><br/>\n\nSUITABILITY OF THE APPLICATION OF FIRE DRILL IN THE PREVENTION OF MARKET FIRE  .

In conclusion Many agro allied companies in the furniture manufacturing industry have made a substantial effort to reduce work-related injuries due to heavy lifting, repetitive motion, awkward and static work postures, vibration, and other recognized ergonomic stressors.<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>Many agro allied companies in the Nigerian industries have made a substantial effort to reduce work-related injuries due to heavy lifting, repetitive motion, awkward and static work postures, vibration, and other recognized ergonomic stressors. The results achieved by these companies demonstrate that there are effective, affordable ways to protect industry employees from injury while maintaining or, in many cases increasing productivity, quality and employee morale. Lost-time work injuries caused by cumulative and acute trauma of the musculoskeletal system such as carpal tunnel syndrome and back injuries are some of the most costly workers’ compensation claims in industry today.<br/>In its 1998 national figures, Liberty Mutual Group estimates that these injuries totaled more than 41 percent of all reported injuries with an estimated $15.7 billion dollars in direct workers’ compensation costs (Liberty, 2001).<br/> Ergonomics specification is an effective approach to reducing the number and severity of these work-related injuries. Ergonomics specification is the practice of designing equipment, work tasks and work environments to conform to the capability of the worker … to create more efficient work places and prevent injuries to employees.<br/>Ergonomics, also known as human engineering or human factors engineering, the science of designing machines, products, and systems to maximize the safety, comfort, and efficiency of the people who use them. Ergonomists draw on the principles of industrial engineering, psychology, anthropometry (the science of human measurement), and biomechanics (the study of muscular activity) to adapt the design of products and workplaces to people’s sizes and shapes and their physical strengths and limitations. Ergonomists also consider the speed with which humans react and how they process information, and their capacities for dealing with psychological factors, such as stress or isolation. Armed with this complete picture of how humans interact with their environment, ergonomists develop the best possible design for products and systems, ranging from the handle of a toothbrush to the flight deck of the space shuttle.<br/>Ergonomists view people and the objects they use as one unit, and ergonomic design blends the best abilities of people and machines. Humans are not as strong as machines, nor can they calculate as quickly and accurately as computers. Unlike machines, humans need to sleep, and they are subject to illness, accidents, or making mistakes when working without adequate rest. But machines are also limited—cars cannot repair themselves, computers do not speak or hear as well as people do, and machines cannot adapt to unexpected situations as well as humans. An ergonomically designed system provides optimum performance<br/> 1.1    THE BACKGROUND OF CASE STUDY<br/>Adapalm has two oil palm plantations namely, then Ohaji plantation and Umogu plantation.<br/>The Ohaji plantation has been given its pride of place ever since the year 2005. Thus as at February 15 2010, the Ohaji plantation has no motorable access roads. Its palms were not pruned and about 65% of it was “colonized” by thick forest. There was zero replanting activity to sustain the plantation future and fortunes.<br/>At Umuogu Plantation, the Story was the same.<br/>WORK &amp; SERVICES/EQUIPMENTS<br/>As at February 2010 Adapalm had 29 vehicles consisting of light duty, heavy duty and earth moving equipments/vehicles. Out of this number 22 were bad while 7 are good. The building section had only 1 shovel and 1 head pan. There were no working tools etc. Similarly only 6 out of 14 Company Computers were in working condition while again only 4 out of 9 Adapalm printers were functional.<br/>FINANCE<br/>At the inception of the Interim Management Committee on the 15th February 2010, Adapalm had only the sum of N2,950.00k to hand  over as cash at hand to the Interim Management Committee.<br/>All bank balances were also sadly in red.<br/>ADMINISTRATIONS/SECURITY<br/>The Staff strength of Adapalm as at December 2009 stood at 792 workers. Out of this number 85 were of Senior category, 666 were of junior category while 41 were casual workers. However as at February 2010 over 35% of these workers withdrew their services due to deprived work conditions.<br/>The 154 Security workers at Adapalm for instance had only about 36 and this led to increased insecurity and brazen looting of the company properties.

Firstly computer aided design is the modelling of physical system on computer allowing both interactive and automatics analysis of design variant and the expression of design in a form of suitable for manufacturing. This follows by explaining the electronics display board as a device which is fast gaining wide acceptance and application in the present days due to its ability to provide a very high precision timing. This can be describe as an electro-mechanical system for processing information in which the information is represented by physical quantities, which are so constrained to take only discrete valuesthan can be referred to as binary signals.<br/>In this design, we are implored the used of both hardware and software to bring about the entire project. The hardware components are solely coordinated by the AT 89551 electronics display chip while the C-programming language is used to program the chip.<br/>1.1    OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT<br/>Depending on one’s intension, electronics display board system has many aims and objectives. For instance, this one in particularly aims at displaying a moveable coded letter that says “WELCOME TO SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING” also electronic display board system can be used to control the traffic minder standing among motorist especially in junctions, moreover, electronic scoreboard during football matches to used display when a goal is scored, also to display the name of that played who scored the goal, above all, this system has contributed a lot in boosting advertisement.<br/>1.2    PREAMBLES<br/>Electronics display board system, is a system electronically designed and constructed, that is used to display different information to the view of the masses. The information to be displayed could be diagrams, symbols letters, colours, numbers, codes etc depending on what is needed at a particular places and time. This without doubt, has made life easier for the people in different ways, however electronics display board, which is the heart of this system, can be described thus: an electronic display is a computer. All computers whether we are talking personal desktop computer you are using is a general-purpose computer than can run any of thousands of programs. Electronic n-display are special purpose computer Electronics display do one thing well, there are a number of other common characteristics, that defined electronic display if a computer matches a majority of these characteristics, then you can call it an electronics display.<br/>1.    Electronics displays are embedded inside some other devices (often a consumer product) so that they can control the features or action of the product. Another name for an electronics display, therefore, is embedded display.<br/>2.    Electronic display are dedicated to one task and run one specific program. The program is store in Read Only Memory (ROM) and generally does not change. Electronics displays are often low power devices. A desktop computer is almost always plugged into a well sucked and might consume 50watt of electricity. A battery operated electronics display might consume 50mw.<br/>3.    An electronics display has a dedicated input device and often (but not always) has a small LED or LED display for output. An electronics display also take from the devices it is controlling and control the device, mean while the use of an electronics display board to implement an electronics display system design made up of LED connected in common cathode matrix form is referred to as electronic display board programmable DOT matrix information display system.  This project design is a welcome compliment that “SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING”<br/>1.3    JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT<br/>Due to the various problems encountered in the manual/analyze design and construction of sign post for advertisement, there is every need for an automated electronics display system that will solve this problem. This will ensure that viewers get the adequate information that is displayed in good and attractive colours. Though the manual/analog way of displaying information to the view of the people is still targeted viewer are attracted. The height is which advertisement in Nigeria have attained will be maintained if some of its design/construction operation is computerized (electronics display board) especially the ones that has to do with bigger companies. This will also maintain the good relationship between the company and its numerous customers.<br/>1.5    SCOPE OF THE PROJECT<br/>This project can serve in any aspect of life; this project (electronics display board) is a board on a computer aided design. In the implementation of this project. The scope that shall concentrate more on are: the architecture of the electronics display port interface, multiplexing the data port control sequence and algorithm of the traffic light. The features of the AT89551 were exploited to achieve the desired sequence of operation of this project.<br/>1.6    CONSTRAINTS OF THE PROJECT<br/>One of the obvious constraints I had in the course of this project was the security of sometime outright. Unavailability of some of the required components in the markets. Since scarcity is followed by a high in price, when such components were even found, they were out lightly expensive. Another major constraint I had relatively short time too sources out the materials from net, libraries, etc. fully understand the underlying principles and come up with a design that would work as a result, I had to forgo pleasure and even leiture in order to achieve this.<br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE CONSTRUCTION OF ELECTRONIC DISPLAY BOARD<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE CONSTRUCTION OF ELECTRONIC DISPLAY BOARD", "id": 116}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A SOLAR OPERATED AUTOMATIC STREET LIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/> In this project work, we are mostly concern about building a simple power streetlight which is automatically operated.

This means, without light, the whole world is in darkness and as a result of this, living things be it plants, animals or human beings cannot exist.<br/>           When talking about lighting, it comes from two different sources, which could be natural or electrical. The former comes from the Creator (God) while the latter is a result of our natural resources being utilized effectively by human beings. Since there is need for lighting, electric energy generation is employed to solve the problems people are facing during the day, especially at night when there is total darkness everywhere.<br/>           Since the invention of electrical energy for lighting, it is quite obvious that it requires human intervention to control the switch either off when not in use or ONM when the need arises. Due to this factor and poor supply of electricity, we have been able to find and alternative way of generating electricity for the purpose of illumination which is highly efficient and effective through the energy from the sun known as solar energy.<br/>           This involves the use of a module called solar panel, which receive the energy from the sun and convert it to electricity.<br/> Basically, this project focused on the design and construction of a solar operated automatic streetlight. This is a commercial quality light that can easily illuminate the streets and other areas of choice giving the potential of many years of trustworthy use with a minimum of maintenance required.<br/>           The four major components needed to build construct a solar powered streetlight are: The solar panel, high efficiency d.c. Temperature, charge controller and a battery.<br/>           The solar panel has its major task to convert the sun’s energy into electricity, precisely D.C voltage. The basic circuitry on solar powered streetlights consists essentially of a automatic battery charger, fed by the solar panel and a lighting controller automated for dusk to down operation.<br/>           The charge controller projects the battery from over-charging, maximizes the charging voltage and current output of the solar panel.<br/>           To achieve the automatic operation of the streetlight, a photocell or a time, which senses the period of darkness and lightness, is used to trigger.<br/>           The type of battery employed here is a maintenance free one, which is capable of supplying few days of back up power in case of bad weather or charger failure. Also the lamp used in this project work is a D.C operated lamp.<br/> 1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/> This project is carried out so as to provide an alternative means of generating electricity through sunlight for lighting purpose.<br/> Also, the effective utilization of natural resources (sunlight) is ensured by the design of this project.<br/>           The components required in carrying out this project which are solar panel, battery charge controller, which contains the resistors, capacitors, led and diode, bulb are efficient enough to yield the desired result without the use of power converter.<br/>           Therefore, the use of Direct Current (D.C) operated lamp are employed, specifically, LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes).<br/> 1.2    AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/> The aims and objectives of this project are:<br/> To power up a street lighting system through solar energy.<br/> To protect the solar battery from quick deterioration as a result of continuous day and night working.<br/> To control a solar powered streetlight automatically.<br/> To utilize the naturally endowed resource (sun).<br/>  1.3    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/> This project design is centered on solar energy as fast growing technology for street lighting with the use of a solar module. The automatic control process of the light can be achieved by a photocell. Or a LDR (Light Depending Resistor) which eliminates human intervention for manual switching or control/<br/> 1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/> The significance of the design and construction of solar operated Automatic Street light cannot be overemphasized in the sense that it is financially viable particularly in areas where the cost of providing a main supply is prohibitive. It has the capability of illuminating large surface area of land due to high efficiency of the lamp used. Also, it does not require human intervention to control its operation and finally, power outages have no impact whatsoever on it.<br/> 1.5    METHODOLOGY<br/> In the process of searching for information on this project, relevant textbooks, journals and related past project reports in the library were consulted. Also, several visits to relevant web sites on the Internet cannot be overloaded.<br/> 1.6    LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/> Every project’s have its limitation. The major limitation of this project is that sunlight used to generate the electricity is not readily available especially at winter period.<br/> As a result, the streetlight requires the need for a large battery to use in order to provide at least three days of stand by operation during cloudy weather without discharging the battery below its safe operating limit.<br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A SOLAR OPERATED AUTOMATIC STREET LIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A SOLAR OPERATED AUTOMATIC STREET LIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM", "id": 117}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CONSTRUCTION OF A GSM BASED HOME AUTOMATION USING AVR<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/> With advancement of technology things are becoming simpler and easier for us. Automatic systems are being preferred over manual system. The purpose of this project is to design and construct A GSM based home automation using AVR. Using GSM networks, in this project a home power control system has been proposed that will act as an embedded system which can monitor and control appliances and other devices locally using built-in input and output peripherals. The system has a delay of 2 minutes after the first call to initiate the next command. This project is made up of four vital units. These units are as follows: GSM module unit, peripheral interface control (PIC) unit, driver unit and a power monitoring and control unit. The GSM module is a GSM transceiver which gives the system access to the GSM service provider. The peripheral interface control (PIC) is programmed to carry out the OFF/ RESET operation according to the GSM commands while the driver and control unit consist of capacitors, resistors, diodes, regulators and electromagnetic relay is to effect power switching. The major component that performed the power control of 220v main supply and the automatic voltage regulation (AVR) is the automated electromagnetic relay.

Automation is the use of control systems and information technologies to reduce the need for human work in the production of goods and services. In the scope of industrialization, automation is a step beyond mechanization. Whereas mechanization provided human operators with machinery to assist them with the muscular requirements of work, automation greatly decreases the need for human sensory and mental requirements as well. Automation plays an increasingly important role in the world economy and in daily experience. Automatic systems are being preferred over manual system. Through this project we have tried to show automatic control of a house as a result of which power is saved to some extent. GSM based home automation using AVR is an electronic device that allows a GSM cell phone to monitor and shut down electrical power supply at home where there are emergency or ugly situations such as fire outbreak, lightning strikes, switching surges, transients, neutral failure and other abnormal conditions or malfunctions that can destroy lives and properties<br/>GSM based home automation using AVR is a system that implements the emerging applications of the GSM technology which enable the users to carry out some task from anywhere in the world via a GSM network, and the system will automatically regulates power surge. The system is made up of a GSM amplifier unit, PIC12f629 microcontroller, power control and a power supply unit. These sub circuits are designed using passive and active electronic components like capacitors, resistors, diode, regulators, transistors, electromagnetic relay, microcontroller and battery.<br/>1.2  BACKGROUND OF STUDY <br/> The new age of technology has redefined communication. Most people nowadays have access to mobile phones and thus the world indeed has become a global village. At any given moment, any particular individual can be contacted with the mobile phone. But the application of mobile phone cannot just be restricted to sending SMS or starting conversations. New innovations and ideas can be generated from it that can further enhance its capability.<br/> Technologies such as Infra-red, Bluetooth, etc which has developed in recent years goes to show the very fact that improvements are in fact possible and these improvements have eased our life and the way we live. Remote management of several home and office appliances is a subject of growing interest and in recen<br/>years we have seen many systems providing such controls. An appliance of a certain location is eliminated with the use of our system. These days, apart from supporting voice calls a mobile phone can be used to send text messages as well as multimedia messages (that may contain pictures, graphics, animations, etc). Sending written text messages is very popular among mobile phone users. Instant messaging, as it is also known, allows quick transmission of short messages that allow an individual to share ideas, opinions and other relevant information. We have designed a control system which is based on the GSM technology that effectively allows control from a remote area to the desired location. The application of our suggested system is immense in the ever changing technological world. It allows a greater degree of freedom to an individual whether it is controlling the household appliances or office equipments. There is no need to be physically present in order to control.<br/>1.3 PROBLEM STATEMENT <br/> Technology has advanced so much in the last decade or two that it has made life more efficient and comfortable. The comfort of being able to take control of devices from one particular location has become imperative as it saves a lot of time and effort. Therefore there arises a need to do so in a systematic manner which we have tried to implement with our system. The system we have proposed is an extended approach to automating a control system. With the advancement and breakthroughs in technology over the years, the lives of people have become more complicated and thus they have become busier than before. With the adoption of our system, we can gain control over certain things that required constant attention. The application of our system comes in handy when people who forget to do simple things such as turn ON or OFF devices at their home or in their office, they can now do so without their presence by making a call from their mobile phone. This development, I believe, will ultimately save a lot o come back for simple things such as to turn OFF switches at their home or at<br/> their office once they set out for their respective work.<br/> 1.4 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/> The objective of this project is to develop a device that can automatically regulate power surge in the home and allow its users to remotely control and monitor multiple home appliances using a cellular phone.

Input sources refer to the microphones that provides a sound input for the system. These input sources are fed into the preamplifiers. The pre amplified signals are then passed into the audio power amplifiers.<br/>These amplifiers will amplify the audio signals to an adequate speaker line level. In view of the above, one can now say that the public address system is an electronic amplification system used for communication in public areas.<br/> Microphone is a device that converts sound waves into electrical waves. Some<br/>times colloquially called a micro mike is an acoustic-to-electric transducer or sensor that converts sound into an electrical signal. Microphones are used in many applications such as telephones, hearing aids, live and recorded audio engineering, in radio and television broadcasting and in computers for recording voice, and for non-acoustic purposes such as ultrasonic checking. The sensitive transducer element of a microphone is called its element. Since a wireless microphone is used in this project; a wireless microphone is one in which communication is not limited by a cable.<br/>A transmitter  is  extremely  important  equipment  and  is  housed  in  the<br/>broadcasting station. Its purpose is to produce radio waves for transmission into space. The important components of a transmitter are microphone, audio amplifiers, oscillator and modulator.<br/>It usually sends its signal using a small FM radio transmitter to a nearby receiver connected to the sound system, but it can also use infrared light if the transmitter and receiver are within sign of each other.

A receiver is an electronic circuit that receives its input from an antenna, uses electronic filters to separate a wanted radio signal from all other signals picked up by this antenna, amplifies it to a level suitable for further processing, and finally converts through demodulation and decoding the signal into a form usable for the consumer, such as sound, and digital data, etc.<br/>Amplifier or simply amp is any device that changes, usually increases, the<br/>amplitude of a signal. The “signal” is device for increasing the power of a signal. It does this by taking energy from a power supply and controlling the output to match the input signal shape but with larger amplitude. Routing the low-frequency parts of the signal to an amplifier can substantially improve the clarity of the overall sound reproduction.<br/>In this project, the audio amplifier used is capable of delivering 20watts continuously. The term “power amplifier” is a relat amount of power delivered to the load and/or sourced by the supply circuit.<br/> In general a power amplifier is designated as the last amplifier in a transmission chain (the output stage) and is the amplifier stage that typically requires most attention to power efficiency. Power amplifiers have also become lighter, smaller, more powerful and more efficient due to increasing use of Class A amplifiers, which offer significant weight and space savings as well as increased efficiency.<br/>Power amplifier circuits (output stages) are classified as A, B, AB and C for analog designs, and class D and E for switching designs, based upon the conduction angle or angle of flow, Θ, of the input signal through the output amplifying device, that is, the portion of the input signal cycle during which the amplifying device conducts.

It can simply be defined as the process of joining two or more pieces of metal to make the act as a single piece. This is often done by melting the work pieces and adding a filler material to form a pool of molten material that cools to become a strong joint. Because of its strength, welding is used to join beams when constructing buildings, bridges and other structures. Welding can also be used to join pipes in pipelines, power plants at the construction sites and in home appliance. Furthermore, welding is used in shipbuilding, automobile manufacturing and repair, aerospace applications. There are many kinds of welding which include arc welding, resistance welding, gas welding among others. Emphasis will be laid on arc welding because it is the most common type of welding as well as the main aim of this project.<br/>Arc welding is the process of welding that utilizes an electrical discharge (arc) to join similar materials together. Equipment that performs the welding operation under the observation and control of a welding operator is known as welding machine. To solve the problem of weight and size of conventional arc welding machine, it is necessary to design an inverter. The inverter provides much higher frequency than 50Hz or 60Hz supply for transformer used in welding. So transformer of much smaller mass is used to permit the handling of much greater output power. The welding noise produce by conventional arc welding machine is reduced by selecting the operating frequency over the hearing of human ability. The choice of 20Khz for the inverter type arc welding machine was determined to meet the above expectation. The output welding current is controlled by controlling the power supply for transformer at high frequency. This power supply is provided by a frequency inverter. Power switch IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) or MOSFETs is used for the inverter design due to its high switching. The control circuit use to control the output welding current is design to drive the power switch at high frequency. Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor power switch is more efficient and less prone to failure than MOSFETs power switch.<br/>1.2         AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT <br/> The main aim and objective of this project is to design and build and arc  welding machine that operates on 36vdc at variable frequency which of benefit to urban area. This reduces the weight and size of the transformer use for welding. To have an arc welding machine that is more efficient which produce neat welding. <br/>1.3 SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY<br/> The significant of this project is that it seeks to develop an arc welding machine that is cost effective, strong and portable. Not only that the arc welding machine is strong and portable, it is also mobile.<br/>1.4 LIMITATION OF THE PROJECT<br/>The project has certain limitations which are mentioned below.<br/>Ø  This project cannot weld bigger gauge of metals.<br/>Ø  The welding time and power depends on the battery input power.<br/>Ø  You are to have bands of battery for reliability when using battery.<br/>Ø  The machine must be used by a qualified welder. Welding can endanger the operator or people near the working area. Therefore, the performance of welding<br/>and cutting must only be done under the comprehensive observation of all relevant safety regulation.<br/>Ø  Switch function modes during welding could potentially damage the equipment. A safety switch is necessary to prevent the equipment from electric leakage. Use only high quality welding tools and equipment with this inverter type arc welding machine.<br/> 1.5      PROJECT REPORT ORGANIZATION<br/>The organization of the project report is well detailed and vast in its coverage.

The human heart pounds to pump oxygen rich blood to the muscles and carry cell waste products away from the tissues. Heartbeat rate can vary according to the demand of the muscles to absorb oxygen and excrete carbon dioxide changes such as during exercise or sleep. It also varies significantly between individuals based on age, fitness and genetics. This means that the heart must beat faster to deliver more oxygen rich blood. During exercise routines, the heartbeat rate gives a strong indication of how effective the exercise is to the body.<br/>The patient monitoring systems is one of the major improvements in the global health care program because of its advanced technology. A patient monitoring system measures the heartbeat and body temperature by using embedded technology. This advancement in technology is highly needed because many sick patients at the hospitals die because of high fever and heart attacks. The trend of cardiovascular disease has shown that heart beat rate plays a key role in determining the possibility of a heart attack while an increase in the body temperature can induce fever on a patient. Heart diseases such as heart attack, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, and congenital heart disease are the leading causes of death for men and women in many countries. Most of the time, the aged people of the society are more prone to heart disease problems than the younger ones. For people who live alone with no one to monitor their health condition, this device offers an opportunity to them for a constant monitoring of their health status, it is developed to monitor and alert the doctors about the heartbeat and temperature condition of a patient. It is developed to give patients a timely and proper heath care.<br/> These days it is not easy for doctors and the nurses to remain close to a patients bed side to monitor their heath condition. In the past, a huge and fixed monitoring device was used (only in the hospitals) to know the health status of a patient when on a bed. These monitoring devices are only available in the hospitals and are constantly on Manytheof patie them are not user friendly so it is important that the doctors and family members will have a handy device that can always monitor their patients when they are not around. One of the vital things to monitor on a patient is the body temperature. This has to do with the measurement of the body's ability to generate and get rid of heat. Temperature monitoring is one of chief indicators of the normal functioning of health. The nature of the human body is to keep its temperature within a narrow, safe range in spite of large variations in temperatures outside the body. Normal human body temperature depends upon the place in the body, from which the measurement is made, and the time and level of activity of the person. The typical body temperature is 37.0 °C ± 0.4°C (98.6 ° F ± 0.7°F). When the body temperature is high, the blood vessels within the skin expand (dilate) to carry the excess heat to the patients skin surface. One may begin to sweat, and as the sweat evaporates, it helps to cool his/her body. When one is too cold, the blood vessels narrows (contracts) so that blood flow to the skin is reduced to conserve body heat. This may cause an involuntary shivering in some people due to cold which is a rapid contraction of the muscles. This extra muscle activity helps to generate more heat. Under normal condition, thus keeping one's body temperature within a narrow, safe range. Body temperature is regulated by neural feedback mechanism which operate primarily through the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus contains not only the control mechanisms, but also the key temperature sensors. Under control of these mechanisms, sweating begins almost precisely at a skin temperature of 37°C and increases rapidly as the skin temperature rises above this value. The heat production of the body under these conditions remains almost constant as the skin temperature rises. If the skin temperature drops below 37°C a variety of responses are initiated to conserve the heat in the body and to increase heat production. These includes: Vasoconstriction to decrease the flow of heat to the skin, Cessation of sweating, shivering to increase heat production in the muscles, Secretion of nor epinephrine, epinephrine, and thyroxin to increase heat production.<br/>Another vital thing to monitor in a patient is the heartbeat rate. It is very important that the heartbeat is to be normal. That is 72 BPM. If there is any abnormality, then the patient is in distress. Heartbeat rate means the number of heartbeats per unit of time. The normal heartbeat rate of a resting person is about 70 bpm for adult males and 75 bpm for adult females. The average heartbeat per minute for 25-year old ranges between 140-170 beats per minute while for a 60-year old it is typically between 115-140 beats per minute and body temperature is 37 degree Celsius or 98.6 Fahrenheit. . Normally it is difficult to keep track of the abnormalities in the heartbeat count of by manual means. Patients are not well versed with the manual treatments, which the doctors normally use for tracking the count of the heartbeat. Thus, there must be some kind of device which would help patients and their family member to keep track of their health by themselves. This sole reason is why this project presents a heartbeat and temperature<br/> monitoring device using radio frequency (RF.). The concept of developing an RF. based patient monitoring device is to have a simple home and hospital based pulse and body temperature monitoring device for sick person’sthat are in critical condition and needs to be constantly or periodically monitored by clinician or family.<br/> 1.2   WHAT IS A PATIENT HEARTBEAT AND TEMPERATURE MONITOR USING RF.? <br/>A patient heartbeat and temperature monitor using RF. is a radio frequency based pulse wave and body temperature monitoring system, which allows the control of a sick conditionperson’sinrealtime. The system monitors the heart beat and temperature of a patient simultaneously and if the patients heartbeat rate or body temperature is abnormal, the system alerts sends an alert to the doctor or patient’stoquicklyexaminefamilyor m diagnose the patient’syprecautionconditiontosavethe an patient’sThealerts soundlifecan.be triggered at any time as long as there is a deviation in the health condition of the patient from the normal, such that the status of the patient can be known on time. The system consists of a sensor, which monitors the patient and sends a signal to a microcontroller, which processes it to determine the temperature and heartbeat rate of the patient  before  sending  an  alert  to  a  receiver  using  radio  frequency.  The receiver has to be in the possession of the patient’sorfamilydoctor members. This project can also be used by athletes who engage in physical<br/>exercise and by medical professionals. Individuals, such as athletes, cyclists or those who are interested in monitoring their heartbeat rate and body temperature to gain maximum efficiency from their training can also use this project. It can be used during physical exercise and healthcare.<br/> 1.3 PROBLEM DEFINITION<br/>The human health is one of the most important concerns in the world today. Anything/everything becomes meaningless when one becomes sick and dies due to improper Medicare. For health reasons, people, governments and several voluntary bodies spend a lot of money to ensure a better health condition for themselves and the entire populace. Scientists and Engineers are always at work to device a means of supporting/sustaining a sound health condition for all through the invention of numerous technologies both Electrical/Mechanical gadgets that are in use for health care delivery today. The heart is a very delicate organ in the human body (once it stops beating, nothing else matters). Thus, If early actions are taken (and on time) the heart condition can be managed effectively and many patients can be cured and saved. The problem of patients slumping and dying is associated with cardiovascular arrests and can be checkmated this sensitive and highly effective device (the patient heartbeat and temperature monitor). This device has an outstanding advantage that it is easy to handle and access. Heartbeat rate and body temperature monitors are part of the most vital tools needed in first aid kit for saving lives. Unlike the x-ray, the heartbeat and temperature monitor does not impose any hazard to the human health. There devices in the market which can provide raw measurement data of the patients to the doctors, but the patients may not be able to interpret the medical measurement into a meaningful diagnosis due to their limited medical background. On the other hand, if raw medical data is delivered to the doctor, time is wasted and may pose a problem, but in emergencies waste of time can never be tolerated. It is tough to share data over large area within a short period. Most of the products available in the market have this drawback of limitation in flexibility and portability. If the heat that is produced from metabolism cannot be checkmated on time, it will cause a turbulent body temperature, which could be worse than 40°C and lead to headache, vertigo, low blood pressure, high energy consumption, unconsciousness and crocking up of body temperature regulation function. On the other hand, when the produced heat is less than<br/>the dissipating heat, the body temperature cannot hold on and it will result to a decrease in metabolism.<br/> 1.4 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/> The major aim and objective of this design [of a patient heartbeat and temperature monitor using RF.] is to help the doctors and family members to keep track of the heartbeat condition of their loved ones [as well as their body temperature] in the case of an abnormality in the health condition (for those with heartbeat defects and those that run excessive high temperature beyond normal). If any varied change takes place, it is notified. This notification through RF. Channel would to take an appropriate action at an instance of time, thereby alerting the appropriate persons..<br/> 1.5  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT<br/>There are various instruments available in the hospitals to keep track of the internal body changes, but many of them have limitations regarding to maintenance, cost, size of instruments, and mobility. This project is so significant because it is mobile, small in size, cost effective, very easy to use, highly efficient performance, portable and light in weight etc. It uses RF. to help both the patient and the concerned doctor to take an appropriate action. It is beneficial in terms of cost. It saves time and is very helpful to patients who lives alone. It offers a freedom of movement to patients. It has a low power consumption though the stability of its wireless data communication is still to be enhanced. To some degree, the wireless data communication via RF has anti-jamming ability.<br/> 1.6 SCOPE OF THE PROJECT<br/>This project operates at a 30 feet’sdistanceon open space. It is designed to operate with an alkaline battery of a minimum of 9 volts to a maximum of 12v consumes 50mA. It uses a buffer, temperature sensor, AT89c51 Microcontroller and a led display with buzzer for the alert. The hardware and soft ware of the system is oriented towards the AT89c51 single chip microcontroller. Hence, reducing the size of the device. A regulated 3.7v RF. operates in the frequency range of 415 MHZ per second used for data transmission, which can easily penetrate over three floors of a building and go over 30 feet’s in open space.<br/>1.7 PROJECT REPORT ORGANIZATION<br/>The organization of the project report is well detailed and vast in its coverage. It covers all the activities encountered during the research work as shown in the block diagram below.<br/>The first chapter is the introductory chapter, which covers the background, project objectives, scope of the project, constraints and block diagram overview of the states. Chapter 2 presents the literature review. Chapter 3 covers the system analysis and design including the design methodology in block diagram form. Chapter 4 presents the system implementation, which shows the component layout, the wiring schedule, the wiring diagram and the complete schematic diagram. Chapter 5 covers the testing and integration of the project design. The system testing was first carried out in a laboratory. Chapter 6 is the summary and conclusion, which includes the summary of achievements, problems encountered during project design, recommendation and suggestion for further improvement.<br/>With the aid of a simple, low cost microcontroller based heartbeat rate and temperature measuring device with LCD output. The heartbeat rate of a patient is measured from the index finger or the wrist or neck using IRD (infrared device) sensors and the rate is then averaged and displayed on a text board LCD.<br/>The device sounds an alarm when the heartbeat and body temperature exceed the safe threshold value. The programmer stipulates this threshold value at the time of programming of the microcontroller. The threshold value given for the device is between 20 to 120 pulses per minute for heart beat indication and 18 degrees Celsius to 38 degrees Celsius for temperature.<br/><br/>\n\nPATIENT HEARTBEAT AND TEMPERATURE MONITOR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PATIENT HEARTBEAT AND TEMPERATURE MONITOR", "id": 122}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>HOME CONTROL SWITCH AUTOMATION USING GSM COMMUNICATION<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/> The advantage of cellular communication like GSM technology is a potential solution for such remote controlling activities. GSM-SMS technology can be used to control household appliances from remote places. Remotely, the system allows the home owner to monitor and control his house appliances via his mobile phone set by sending commands in the form of SMS message and receiving the appliances status as well. This system provides ideal solution to the problems caused in situations when a wired connection between a remote appliance device and the control unit might not be feasible. The system is wireless and uses the user’s mobilethe system is more adaptable and cost effective. The system uses GSM technology thus providing ubiquitous access to the system for appliance control. With this hypothesis, three different approaches have been proposed and implemented in this project; FIRSTLY, home control switch/household appliances are controlled by server mobile which acts as remote control. SECONDLY, GSM-SMS messaging technology is used to control them from remote places and FINALLY, to provide a multiple agents environment.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/> 1.0  INTRODUCTION<br/> 1.1  PROJECT OBJECTIVE       2<br/> 1.2  SCOPE OF THE  PROJECT<br/>1.3  OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM<br/> 1.4  ARCHTECTURE OF THE SYSTEM<br/> CHAPTER TWO<br/> 2. 0 LITERURE REVIEW         <br/>  2.1 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION<br/> 2.1.1 USER GSM MOBILE HANDSET<br/> 2.1.2 RECEIVER GSM HANDSET<br/>2.2 MICROCONTROLLER BOARD<br/> 2.3 SWITCHING MODULE<br/> CHAPTER THREE<br/> 3.0 SOFTWARE DESIGNING<br/> 3.1 TRANSFORMER<br/> 3.2 TRANSFORMER CALCULATION<br/>  3.3 RECTIFICATION PROCESS<br/> 3.4 MICROCONTROLLER SECTION<br/> CHAPTER FOUR<br/> 4.0 TESTING<br/> 4.1 SYSTEM TESTING<br/> 4.2 PACKAGING<br/> 4.3 TROUBLE SHOOTING THE DESIGN<br/> CHAPTER FIVE<br/> 5.0 PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED<br/> 5.1 PRECAUTIONS<br/> 5.2 RECOMMENDATION<br/> 5.3 CONCLUSION<br/> 5.5 APPENDIX<br/>  5.4 PROGRAMME CODES<br/>  5.6 REFERENCE<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Nowadays, people’s expectations in t technology is improving rapidly. People need an affordable system (smart) that can make their lives easier, more comfortable, and offer more safety.GSM based home automation system is an electrical and electronic system designed to control home appliance with a mobile phone. The two main technologies applied in the system are GSM and PLC. GSM stands for global system for mobile communication and PLC stands for power line communication. In this study, Nokia 6100 is chosen as the GSM phone that receives command and transfers it to controller. Due to rapidly advancing of mobile communication technology and widely availability make it possible to incorporate mobile technology into home automation systems. ’’AT’’ command is phone and microcontroller by passing through a serial interface RS232 with the help of its driver.<br/>The project is based on the principle of GSM network, which enables the user to remotely control the operations of the appliances by using a mobile phone. In other word it would transform a normal home into an intelligent home. The controlling circuit is the most important component in communication and interface between home appliances. It was implemented by using peripheral interface controller (PIC) interfaced to mobile phone. The user can perform ON/OFF operations of the appliances just by pressing keypad of mobile phone.<br/>The user sends GSM data in the form of SMS (short message service) message to switch ON or OFF any appliances at home such as lamp, air condition, fan and etc. the appliances may also provide the user with its current ON/OFF status. The system can be improved to provide the user with information about the status of each appliance.<br/> PROJECT OBJECTIVES<br/>The objectives of this project are as follows;<br/>   1.                 To design and develop home appliances control system over GSM network by using a mobile phone.<br/>2.                 To determine and understand on how the GSM works.<br/>3.                 To understand the architecture and programming of the PIC.<br/>4.                 To learn the troubleshooting and techniques.<br/> SCOPE OF THE PROJECT<br/> The scopes of works in this project are;<br/>1.                 Mobile phone with SIM card enables the user to remotely control the operations of the appliances by communication to the GSM modem.<br/>2.                 GSM modem allows the capability to send and receive SMS to and from the mobile phone.<br/>3.                 RS-232 is the basic serial communication cable that will be used to interface between GSM modem and PIC microcontroller.<br/>4.                 PIC microcontroller will be interfaced to the control circuit that is connected to the appliances. It contains the software components through which the appliances are controlled and monitored.<br/>5.                 Relay and control circuit used to detect and control the condition of the home appliances.<br/>OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM<br/>The system works as a remote sensing for the electrical appliances at home or industry to check whether it is ON or OFF, at the same time the user can control the electrical appliances at home by sending SMS message into the system, for example, turning on the AC before returning home. in case of fire/security the chip will receive signals from the different sensors in the monitoring place and acts according to the received signal by sending an SMS message to user’s mobile phone, it also works as automatic and immediate reporting to the user<br/>in case of emergency for home security, as well as immediate and automatic reporting to the fire brigade and police station according to activated sensor to decrease the time required for tracking action.<br/>ARCHTECTURE OF THE SYSTEM<br/>It can be implemented to any levels of the security system. The architecture of the system mainly consists of three components the GSM MODEM and the interface circuit that include the different sensors used. The function of the GSM MODEM is the remote communication between the user and the controller through the RS232 serial communication standard. The function of the controller is to continuously check the inputs coming from the different sensor and send message through the GSM network in case of emergency such that it acts as a 24hours monitoring and continuously checking for any received message from the user through the GSM MODEM to switch on the AC for example.<br/>  <br/><br/><br/>\n\nHOME CONTROL SWITCH AUTOMATION USING GSM COMMUNICATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " HOME CONTROL SWITCH AUTOMATION USING GSM COMMUNICATION", "id": 123}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CONSTRUCTION OF RADIO FREQUENCY GSM SIGNAL JAMMER<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1           Introduction <br/>A wireless signal jammer is a device which blocks transmission by<br/>creating interference. This wireless signal jammer can be categorized into the Radio Frequency (RF) jammer and GSM jammer.<br/>A Radio Frequency jammer is a device used to disrupt or prevent communication via a broadcasted RF signal. It is an RF and GSM frequency disrupter commonly known as wideband radio frequency (RF) and GSM cell phone jammer. Simultaneously, they can blocks all commercial FM broadcast band (87.5 MHz to 108 MHz) and GSM signal transmissions within the jammer's transmission range. The device can possibly block these frequencies by transmitting a dirty signal (like noise) on the same frequency at which the GSM and radio system operates.<br/>A Radio Frequency jammer is a device that transmits a radio frequency signal on the same frequency at which the radio system operates and the jamming succeeds when the radio sets in the area where the jammer is located are disabled.<br/>A GSM jammer is a device that transmits a signal on the same frequency at which the GSM operates. The jamming succeeds when the mobile phones in the area where the jammer is located are disabled.<br/>In recent times, where bombs are being planted and detonated by GSM or Radio Frequency signals, this device can be at an advantage by jamming the signals required for the detonation of the bomb.<br/>Presently, the mobile jammer devices are becoming civilian products rather than electronic warfare devices, since with the increasing number of the mobile phone users the need to disable mobile phones in specific<br/> places where the ringing of cell phone would be disruptive has increased. These places include worship places, university lecture rooms, libraries, concert halls, meeting rooms, and other places where silence is appreciated.<br/>The solution to these annoying and disrupting noises is to install a device which can block the signal transmission from mobile phones and radio sets and thus, disrupt the triggering of bombs by these wireless signals.<br/>1.2             Project Background <br/> The technology being used by this device is very simple. The mobile phone transmission is being blocked and interfered by RF which creates high noise. The frequency being generated by the jamming device jams the signal being generated by the cell tower (as illustrated in figure 1.1 below).<br/>When the signal has been blocked, th NETWORK” on the network bar, and radi into any signal. Thus, all phones and radio devices in the 200m radius of the jammer will be having the same situation.<br/>Radio Frequency (RF) and Mobile signal jammer is an illegal device in many countries. It is because the device is blocking the signal which has been approved by government agency as a legal communication transmission system. According to the National Communications<br/>Commission (NCC) in Nigeria, “The man for sale, of devices designed to block or jam wireless transmission is prohibited”]. [10<br/>The reason I am developing this device is for educational purpose only. This device was developed and tested in this report just for Final Year Project presentation. There is no intention of manufacturing or selling such device in Nigeria or elsewhere.<br/>In the construction of this wireless signal jammer, the device will be able to jam GSM and Radio Frequency (RF) signals and this can be done alternatively through a switch.<br/> As shown in Fig. 1.1 below, the wireless signal jammer is divided into two major branches: the GSM signal jammer, and the radio receiver jammer. The radio receiver jammer is also sub-divided into the Amplitude Modulated (AM) signal jammer and the Frequency Modulated (FM) Signal jammer. The Cell phones and Radio receivers cannot be blocked simultaneously as they operate at separate frequencies. The frequency can then be varied using a frequency tuner mounted on the jammer<br/>  JAMMER<br/>GSM SIGNAL JAMMER<br/>RADIO FREQUENCY RECEIVER<br/>(935-960MHz)<br/>SIGNAL JAMMER (87.5-108 MHz)<br/>            <br/><br/>\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF RADIO FREQUENCY GSM SIGNAL JAMMER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONSTRUCTION OF RADIO FREQUENCY GSM SIGNAL JAMMER", "id": 124}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CONSTRUCTION OF A MICROCONTROLLER BASED T JUNCTION TRAFFIC LIGHT CONTROLLER<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/> T-junction traffic light controller is such a device that will play a significant role in controlling traffic at junctions, to ease the expected increased rush at such junctions and reduce to minimum disorderliness that may arise, as well as allowing the pedestrians a right of the way at intervals rather than being struck down when in a hurry to cross the roads.

That the innumerable traffic junctions in the country by far out-number the staff strength of the traffic wardens available and that the traffic wardens even where they are enough to control all the junctions cannot do so throughout the day is not in doubt. Traffic control at T.junctions or elsewhere ensures orderliness of movements of vehicles, goods and pedestrians while its absence strongly indicates chaos and most at times leads to accidents.<br/>In the light of the above, it is imperative to recognize the need to compliment the physical exhausting efforts of the traffic wardens. In doing so, steps to be taken should assume permanence in nature rather than any ad-hoc exercise. Such is the role expected to be played by an installed operational road junction traffic controller. This project –DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A THREE WAY JUNCTION TRAFFIC LIGHT CONTROLLER is such a device that will play significant role in controlling traffic at junctions to ease the expected increased rush at such junctions and reduce to minimum such disorderliness that may arise as well as allowing the<br/>pedestrians a right of the way at intervals rather than being struck down when in a hurry to cross the roads. Such an electrical system with a touch of electronics that controls the flow of traffic in a pre-determine sequential pattern at a junction has its diagram below with blocks representing distinct units.[1]<br/> The power supply unit provides the control unit with specified dc voltage from primary source, which is a 240v, 50Hz ac supply, from public power system. The pulse generator containing a timer generates pulse for the system. The clock or counter moderates the signal that enters the decoding logic system. <br/> The display unit of each stand consists of three bulbs Red in colour showing STOP, three bulbs Amber in colour showing GET READY and three bulbs Green in colour showing MOVE.<br/>1.2            OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT <br/> The main objective of the study includes:<br/> 5                   To investigate the practicality of the theoretical knowledge about these components to be used.<br/>6                   To experiment on the compatibility of the working relation between components to be used.<br/> 7                   To investigate the extent to which the design and construction of the control unit can be useful to mankind.<br/>8                   To investigate the immediate usefulness of the control system as complimentary to traffic wardens.<br/> 1.3            SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/> The scope of this project is to enlighten all electronics students on the use of microcontroller base traffic light (3-ways) and timer system in T-junction. On the practical usage it is limited to the laboratory used for reference purpose. The larger application of this project work is found in most of our mega cities like Abuja, Lagos, Calabar, Enugu etc, to control and manage heavy traffic congestion.<br/>1.4            PROJECT REPORT ORGANIZATION <br/> This report is structured to follow the history and origin of traffic light system all through the design and implementation phase. The report takes into account the step-by-step process followed in order to arrive at the final design.<br/>Chapter one of this report introduces the concept of the Traffic light system and its objectives. Chapter two centers on the literature review, the origin and history of Traffic light systems and its basic functionality. Chapter Three explains the components which make up the Traffic light system and their basic functionalities/mode of operation.

That the innumerable traffic junctions in the country by far out-number the staff strength of the traffic wardens available and that the traffic wardens even where they are enough to control all the junctions cannot do so throughout the day is not in doubt. Traffic control at T.junctions or elsewhere ensures orderliness of movements of vehicles, goods and pedestrians while its absence strongly indicates chaos and most at times leads to accidents.<br/>In the light of the above, it is imperative to recognize the need to compliment the physical exhausting efforts of the traffic wardens. In doing so, steps to be taken should assume permanence in nature rather than any ad-hoc exercise. Such is the role expected to be played by an installed operational road junction traffic controller. This project –DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A THREE WAY JUNCTION TRAFFIC LIGHT CONTROLLER is such a device that will play significant role in controlling traffic at junctions to ease the expected increased rush at such junctions and reduce to minimum such disorderliness that may arise as well as allowing the<br/>pedestrians a right of the way at intervals rather than being struck down when in a hurry to cross the roads. Such an electrical system with a touch of electronics that controls the flow of traffic in a pre-determine sequential pattern at a junction has its diagram below with blocks representing distinct units.[1]<br/>               Pulse                             Lamp     <br/>     Dc                 Counter         Decoder             <br/>AC             Generator                           Display     <br/>    Power                                             <br/>Source                                                 <br/>    Supply                                             <br/> The power supply unit provides the control unit with specified dc voltage from primary source, which is a 240v, 50Hz ac supply, from public power system.

On the practical usage it is limited to the laboratory used for reference purpose. The larger application of this project work is found in most of our mega cities like Abuja, Lagos, Calabar, Enugu etc, to control and manage heavy traffic congestion.<br/>1.4            PROJECT REPORT ORGANIZATION <br/> This report is structured to follow the history and origin of traffic light system all through the design and implementation phase.

However those operating in the early stages of the signal processing system deal with small signals. These early stages are designed to give good voltage gain. Since voltage gain is the most important functions of these amplifiers, they are called voltage amplifiers. The set up of a simple audio amplifier large – signal stage and the speaker. The microphone produces a very small signal, in the millivolt range. The small – signal stage amplifiers this audio signal and it becomes larger. The larger signal. It is called a Power Amplifier.<br/>A Power Amplifier is designed for good power gain. It must handle large voltage and current swings. These high voltages and currents, the power is high.<br/>It is very important to have good efficiencies in power amplifier. An efficient power amplifier delivers the signal power for the D.C. power. It takes from the supply since the job of the power amplifier is to change DC power into signal power<br/>1.2              THE PREAMPLIFIER <br/>A pre-amplifier is used to meet one or move to the following requirements.<br/>1.                  Impedance Matching:  For optimum performance, different sources of signals have different output impedance. It is not feasible to alter the input impedance of the power amplifier to suit the requirement of the signal source. Generally, a power amplifier has a low to medium input impedance.<br/>2.                  Signal Amplification:            Raw signal from the source generally lies in the region of 0.15MV to 100MV whereas signal strength required at the input of the power amplifier for rated output is of the order of 350MV to 1V. A preamplifier is used to boost the signal sufficiently to drive the power amplifier.<br/>3.                  Equalization: While recording on tapes and discs, certain frequencies are emphasized while others are attenuated. During play back, the amplifier must reverse this deliberately introduced nonlinerity. To achieved this, the amplifier is required to provide different gains at different frequencies. This is termed Equalization.<br/>4.                  Additional Facilities: Very often a preamplifier is expected to provide such additional facilities as tone controls and various types to filters to modify the response to make up for deficiencies of the listening area and to cater for the personal taste of the listener.<br/>1.3              THE POWER SUPPLY <br/>Electronics circuits needs energy to work. In most cases, this energy is provided by a circuit called power supply. A power supply failure will affect all the other circuits. The supply is a key part of any electronics system.<br/>Power supplies use rectifier diodes to convert to direct current. They may also use zener diodes as voltage regulators. <br/>This chapter also covers the features influencing the design of the power supply for this power amplifier circuits. <br/>The preamplifier requires positive and negative po9wer supply. Therefore, the dual power at 3.5A 12vdc and the pre amplifier taking circuit in milli amplifier, the transformer with average D.C. current of 3.5A is chosen to be able to deliver this current tot he load, a rectifier diode IN400 (4 for Bridge rectifier) are used. With 2400 across the transformer’s primary 12vac is developed across the secondary.<br/>The impedance that will thus be presented across the power supply by the circuit is: za      =          VDC IDC = 120 / 3.5       =          3.43 ohms <br/>A full wave rectifier with center; tapped transformer is used in order to achieve a dual polarity power supply for the amplifier unit. The 4 diodes are connected in such a way that during the positive half cycle, D2 and D4 conduct. On the negative alternation, the polarity across t her secondary is reversed. The election leaves the centre tap, flow through D1 and D3. The load current is the same for both alteration. Since the direction never changes the load current is directly current.<br/>Again, the full wave rectifier enables the unit  to deliver high power to the amplifier in a given time. It also enables the output wave voltage to be effectively filtered with average sized capacitor.<br/>Smoothing is carried out with capacitors C1 and C2, connected between the position of VCC and ground. <br/>The D.C. output voltage of a filter power supply end to be higher than the output of a non filtered supply. With vims voltage of 12v, after the switch is closed, the capacitor changes to the peak value of the wave form.<br/>VP       =          1.414   x          vrms<br/>            =          1.414   x          12        =          160<br/>This represented a significant change in output voltages. However, as the supply is loaded, the output voltage will drop the required 12V.<br/>Therefore, capacitor C1 and C2 are chosen with values of 330uf / 16v respectively. These capacitors are connected with positive of C1 to VCC and positive off C2 to ground, so as to achieve the dual polarity power supply in addition the secondary function of filtering <br/>Va. C   =          0.9       x          vrms<br/>                        =          0.9       x          12        =          10.8 = 11v<br/>Transformer is rated at 240v / 12v gain, <br/>1p        =          12 x 3.5 / 240  =          0.175 =            0.200A<br/>The rating of the fuse  required is thus <br/>200MA / 240 V.<br/><br/>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A 60 WATTS POWER AMPLIFIER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A 60 WATTS POWER AMPLIFIER", "id": 127}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A SINGLE PHASE AUTO-TRANSFORMER OF RATING IKVA, 240V/110, 80 12V, 6V<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            This project work-up deals on the design and construction of a single phase step down nations fermor, with raking IKVA, 240V/11OV, 80V 12U, 6V.

Transmission systems are required (a) to enable sources of natural energy (eg water fails – dams, or storage loaves, reservoirs for hydropower station, fuel fields, coal gas, diesel – for thermal generating station), for distant from the centre of energy demand (e.g large works, industrial areas of cities), to be economically utilized, (b) to enable generating plant to be concentrated in a few large. Favourably situated stations; and (c) to per met of the in for connection of network or distributing areas to ensure reliability economy and stability or continuity of supply.<br/>There are three main facts in the production and utilization of electricity namely: generations transmission, and distribution generation of electrical energy employs electrical power stations. These power stations generate electrical energy making use of fuel (e.g coal, gas, diesel) as mom raw material; hence thus type is called steam or thermal power station. Other power stations make use of water falls or storage haves – hence called hydro electric power station: etc.<br/>No mater the type of the power station employed, the voltage generated is usually in a low level e.g 11KV or 25KV. Owing to the distance between the centre of energy dim and (consumption areas) to the power stations, transmission system of energy times into play. A high voltage is desirable for transmitting large power in order to decrease the 12R losses and reduce the amount of conductor material. Therefore, a transformer is employed to step up the generated voltage to 3300KV/ the highest National Grid voltage although effort are being made to increase it to 765KV for transmission. This 330KV is transmuted to the distribution ends. A very much however voltage, on the other hand, is required for distribution, for various reasons connected with safely and convenience. The transformer also mavies this easily and economically possible as the 330KV is stepped down to 132KV, 66KV, 33KV, 11KV, 415KV and to a minimum level of 240V for distribution to various load centre (consumption area).<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND<br/>            The device to increase (step up) or decrease (step down) the generated voltage is called the transformer. It is a static (stationary) alternating consent machine.<br/>            Basically, transformers are classified according to purpose namely:- power transformer, distribution transformer, Auto-transformer and instrument transformer, power transformer are large transformers generally used at generating stations to step up the voltage, and at the substations to step d0wn the voltage for supplying distribution systems. They may also be used for tionving together two power stations. The power transformer has a high utilization factor, e.g it is arranged that they run with an almost constant load which is equal to their rating. The maximum efficiency is designed to be at fall load. This means that the fall-load winding losses must be equal to the here losses.<br/>            According to common usage, a transformer rated over 500KVA is termed a power transformer.<br/>            The distribution transformer has a intermittent and variable head which is usually considerable less than fall-head rating. They are therefore, designed to have their maximum efficiency at between half and three – quarter of fall head.<br/>            The instrument transformers are of two types depending on the mode of operation voltage or current transformers. The current (series) and voltage (shunt) transformers are used for extending the range of a.c. instruments in preference to shunts and series resistors.  <br/>1.2              THE AIM OF STUDY<br/>The aim of our study is to design and construct an auto-transformer which can step-down 240V from the local supply down to 110V, 80V, 12V, 6V, to sent the various voltage requirements of numerous electrical and electronic appliances, often appliances imported from say America where the domestic voltage level is 110Volts.<br/>This auto-transformer can conveniently do at a relatively cheap cost or rate. The output of this transformer is made by making numerous tapping on the primary winding depending on the required output. <br/>1.3              SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>The scope of our study is committed to 1KVA auto-transformer (stepdown) that has these tappings as follows 110V, 80V 12V, 6V. In view of this any other thin out side this topic would not be considered. <br/>Because of the various voltage levels on the secondary, it can be used to supply voltage to American equipment at 110V, for welding machines and electronic equipment at 12V, 6V and 80V, and for barberry charging at 6V or 12V.<br/>1.4              DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Transformer: A transformer is alternating current machine which is usual to increase (step-up) or decrease (step down) voltage (a.c).<br/>Auto- Transformer: This is a transformer with single winding. The single winding is common to both the priming and the secondary of the transformer.<br/>Winding: The winding of a transformer is the band of copper conductor which is wound into many farms on the transformer core.<br/>Core: The core of a transformer is a pile of haminated sheets of science steel. <br/>Turns: This is the number of times or rounds the copper conductor is wound on the core.<br/>Lamina: This is a single sheet of the soft iron which is insulated or lamination. <br/>Primary Winding: The primary winding of a transformer is the winding that is directly connected to the over is the winding that is directly connected to the supply.<br/>Secondary Winding: This is the winding that is directly connected to the head.<br/>Tappings: Tappings refers to the connections which are usually made successively in the winding of a transformer especially in auto transformer.<br/>Step up: When the primary voltage is lower than the secondary voltage, the transformer is caved a step up transformer.<br/>Step down: When the primary voltage is higher than the secondary voltage, the transformer is called a step down transformer. <br/>Window: This is the space in the transformer core bounded by the 10Kes and the timbs of the transformer.<br/>Varnish: This is an insulating Tigard which used to increase the insulation of the transformer core and winding as well as making it inechanically strong. It so laxities when air acts and it. <br/>Copper Conductors: These are bare copper worse which are used in transformer windings.<br/>Wire Sleeve: This can be fibre or plastic coating which is used to insulate and isolate the transformer winding terminals.<br/>Slot Popper: This is a thick insulating paper which is used to wrap the transformer winding and separate each layer of the winding. It serves as mechanical protection. <br/>Center Block: This is a wirden block approximately the size of the central limb of the transformer core. It is on the centre block that the former is made.<br/> <br/>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A SINGLE PHASE AUTO-TRANSFORMER OF RATING IKVA, 240V/110, 80 12V, 6V<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A SINGLE PHASE AUTO-TRANSFORMER OF RATING IKVA, 240V/110, 80 12V, 6V", "id": 128}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN INVERTER<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>An inverter is an electronic device that converts direct current (DC¬) to alternating current (AC) the converted Ac can be at any required voltage and frequency with the use of appropriate transformers, switching and control circuit. It’s simple put, is an electronic box that makes household electricity for everyday items.  It converts power from eg car batteries, windmills, solar panels or fuel cells, then turns it into normal household power.  That is, supply AC power from DC source.       Solid state inverters have no moving parts and are used in a wide range of applications, from small switching power supplies in computers, to large electric utility high voltage direct current applications that transport bulk power.  The Inverter performs the opposite function at a rectifier.  There is one more thing you need to be very careful about that is, do you want clean or dirty electricity? What I mean here is that there are two types of electricity that inverters can produce.  Pure sine wave Inverters and Modified sine wave Inverters. The difference is that pure sine wave matches the power to that of which you get from you electricity supplier, its clean and you can run any appliances safely even sensitive equipment. Modified sine wave is dirty power, you can use this to power a lot of things that don’t have sensitive electronics.  Kettle for example fridges, cookers, hot plates etc. You cannot run led lighting on these Inverters as they over head and die within a couple of hours. You have to be careful with some Tvs PCs as they do n like it either, but I have heard that lot of people use them for this with no problems, but I like to be safe, rather than sorry.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE   <br/>Introduction                        <br/>CHAPTER TWO  <br/>Transformer Fundamentals           <br/>CHAPTER THREE         <br/>3.1    Description Of Components           <br/>3.2    Capacitors                          <br/>3.2.1 Types of Capacitor               <br/>3.3    Semi-Conductor Diode          <br/>3.4    Transistors                                 <br/>3.4.1   Bipolar Transistor                      <br/>3.5      Field Effect Transistor (FET)         <br/>CHAPTER FOUR          <br/>Operation and Design Consideration <br/>4.1            Features of the Device                       <br/>4.1.1      Supply Unit               <br/>4.1.2      Inverter Unit                     <br/>4.1.3      Stepup Transformer Unit    <br/>4.1.4      Triggering or Switching Unit                <br/>4.2            Design                                             <br/>4.2.1      Required Specification        <br/>4.2.2      Triggering or Switching Circuit<br/>4.2.3      Buffer Stage                             <br/>4.2.4      Transformer Turns Ratio             <br/>CHAPTER FIVE:           CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURE AND TESTING <br/>5.1        Casing and Packaging          <br/>CHAPTER SIX:             ASSEMBLING OF SECTIONS <br/>6.1        Testing of System Operation         <br/>CHAPTER SEVEN:       INSTALLATION OF COMPLETED DESIGN                        <br/>List, Quantity And Prizes Of Components Used<br/>Conclusion                                          <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>        All modern engineering system includes certain aspects of control system at some point in their broadcast scenes, control engineering and the associated theory are concerned with the means of making system to behave in a desired may. <br/>        The system on this thesis is a DC – AC inverter which is an apparatus used in the conversion of direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC).<br/>        In our country today, this equipment is not all that in use not because it is not important but because people never give it a thought as per the construction and design.<br/>        It is meant for use with a 12volts lead acid battery of it’s in a car for example a suitable output voltage of 240volts AC obtainable.<br/>        This output voltage of 240volts AC can be used for powering small electrical appliances such as lights, electrical tools radio, soldering iron, fan etc. However, it is with mentioning that the DC generated with this appliance is nothing comparable to the AC generated by big generation duration. This appliance is therefore suitable for short time replacement for the real AC generation especially in the remote areas and it is install where electrical appliances are sold and the need might arise for it to be tested and certified good.<br/>        Another main area where this equipment can be of great utility is in communication system. In a situation where there is a constant AC power supply failure example in offices DC – AC inverter is needed and such cases, inverter can be used as a source of light.<br/>        Most industries in the country do not make use of DC – AC inverter because there are through to be costly with respect to the task they perform. However, putting into consideration the task, this appliance can perform. It can be concluded that it is cheaper. The construction is simple, cheaper, easy to operate and portable. The usefulness of this device and the function cannot be over emphasized especially now that our country is passing through a very sensitive era in our power generating Authority (NEPA) has been dubbed NEVER EXPECT POWER ALWAYS. In these times when control and monitor of complex field operations have based in computer, a failure of AC, power supply to communication equipment means work stoppage and to some small scale industries a lot of economic and materials losses is avoidable. <br/>        Inverters come in different types. Examples<br/>Modified sine wave, pure sine wave and grid tie inverter are:<br/>Modified Sine Wave: The output of a modified sine wave inverter is similar to square wave output except that the output goes to zero Volts for a time before switching positive or negative. It is simple and low cost, also it’s compatible with most electronic devices, except for sensitive or specialized equipment for example certain laser printers, fluorescent lighting, audio equipment.  Most AC motors will run off this power source about at a reduction inefficiency of approximately 20%.<br/>        A pure sine wave inverter produces a nearly perfect sine wave output (&lt;3% total harmonic distortion) that is essentially the same as utility –supplied grid power.  Thus it is compatible with all AC electronic devices.  This is the type used in grid tie inverts. Its design is more complex, and costs more per unit power.  The electrical inverter is a high power electronic oscillator.  It is so named because early mechanical AC to PC converters were made to work in reserve and thus were “inverted” to convert DC to AC.<br/>        A grid tie inverter is a sine wave inverter designed to inject electricity into the electric power distribution system.  Such inverter must synchronise with the frequency of the grid.  They usually contain one or more maximum power point tracking features to extract the maximum amount of power, and also include safety features.<br/>APPLICATIONS<br/>DC Power Source Utilization <br/>Inverter designed to provide 115 VAC from the 12 VDC source provided in an automobile.  The unit shown provides up to 1.2 amperes of alternating current, or enough to power two sixty watt light bulbs.<br/>Micro –inverter convert direct current from individual solar panels into alternating current for the electric grid.  They are grid tie designs by default.<br/>Uninterruptible Power Supplies   <br/>An uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) uses batteries and an inverter to supply AC power when main power is not available.  When main power is restored, a rectified supplies DC power to recharge the batteries.<br/>        Induction heating inverters convert low frequency main AC power to higher frequency for use in induction heating.  To do this, AC power is first rectified to proved DC power.  The inverter then charges the DC power to high frequency AC power.<br/>  <br/>\n\nDESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN INVERTER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN INVERTER", "id": 129}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN AUTOMATIC THREE PHASE SELECTOR.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This is a technical report presented on the design and construction of an Automatic Three Phase Selector.<br/>        In the construction work, an ordinary level knowledge of electronics principles are observed.

The negative electrode is of lead and the positive electrode is of lead (iv) oxide (pb02).  The electrolyte is sulphur acid initially of density. 1.21 the initial emf of the battery it about 2.1 volts.  This rapidly decrcoses to 2.0 volts at which figure it remains nearly constant until the battery is almost discharge re-charging should be begin if the emf falls as low as 1.8 volts.<br/>        Those substance of the cell which stake active part in chemical combination and hence absords or produces electricity during charging or discharging are known as active materials of the cell.  The active materials of a lead acid cell are.<br/>1.           Lead peroxide (Pb02) for positive plate<br/>2.           Spong lead (Pb) for negative plate<br/>3.           Delute Sulphorine Acid (H2 S04) as electrolyte<br/>Lead peroxide (pb02) is a combination of lead and oxygen.  Its dure chocolate brown in colour and its quite hard but brittle substance.  It is made up of one atom of lead (pb) and two atoms of oxygen (02) and its chemical formular is Pb02: As said earlier, it posses the positive action material of the accumulator.  The spong lead (pb) is a pure leads in soft sponge or porous conduction, its chemical formualr is Pb and forms the negative alhra material.<br/>        The dilute sulphrine acid is approximately  three parts water and one parts suphurie acid the chemical formular of this is H2 S04.  The positive and negative plates are inversed in this solution known as electrolyte.  The current producers chemical changes in this solution.  Hence the  lead acid cell depend.  For its action of the presence of two plates covered with Pb02 and Pb in solution of dilute H2S04 of specific gravity of 1.21 or ne3ar about as earlier stated.  The basically means of discharging and the charging process of the accumulator is known as chemical charger.<br/>        In the process of the accumulator is known as chemical charger.  In the process of dischargings of a battery.  If the cell is fully charged, it s positive plate or anode is Pb02 (dack chocolate brown0 and the negative plate or cathode is pb (slate grey) when the cell discharges, the scorda current through the extend lend, then H2 S04 is dissociated into positive H2 and negative S04 ions.  As the current within the cell is flowing from cathode to anode in the process of charging of a battery if the cell is recharged, then hydrogen ions (H2) moves to cathode and S04 ions gas to anode and the following charges would likely placed.<br/>        At cathode<br/>                 Pb S04 + H2                Pb + H2 S04<br/>        At Anode<br/>                 Pb S04 + S04 + 2H20                  Pb02 + 2H2 S04<br/>General, it will be noted that during discharging the following are absorbed:<br/>i.             Both anode and cathode becomes pb S04 which is whitish in colour<br/>ii.            The specific gravity and acid is discharged due to the formation of water<br/>iii.          The voltage of the cell decrease<br/>iv.          The cells given out energy<br/>METHOD OF CHARGING<br/>        These are basically four method of charging batteries.   They are includes:<br/>a.           Constant voltage<br/>b.           Constant current<br/>c.           Ride charging and <br/>d.           Floating charging<br/>But for the purpose of celerity and simplification of works and increase of theirs project it is the constant voltage method that we are going to discuss furt6her.  This method has been employed while testing and constructing the charger.<br/>CONSTANT – VOLTAGE METHOD<br/>          In the method of charging the voltage is  maintained at a value which is slightly in excess of the end of fully charged battery, act the beginning of the charging period the current is charged.<br/>        During the charging process the current fails as the emf of the cell rises to approach the charging voltage when the battery is fully charged it up to its maximum 12 volts, the charger will automatically stop charging with the help of the contact relay, the transistor and the zener dioxide which send the current back to the system.<br/>        Then at this moment<br/>        The charging current is usually determined from the formular<br/>IC     =      V – E<br/>                    r<br/>Where       IC     =

In rent years, the destruction in our electrical and electronic equipment caused due to the and unsteady current has lead many home or family homeless and also an expense.<br/>        The introduction of an automatic voltage regulation act as an answer prayer for the protection of our equipment since it comes into existence. This device is made to vary the amount of current supplied through the supplier.  It also helps to smoothing the voltage to be used in our electrical and electronic devices.<br/>        The automatic voltage regulator is a protective device that brings out a steady current which varies between 100V-240V.  This device is very good and active in terms of protecting our devices.<br/>1.1    OBJECTIVE / AIM OF STUDY <br/>The Automatic Voltage Regulator (1000VA) is made to produce a stable and steady current.  The device is produced or designed to perform the following functions which includes.<br/>        This device is used to step up and step down the voltage when the supply is faulty. It is an appliance that helps to prevent the life span of electronic any electrical and electric devices that makes the use of it.<br/>        It also brings out a filtered current which bring smothering the components that can make use of it.  This system can be called an automatic machine because it perform the functions of automatic system in which by changing from one stage to another in order to feet the valuable current and voltage to the supplied by the components to makes use of it.<br/>        The damages received by the society which ignored the use of automatic voltage regulator is so complicated that it cannot be mentioned in this project. But my advice to the society is to try as much as possible to make the use of automatic voltage regulation in their electrical and electronic components because it is a protective device.<br/>1.3       THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The design and construction of IkVA Automatic Voltage Regulator is the project we are construction.  We are working on this machine because we have some idea on how this machine can be constructed and also on how it works.  We are also doing this because we want to learn more abut it.<br/>        As we have mentioned earlier, this device is a protective device that protects our electrical and electronic appliances out of current and voltage fluctuation.

However, pin 2 of the first NE555 was used as sensor part .When pin 2 has contact with human body or hand it will activate the IC1 which will also bias transistor and this transistor was wired in a way that once it is powered it will close circuit thereby passing a negative supply voltage to tone generator circuit and outputted out through a loud speaker or buzzer. <br/>This device functions as a major security device against car-theft as stated above. It is an electronic device that is connected to the battery of the car it is being installed in and gets activated when the car engine is switched off and the car stationed at a place. The device is not seen but, it has an indicator light which shows that the alarm has been activated. When the body of the car is touched by human hand, it sends a negative signal to the device which needs a negative pulse to get activated; it sends this negative from the human hand to the tone generator IC which triggers the alarm.    <br/>                                          TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>   CHAPTER ONE: Introduction                                                                               </p><p>   1.1    Background of study<br/>1.2       Aims and objectives<br/>    CHAPTER TWO: Literature Review <br/>    CHAPTER THREE: Specification and operation of system component              </p><p>3.1       Description of NE55 Timer            <br/>3.2       Description of Resistor<br/>3.3       Description of Capacitor<br/>3.4       Description of Diode<br/>3.5       Description of Transformer <br/>3.6       Description of Loud Speaker and Buzzer<br/>3.7       Description of Transistor<br/>3. 8     Description of L.E.D<br/>    CHAPTER FOUR: Operation of system and its circuit and block diagram<br/>4.1       Operation of  <br/>4.2       The circuit diagram<br/>4.3    The block diagram<br/>    CHAPTER FIVE: Construction, Testing and Packaging<br/>5.1    Values of components<br/>5.2    Assembly<br/>5.3    A schematic diagram of the finished work<br/>    CHAPTER SIX: Conclusion and Recommendation<br/>6.1       Conclusion <br/>6.2       Recommendation <br/>6.3       Observations <br/>6.4       Dificulties<br/>6.5      Reference                        <br/> CHAPTER ONE:  INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1.            Background of the Study<br/>        The first car alarm was a primitive contraption that utilized a bell or horn connected to the drive shaft. It was created by an unnamed Nebraska inventor in June 20th, 1920. It utilizes the drive shaft to operate its own bell or horn signal when the car is properly moved. This is just a little talk on a car alarm but not a car touch intruder alarm which is a modern, more advanced, and more reliable type of car alarm.<br/>        This car touch sensitive alarm project consist of three NE555 timer IC, the first NE555 was wired as monostable  multi-vibrator and the remaining two were wired as tone generator. When the sensor is touch or has contact with human hand perhaps body, IC1 is triggered at its pin 2 and output pin 3 goes high for a time period previously set by the values of R4 (10M) and Q1 (transistor) was bias via R3 and this transistor is in such a way that once it was biased it will supply a negative voltage to tone generator thereby making two NE555 timer which was know as (tone generator) to oscillate to make a bell sound through the buzzer. The tone generators are configured as an astable multi-vibrator whose oscillation frequency can be varied with the help of PR1 and PR2. By adjusting the values of PR1 and PR2, modifications on the tone are possible. <br/>The reset button is used to set or open circuit the system back to its initial stage. The system is powered with 12V power supply voltage.<br/>The first chapter of this project is narrating on the introduction, the concept of the system and also the aims and objective. Chapter two is all about literature review. Chapter three talks about specification and operation of system component. Chapter four is operation of system. Chapter five is about construction, testing and packaging. Chapter six is conclusion, observation, recommendation and References. <br/>1.2       AIM AND OBJECTIVE<br/>       The main aim and objective of the design and construction this project is to create a comfort in the minds of vehicle owners or users when their vehicles are parked or stationed anywhere without much fear of car-theft. <br/><br/></p>\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF CAR TOUCH INTRUDER ALARM.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONSTRUCTION OF CAR TOUCH INTRUDER ALARM.", "id": 134}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>POWER OUTAGE IN NIGERIA<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This research work examines the factors affecting  power  outage in Nigeria.<br/>Constants Power supply is the hallmark of a develop economy.
