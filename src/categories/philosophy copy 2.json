[{"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECT OF EUROPEANS (COLONIALISTS) ON THE OVAH PEOPLES<br/>BACKGROUND OF STUDY</b><br/>1.1    Introduction<br/>To live without conflicts is not to exist. The culture of conflict is universal and noticeable in every society. In so far as there are conflicting interests and divergent ideas even in relation to the same issues.Conflicts therefore is inevitable, wherever incompatible activities occur. <br/>Historically, peoples of various cultures have co-operated and have disagreed over matters as it affects their interest. They have resolved to a variety of conflict resolution methods in different situations including negotiations,conciliation,mediation, and facilitation.1Conflict and conflict resolution by this means.<br/>A clash or disagreement, often violent, between two opposing groups or individuals, and by conflict resolution means “intervention aimed at alleviating or eliminating discord through conciliation.2<br/>The origin of conflict is difficult to trace, which in turn has led to a number of complex interpretations of history. Within these simple definitions there are several important understanding that emerged.<br/>Disagreement- Generally, we are aware there is some level of difference in the positions of the two or more parties involved in the conflict. But the true disagreement versus the perceived disagreement may be quite different from one another. Infact, conflict tends to be accompanied by significant levels of misunderstanding that exaggerate the perceived agreement considerably. If we can understand the true areas of agreement this will helps us solve the right problems and manage the true needs of the parties.<br/>Parties involved- There are often disparities in our sense of who is involved in the conflict. Sometimes, people are surprised to learn that they are a party to the conflict, while other times we are shocked to learn we are not included in the disagreement. On many occasions, people who are seen as part of the social system (e.g team, family, and company) are influenced to participate in the dispute, whether they would personally define the situation in that way or not. In the above example, people very readily take sides. Based upon current perceptions of issues and relationships, roles within the organization and other factors. The parties involved can become an elusive concept to define.<br/>Perceived threat- People respond to the perceived threat, rather than the time threat, facing them, thus, while perception does not become reality per se, peoples behaviors, feelings and ongoing responses become modified by that evolving sense of the threat they confront. If we can work to understand the time threat (issues) and develop strategies (solutions) that manage it (agreement), we are acting constructively to manage the conflict.<br/>Needs, interests or concerns- There is a tendency to narrowly define “the problem” as one of substance, task and near-term viability. However, workplace conflicts tend to be far more complex than that for they involve ongoing relationships with complex emotional components simply, there are always procedural needs and psychological needs to be addressed within the conflict, in additions to the substantive needs that are generally presented. And the durability of the interest and concerns of the parties transcends the immediate presenting situation. Any efforts to resolve conflicts effectively must take these points into account.3<br/>Conflicts in pre-colonial Ovah community, like every society in Benin is focused on the role of individuals, groups in the promotion, resolution and sustaining of conflict and peace.Individuals and groups who engage in conflict are also some institutions who attempt to resolve them.4<br/>As in most pre-colonial African societies, therewere bound to be conflicts among individuals and communities but there also existed traditional methods by which they were resolved to ensure that peace and order were achieved and maintained in the society. It however hopes that the lessons to be learnt from the findings of this paper, if properly applied, would be of great benefit to those who are charged with the responsibilities to the various intra and inter-ethnic as well as sectarian crisis presently ravaging various parts of Nigeria and the African continent in general. A case study of the Ovah community.5<br/>Though conflict is perceived as contra-society and destructive, it is necessary for social change. It may infact be the product of social change just as it may help produce change. Similarly, internal conflicts may be positively functional and may produce unity in a society, depending on the type of issues at stake, that is, if issue are not fundamentally opposed to the basic norms and values on which relations are based.6<br/>In describing the context to any conflict in traditional Africa, land is perhaps the most commonly cited cause of conflict, this disputes could be between individuals, communities, or families. Land is highly priced and people are willing against all odds, to defend and protect a piece of an ancestors land. In simple societies Africa, a case study of the Ovah. Sorcery and witchcraft are practices which cause death and threaten to diminish and destroy the social group, and which society itself has come to perceive with fear and suspicion. Sorcery and witchcraft and trials stir up discontent, and they are veritable sources of conflict. <br/>Sexual offences such as adultery incest and rape are also veritable sources as of conflict in indigenous Africa. In traditional African societies, a clear cut distinction is drawn between rape and adultery, and in each case, there are clear cut defined punishment for offenders.7<br/>Succession, as in many kingdoms which later sprang up within the fringes of the Ancient kingdom of Benin. This has often led to political and social strife with people migrating to establish new kingdoms. In cases where succession to kingship was opened to all bonafide members of the community, and where leadership did not descend from father to son in immediate succession as in the case of the Ovah community where the Odionwere is chosen by age, i.e. the oldest wears the crown, may lay open the succession process to conflict between contending parties and individuals.8<br/>What makes a society an ideal polity is the extent to which conflicting interests and needs in that society are constructively managed so that violence does not threaten its continued existence. For many African indigenous societies oath taking is a veritable tool of conflict and conflict resolutions. As noted by Gluckman, the objective of the traditional  African courts are to right wrong, adjust claims, defend norms, and prevent good relations from being broken.9<br/>In conclusion, the chapter introduced the nature of conflict, the causes and some measures in resolving them in pre-colonial Africa, a case study of Ovah community. So that if one reads the first chapter, understanding of the chapters that follows will not be difficult.<br/>1.2    Aims and Objectives<br/>This study seeks to achieve the following aims and objectives.<br/>1.    To examine the concepts and dimensions of conflict resolution.<br/>2.    To examine the historical origin and background of the Ovah peoples.<br/>3.    To examine the socio-cultural, and political organization of the Ovah people.<br/>4.    Analyze traditional methods of conflict resolution in pro-colonial Ovah community<br/>5.    Conclusions.<br/>1.3    Scope of Study<br/>This study covers the period from the early times up till the period before the first contact of the Ovah peoples with Europeans (colonialists). This study covers conflict resolutions in pre-colonial Ovah community; it would also cover the origin, background, socio-cultural, political organization of the Ovah people, it will give comparative analysis of the traditional methods of conflict resolution, and hope to reach a middle where we could conclude that the traditional methods of conflict resolution if implemented today, in the present day, it could help the rather waning society from total collapse.<br/>1.4    Literature Review:<br/>Research from the existing literatures on conflict resolutions in Nigeria shows that there are no work on pre-colonial Ovah community per se. Hence a resort to oral interview. There are however books with regard to African society of which ovah is a constitute. Books adopted in the course of this research work included;<br/>Isaac O. Albert in his book titled, informal channels for conflicts resolutions in Ibadan, 10which contributes to the traditional methods of peace keeping methods in African societies. In his book, he emphasized on the need to adopt policies which was geared towards social integration, discourage ethnicism, and individualism. He focused on the Ibadan town, among the Yoruba group, but his work is very relevant to this work, as social crisis in traditional African states were almost the same.<br/>Francisca AkunnaEzenkwo, M.I.H.D, and Joseph InegbenebhoOsagie,P.H.D in the article titled “conflict and conflict resolution in pre-colonial Igbo society of Nigeria”,11 the book introduces us to what conflict is, its manifestation, and how it is resolved in a traditional African Society it gave us a very good base to what conflict and conflict resolution entails in this research work, and ways it was resolved using a case study of an African Society.<br/>BjarneVestergaard “et. al”, in the book titled “conflict resolution-working about various ways of working with and within conflict”12 in the book the writers wrote about various ways of working with and within conflict. It introduced us to various dimensions of conflict resolution, and also they shared various experiences, across cultural borders, explore differences, understand other discourses and learn from conflict resolution, in other Social contexts. This work serves as a secondary reliable source for this research work.<br/>Peace studies and conflict Resolution, as edited by E.O.S Iyamu and Lilian.I. Salami, the book addressed the dimensions of conflict, and some concepts to understanding conflict Resolution: This work was very relevant in the writing of a chapter in this research work.<br/>Max Glauckman, in his book titled “politics and Rituals in Tribal Society”13 he viewed conflict as inevitable, and that traditions and rituals were the natural way that societies preserved themselves. His analysis further indicated that through understanding each other, human beings could come to develop common traditions and methods of overcoming traditions and conflict. This work also serves as a reliable secondary source in this research project.<br/>J.U. Egharevba, in his book titled “A Short History of Benin”14, he introduced us to the ascension of Oba Esigie, how he clashed with his brother Arhuaran, he talked about how the two brothers clashed over the Benin throne (Ekete) and in consequence the Ovah community was established. This book talked about the battles fought, sometimes one side being the victorious and the other was victorious some other times. This book was of great importance in this research work.<br/>1.5    Methodology <br/>In the process of carrying out this research study, relevant and essential data and materials will be collected and gathered from two main sources, the primary and secondary sources. <br/>According to Ajetunmobi (2009) historical research methodology has documentary values of the local achievement and challenges faced by the people.<br/>Oral traditions will be used mostly as the primary source, while textbooks and the internet would constitute the secondary sources. The oral interviews would be conducted among the elderly in Ovah community. The language used is Edo language and was later translated into English and cross-checked to ascertain their level of objectivity.<br/>END NOTES<br/>1.    AworomAnnang, “Conflict and Conflict Resolution in Indigenous Africa”.

MOORE “<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>    What is knowledge? What can be known? What is it to know? Or put simply; what is the possibility of an absolute truth and certainty in knowledge? These are fundamental questions in epistemology. Aristotle, the ancient Greek philosopher appealed to sense experience, as the source of knowledge. He argued that knowledge begins with a study of particular things. In other words, our knowledge of things begins with the things we can perceive. There is no way we would understand an object or something. We must appeal to the things our sense perceive about that particular thing or object.<br/>    However, to understand G.E. Moore’s argument on the epistemic status of common sense which is a contemporary defense to the theory of knowledge, we can begin by examining what we mean by sense experience and common sense view of the world. Against this background, this work examines the theory of knowledge gotten from common sense beliefs, its implications, importance, effects and differences.<br/> 1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>    The problems of this study can be seen in the tensions arising from G.E. Moore’s attempt to defend common sense beliefs. Moore’s conception of common sense creates some problems in the discourse of philosophy. The first problem created by Moore’s idea of common sense beliefs, is that in appealing to the epistemic nature or character of various common sense beliefs and propositions, there is lot of inconsistency in these beliefs and propositions, this in turn raises objections and criticisms.<br/>The second problem is in the fact of empiricism, the idea that only the senses can give us knowledge There is first of all the question of whether there are other ways of getting certain knowledge, which exist outside of the empirical method and if it does exist, how does it contribute to knowledge, and how can it be attributed to common sensual knowledge? There is infact the question of the epistemological status of the empirical; is every empirical thing true, knowable or useful?<br/>Lastly, though Moore took great pain in specifying the kinds of statement he was talking about, by asserting common sense beliefs and propositions, which can be taken as data, the problem remains that these common sense beliefs and propositions cannot be epistemologically justified. This is because it is not in the virtue of their being common sense proposition and beliefs that confers any positive epistemic status on them. Rather it is as a result of being the case that it is not every common sensical beliefs that are sources of knowledge. <br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>    The main purpose of the study is to examine and evaluate critically, the epistemological implication of common sense propositions and beliefs as sources of knowledge in G.E. Moore. <br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>    The significance of this study can be seen in its potential contribution to knowledge. It will expose us to the contribution, importance, sources and limits of common – sensical beliefs to knowledge. It will enable us determine the justification of what we mean by common sense beliefs. <br/>1.5    SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>    The scope of this study will be limited to knowledge derived from common sense beliefs, as argued by G.E. Moore. It will include sense perceptory knowledge and empirical knowledge. A critical evaluation of the theory of knowledge and G.E. Moore’s idea of common sense will be studied, since it exposes us to its implication and contribution. Thus, it affects what we claim to know epistemologically. <br/>1.6    METHODOLOGY <br/>    The primary source will include G.E. Moore’s work on common sense; a critical evaluation which looks at the merits and demerits will be a major methodology to be used in this project.<br/>    Secondary source will also include extensive library research, relevant and literature and materials applicable to the current subject, with a view to extensively evaluate and analyze them and also to source the internet for more materials to support this project. <br/>1.7    LITERATURE REVIEW <br/>    There are a number of works that have been done on epistemology. These works focuses on its practices, sources, and limits. Some of these works also offer a general view on the theory of knowledge, specifically common sense theory. One of the works relevant to this study is titled; An Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge by Dan O’ Brien. He examined the study of the theory of knowledge, its sources, limits, justification and areas of knowledge. For him, epistemology as a branch of philosophy, studies the human knowledge. It examines how human beings acquire knowledge. It tries to know and examine the scope and limits of human knowledge.1<br/>    Another relevant work is ‘A Contemporary Defense on Common Sense, by Noah Lemos. It explains the common sense tradition and highlights some of its features. It examines some of the chief representatives of the common sense tradition, mainly Thomas as Reid, G.E. Moore and Roderick Chisholm. Although there are important differences among the views of these three philosophers and epistemologist, the book gives a rough account of some central features of the common sense tradition in philosophy.2<br/>    Another relevant work on G.E. Moore was edited by Michael Huemer. The book titled Contemporary Readings in Epistemology exposes us to the contributions and implication of sense data, his contribution on classical correspondence theory. The text articulates three different versions of common sense. These epistemological concerns also motivate the focus on the ontology  of cognition, which specifically implies that the object of knowledge/cognition are not independent of their knower’s, in other words, being known (cognized, perceived etc) makes a difference to the nature and things being known “the object of knowledge”3.

Inter- religious dialogue is a concept that seeks a common ground on which diverse traditions can meet in mutual respect and sharing. It is a way to come to know people of other traditions and understand their perspective on various issues – ‘’to explore one mountain through many paths’’.<br/>    Inter- religious dialogue is of greater importance and is more difficult when it takes place between people of different and even opposing opinions. They try to dispel each other’s prejudiced opinions and to increase as much as they are able, consensus between themselves. Their objective may be simply interrelationships between men, the search for truth or co-operation in some activity. <br/>    All of these elements are present in every form of dialogue, but since one or other element can predominate, it is possible to distinguish three forms of inter-religious dialogue, seen as attempting to reach: <br/>“An agreement, to be established only in terms of human relationship, destined to liberated those engaged in discussion from their solitude and their mutual distrust, and to induce in true fellow-feeling mutual reverence and esteem.<br/>Secondly, it is “An agreement, to be established in the realm of truth involving discussion of problems of the greatest importance to those engaged in dialogue and the achievement by common effort of a better grasp of the truth and an extension of knowledge.<br/>And thirdly, it is “An agreement to be reached in the realm of action, establishing the conditions under which certain set objectives may be achieved in spite of ideological differences. <br/>    Although it is to be hoped that inter-religious dialogue would be pursued for all three reasons at once, it remains true that each form retains its own power of establishing interpersonal relationship. Every form of inter-religious dialogue, in so far as the participants are involved in mutual give and take, involves ascertain reciprocity. In this it differs from teaching, which enriches the pupil – participant to dialogue. However, inter-religious dialogue can be called a true form of teaching, since it is able to provide the benefit of doctrine for very many men. Inter-religious dialogue is also, implicitly, a proclamation of one’s belief. <br/>    Furthermore, inter-religious dialogue may be considered a challenge to one’s faith but one cannot run away from such a challenge. Through this challenge we may find that our faith can grow. Inter-religious dialogue as understood differs from contention and controversy, in which each participant tries to defend his side and prove that the other side is in error. <br/>    Finally, inter-religious dialogue is not the same as confronting one’s religious belief. For its objective is that one side should come closer to the other side and should understand it better. While each group to dialogue may legitimately hope to persuade the other that it is right, the fact remains that this is not the purpose of inter-religious dialogue, but, rather, mutual enrichment.  <br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>    Plateau state is currently the main site of ethnic and religious violence in Northern Nigeria. The past decade has seen recurrent crises across the state, in urban and rural areas. Thousands of lives have been lost in these violent conflicts. There has been extensive damage to property and the development prospects to the state have been setback. The violence has mainly been along religious lines, especially between Christians and Muslims. One should also understand that ethnicity has also a central role in the conflicts and there are considerable political interests at stake. <br/>    Jos, the state capital of Plateau and a major Northern city with a population of about one million inhabitants, is the epicenter of much of the insecurity in Plateau state and has been the site of some of the worst of the violence. Episodes of mass killings and destructions have occurred in Jos over the years which have also affected other parts of Plateau, in rural areas outside of Jos particularly in 2001, 2002 and 2010. In rural areas there has also been widespread violence between Berom farmers (who are predominantly Christians) and the Fulani pastoralist (who are Muslims). This is generally framed to be conflict over land, but the contrary to media reports, many of those involved tend not to think the fight is about a struggle for grazing land or farm but rather on religious ties. Much of the conflicts are also politically oriented. <br/>The violence in Jos began after two decades of increasing collective violence in other parts of Northern Nigeria, the worst of which occurred in Kano, Kaduna and Bauchi states. Jos was relatively peaceful during this period 1980-2000. In fact the first episode of mass killing or violence in Jos, since the anti-Igbo pogroms in 1966 occurred in 2001. <br/>    This project therefore explores mainly the relationship between Christians and Muslims in Jos and the implications of the relationship to the Jos society. <br/>1.3    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>    This project work would be limited to only two religious beliefs in Jos, Plateau state, which are basically Islam and Christianity and their relationship as it affects the Jos society. It would also focus on the causes of religious intolerance using the Jos society in Plateau state, Nigeria as a case study. <br/>    This study will not address issues that are directly not related to religions, but will focus on those issues that religious intolerance affects directly or indirectly in Jos. Issues to be treated will basically focus on Jos society, Plateau state. <br/>1.4    AIMS AND OBJECTIVES <br/>    The aim of this work is to address the pertinent issues of religious intolerance in Jos, Plateau state. This work will intend firstly is discuss briefly on the historical background of Jos and its original people. <br/>    Secondly, discuss the history of the religious in Jos taking into cognizance Islam and Christianity and their impact on the Jos society. <br/>    Thirdly, make a brief historical survey of the Christian – Muslim relationship in Jos; past and present and its implications. <br/>    Fourthly, reflect briefly on the basic factors that generate religious instability in Jos and the socio, political and economic implications of these factors. <br/>    Finally, after a balanced evaluation of the situation, make some positive recommendations for a solution to the perennial problems of intolerance in the multi-religious and multi-cultural Jos society. <br/>1.5    METHODOLOGY<br/>    The method to be used in this study will be phenomenological, expository and critical analysis of the data gathered.<br/>    This method would be best understood in view of the fact that it would enable an individual to critically and objectively give a clear analysis of the Jos situation without a bias thought. <br/>    Furthermore, it will provide an ample opportunity for the society to see the need for religious pluralism.<br/><br/>\n\nRELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE AND ITS EFFECT IN JOS SOCIETY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE AND ITS EFFECT IN JOS SOCIETY", "id": 3}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>POWER AND AUTHORITY IN NICCOLO MACHIAVELLIS THOUGHT: AN ETHICAL EVALUATION<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>What power is and what authority is inform some serious concerns in philosophical arena.

One will then ask what is “power” and what then is “Authority”? Are they of the same concept. <br/>“Power” can be defined as the ability to do or enforce a thing, while authority on the other hand can be described as the power or right to command. However in this thesis I shall be reviewing the concepts of power vis-à-vis authority as used or been prescribed in a political and social organization by Niccolo Machiavelli. Here we need to understand the idea of power as to whether it is related or has a close link to authority. In our contemporary world today power is been confused for authority, meanwhile it has been a great debate that the idea of power is one and the same with that of authority. <br/>    Subsequently, in this thesis I shall try to marry both concepts of power vis-à-vis Authority to see if it matches with that of the great political philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli in the realization of political empowerment. <br/>1.1    Background of the Study<br/>    Thus goes the “diati” question, why Machiavelli? Why should anyone want to feel the need to reconsider the doctrine of Niccolo Machiavelli? Although there truly is so much tangible and visible originality in Machiavelli scholarship. There are equally so many downright distortations written about him. <br/>    Systematically, power and authority without being dependent on each other or any other in perspective Niccolo Machiavelli is capable of invoking a work or research of some sort. Reason be that there is a discomforting view on the concept of power and authority  and how to provide a marriage between them. <br/>    Most philosophically and critically power can be define as the ability to do or enforce a thing1. While authority in the other hand can be also be defined as the power or right to command. It is the very essential to clarify this two concept because of it confusion in terms of language and as well in terms of thought. When we talk about giving the prince “power” to do this or that, when we equally mean giving him authority, sequentially  we administer the going beyond one’s legal “power” or acting ultra views as to the word authority”. <br/>    Subsequently, I this background I am driven with the passion to dispassionate analyses the essence of power and authority in Niccolo Machiavelli’s thought. <br/>“Any man who tries to be good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who are not good. Hence a prince who wants to keep his authority must learn how to be good, and use that knowledge, or refrain from using it, as necessity requires3”. <br/>In examining  the current or frequent usage appear rightly a the philosophical discussion of Jean Bodin in the 16th century in his work title sovereignty is the absolute and perpetual power of a state … that is to say the Supreme Being ultimate power to command. Jean Bodin goes further to speak of absolute and perpetual power and so affirms that sovereignty is a matter of power in the ordinary sense of the word. <br/>    However Niccolo Machiavelli saw stable and efficient political authority and order as necessary and most important for social  cohesion and moral development. Niccolo Machiavelli stressed the need for a unified politic and also a republican and free government. <br/>    Niccolos Machiavelli’s works include the following. THE PRINCE, THE DISCOURSE, THE ART OF HAR, THE COMEDY, MANDRACON A SATIRE ON SEDUCTION. Further more, in 1520 Niccolo Machiavelli was secured to write a history of Florence by cardinal Giulio de’ medici which he finished in 1525. Note, the prince maintain the heart beat through the journey of this thesis.<br/>1.2    Statement of the Problem<br/>    What is a problem? A problem is a proposition stating something to be done the work to be done on this thesis is an ethical evaluation of the concept of power and authority in Niccolo Machiavelli’s thought respectively. <br/>    However Niccolo Machiavelli’s thought dead for over four hundred and seventy five years now, still have his name reigning as a by word for cunning, evasion  and the exercise of bad faith in political affairs, the cascade of negativism published about him by many notable philosopher and scholars. The question now is, are all these negative analysis and interpretation of Machiavelli true?. <br/>    With the quest to give an understanding of Machiavelli’s political thought, has arisen many ambivalence of interpretation following the above line of though the cumbersome task of x-raying and tele-graphing Machiavelli political thought through an understanding of human nature is what this work seems to achieve. <br/>    Meanwhile we need to ask what is the structure and what exactly are the functions of power vis-à-vis. Authority is any superior to or more relevant than the other? If yes then which. To what extent can one be dependent on or independent of the other is power and authority one and the same? If not, how and to what state do they differ. Who or what can exercise  power or authority and what limits are there. Why power and why authority.  Philosophically speaking the answer to this variable question above as ad-infinitum. <br/>    However in the cause of this thesis write-up, conscious attempt will be made or observed to effect possible progress duly figured out. <br/>1.3    Purpose of the Study<br/>    The purpose of this thesis is to consolidate on the acquisition and sustenance of the concept of power and authority as proffered in the political thought of Niccolo Machiavelli. <br/>    This topic has been a triggered issue that has been expecting a write-up as to the clarification of the both concepts, like have mentioned above that the concept of power and authority is often confused at different time and in different  aspects. This observation and notation constitute a major and distinct reason why in this work.  I am establishing the most attainable clarification concerning the nature of the concept of power vis-à-vis authority lastly, I shall try to fuse both concept as been determined by Niccolo Machiavelli. <br/>1.4    Significance of the Study<br/>    Most often, we witness and observe occurrence of events in governance, but only those exposed to, a basis understanding, especially from a more coherent philosophical viewpoint can successfully grasp reality of such happening independent of necessary falling pray to the hands of whatever disguised form the present themselves. <br/>    However, the idea of power and authority may  not be all there is to the political cosmos. In this , I intend to reconstruct and diffuse or hopefully reveal some extra about the already self evident, in the progress of this thesis, I believe enormous achievement and success which will constitute a model system through which most guised political transactions can be established or formed.<br/>1.5    Scope of the Study<br/>    This work is limited to Niccolo Machiavelli’s conception of power and authority that has been driven for a psychological analysis of human nature. More modify, this work shall illustrate how Niccolo Machiavelli provided a justification for his conception of power and authority by trying it down to human nature. <br/>1.6    Methodology of the Study<br/>    In the methodology of this thesis, I shall try to give an ethical evaluation. Talking  about evaluation it simply involves the critical analysis of it constituent  parts in order to investigate its structure and functions. With this toot of analyses therefore, I shall mantle the pending chapter of this thesis from a brief historical analysis though necessary and sufficient research. <br/>    Meanwhile, relevant contributions from  available sources, factual documented and so forth will be enacted progressively, then follows criticism to play it part of necessary. <br/>1.7    Literature Review <br/>    As regard this topic, many refined authors have written about the term “concept of power” and authority from various point view. But in this thesis, we are mostly concerned with Niccolo Machiavelli’s idea on power and authority. However in other to achieve my set goals of written  pm tjos topic, I have reviewed some books on power which are  been authored by non-philosopher. Meanwhile the reviewing of “the prince” will be most essential, the discourse, Art of War. The 48 laws of power will be highly welcomed, including history of political thoughts. “Niccolo Machiavelli the prince translated by N.K. MARRIOT” is relevant in other to achieve my aim and purpose in his work, and it is to this purpose that this book becomes useful. The book9 present a succulent presentation of Machiavelli’s practical thought in politics, it is in Machiavelli work, the prince that his Manuel of holding political office is expressed with a more practical method which the prince or monarch in other sense must employ in order to given a community effectively7.<br/>    This can be achieved by the prince through the effective use of power as regarding authority so what Machiavelli produces in the prince is a set of prescriptions for the successful management of a state through the procurement of power, the clear presentation of Niccolo Machiavelli’s political thought in this book guide our scope of argument, so that we do not just base our understanding on distorted views. <br/>REFERENCES <br/>1.    Geddes and Grosset, Webster’s Universal Dictionary  and Thesaurus, p. 380.<br/>2.    Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary 8th Edition, p. 83. <br/>3.    The 48 Laws of Power, Robert Greece, p.1.                                 <br/><br/>\n\nPOWER AND AUTHORITY IN NICCOLO MACHIAVELLIS THOUGHT:  AN ETHICAL EVALUATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " POWER AND AUTHORITY IN NICCOLO MACHIAVELLIS THOUGHT:  AN ETHICAL EVALUATION", "id": 4}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN APPRAISAL OF EDMUND GETTIER’S CRITIQUE OF KNOWLEDGE AS “JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF”<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This work is an appraisal based on Edmund Gettier’s problem with the traditional account of knowledge which states that the basic conditions of knowledge is justification, truth and belief (JTB). This definition of knowledge is credited to Plato in his Theatetus. In 1963, Gettier arose to pose scenarios that challenge the tripartite conditions of knowledge, presumably proving that the conditions could amount to sheer luck and not true and certain knowledge.<br/>Gettier’s examples led to various proposals on what knowledge should entail, which implies that it is either the case that the JTB account be totally abandoned or a Fourth Condition be added to make the others more sufficient. Other responses to Gettier will be examined in the course of this research. The Gettier problem has been proven to be a rather difficult one in the course of epistemological inquiry and this work tries to unravel the key issues. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE:  INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    The background of the study    <br/>1.2    The statement of the problem    .    <br/>1.3    The significance of the study    .    .<br/>1.4    Purpose of the study    .    .<br/>1.5    Scope of the study    .    .<br/>1.6    Methodology    .<br/>1.7    Literature review    .<br/>Notes and References<br/>CHAPTER TWO: THE PROBLEM OF KNOWLEDGE<br/>2.1     What is knowledge?    <br/>2.2     Plato’s theory of knowledge<br/>2.3    Knowledge as “Justified True Belief”         <br/>Notes and References        <br/>CHAPTER THREE: EDMUND GETTIER’S CRITIQUE OF KNOWLEDGE AS “JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF”<br/>3.1     Gettier’s life, works and influences    <br/>3.2     The Gettier problem in epistemology    <br/>3.3     Concerns and implications of Gettier’s theory<br/>Notes and References.    <br/>CHAPTER FOUR: CRITICAL EVALUATION<br/>4.1     Summary of the main points    .<br/>4.2     Negative Responses to Gettier    .<br/>4.3     Positive Responses to Gettier    .<br/>4.4     Possible Solutions to the Gettier problem        <br/>4.5     Conclusion    .    <br/>    Notes and References     <br/>    Bibliography     <br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    THE BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>The traditional account of knowledge as propounded by Plato as “justified true belief” suffices as the necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge. This involves three key components namely justification, truth and belief. The formulation holds that three conditions are necessary and jointly sufficient for knowledge. Firstly, there are beliefs which imply that one does not know something unless he holds it as true in the mind, if you do not believe it then you do not know it.1 Secondly, we have truth which means that there can be no knowledge of false propositions; belief in a false hood is delusion or misapprehension, not knowledge2and thirdly, there is justification which means that the belief must be appropriately supported; there must be sufficient evidence or argument for the belief.3<br/>Thus to claim that “all doctors are professionals”, one has to believe it, the statement has to be true and there has to be sufficient evidence or arguments to claim its truth. This implies that knowledge is a three-legged stool which cannot stand when any of its legs are removed. This can be well examined in a situation of lack of belief, truth or justification.<br/>A lack of truth disqualifies knowledge. The pre-Copernican belief  (justified at a time) that heavenly bodies moved around a stationary earth is false, and is thus knowledge, even if educated persons of that time operated under the misapprehension that it was. Also, a lack of justification preludes knowledge. If a fortune teller informs Alice that she will meet the man of her dreams within a month, then this proposition is not knowledge for Alice, even if she believes it and it actually happens. The “justified true belief” conditions of knowledge as proposed by Plato in the Theatetus do not elude critical analysis. This account was accepted by most philosophers at the time, most prominently the epistemologist, Clarence Irving Lewis and his student, Roderick Chisholm. For some time, the justified true belief (JTB) account was widely agreed to capture the nature of knowledge.<br/>However, in 1963, Edmund Gettier published a short widely influential article which has shaped much subsequent work in epistemology. He is reputed to have questioned a theory of knowledge that had been dominant among philosophers for thousands of years.4 Gettier argues that there are situations in which one’s belief may be justifiable while not qualifying as knowledge.5 The counter examples as presented by Gettier are those of beliefs that seem to have justification in their belief, and inferences based on those beliefs turn out to be true by some degree of chance. One of such examples by Gettier is;<br/>1.    Smith and Jones and the job<br/>Smith believes (justifiably) of Jones that <br/>a)    He will get the job<br/>b)    He has 10 coins in his pocket<br/>As a result, Smith believes<br/>c)    The man who has 10 coins in his pocket will get the job.<br/>C is true, but not because Jones is that man, rather, because Smith as both 10coins and the job in hand6.Smith is justified in believing both A and B, even though they are false, he is still justified, but he does not know it. This project seeks to cover up most of the responses to Gettier on both positive and negative sides. <br/>1.2     THE STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>           Epistemology is basically the study ofthe theory of knowledge. The concept of knowledge thus has generated many propositions as to what exactly we can identify as knowledge.<br/>Thus, Plato tried to give an answer to this by supplying us with the concept of “justified true belief” in the Theatetus which was a dialogue between Socrates and Theatetus. A problem arose when Gettier came up with some counter examples that sought to virtually oppose the JTB conditions of knowledge. Is Gettier absolutely correct and without criticisms? Does Gettier’s analysis lead to a total destruction of the JTB system or is it simply a reformation? Would there be an addition to the tripartite conditions for knowledge? All these questions would be addressed in this project.<br/>1.3    THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>  A major significance of this research is that it exposes one to the concept of knowledge. The study enables us to proffer and ascertain certain conditions as to what can be classified as necessary or sufficient conditions for knowledge.<br/>Also, this study aims at studying the lapses evident in the Gettier problem. <br/>1.4     THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The main purpose of this study is to critically analyze Edmund Gettier’s critique of the JTB condition for knowledge as proposed by Plato. It is basically intended towards serving as philosophical enquiry into one of its most important branches-epistemology, as knowledge is applied in our everyday activities. This work seeks to analyze and synthesize critically the fundamental conditions for knowledge, and also provide new solutions.<br/>1.5     THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The scope of this work is limited to an appraisal of Edmund Gettier’s Is justified true belief knowledge?  in response to Plato’s Theatetus  which would form the basic line of concentration in this study. Different responses from various philosophers would also be analyzed, as efforts will be made to create a critical analysis of Edmund Gettiers’s paper.<br/>1.6     METHODOLOGY<br/>The method of this work is critical analysis. This work will begin with an analysis of Plato’s conditions for human knowledge; several arguments either supporting or disapproving these conditions would also be noted. However, Edmund Getttier would be the main focus as this project deals with his critique of the JTB conditions.<br/>The instruments to be used include source documents and materials both from the internet and the library. Some interviews may be conducted in order to put Gettier’s study of the JTB issue in proper perspective. <br/>LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>The first book to be reviewed is The Theatetus written by a prestigious philosopher Plato, published by Hazell Watson Press in 1960. This book contained a dialogue between Socrates and a young boy- Theatetus. The dialogue is devoted to the question “what is knowledge (episteme)?” This dialogue, though not an early one, has the structure usual for a Socratic dialogue: the protagonist (Theatetus- a young brilliant mathematician) offers a series of definitions, all in turn are rejected by Socrates, and the drama ends with a proclamation of ignorance9. However, they concluded that the three sufficient conditions for knowledge are Justification, Truth and Belief. These served as necessary conditions for many years.<br/>Another work to be reviewed is the paper written by Edmund Gettier titled:  Is justified true belief knowledge?” in 1963. This three paged paper ended up creating a new turn to epistemological discourse in philosophy. Here, Gettier argued against the tripartite conditions for knowledge, and he buttressed his points by issuing some counter-examples. This is the basis for this work.<br/>The third book under review is Justified False Beliefs and Truth as a redundant condition by Steve Tensmeyer in 2010. This journal helped give an adequate response to the Gettier problem. Tensmeyer argued against the validity of Gettier’s counter-examples and then classified truth as an object of redundancy. He also advocated for a fourth condition for knowledge, “we must add some conditions to justification and belief that necessarily entails truth”.10<br/>The fifth book to be reviewed is The concept of knowledge by Colin Mcginn in 1984. In his book, Colin Mcginn suggests that knowledge is atomic (it is not divisible into smaller components). We have knowledge when we have knowledge, and an accurate definition of knowledge may even contain the word “knowledge”12. This can as well serve as a critique of Edmund Gettier’s counter examples in relation to the tripartite conditions of knowledge.<br/>The sixth book that would be reviewed in this study is surrounded on Robert Nozick written by David Schmidtz in 2002. It entails most of Nozick’s views on epistemology as written in his Philosophical investigations (1981). He put forward an epistemological system which attempted to deal with both the Gettier problem and those posed by skepticism. This highly influential argument eschewed justification as a necessary requirement for knowledge.13 He also introduced a third and fourth condition for knowledge, which are counterfactuals.<br/>However, many journals would be reviewed, as most responses to Gettier are journals written by contemporary philosophers and scholars. Some of which are On the Gettier Problem by William Lycan, Justified True Belief by Brett Watson, Defending Gettier examples by R. Almeder and a lot of other related journals.<br/>In the next chapter, we would have a look at the problem of knowledge and the JTB account of knowledge.<br/>Notes and References <br/>1.    B.

To do this, the researcher used secondary data in his analysis. The data analysis revealed that Boko Haram crisis has created so many backwardness, hatred, national disintegration and lack of unity in Nigeria. The researcher therefore recommended that for Boko Haram crisis to be prevented, the government should take adequate measures to shut down any training terrorist camps operated by the Boko Haram sect. Then, the nation will start experiencing peace, oneness, security, national unity, development and progress for the betterment of all Nigerians.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>Background of the study<br/>Statement of the problem<br/>Research Questions<br/>Objective of the Study<br/>Scope and Delimitation of the Study<br/>Significance of the Study<br/>Definition of Terms<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE<br/>Theoretical Framework<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>Historical Analysis of Boko Haram Insurgency in Nigeria<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>Boko Haram Insurgency as a Fight Against Western Culture and People Perception in the South-South Region<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>Summary, Conclusion and Recommendation<br/>Summary<br/>Conclusion<br/>Recommendations<br/>Bibliography<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>    Boko Haram in Nigeria is an Islamic fundamentalist group seeking to transform the secular Nigeria state into an Islamic nation by infusing and enforcing strict and draconian sharia laws upon all citizens. Boko Haram which means “anything western or western education is sin”, with this put to mind anything secular therefore is sin (Haram).<br/>    Boko Haram which means terror in the hearts of many Nigerians had its foundation stones laid right from the time of the Maitatsine riots which came about through the awkward Islamic teachings of Muhammad Marwa who was an Islamic scholar-Muhammad Marwa migrated from the town the town of Marwa in northern Cameroun to the city of Kano in 1945. While in Kano he became an Islamist zealot cum fundamentalist concerned with the purification of Islam. He believed that Islam had been corrupted by modernization (westernization) and the formation of the modern state; he was also recorded to have given himself the title of an annabi (a prophet) and made void the teachings and writings of Prophet Muhammad in the Quran. His constant preaching became very abusive, provocative and inciting especially against established institutions like the emirate and the political class to the extent that the then Emir of Kano, Alhaji Sanusi Lamido, expelled him from Kano. Marwa however found his way back to Kano in 1966, presumably after the death of Alhaji Sanusi. Between 1972 and 1979 Marwa was detained in prison several times for his provocative teaching and acts of lawlessness against the state. He (Marwa) was a Qur’anic teacher and preacher opposed to most aspects of modernization and to all western influences Falola (1990:143). It is very obvious that Marwa exploited the dwindling economic situation and the Almajiri system and was able to attract large followers amongst the commoners, who, unable to afford the basic necessities of life, became die hard patriots of the sect and Marwa himself.<br/>    The Boko Haram violence unlike Maitatsine riot also started with inciting teachings of Ustaz Mohammed Yusuf (late) of which garnered followers much of who were unemployed youths and northern tertiary institutions graduates, illiterates and downtrodden of northern Nigerians. It can be said that even Mohammed Yusuf took advantage of the economic situation of Nigeria.<br/>    However, much violent attacks on Muslims and Christians have been carried out after the death of Yusuf, but the situation seems to be under control presently as the joint task force (JTF) in collaboration with sub-regional forces from Cameroon, Niger and Chad are giving the sect a hot battle.<br/>    Despite the state of emergency that has been in operation in three states of the north-eastern part of Nigeria for almost over a year, the violent campaign embarked upon by the Boko Haram Islamic sect has refused to die down. In fact, the violence seems to be escalating, especially in its toll on human lives and property. There are continuing reports of violent activities by Boko Haram, in which dozens of lives are usually lost. Overall, it is estimated that the conflict has consumed several thousands of lives, while properties worth millions of dollars have been lost. In 2012 alone, Boko Haram accounted for 1,386 deaths in 546 attacks, and in 2013 the group was involved in 213 attacks with over 1000 deaths. The Boko Haram insurgency is the latest in the long list of such insurgencies to afflict Nigeria in recent times.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM   <br/>    From the Niger delta uprising to the recent series of Boko Haram insurgency, Nigeria is presently undergoing a true test of security capabilities, as the nation with her leaders had failed to provide adequate security for lives and properties of her citizens. In fact, the present situation in the north eastern region as regards the Boko Haram attacks in the states of Yobe, Adamawa and Borno has now become a regular thing and it seems as though the whole situation is above the control and capabilities of the government and its security forces, although it is a thing of hope if the current upsurge of the security forces in reclaiming the lost territories would bring lasting solution to this region of the country.<br/>    Furthermore, the sect has now become more openly sophisticated and brutal in its modus operand of violence as it now directly attacks even top Muslim leaders -  one of such attacks was that of the Emir Fika and of recent the Emir of Kano.<br/>    However, the major problem now is that the group is faceless, in fact with a flag but only a name and an ideology that seem like a religious ideology, but the question is – is Boko Haram a religious group fighting for a religious course or is it a political weapon used by some top shots to instill violence and acquire power? This is a question to be answered because Boko Haram not only attacks churches and Christians but also mosque and Muslims. This group or simply put as sect has been called upon severally by the federal government of Nigeria for peace talks and negotiations but all to no avail.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>i.    Is the activity of Boko Haram a threat to Nigeria?<br/>ii.    What are the factors responsible for the emergence of Boko Haram in Nigeria?<br/>iii.    What are the perceptions of the southern Nigerians in the face of the Boko Haram insurgency?<br/>iv.    What solution can be proffered in checking the Boko Harm menace?<br/>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>    The overall aim of this research is to examine Boko Haram and insurgencies in Nigeria with particular interest in the north east region with specific objective to,<br/>    The Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria.<br/>    Find out the extent the present Boko Haram violence has threatened the nation’s security.<br/>    To identify and highlight the perception and views of southern Nigerians on Boko Haram insurgency.<br/>    Ascertain the level of insecurity in Nigeria in general terms.<br/>SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF STUDY<br/>    This research work is aimed at evaluating Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria within the year 2009 – 2015. The study shall also examines the nexus between the Boko Haram sect violence  and the level of insecurity in Nigeria in order to fulfill part of the objective of this study, that is, to find out the extent to which the present Boko Haram has threatened the national security of Nigeria.<br/>    The main limitation for this research rests on my inability to have real and first-hand interviews with current or even former members of Boko Haram. This is because Boko Haram is still an ongoing threat and as such even going to the North-Eastern part of Nigeria remains a risk. Another basic limitation rests on the collection and availability of data especially with regards to Boko Haram attacks. While some of the sites are locked and others have some earlier information removed, there was also the grave limitation posed by inaccuracy by different sources (news outfits) with regards to an attack or the number of dead or injured. This shortcoming was however reduced by comparing what, at least, four sources reported on an issue.<br/>    Future researchers should however coin out modalities in order to see through the eyes of insurgents and terrorists. By this I mean, having interviews with insurgents to personally hear why they do what they do.<br/>METHODOLOGY APPLIED<br/>    The findings herewith presented were based on a desk research with heavy reliance on books; you tube clips, online news outfits, articles, online data sources, journals, and reports. Being a qualitative research, emphasis is also hinged on content analysis.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>    This research work will make individuals and the public to be aware of the existing and threatened national security of Nigeria as a result of insurgencies. Also this research work is to basically reveal the foundation of the Boko Haram sect. Bottom line, the entirety of this project work is to add to knowledge for a better understanding of what insurgency really is and how it has affected the north east region of the country and the unity of Nigerian state.<br/> REFERENCES<br/>Agbiboa, D.

Therefore, leadership becomes an indispensable factor of the human society or an organization. Leadership or government is instituted for the sole purpose on of maintaining peace, orderliness stability and to prevent chaos and anarchy in the society or political entity. In the discourse of political philosophy, Thomas Hobbes committed himself to the task of tracing the origin of the state as a political entity in 1651 in his book titled ‘Leviathan’. This was necessitated by the fact in the 17th century; Europe experienced a great political problem. <br/>The book mentioned above, contained his social contract theory which was set out to trace the origin of the state. Thomas Hobbes’ aim was to re-introduce peace, orderliness and stability in the once disordered, ore disorganized political society. The emergence of the state traced through the social contract by Thomas Hobbes, was the voluntary agreement of all individuals to surrender their rights and powers themselves to one man or assembly of men who can represent them and bear their burden. This man or assembly of men, he calls ‘leviathan’ who every man gave up their rights and powers so that he would keep them in awe and give them security.<br/>Thomas Hobbes subscribed to absolute authority for the leviathan or those in the helm of affairs. And according to him, a sovereign without such an authority or power is no sovereign at all. For Hobbes the sovereign can do whatever he likes with absolute authority or power, he is above the law he says, the chaos of the absolute power in the society is preferred to that of a society in which there is no absolute power. At this juncture, the question now is, can the evils of the absolute authority or power be preferred to the evils of life in the society that does not contain such an authority or power? Can the authority or power left to an individual’s disposal, promote peace? <br/>0.2    THE STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Historically, the world exhibits peculiar and different qualities of leadership. Leadership experience have been of both good and bad due to the nature of mankind. And according to Aristotle, ‘man is a political animal.1 this means that in every society there must be a leader, a person or group of persons who directs the affairs of the society towar1ds its goal. Hence, Thomas Hobbes argues that the most dangerous place for man to live in is a chaotic society where there is no leader. That is, no authority of the civil law, etc and the behavior of ‘man’ is ruled by inner impulses. This state, he calls the state of nature. In such society, man’s life is not secure because man by nature is self and egoistic and so, the life of man in such society is nasty, brutish, short and poor. for survival of the fittest, man is against man and by this man’s life is not safe. The question now is, what type of leadership is suitable for such society that will best maintain peace and orderliness?<br/>0.3    THE AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>Generally speaking the essence of any government is to make law, so as to enhance the smooth running of the state. Any government therefore, that does not care for the peaceful co-existence of its citizens is an ill- functioning government. The essence of government is to maintain peace, stability and smooth running of the state. Just like Paul G. Elberecht would say; for a government to be truly good, its energy must be directed towards the maintenance of peace, it must also work to suppress inequality and the misuse of power, and it must strive diligently for the maintenance of adequate temporal care for every citizen”2.it is on this note that the aim of this easy or study is to see whether a chaotic society, if hobbies idea of 2leadership  (absolute authority) is enforced to cub a chaotic situation in order to achieve peace and stability is the best form  of government.<br/>0.4    THE SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>    This essay shall concern itself only with the exposition and evaluation of the idea of leadership in Hobbes political thought. And also examine some philosophers’ idea on leadership before Thomas  Hobbes. <br/>0.5    METHODOLOGY<br/>    This research work shall employ a critical and analytic method in looking at the idea of leadership in Thomas Hobbes political thought. Chapter one shall deal with the general concept of leadership. That is, the meaning of leadership, types of leadership, characteristics of leadership and purpose of leadership. Chapter two shall explore the idea of leadership in some philosophers before Thomas Hobbes. Precisely Plato of the ancient era, Thomas, Aquinas of the middle era also known as middle age, and Nicolo Michiavelli of the modern era. Chapter three shall critically look at the idea of leadership in Hobbes stating from the state of nature which ariseth social contract and commonwealth that lead to the emergence of the society or state and by this Hobbes posited that absolute authority or power should rule the society or the state that emerged from the social contract and commonwealth as his idea of leadership. Chapter four which is the last chapter of this discourse shall give an evaluation on the idea of leadership in Thomas Hobbes political thought. And there follows immediately conclusion. <br/> End Notes<br/>1.    Olatunji Oyeshile, A compendium of philosophy and political quotation, (Ibadan: Hope Publication 2001), p.556. <br/> 2.     Paul g.

The Case Study for this discussion is Ancient Greece were this kind of worship greatly flourished.<br/>The scope and antiquity of goddess worship are remarkable. Female sacred images are associated with some of the oldest archaeological evidence for religious expression and they still have efficacy in the contemporary world. Goddess images are depicted in a wide range of forms, from aniconic representations, such as abstract organs of reproduction to fully elaborated icons decorated with the finery of monarchy. They are linked to all major aspects of life including initiation, marriage, reproduction and death. <br/>They display the elaborate variegation of religious experiences in different cultural contexts. A historical survey reveals goddess worship to be a continuous phenomenon despite periodic ebbs and tides during certain critical epochs.<br/>Quite interesting and breath-taking is the religious symbology associated with it. It tends to mirror the arts and symbols portrayed in the pictures and deeds of this goddesses and how its relevance to Religious and Sociological aspect of life.<br/>The aforementioned is cleverly linked through the Goddess Movement and its indelible influence on feminist drive by present day women.<br/>This piece is set to change the world view about the feminine and give them an equal opportunity to express themselves by relieving them of the over-bearing burden of the patriarchal world.<br/>1.2 CLARIFICATION OF TERMS<br/>This caters for the brief explanation of some complex words contained in the topic of this work.<br/>For better understanding of this work, the following words need some clarification and a little insight so as to make the reader quite grounded. They include-<br/>Iconography<br/>Goddess<br/>Worship<br/>Ancient Greece<br/>Nexus<br/>Feminism.<br/>1.2.1 ICONOGRAPHY<br/>Iconography as a branch of History studies the Identification, Description and the Interpretation of the content of images: the subjects depicted the particular compositions and details used to do so and other elements that are distinct from artistic style.<br/>The word iconographycomes from the Greek (image) and (‘’to write’’).  A secondary meaning (based on a non-standard translation of the Greek and Russian equivalent terms) is the production of religious images, called ‘’icons’’,in the Byzantine and Orthodox Christian tradition.<br/>In Art History, ‘’an iconography’’ may also mean a particular depiction of a subject in terms of the content of the image, such as the number of figures used, their placing and gestures.<br/>Religious images are used to some extent by all major religions and often certain highly complex iconography, which reflects centuries of accumulated tradition.<br/>1.2.2 GODDESS<br/>A Goddess is a Female Deity in polytheistic Religions. Goddesses most often have Feminine characteristics that are apotheosize in their pure form. However in some cases Goddesses may embody neutral forms, personifying both Male and Female characteristics (like Sophia), or they may even exhibit traits that are traditionally associated with the Male gender (for example, Artemis).<br/>Goddesses have been especially linked with virtues such as Beauty, Love, Motherhood and Fertility (Mother-Goddess cult in prehistoric times), but because of their flexibility in gender portrayal, they have also been associated with ideas, such as War, Creation and Death.<br/>The primacy of a monotheistic or near-monotheistic ‘’great goddess’’ is advocated by some modern Matriarchists as a female version of, preceding or analogue to, the Abrahamic God associated with the historical rise of monotheism in the Mediterranean axis Age.<br/>Polytheist religions, including polytheistic Reconstructionists, honor multiple Goddesses, and usually view them as discrete, separate beings.<br/>The noun ‘goddess’ is a secondary formation, combining the Germanic Godwith the Latinate- ess suffix. It first appeared in Middle English, from about 1350. The English word follows the linguistic precedent of a number of languages- including Egyptian, ClassicalGreek, and several Semitic languages that add a feminine ending to the language’s word for God.<br/>1.2.3 WORSHIP<br/>Worship is the feeling or expression of reverence and adoration for a Deity. It is also used in addressing or referring to an important or high-ranking personality.<br/>1.2.4 ANCIENT GREECE<br/>Ancient Greece was a Civilization belonging to a period of Greek History from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th-19th centuries BC to the end of antiquity (c.600AD).Immediately following this period was the beginning of the early middle Ages and the Byzantine Era. <br/>Roughly three centuries after the late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece, Greek Urban Poleis began to form in the 8th century BC, ushering in the period of archaic Greece and colonization of the Mediterranean basin.<br/>This was followed by the period of Classical Greece, an era that began with the Greco-Persian wars, lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC.<br/>Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedonia, Hellenistic civilization flourished from central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. The Hellenistic period came to an end with the Roman Republic, which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire.<br/>Classical Greek culture, especially philosophy had a powerful influence on Ancient Rome, which carried a version of it to many parts of the Mediterranean basin and Europe. For this reason Classical Greece is generally considered to be the seminal culture which provided the foundation of modern western culture and is considered theCradle of Western Civilization.<br/>The Civilization of Ancient Greece has been immensely influential on Language, Politics, Philosophy, Science, Arts and the Educational system. It became the leitkulturof the Roman Empire to the point of marginalizing native Italic traditions. As Horace put it,<br/>‘’Graecia capta ferumvictoremcepit et artis/intulitagrestilatio’’.<br/>“Captive Greece took captive her uncivilized conqueror and instilled her arts in rustic Latium”.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ancientgreece.  Retrieved 5/06/2017<br/>Via, the Roman Empire, Greek Culture came to be foundational to Western Culture in general. The Byzantine Empire inherited Classical Greek Culture directly, without Latin intermediation, and the preservation of Classical Greek learning in Medieval Byzantine tradition further exerted strong influence on the Slavs and later on the Islamic Golden Age and the Western European Renaissance. A modern revival of Classical Greek learning took place in the Neoclassicism Movement in 18th and 19th century Europe and the America.<br/>1.2.5 NEXUS<br/>This is a connection of series of connections linking two or more things. It originated in the mid 17th century. It is from Latin meaning “a binding together”, fromnex-“bound”, from the verb NECTERE.<br/>1.2.6 FEMINISM<br/>This is a range of Political movements, Ideologies and Social movements that share a common goal: to define, establish and achieve Political, Economic, Personal and Social Rights for Women.<br/>Feminist Movements have campaigned and continue to campaign for Women’s Rights, including the Right to Vote, to hold Public Office, to work, to earn fair wages or equal pay, to own property, to receive Education, to enter contracts, to have equal rights within marriage and to have Maternity Leave. Feminists have also worked to promote bodily autonomy and integrity, and to protect Women and Girls from rape, sexual harassment and domestic violence. <br/>According to Daisy UdonMorsi, a graduate of Religions from the University of Benin and a Feminist, she says ‘’feminism is not a fight for equality with men but for equity amongst men”. By men she meant both male and female.<br/>Feminist Theory which emerged from Feminist Movements, aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining women’s social roles and lived experience; it has developed theories in a variety disciplines in order to respond to issues concerning gender.<br/>1.3 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>‘’…successfully converted the world from matriarchal paganism to patriarchal Christianity by waging a campaign of propaganda that demonized the sacred feminine, obliterating the goddess from modern religion forever.’’[Frymer-kensky, p.45]<br/>Archaeological findings have in no mean terms affirmed at several times that the earliest form of worship was matrilineal. The people of antiquity worshipped various goddesses that were in-charge of the various aspects of life and the environment. Most times they had their attention on only the mother goddess or the great mother as the case maybe. The mother goddess was referred to sometimes as the Creatrix (creator of the universe) or most times as the mother over the other goddess.<br/>During this time, society wore the robes of matriarchy even though women did not have as much right compared to the heavyweight of their male folks. One striking thing of note was that religion at that time was the defining factor of all man’s activity. Man consulted and offered to the deities before he could embark on anything. Religion then was very vital, as the feminine was the focal point of the religious activities.<br/>Not too long from that time did the male folks begin to wage an aggressive war against the worship of goddesses. They started by installing the worship of the God-worship. This resulted in attention shift from Goddess worship, by creating a God equivalent for all Goddesses and their aspects.<br/>This shift in religious position affected the influence of women in the society as there was nothing tangible that the women folks could hold on to as the source of their strength. Women were more than ever before relegated to the background.<br/>In ancient Greece, a woman was seen as the property of her husband and hardly possessed any rights. Even a slave then, possessed rights of ownership and even more when liberated. A woman was merely kept in the ‘cage’ of her father and handled over to her husband after marriage consummation.<br/>Understanding the fact that the feminine held sway in the religious circle amongst the Greek ancients, and in retrospectof the limitation of women in terms of right in ancient Greece, it awakens and prompts a clarion call for modern day feminism and giving women a chance.<br/>In a nut-shell, this project work tends to address three (3) key issues-<br/>The influence and iconography of goddess worship and the feminine in ancient Greece.<br/>The nexus between the feminine position in ancient Greece and feminism today and;<br/>The lesson for a matriarchal society.<br/>1.4 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>What this research work tends to achieve is to relate the value and prestige the goddesses possessed in ancient Greece in spite the fact that women of the Age were to a very large extent marginalized and these events spurred the spirit of the present day feminist movement.<br/>The purpose of this work therefore, is to show how the feminist enthusiastof today recognize the intimate connection between the situations of things amongst the women of antiquity and how they have positioned their social tractor towards crushing the patriarchal order that is holding sway and give way to a better society built on gender equality.<br/>Women in no mean words are on a fast-track driving off to eradicate gender inequality in all its forms and ramifications.<br/>1.5 METHODOLOGY<br/>The method employed in this research work is analytical and evaluative. These methods helped in relaying the message behind the goddess worship, the feminine of ancient Greece and feminism today. This makes the work what it is and it features materials ranging from speeches, books, journals and the internet.<br/>The work is exhaustively a Socio-Religious compendium about the sacred feminine with ancient Greece as the case of study and contemporary feminism.<br/>1.6 SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>The scope of this works cut across goddesses and women of ancient Greece, Feminism with an insight into the declarations of the United Nations on women, Feminist Movement in Africa with Nigeria in view, the Goddess Movement and the attempts at reviving goddess worship.<br/>1.7 DIVISION OF WORK<br/>This work is organized into five (5) chapters. It is structured in a way that rightly guides the reader through bit by bit analysis of the concept of the feminine amongst the Ancient Greeks and how it relates to the contemporary Feminist struggle.<br/>This work is as thus organized-<br/>Chapter One Introduces and set the ground for further discussions on the study. It is divided into Seven (7) Sections with Section Two (2) containing Six (6) Sub-Sections.<br/>The First is the Background to the Study. This highlights different themes of the study that includes the Goddess Worship by the Ancient Greeks, Feminism and how it relates to this present day Feminist struggle.<br/>Next is the Clarification of Terms as contained by the Project Work. The clarified terms are Iconography, Goddess, Worship, Ancient Greece, Nexus and Feminism.<br/>It is followed by the Statementof Problemi.e. the problem of the marginalized feminine, worship of Goddesses and the issues surrounding Feminism the work tends to resolve.<br/>Also, the Aims and Objectives of the work is well-spelt out in other to reveal its purpose and significance of the study.<br/>Methodology employed in the course of the Project Work.<br/>Scope of Study and what it encomprises, and finally;<br/>Division of Work.<br/>Chapter Two X-rays the History of Goddess Worship, an overview of ancient Greece, women in ancient Greece and the Socio-Religious iconography.

It can be seen in all aspects of life. Rites of passage defines the different ceremonies that accompany an individual leaving a particular stage of societal existence to a higher one. In some cases, it is accompanied with big ceremonies while in others, little or nothing is done. Rites of passage does not apply only to the living, it also applies to the dead. This can be seen in traditional or modern communities.<br/>Whatever the case, rites of passage remains a very vital aspect of human life.<br/>Rites of passage can be seen in the tradition of a child into adulthood,  marriage, fatherhood or motherhood as the case may be. Advancement to a higher social class the nze title in  Igbo land, and also from life to death.<br/>According to Metuh Ikenga,rites of passage are mostly found in all societies but tend to reach their maximal expression in a small scale, relatively stable and cyclical societies where change is bound up with biological and meteorological rhythms and reoccurrence rather than with technological invitations.<br/>The work is primarily on some rites of passage practiced among the people of Mbosi community before the coming of the colonial masters, who came with their culture and influenced ours to a greater extent.  Nevertheless some fragments of those rites can still be seen, since they could not be entirely over shadowed by western influence.<br/>1.2 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>1.2.1    To investigate the history of Mbosi community, geographical setting, socio-economic and political setting and also religious setting before the coming of westernization.<br/>This work is also aimed at investigating the procedures which goes before and after the birth of a child in Mbosi community his growth into adulthood, and the different group he joins as he climbs the ladder of life. This also includes marriage and the procedure followed when an adult is then ripe for marriage. This work also tends to achieve the objective of studying the different important stages taken to accord a befitting burial to the dead in Mbosi Community.<br/>This work also tends to know the importance of these stages of life in Mbosi community. The rites conducted and the blessing that follows it when done accordingly and the curse or misfortune that follows when what ought to be done is neglected.<br/>1.3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>Phenomenological, historical and critical evaluations are used in this work. Oral sources are mainly used due to the lack of literature materials on the proposed study. The oral sources are interviews had with some elderly men of Mbosi community and also from personal experiences.<br/>1.4 SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>This work will be limited to the Mbosi community in Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra state.<br/>Due to the nature of the study (Rites of Passage), which is universally found among the people of Anambra State, neighbouring communities will be cited in the course of this work for the purpose of comparism and further classifications of the study.<br/>Furthermore, issues that are not directly related to rites of passage will not be discussed, only those issues related as it affects rites of passage in Mbosi Community will be treated in the study.<br/>1.5 CLARIFICATION OF TERMS<br/>These are terms as may be used in the study. Terms like Rites, Passage and Transition will be clarified.<br/>1.5.1 Rites: According to Godwin Egbuchi, he described rites as a form of behaviour with a field pattern used for religious purposes.<br/>The oxford advanced Learner's Dictionary defines Rites as a ceremony performed by a particular group of people often for religious purposes.<br/>1.5.2 Passage:  The Oxford  Advanced Learner's Dictionary defines passage as a long narrow area with walls on either side. But for the purpose of this work, it will be further clarified in the course of the study.<br/>1.5.3 Transition: The Advanced Learner's Dictionary described transition as the process or period of changing from one state or condition to another.<br/>Google search describes transition as movement, passage, or change from one position, state, stage, subject, concept to another.<br/>END NOTES<br/>1) Metuh Ikenga        Comparative studies of African Traditional Religion Imico publishers, onitsha, 1987, pg 197<br/>2) Egbucha Godwin        Religious change in birth, puberty and marriage rites in owerri, imo state.<br/>        Assemblies of God press, Aba,2007,pg 172.<br/>3) Oxford Advanced Learners         7th edition<br/>    Dictionary <br/>4) Oxford Advanced Learners       7th edition<br/>    Dictionary         <br/>5) Oxford Advanced Learners        7th edition<br/>    Dictionary         <br/>6) Google search    Dictionary.reference.com/../transition.<br/><br/></p>\n\nRITES OF PASSAGE IN MBOSI COMMUNITY, IHIALA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF ANAMBRA STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RITES OF PASSAGE IN MBOSI COMMUNITY, IHIALA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF ANAMBRA STATE", "id": 9}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE INTERGROUP RELATIONS IN PRE-COLONIAL, COLONIAL AND POST-COLONIAL EASTERN NIGERIA<br/>CHAPTER ONE.</b><br/>INTRODUCTION.<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY.<br/>      As an area of study, intergroup relations appears to be one of the recent themes in African historiography.1 Intergroup relations has been rationalised by behavioural scientists like M. Sherif and C. W. Sherif, from the social psychology perspective.<br/>      According to one of such insights put forward, intergroup relations has been conceptualised  as;<br/>               \"states of friendship or hospitality, cooperation or competition, <br/>                domination or subordination, alliance or enmity, peace or war<br/>                between two or more groups and their respective members\"2<br/>They both view a group as a social unit consisting of a number of individuals who stand in role and status relationships to one another and who possesses a set of values or norms of their own to regulate their behaviour towards each other in matters affecting them.<br/>      Another theoretical formation on intergroup relations, is that by A. E. Afigbo in his analysis of The Igbos and Their Neighbours. According to him;<br/>               \"intergroup relations presupposes contacts and interaction<br/>                between groups each of which has an identity, to make some<br/>                some impute into the relations, each of which has some scope<br/>               and area of autonomous action\"3<br/>      From the above definition therefore, an important phenomenon of intergroup relations is that it entails contact and interaction between two or more groups. An implication of this is that intergroup relations is the logical consequence of contact between people in which case it deals with human beings and is therefore a social phenomenon. In emphasizing this point, Lohor, (1998) observed that intergroup relations;<br/>                \"...refers to the interactions which takes place between <br/>                members of different groups and societies who come <br/>                in contact with one another. It pertains to the symbolical<br/>                or face-to-face interaction between different societies...\"4<br/>      Therefore, intergroup relations reflect human actions which are also part of the process of existence channeled towards economic, political and social development.<br/>      The Eastern Region was one of Nigeria's federal divisions, dating back originally from the division of the colony of Southern Nigeria in 1954. Its first capital was Calabar and later Enugu, and the second was Umuahia. The dominant ethnic groups in this region (Eastern Nigeria) are the Igbo people; others include Calabar, Ibibio, Efik, Ijaw e.t.c. This region was officially divided in 1967 into three new states; the East-Central State, Rivers State and Southern Eastern States.The region now harbours states like Imo, Enugu, Anambra, Abia e.t.c in present day Nigeria.<br/>      According to A. E. Afigbo,<br/>               \"it is difficult to reconstruct the early history of a pre-literate<br/>                and acephalous people. Those who seek to do so can easily<br/>                fall victim to either wild romanticism or sterile scepticism\"5<br/>      Thus the Igbo people of Eastern Nigeria are widely known for its acephalous system of government that it practised long before colonial imposition. Therefore, before the coming of the Europeans, the people and groups of Eastern Nigeria had co-existed and sufficiently interacted with one another. These interactions occurred in multifarious ways (peacefully and violently)<br/>      This work examines the phenomenon of intergroup relations in pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial Eastern Nigeria using Imo State as a case-study. Historically, the Ibo people of Eastern Nigeria had achieved a high level of integration and administration with high societal values long before colonial European conquest. Their pattern of intergroup relations includes trade, migration, marriages, cultural exchange, festivals and socio-economic relations. Typical examples of intergroup relations in this region (Eastern Nigeria) include Opi and Nike, Ugbawka and Amurri, Awo-Omamma and Amirri, amongst others.<br/>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>      This research work is expected to add to the existing body of knowledge on intergroup relations in Eastern Nigeria. Thus it intends doing this by discussing the patterns and ways by which the people and groups of Eastern Nigeria related with each other in the conduct of their activities. Thus by so doing, this research work aims at enriching existing literature on the subject matter as well as reveal in the process of discussion, the impact of intergroup relations in the region and on its people and groups.<br/>      The objective of this work most notably is to illuminate the fact that the people and groups of Eastern Nigeria had their own culture, administrative system and mode of relating between and amongst themselves long before the advent of colonialism. Its objective is also to explore the effects of colonialism on the groups and peoples of this region through the discussion of colonial intergroup relations in Eastern Nigeria.<br/>      The research work also aims at showing or attesting to the fact that the people and groups of Eastern Nigeria still had their own culture, administrative system and mode of relation between and amongst themselves even after the advent of colonialism. Its objective is also to explore the effects of colonialism on the groups and peoples of this region through the discussion of intergroup relations among the Imo People in Eastern Nigeria.<br/>SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>      The scope of study as regards this research work coves basically intergroup relations in pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial Eastern Nigeria. The pattern of intergroup relations in pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial Eastern Nigeria. The pattern of intergroup relations in this region and during these said periods shall be analysed with particular note to the colonial period upon which the basis of this research work is founded.<br/>METHODOLOGY<br/>      This research work shall be heavily drawn from secondary sources which includes textbooks, journals, articles and also from the internet. The research work also makes use of primary sources which includes oral interviews. However, the methodological approach to this work will be historical and social, thus making this research work both qualitative and quantitative as it will benefit from existing literatures on the subject upon which this research work is largely based.<br/>LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>      The review of existing literature relevant to this research work is very necessary because without their review, this research work cannot be sufficiently considered to be an intellectual or academic piece. Therefore the invaluable materials consulted for this research work include;<br/>      The Igbos and Their Neighbour ; Intergroup Relations in South Eastern Nigeria History. A book by A.E. Afigbo and published in 1980 in Ibadan by Heinemann Education books. This book talked on the Igbo groups and people of Eastern Nigeria, revealing the socio-cultural interactions between them and South Eastern Nigeria. This socio-cultural interaction cuts across a multifarious range of cultural and social activities. A.E. Afigbo in his book also conceptualised the phenomenon known as intergroup relations in which he defines it as presupposing contact and interaction between groups each of which has an individual identity to make some impute into their relations.6<br/>    Egbefo Dawood Omolumen's article, Aspects of Intergroup Relations in 21st Century Nigeria: Emblem of Ethnicity, Religious Fundamentalism and National Security Crisis 2000-2014, published in International Journals of Arts and Humanities (IJAH), Vol.4, No.1 2015. This article made known that intergroup relations as an area of study appear to be one of the recent themes in African historiography. it also went ahead to make some conceptual classifications on the subject of intergroup relations.7<br/>    In their book entitled Social Psychology, published in Oklahoma by Oklahoma university in 1969, Sherif M. and Sherif C.W. Leds talked about intergroup relations from the perspective of social psychology. This book thus broadens one's understanding of intergroup relations beyond the historical perspective thereby adding some sort of flavour to this research work.8<br/>    C.C. Ifemesia in his work The Peoples of West Africa Around 1800 divulged that a wider-layer of similarity in symbols and rituals exist among the West African people. He further contended that diversities result from adaptation to peculiar environment.9 Therefore, it should be noted that peculiarity of culture indicates aspects of cultural conflicts.<br/>AUTHORITIES OF INTEGROUP RELATIONS<br/>    This authority refers to people who have in one way or the other distinguished themselves in history and within the context of intergroup relations as a theme in African historiography. Among these notable personalities include Obaro Ikime, Adiele Eberechukwu Afigbo, Kenneth Dike, etc.<br/>    One very prominent individual in Nigeria and indeed African history is the renowned historian himself Professor Obaro Ikime, he is a relevant authority in intergroup relations especially in South-Eastern Nigerian History. He is a native of Isoko, Delta State and went to Warri College, now Government College Ughelli. His craving or unveiling the deep secrets of human history led him to study Itsekiri-Urhobo relations which bagged him his PhD degree. He taught history at the University of Ibadan from 1964-1990 between which period he served as both head of History Department and Dean of Arts. He was the director of the Institute of African Studies as well as the president of the Historical Society of Nigeria.<br/>    One major work of Obaro Ikime is Groundwork of Nigerian History which he edited. This works talks about every part of pre-colonial Nigeria and how they interrelated between and among themselves. Other works by him include, \"History, the Historian and the Nation\", \"The Fall of Nigeria: the British Conquest\"; Government in pre-colonial Africa, etc.10<br/>    Adiele Eberechukwu Afigbo(Nov. 22, 1937- March 9, 2009) was a Nigerian historian known for the history and historiography of Africa, particularly Igbo history and the history of South Eastern Nigeria. Some of the themes emphasized by him include Pre-Colonial and Colonial History, Inter-group Relations, the Aro and the slave trade, the Art and Science of History in Africa, and Nation-building.<br/>    He was birthed at Ihube, Okigwe, in present day Imo State. His formal education began in 1994 at Methodist Central School, Ihube. He went to St. Augustine's (SMS) Grammar School, Nkwerre, Orlu in present day Imo State with an Okigwe Native Administration Scholarship won in a competitive examination. He studied History at University College, Ibadan(then an affiliate of University of London), with scholarship from the government of Eastern Nigeria. There he encountered notables scholars like J. D. Omer Cooper, J. C. Anene, J. F.Ade Ajayi and K. O. Dike. There were also some of his colleagues like Obaro Ikime and Philip Igbafe who not only read History with him but also went on to become the pioneers of the 'made in Nigeria PhD' at the Infant University of Ibadan. A. E. Afigbo did not only graduate at the top of his class, but also upon graduation became the first person to receive a doctorate degree from a Nigerian university.11<br/>      A.E. Afigbo was a Historian of Africa, Nigeria, South Eastern Nigeria and a historian of the Igbo. He was a political, economic and social historian as well as historian of Historiography. One of his works include; Myth ,History and Society, one of the three volumes of his essays edited by Toyin Falola is devoted to theorising on the sources of History in Africa, on the place and purpose of African history and other related issues.12<br/>      Afigbo broke away from the action-reaction thesis that ruled the new African historiography when he joined the history profession. He did so by emphasizing his works are based on the reconstructionist history, the study of peoples and cultures in their own right.13<br/>      Kenneth Dike was an African historian noted for setting uop the Nigerian National Archives and or serving as roving ambassador for Biafra during Eastern Nigeria's bid for seccession.14<br/>      Born December 17, 1917 in Awka (East Central)Nigeria. He attended Dennis Memorial Grammar School in nearby Onitsha and went on later to Achimota College in Ghana and then Fourah Bay College in Sierra Leone. He received his Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Durham, England, his M.A degree was from the University of Aberdeen, Scotland and he earned his PhD in history from the University of London.15<br/>      As both, historian and leader of the University of Ibadan's post-graduate school in   Nigeria, Dike is said to have \"Nigerianized Nigerian History\"(Michael Crowder). Perhaps Dike's best known book is Trade and Politics in the Niger Delta 1830-1890 (1956). In this work, Dike examined the \"detailed process by which the existing native administration were gradually supplanted by British consular power and the Crown Colony administration\".16<br/>     In 1953, his Report on the Preservation and Administration of Historical Records in Nigerian National Archives which he later served as director. In this same documentation and preservation vein, Dike served for a time and also Chair of the Nigerian Antiquities Commission. Then in 1957 A Hundred Years of British Rule of Nigeria appeared.<br/>      Dike from 1960-1966 was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Ibadan, prior to which he was the director of the Institute of African Studies at Ibadan in addition to being the Director of the National Archives. He resigned as Vice-Chancellor in December 1966 at the beginning of the Nigerian Civil War to become Biafra's roving ambassador. Since he was an Igbo and Easterner, his role as head of university in Western Nigeria was untenable.17 He died in an Enugu hospital in October 26, 1983 at the age of 65.  <br/>CHAPTERIZATION<br/>      This work consists of five chapters, all structured out to give a clear insight and understanding of intergroup relations in Eastern Nigeria during the pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial era.<br/>      Chapter One; Introduction: This introduces us to the subject of intergroup relations as regards definition and conceptualisation.

Since September 7, 2001, it experienced a violent ethno-religious crisis, which broke its innocence as a religiously tolerant state. Since then Jos has lost its acclaim as the “city of peace and tourism”. Today, Jos is being sarcastically referred to by the public observes and commentators as a “city of pieces and terrorism”. <br/>    The objective of this study is to ascertain the role played by religions in the rancor that have belated Jos. <br/>    This study will further elaborate on the roles of ethnicity and the religious, political and socio-economic relationships of Christians and Muslims in the development of the Jos society. <br/>    In addition, this work will also look at the causes of intolerance as it affects the Jos society. <br/>    Finally, attempts would be made to proffer solutions that can eradicate all forms of intolerance in Jos, Plateau state.  <br/>CHAPTERIZATION<br/>CHAPTER ONE: GENERAL INTRODUCTION <br/>Background of the study <br/>Statement of problem <br/>Scope of the study <br/>Aims and objectives of the study <br/>Methodology <br/>Works Cited<br/>CHAPTER TWO: JOS: HISTORY AND RELIGIONS <br/>2.1    History of Jos <br/>2.2    History of Islam in Jos <br/>2.3    History of Christianity in Jos <br/>2.3.1    Roman Catholic Mission <br/>2.3.2    Sudan United Mission <br/>2.3.3    Sudan Interior Mission <br/>2.3.4    Impact of the Christian Missions <br/>    Works Cited <br/>CHAPTER THREE: AN OVERVIEW OF CHRISTIANS – MUSLIMS RELATIONSHIP IN JOS: PAST AND PRESENT <br/>3.1    Introduction <br/>3.2    Christians – Muslims Religious Relationship in Jos <br/>3.3    Christians – Muslims Political Relationship in Jos <br/>3.4    Christians – Muslims Socio-Economic Relationship in Jos  <br/>    Work Cited <br/>CHAPTER FOUR: <br/>4.1    Causes of Intolerance <br/>4.1.1    Religious Causes <br/>4.1.2    Political Causes<br/>4.1.3    Economic Causes<br/>4.1.4    Theological Causes<br/>4.2    Implications of Intolerance in Jos Society. <br/>    Work Cited <br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>5.0    Evaluation, crises management, recommendation, and conclusion <br/>5.1    Evaluation <br/>5.2    Crises Management <br/>5.3    Recommendation <br/>5.4    Conclusion<br/> CHAPTER ONE <br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>    Inter-religious dialogue imply any form of getting together and communication between religious communities or groups in a spirit of sincerity, reverence for persons, and a certain trust, in order to achieve either a greater grasp of truth or a more practicable cordial relationship between the religious communities involved in a given society. Inter- religious dialogue is a concept that seeks a common ground on which diverse traditions can meet in mutual respect and sharing. It is not instead of our traditions, but in addition. It is a way to come to know people of other  traditions and understand their perspective on various issues – to explore one mountain through many paths. <br/>    Inter- religious dialogue is of greater importance and is more difficult when it takes place between people of different and even opposing opinions. They try to dispel each other’s prejudiced opinions and to increase as much as they are able, consensus between themselves. Their objective may be simply interrelationships between men, the search for truth or co-operation in some activity. <br/>    All of these elements are present in every form of dialogue, but since one or other element can predominate, it is possible to distinguish three forms of inter-religious dialogue, seen as attempting to reach: <br/>“An agreement, to be established only in terms of human relationship, destined to liberated those engaged in discussion from their solitude and their mutual distrust, and to induce in true fellow-feeling mutual reverence and esteem. <br/>“An agreement, to be established in the realm of truth involving discussion of problems of the greatest importance to those engaged in dialogue and the achievement by common effort of a better grasp of the truth and an extension of knowledge. <br/>“An agreement to be reached in the realm of action, establishing the conditions under which certain set objectives may be achieved in spite of ideological differences. <br/>    Although it is to be hoped that inter-religious3 would be pursued for all three reasons at once, it remains true that each form retains its own power of establishing interpersonal relationship. Every form of inter-religious dialogue, in so far as the participants are involved in mutual give and take, involves certain reciprocity. In this it differs from teaching, which enriches the pupil – participant to dialogue. However, inter-religious dialogue can be called a true form of teaching, since it is able to provide the benefit of doctrine for very many men. Inter-religious dialogue is also, implicitly, a proclamation of one’s belief. <br/>    Furthermore, inter-religious dialogue may be considered a challenge to one’s faith but one cannot run away from such a challenge. Through this challenge we may find that our faith can grow. Inter-religious dialogue an here understood differs from contention and controversy, in which each participant aim to defend his own side and prove that the other side is error. <br/>    Finally, inter-religious dialogue is not the same as confronting one’s religious belief. For its objective is that one side should come closer to the other side and should understand it better. While each group to dialogue may legitimately hope to persuade the other that he is right, the fact remains that this is not the purpose of inter-religious dialogue, but rather mutual enrichment. <br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>    Plateau state is currently the main site of ethnic and religious violence in northern Nigeria. The past decade has been recurrent crises across the state, in urban and rural areas. Thousands of lives have been lost in these violent conflicts, there has been extensive damage to property and the development prospects to the state have been setback. The violence has mainly been along religious lines, especially between Christians and Muslims. One should also understand that ethnicity has also a central role in the conflicts and there are considerable political interests at stake. <br/>    Jos, the state capital of Plateau and a major northern city with a population of about one million inhabitants, is the epicenter of much of the insecurity in Plateau state and has been the site of some of the worst of the violence. Episodes of mass killing and destruction have occurred in Jos over the years which have also affected other parts of high Plateau, in rural areas outside of Jos particularly in 2001, 2002 and 2010. In rural areas there has also been widespread violence between Barroom farmer (who are predominantly Christians) and the Fulani pastoralist (who are Muslims). This is generally framed to be conflict over land, but the contrary to media reports, many of those involved tend not to think the fight is about a struggle for grazing land or farm but rather on religious ties. Much of the conflicts are also political oriented. The violence in Jos began after two decades of increasing Nigeria, the worst of which occurred in Kano, Kaduna and Bauchi states. Jos was relatively peaceful during this period 1980-2000. In fact the first episode of mass killing or violence in Jos, since the anti-Igbo pogroms in 1966 occurred in 2001 according to Danfulani and Fwatshak, 2002, Higazi 2007. <br/>    This project explores mainly the relationship between Christians and Muslims in Jos and the implications of the relationship to the Jos society. <br/>1.3    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>    This project work would be limited to only two religious beliefs in Jos, Plateau state, which are basically Islam and Christianity and their relationship as it affects the Jos society. It would also focus on the causes of religious intolerance using the Jos society in Plateau state, Nigeria as a case study. <br/>    This study will not address issues that are directly not related to religious, but will focus on those issues that religious intolerance affects directly or indirectly in Jos. Issues to be treated will basically focus on Jos society, Plateau state. <br/>1.4    AIMS AND OBJECTIVES <br/>    The aim of this work is toe address the pertinent issues of religious intolerance in Jos, Plateau state. This work will intend firstly is discuss briefly on the historical background of Jos and its original people. <br/>    Secondly, discuss the history of the religions in Jos taking into cognizance Islam and Christianity and their impact on the Jos society. <br/>    Thirdly, make a brief historical survey of the Christians – Muslims relationship in Jos; past and present and its implications. <br/>    Fourthly, to reflect briefly on the basic factors that generates religious instability in Jos and the implications of these factors. <br/>    Finally, after a balanced evaluation make some positive recommendations for a solution to the perennial problems of intolerance in the multi-religious and multi-cultural Jos society. <br/>1.5    METHODOLOGY<br/>    The method to be used in this study will be both phenomenological, expository and critical analysis.<br/>    This method would be best understood in view of the fact that it would enable an individual to critically and objectively give a clear analysis of the Jos situation without a bias thought. <br/>    Furthermore, it will provide an ample opportunity for the society to see the need for religious pluralism, when historical method used also in this work are critically and objectively considered. <br/><br/>\n\nINTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE: CHRISTIAN MUSLIM RELATIONSHIP IN JOS AS A CASE STUDY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE: CHRISTIAN MUSLIM RELATIONSHIP IN JOS AS A CASE STUDY", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE ADVENT OF CHRISTIANITY IN IGBODO COMMUNITY IN DELTA STATE, ITS EFFECT AND SOCIAL IMPACT<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>    This work is on the advent of Christianity in Igbodo community in Delta state, its effect and social impact.

The introduction of Christianity to a society where communal  living has had its root engulfed in traditional beliefs, now having Christians at the fore front of their fundamental beliefs raise a lot of questions. <br/>    It has become so widely proclaimed that it has now become a part of the community that one would think it has been in existence over many centuries. <br/>    The proclamation of the gospel and the proliferation of churches having suppressed the traditional activities of the adherents, who had lost their sense of humanity, gave them a new view and perception. <br/>    The positive impact and the positive value to a community ravaged with poverty and illiteracy. <br/>    The obvious clash of ideologies and culture craving its way in the hearts and minds of the Igbodo people brings about a mutual suspicion on both sides, as presented seemingly justifiable as the people live amongst them are identifiable and visibly real. <br/>    The God being introduced seem not to be empirical or having any physical form nor visible to the human eyes here in lies in defining position that justified the suspicion of resentment and resistance of the Igbodo people. In their thinking and culture, reality must be visible and verifiable.2<br/>1.3    SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>    This research is mainly centered on Igbodo community in Ika Local Government Area.<br/>    The research will give an explicit and intrinsic report on the advent of Christianity in Igbodo society.<br/>    The details given in this work will be based on observation,-research findings. It will also give an appraisal on the lasting effect of Christianity. <br/>1.4    CLARIFICATION OF TERMS <br/>    For the convenient purpose of this study there would be a need to clarify some terms.  <br/>Christianity<br/>The Webster’s Universal Dictionary defines Christianity to be a religion based on the teaching of Christ.3<br/>Effect<br/>The Oxford Dictionary defines effect to be a change produced by an action or cause; impression; state of being operative. <br/>Social impact<br/>The concept social impact means, to have a strong effect on a society or community, it could be positive or negative.4<br/>1.5    AIMS AND OBJECTIVE<br/>    The aims and objective of the research are as follows. <br/>To have a knowledge of the arrival of Christian missionaries and advent of Christianity in Igbodo society. <br/>To examine the impact and effect on the community. <br/>To understanding the role played by the missionaries and individuals of community. <br/>1.6    METHODOLOGY<br/>    The methodological approach of this project is historical and observational. <br/>    The method of approach is a collection of data majorly based on oral interview through personal meetings and communication. <br/>    This thesis emerges out of rigorous investigation and interviews of individuals within several age differences in various fields of life. <br/>    As the research progressed, relevant text pertaining to the subject matter, on interpretations of terms and concept were also consulted and more findings made. <br/>    The bottom linelays in the fact that oral interview which has been well scrutinized and subjected to verification forms and makes up the totality of this project.<br/>1.7    PLAN AND CHAPTERS<br/>    This research consists of five chapters to ensure for a better comprehension and assimilation. Chapter one gives a general introduction of the projecttitle which includes statement of problem, clarification of terms, aims and objective, methodology, plan and chapters, literature review.Chapter two consists on the historical background of the Igbodo community and the arrival of the Christian missionaries. <br/>    Chapterthree consists of the social impact and the effect they had on the Igbodo people. <br/>    Chapter four deals with the culture clashes, reactions of the Igbodo people, experiences of the natives<br/>    Chapter five is the evaluation of the work, recommendation, to the positive and negative effect the influence of Christianity has had on the Igbodo people and also a general conclusion. <br/>1.8    LITERATURE REVIEW <br/>    Although this research is majorly based on oral interviews and observations, it is not without exception to the consultation of some texts to ensure detailed information.<br/>    G.I.C. Eluwa in his book, a history of Nigeria traced the arrival of missionaries to Portugal and in West Africa, subsequently Warri.Similar text like Africa and the wider world since 1800 A.D. by Eluwa, A.D. Nzemeke and E.O. Erhagbe in Nigerians people and culture, gave a similar explanation. National Open University, Christianity in Nigeria sharing the same view. Eqwabor Iduwe”. History of the Ika people, also talked about the geographical location of Ika their beliefs and life practice was also used for research as Igbodo is a part of Ika. E. Bolaji Idowu in his book African traditional religions helped understand the application of some terms in this work within the African context. <br/>    Nigerian studies in religious tolerance by Dr. C.S. Momoh volume 1 in one of the chapter 29 page 360,  trace the advent of Christianity to the Niger expedition, the tolerance of the Africans against the influence of foreign religion.<br/>    Essays in History and Religions by Adebayo Adeogun also traced the Arrival of missionaries from Europe to Benin and Warri   and the structure of religion to natives and their perception. <br/>    Gbolade Aderibigbe also traced the arrival of missionaries similar to Adebayo Adeogun.

Ayer posited it. Ayer had said that the meaning of a statement is the method of its verification. <br/>    The study starts by researching into the Biography of Ayer and thus uncovering the factors that shaped Ayer. Understanding the factors that shaped the life of Ayer will help us to know how and why Ayer propounded the theory of verification. The period in which Ayer lived is the contemporary period, so a review of contemporary philosophy is undertaken by his researcher. <br/>    In chapter four, the principle of verification principle is thoroughly examined. This writer argued that verification principle has implication for metaphysics, ethics, religion and epistemology. <br/>    The method used in this research is the Historical, synthetic and critical method. The study looks at the history of verification in philosophy and critically addressed its shortcoming. The research will consult books, and journals in this study. <br/>    The study concludes by criticizing the theory of verification in philosophy.  <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT <br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION <br/>Background of the study                <br/>Statement of the Problem                     <br/>Significance of the Study                 <br/>Scope of the Study                    <br/>Methodology                         <br/>1.6    Literature Review                     <br/>Endnotes                         <br/>CHAPTER TWO: LIFE AND TIMES OF ALFRED JULES <br/>            AYER<br/>2.1    Parental Background                     <br/>2.2    Educational Background             <br/>2.3    Professional Life.                     <br/>2.4    Influences in the Philosophy of A.J.

By contemporary is meant the present time. This period in the history of philosophy started with pragmatic movement in philosophy.<br/>    Contemporary philosophy does not represent one particular philosophical idea. There are various strands of the thoughts in this period, among them are pragmatism, essentialism, process metaphysic, and analytic philosophy. <br/>    Analytic philosophy holds that the purpose of philosophy is not to postulate doctrines but to clarifies, analyse words that we use in describing the world. Analytic philosophy has undergone many stages. One of such stages is logical positivism. Logical positivism is based on the principle that holds that for us to have a criterion of meaningfulness, a statement is either analytic or synthetic. <br/>    Analytic statement are statements that are necessarily true. It is true because of the meaning of its term, such statement does not increase our knowledge, so it is a tautology. <br/>    On the other hand, synthetic statement is a statement that is either true or false. In order for it to be meaningful, it must be capable of being verified. It is this scenario that A.J. Ayer wrote his book language, Truth and logic. In the book, Ayer insisted that the meaning of a statement is the method of its verification. <br/>1.2    Statement Of The Problem <br/>    According to A.J. Ayer, the meaning of a statement is the method of its verification. This theory is problematic on many grounds. If the criterion of meaning is verification, what about statements that cannot be empirically verified? Is it tenable to say that metaphysical statement, religious statement and ethical statement are meaningless because they are not subject to empirical verification?<br/>1.3    Significance of the Study<br/>    This study is important because it will show that the approach of A.J. Ayer to meaning is very parochial and ill-founded. So the study will prevent other philosopher from the pitfall of A.J. Ayer. <br/>1.4    The Scope of the Study<br/>    This study focuses on the principle of verification as A.J Ayer posited it. Ayer had said that the meaning of a statement is the method of its verification. <br/>    The study will research into the life of A.J. Ayer in order to uncover the factor that shaped the philosopher of A.J. Ayer. <br/>    The verification principle will be studied in its length and breadth. Finally the study will criticize the principle of verification. <br/>1.5    Methodology <br/>    The method used in this research is the historical synthetic and critical method. The study looks at the history of verification in philosophy and critically addressed its shortcomings. The research will used books and journals. <br/>1.6    Literature Review <br/>    In this study the researcher finds many books useful to the research. These books are reviewed below: <br/>    In Lacey’s Dictionary of Philosophy there are many articles that discuss verification principles. “Analytical propositions are true without any sort of empirical investigation at all. So for the logical positivists, analytic proposition are “trivial”. They do not tell us anything about the world”1. <br/>    In a very useful book, A modern introduction to philosophy, the verification principle is analysed. The various objections to the principle are presented. Ayer attempted a response to these objections. This book will be invaluable in this research2. <br/>    Joseph Omorogbe in his book: Ethics: A systematic and Historical Study, made an application of Ayer theory of verification to ethics. For A.J. Ayer, since ethical statements cannot be verified through sensory observation, they are meaningless. Ethical statement are non-cognitive3. <br/>    In the book titled Philosophy, popkin made clear how verification principle attacked traditional philosophy. He went further to state that there is a distinction between a statement, that are verified and statement that are verifiable4. <br/>    In a philosophical look at Religion, Omoregbe discuss in chapter six, the verification principle of Ayer as it relates to religion and metaphysics the logical positivist, writes Omorogbe, took verifiability as the criterion of meaningfulness. The principle states Any proposition that is verifiable is meaningful whereas any proposition that is unverifiable is meaningless. It was this principle that the logical positivists, among whom is Ayer, used to write off religious and metaphysical statement as meaningless5. <br/>    In metaphysics without tears: A systematic and Historical study Omorogbe analysed how Ayer contributed to the criticism of metaphysics. He wrote that originally Ayer was not a member of the Vienna circle. But he read their work and introduced logical positivism to the English speaking world with the publication of his very polemical little book, language, truth and logic6.<br/> Iroegbe, in metaphysics: the kpim of philosophy discussed Ayer under five sub-headings. He noted first that logical positivism was the background of Ayer philosophy. For the logical positivist, Iroegbu says, philosophy is not a theory but an activity. Its role is to clarify the meaning of proposition. <br/>    Secondly, Iroegbu observes that verifiability criterion leaves us with very clear rule of testing cognitively significant proposition. The verification principle itself, could be said to be strong or weak. <br/>    Thirdly, Iroegbu continues, when verifiability criterion is applied to metaphysical proposition, the result will either be that, the statements are trivially analytic or outright nonsensical. <br/>    Fourthly, the problem that Ayer found with metaphysical statement is what he calls ontological fallacy. This for Ayer means the use of grammar in such a manner that logical statements are taken as existential or ontological. So metaphysics is mistaken in that it ascribes existence to imaginary objects that cannot be instantiated. For example when metaphysician says unicorns are fictitious, there is an error of ontology because unicorn does not really exist. Furthermore, Ayer says that the statements: God is perfect being is fallacious. The reasoning of Ayer here is that God cannot be verified. So how then do we apply perfection to him. After all, kant had said earlier that perfection is not a predicate. <br/>    Finally, Ayer dismissed metaphysics as nonsense. Ayer, says Iroegbu, assigns new role to philosophy. The proper function of philosophy is not to postulate doctrine or proposition. Its role is critical. By critical, Ayer, is saying that the role of philosophy is clarification, analysis and explanation of proposition that are made about reality. Philosophy is there to explain the meaning of statement and terms that are used by scientist which are unclear. Iroegbu concluded his writing on Ayer by criticizing verification principle7. <br/>Another important book that will be used in this research is Socrates to Sartre and Beyond: A History of Philosophy. This book was authored by Samuel Enoch Stumpf  and James Fieser. Chapter seventeen of this book addressed analytic philosophy. Within the chapter, Ayer Verification principle is discussed. According to this work, verification principle was motivated by David Hume’s empirical tradition that involved strict criteria of meaning as contained in Hume’s Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. <br/>Another personality that motivated the verification principle is Auguste Comte. These personalities were disposed to reject metaphysics as outdated by science. <br/>    The book Language, Truth and Logic was written by Alfred Jules Ayer. The book will be used in this research. In the book Ayer define the principles of verification. The book dismisses metaphysics, religious language, and ethics as meaningless. The reason here for Ayer is that, for a statement to be meaningful, it must either be analytic or synthetic. <br/>    Ethical statement like “killing is bad” merely expresses an emotion. It cannot be verified. So it has no meaning for Ayer. <br/>    When metaphysician says God exist, they are committing ontological fallacy because they are using grammar in such a way that logical statement are treated as existential or ontological. So metaphysics is nonsense!8<br/>    In voyage of Discovery: A Historical Introduction to Philosophy, W.F. Lawhead discussed verifiability principle. This principle was developed, Lawhead  says, as a tool used by logical positivists to determine cognitively meaningful statement. <br/>    The book define  verifiability principle thus: a factual statement is meaningful if it can be verified in experience. <br/>    The book surveys how the logical positivists modified this statement from time to time. The modification was warranted by the obvious pitfall in the theory. <br/>    Furthermore the book shows how the verifiability principle affected metaphysics, ethics, and religious statement. To make a statement about God for example is meaningless because God cannot be verified empirically. There is nothing that correspond to the idea of God in our experience. In ethics, the theory of Ayer came to be known as emotivism. This is the theory that says that ethical statements merely expresses emotions. Verification principle therefore is not about truth but about meaning9. <br/>    The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy by Simon Blackburn is an important book that will be used extensively in this research. The book contains articles on the different aspect of Ayer verifications. It has article on Ayer biography in which the book summarizes Ayer’s life from birth to death. It also features article on verification principle and logical positivism. This book will be used in this research10. <br/>    Another useful book in this research is philosophy History and problems by Samuel Enoch Stumpf. In chapter twenty-four of the book, analytic philosophy is explained. The dominant movement of philosophical activity in the contemporary English speaking world is known as analytic philosophy. <br/>    According to Stumpf the central issue in analytic philosophy is what they teach about the role of philosophy. For them the role of philosophy is to explain and not to postulate doctrine. So in that way the goal of philosophy is meaning and not truth. <br/>    The scientist have already found out everything there is about reality and the world. There is nothing left for philosopher to uncover. But the scientist used ambiguous and misleading expressions. It is the work of philosophers to make clear these ambiguous statements by the scientist. So it was assumed that rigorous linguistic analysis could prevent the use or abuse of language in manner that would cause us, as A.J. Ayer said, to draw false inference or ask spurious questions, or make nonsensical assumptions’. <br/>    The worry of Ayer is that we use proposition about nation as though nations were persons and we use the word Is in relation to things whose existence we could not possibly want to infer. <br/>    Stumpf continued to analyse how the principle of verification was divided into direct verification and indirect verification. This was with specific reference to Rudolph Carnap contribution to verification. As verification principle was criticized. Carnap decided to shift his ground from verification to confirmation, why did Carnap shift ground? Stumpf answered as follows “Carnap agreed that if verification is taken to mean a complete and definitive establishment of truth the laws of science could never be verified. The number of instances to which the laws, say of biology or physics apply is infinite. And if strict verification is required personal observation of every instance then obviously there could not be verification as so defined”11.<br/>Endnotes<br/>A.R.

According to Merriam – Webster Dictionary, Humanism is defined as: “a doctrine, attitude or ways of life centered on human interests or values, a philosophy that usually rejects supernationalism and stress an individuals dignity and worth and capacity for self – realization through reason I. <br/>    Oxford Advance leaner dictionary also defines humanism as, “a rationalist outlook or system of thought attaching prime importance to human rather than divine or supernatural matters”.2 <br/>    However, the term is used with reference to a system of education and mode of inquiry that developed in Northern Italy during the 13th and 14th century and later spread through continental Europe and England alternatively known  as Renaissance humanism. <br/>Humanism sought to emphasize on the value and dignity of people. This work  is base to investigate into the humanism some philosophers such as Frantz Fanon and extract inhumanism from his theory of humanism. <br/>Nevertheless, this work will crystallize the work of Frantz Fanon during his quest for decolonization in Algeria where he explores the role of violence as the perfect revolutionary weapon in which the colonise man can liberate himself from the shackle of colonialism in Fanon’s work “the wretched of the earth” he argues the colonized world is “a world divided into compartments, divided into two to cater for two different species”3<br/>One would argue that this special divide which seeks to establish boundaries were set up in which the “colonized was localized and positioned and essentially made to perform the role of a foreigner, in his or her own country.4<br/>Fanon is f a view that a compartmentalized colonial city perpetuates itself even after a successful independence. He was able to understand the pain of the colonized because of his experience as a psychologist, he understood and pointed out all forms of oppression, that the Negro undergoes and draw their justification from a simply biblical source that allows them to rationalized the lack of humanity in whomever is being oppressed thus, in chapter six of Fanon’s book “Black Skin White Mask” he presents brief deep psycho analysis of colonized black people and proposes the inability to black people to fit into the norms (social, cultural racial) established by white society and that “a normal Negro child having grown up in a normal Negro family will become abnormal on the slightest contact of the white world”.5 <br/>Such an extreme psychological responses originate from the unconscious and unnational training of black people from early childhood to associate “blackness” with “wrongness” while “whiteness” is considered to be “virtue” and for Negro to liberate himself from this inferiority complexes, it requires violence which Fanon poised as the perfect revolutionary weapon to escape from colonialism. <br/>1.2        STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS<br/>    Various violent activities against humanity has been projected under the canopy of humanism and such dehumanizing actions are attack on the values and dignity of human. <br/>    Thus Frantz Fanon in his work “’The Wretched of the Earth” starts out with a dialectical analysis of violence. His primary concern is the decolonization, he understands colonization to be the substitution of one species of man kind of another which he also referred to as racism Fanon referenced a work by Aime Cesaere which compares lyching in America, world wide discrimination against Jews and the legalization of forced labour in Africa to  the action of Adolf Hitler to prove his point that oppression is a universal concept that does not vary its intensity whatsoever. He also contends that particular segment of a society are not more or less responsible for racism when he paraphrases Francis Jeanson’s statement that: “every citizen of a nation is responsible for the actions committed in the name of that nation”.6<br/>    Fanon also argued that France is a racist country which was revealed in their modus operandi in Africa where they made black to feel inferior and see themselves as been superior. Inferiority complexes usually occurs within a fraction of a minority population and that majority population seldom experience such complexes. But in Africa such was not the case, the white minority made themselves superior over the majority black. Fanon reminds us in his work, “in martinque, there are 200 whites who consider themselves superior to 300,000 people of colour, in South Africa there are two million white against almost thirteen million native people and it have never occurred to a single black to consider himself superior to a number of the white minority”.7<br/>    Fanon insists that there is a correlation between the feelings of inferiority experienced by people of colour and the feelings of superiority espoused by whites that in fact, “it is the racist who creates his inferior”.8<br/>    Here, the oppressed individual must either develop feelings of inferiority or remain dependent on the colonizers with all his oppression suffered by the black man. Fanon dream was to rid off this inferiority complex not by remaining in the place of dependent but by becoming aware of the source of his subconscious conflict and choosing action against its structure or else remaining passive. <br/>    However, Fanon suggested violence as the ultimate weapon for decolonization and for the colonized to liberate himself from the shackles of racism, but violence goes against the value and dignity of human and should not be projected under humanism. <br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>    This work will analyse the condition of the colonial reality and also critically analyse an overwhelming numbers of issues drawing from racial formation, identity, decolonization, liberation struggles, language nationalism and violence and also the various ways in which it shapes and alters the relationship between the colonizers and the colonized. <br/>Thus, crystalising Frantz Fanon theory of violence which was his fundamental premise in the quest for decolonization in Africa. Juxtaposing it with the universal theory of humanism and debunking this theory as dehumanizing as it affect humanity.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>    Humanism is a system of thought attaching fundamental importance on human rather than other supernatural matters. It is problematic to narratively describe humanity as purity of thought and rationality as thinking according to absolute rules of inference and then “locate human existence exclusively with in Europe”.9<br/>This however runs a “risk of confining and condemning non-Europeans to irrationality or cognitive underdevelopment”.10         <br/>    This therefore is a rethinking of humanity in a critical way. Critical humanism entails the rethinking of the problematic of being or existence outside the confines of metaphysics of presenting in the globe. Reflecting on Fanon, it is believe that “each generation must out of relative obscurity discover its mission, fulfill it or betray it”.11 As a generation of a disbanded revolution in our underdeveloped countries, this work emphasize the need to continuously question, challenge and resist the neo-liberal technocrat thinking and the legacy of colonialism and also help on the “maturing of the struggle of our lifetime”.12<br/>1.5    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>    The scope of this study is limited to the critical analysis of Frantz Fanon humanism theory, it will also covers Frantz Fanon’s life, works influences and his philosophical belief. <br/>1.6    METHDOLOGY<br/>    The method adopted in the study is a critical analysis of Frantz Fanon humanism. Critical analysis here means to “breakdown” Frantz Fanon’s humanism and properly examine his theory of violence carefully and extract those actions which are dehumanizing toward humanity in general. <br/>    To start first, chapter one centers on the general introduction, where we will be looking at the background of the study, the statement of problems, purpose of the study, significance of study, scope of the study, methodology, definition of concepts and lastly the literature review. <br/>    The chapter two centers on the background of the theory of humanism, nevertheless we will be looking at the origin of humanism, nature of humanism, types of humanism, humanist beliefs and tradition, humanist philosophers and their manifestos and lastly other philosophers view on humanism. <br/>1.7    DEFINITION OF CONCEPTS<br/>    At this point some words that will be used regularly needs clarification so that there would be no confusion of meaning as the words might have other meaning elsewhere, but in this study, we would tie them to one meaning in respect of this study. <br/>    We have words like violence, Negro, state, black, white inferiority complex and chauvinism. <br/>1.7.1    Violence: According to Oxford Advance Learner’s Dictionary 8th edition, violence is define as “a behavior involving physical force intended to hurt, damage or kill someone or something”.13<br/>    This could also mean the unlawful exercise of physical force or introduction by the exhibition of such force. An example of his concept can be pointed to in Fanon’s work “the wretched of the earth” in the first chapter where he analyse anti-colonial violence, for him it was an act of rebirth “the veritable creation of new man”14 Fanon also use the concept of violence also in the first chapter of this same book, where he articulates violence, “violence is a cleansing force it frees the native from his inferiority complex and from his despair and inaction, it makes him fearless and restores himself respect”.15<br/>1.7.2    Negro: According to Merriam – Webster Dictionary Negro Means, “a member of a race of  human kind native of Africa and classified according to physical features as dark skin pigmentation”.16<br/>Also, Oxford Advance Learner’s Dictionary defines it as “a member of a dark skinned group of people originally native to Africa South of the Sahara”.<br/>    The word Negro was adopted from the mid 16th century from Spanish and Portuguese. It remain the standard term throughout the 17th – 19th centuries and was used by prominent black American campaigner such as W.EB Dubois and Booker T. Washington in the early 20th century. <br/>    An example of this concept can be crystallize in Fanon’s work “Black Skin White Masks” the first chapter where he pointed out that, “the negro will become whiter – become more human as he masters the white man’s language”.17<br/>1.7.3    State: According to Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, it is refers to a, “a nation or territory considered as an organized political community under one government”.18<br/>1.7.4    Black: Black in this context refers to the man of black skin i.e. the African man of colour. An example of this concept can be crystallize in the first chapter of Fanon’s work “Black skin white masks” where he affirms that, “the black man is a reaction and since the Negro is appraised in term of the extent of his assimilation, it is also understandable why the newcomer expresses himself only in French. <br/>1.7.5     White: White in this context refers to the Europeans with white skin i.e. the non-African man. An example this in this context can  be crystallize in the first chapter 7 Fanon’s work ‘Black skin white masks” where he affirms that, “A white man addressing a Negro behaves exactly like an adult with a child and start smirking, whispering, patronizing, cozening.20<br/>1.7.6    Inferiority Complex: According to Oxford Advanced Leaner’s Dictionary. It is refer to an unrealistic feeling of general inadequacy caused by actual or supposed inferiority in one sphere, sometimes marked by aggressive behavior in compensation. This term can also be pointed out in the chapter four of Fanon’s work “Black skin, white masks” where he described the lack of subjectivity displayed by Mannon, which he believed is responsible for the scholar assumption that, “the inferiority complex is something that antedole colonization or put more simply that inferiority complexes are someone inherent to priorities uncivilized people.21<br/>1.8    LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>    Lewis R. Gordon in his “Essay on philosophy and human science, managers to revive the importance of Fanon’s existential phenomenology which many critics of both Marxist and post-structralist persuasion had come to see as an embarrassment. It also represents an extension of Gordon’s earlier work which revived the Sartrean concept of “bad faith” as a way to talk about anti-black racism. But it also goes further placing fanon alongside Hisser’s description of the crisis of the human sciences in Europe. In his final chapter “Fanon’s continued relevance” Gordon has advanced a convincing argument that Fanon relentless attack on the murderous nature of European humanism should be read as an attempt not to dispose of humanism perse, but rather to bring into existence a new humanism, Gordon argues earlier in his book that “man needs to emerge out of the ashes of the fact of his desiccation”.21 and concludes that, “this does not mean that the project of constructing or engaging in human science must also be abandoned instead in the spirit of Fanon’s call for radicality and originally, the challenge becomes one of radical engagement and attuned relevance”.22<br/>    Ato Sekyi – Out’s ‘Fanon’s Dialectic of experience” also breaks new group by reading Fanon’s text “as though they formed one dramatic dialectical narratives whose principal subject is political experience”.23<br/>    His deployment of this dialectical analysis leads to reading which must strike even those familiar with Fanon’s work as remarkably fresh and exciting. As Sekyi – Out suggest in his conclusion a careful reading of Fanon’s dramatic personae” brings us the realization that his texts “reveals themselves to us not as faithful reports, still less as self enclosed proposition stamped in each and every occasion with author’s descrete assent and unmistakable imprimatur rather, they are grasped now as enactments of positions assumed stances, staged, claims advanced by typical character in a story of experience .. always as products of the dialectical movement by which the enacted extent or figure is compelled to disclose its incompleteness that fatal short coming of its moral  consequence and there by made its yield to a vision of suppressed or transgressive possibilities”24. <br/>    It is with noting a few of Sekyi-Out’s most significant re-readings of Fanon, motivated by his explicitly gramscian approach (at one point) he declares that he is “tempted to call Gramsci a precious Fanonian”.25 <br/>    His brilliant reconsideration of “concerning violence” which as Gordon has pointed out is often cited as a way  to reduce Fanon fro a complex thinker to a “simplistic pinpoint of violence”.26 <br/>He reveals the part this chapter plays in Fanon’s larger argument that the Manichaeism of the colonial situation leaves the colonized in a state, where there is no public political sphere and no mediation possible between the rulers and he ruled. In Gramscian terms, a state of pure violence rather than of hegemony fanon is thus suggesting, “with the most classical of political philosophers (Sekyi-Out cites Aristotle as well as Aundt) that where there is no public space, there is no political relationship, only violence, violence in a state of nature”.27<br/>Equally suggestive is Sekyi – Out’s interpretation of fanon’s withering attack upon the post colonial natural bourgeoisie. He recognizes fanon’s position that this bourgeoisie condemns itself to become “a figure of baleful inconsequence” in the post independence era. But reading dialectically, he goes on to argue that the very fact that Fanon fails to provide any other candidate for the critical leadership roles in post-colonial society, stopping to make a persuasive case that fanon is not in fact ready to claim that the peasantry are the most promising revolutionary agents, as most readings of the wretched of the earth” have suggested actually reveals fanon to be, “a retrievalist open to the possibility of a redeeming role for members of the national bourgeoisie”.28<br/>Stuart Hall in his essay “the After-Life of Frantz Fanon: Why Fanon? Why now? Why black skin white masks? Which among other things attempt to put to rest. What hall referred to as the “finding fanon” conference as the easy and unproductive early or late, young or old, bourgeoisie or revolutionary binary found in so much fanon scholarship insisting that an honest appraisal of his work presents us with, “a radically incomplete fanon … who is bound to unsettle us from whichever direction we read him?.29<br/>    Equally significant is Bell Hook’s contribution in Feminism as a persistent critique of history: What’s love got to do with it? Which takes seriously Fanon’s declaration in  “Black Skin White Mask’s that ‘today I believe in the possibility of love, that is why I endeavour to trace its imperfecton’30<br/>    It offered a searing but ultimately loving critique of fanon for his homopholia and for the “symbolic matricide’ he commits in “the wretched of the earth”. <br/>    Charles Taylor in his article “the politics of recognition tries to make a case for Fanon as  prophet of the sort of multiculturalism which maintains that “recognition forges identity and thus the ultimate solution lies in reform of curricular allowing for the inclusion of women, minorities etc”31<br/>But to reduce Fanon’s work to a more request for recognition is to ignore the fact that when Fanon writes about life and death struggle of master and slave, it is real life and real death that are at stake when he protest against the social construction of blackness against racism “Epidermal Schema “. It is with understanding that such construction have the power to kill or at least to sentence certain numbers of society to death. The emphasis on the violent struggles for freedom, the recognition as Gordon put it that, “one cannot give another his freedom, only his liberty”.32<br/>    The statement is central to Fanon’s legacy. The kind of cultural and political works that will continue to be inspired by him needs to maintain this sense of urgency. This brings one to another concern, one which is the flipside of the first that Fanon’s legacy will be reduced to an incitement to violence under all circumstances. <br/>    In Julian J. Samuel review of “the fact of blackness” he suggests that the text has nothing to offer those who wish for a new interpretation of Fanon’s work because it ignores the question of violence while agreeing with Samuel’s point that, “it is impossible to discuss Fanon without discussing the many violence laden Algerians today” I am not at all certain that Fanon’s central message is violence is the only thing the master listen to nothingelse”33<br/>    This is one place where Sekyi – Out’s Gramscian reading is particularly useful. If Fanon’s “concerning violence” addresses a situation where no civil or political sphere exists, where no war of position is possible then indeed violence is the only response. But such a model is hardly transferable to every political situation. For one thing to use Samuel’s term “The master” are not always the same sets of people. If the reality of too many post-colonial nations has been exactly the same as colonialism. It is worth nothing that the remainder of “the wretched of the earth” is as concerned whit the battle that needs to be fought against the emergent national bourgeoisie as it is with the anti-colonial struggle perse. “concerning violence” in other word is meaningless except when read together with “spontaneity” its strength and weakness and “the misadventures of national consciousness”.<br/> End Notes<br/>Merriam – Webster Dictionary 11th Edition (Merriam – Webster Inc. 2003).<br/>Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary (Oxford University Press 2010, 8th Edition of Turnbull and Joanna.<br/>Frantz Fanon and Wretched of the  Earth (Grove Weidenfield, 1961), p.30. <br/>Ibid., p. 187. <br/>Frantz Fanon, Black Skin, White Mask (New York Grove Press, 1967), p.145. <br/>Ibid., p.91. <br/>Ibid., p.92 - 93.<br/>Ibid., p.93.<br/>Marina Paola, Banchetti – Robino Headly, Shifting the Geography of Reason, Gender, Science and Religion (Cambridge Scholar Publisher 2006), p.7<br/>Ibid., p.8.<br/>Fanon (1961) op.cit. p.205. <br/>Ibid., p.205.  <br/>Ibid,.<br/>Fanon (1961) Op. cit, p.36. <br/>Ibid., p.94.<br/>Ibid,.<br/>Fanon (1967), p.18. <br/>Ibid,. <br/>Ibid., p.36.<br/>Ibid., p.31.<br/>Ibid., p.85.<br/>Lewis R.

Joseph Omoregbe, in his book A philosophical look at Religion has defined philosophy of religion as “free, unprejudiced rational inquiry into the nature, meaning and purpose of religion or is a defense of religion, but and unprejudiced investigation into the nature, meaning and purpose of religion and the truth value of religious tenets. The truth value of religion has to do with the truth or falsity of the religion. It lets us know whether religion is worth practicing. The question of truth value has to do with whether to engage in a religious activity is worthwhile. Truth value the way we understand it is what makes a theory or a religious system reasonable to believe. If the truth of a religious system is verified and confirmed to be true, it will give its adherents the motive power to put more effort in the course they believe. This is our task in this study and this will be done within the context of David Hume’ view on Religion.</p> <p>David Hume was a Scottish philosopher who is generally regarded as the greatest of the British empiricist and it is said that he took empiricism to its logical conclusion which is skepticism.</p> <p>Hume applied his rigorous empiricist logic to examining religious matters and drew some skeptical conclusion, this is the issue we want to critically examine in this study. The central problem then and controlling question of this study is was Hume an atheist? Our response will be in the negative, as we shall argue subsequently.</p> <p><strong>1.2   OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Our objective in this study is to critically analyse and evaluate the views of David Hume on religion with a view to determining the validity or otherwise of the description of Hume as an atheist. An atheist is one who maintains that there is no God. Now, the question is, was this the position of David Hume?</p> <p>Stated differently, our objective in this study is  to carry out a detailed critical study of natural religion.</p> <p>We also aim to study Hume’s controversial essay “of miracles” which appeared in his An Enquiry Concerning Human understanding. A reading of these two pieces gives us a clear picture of Hume’s views on religion; and this is our objective in this study.</p> <p><strong>1.3   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is significant because not much attention has been paid or interest shown in studying Hume’s Philosophy of religion. Hume is basically renowned for his empiricist epistemological principles, but not many know how he applied these principles in the realm of religion. Hume’s works, A treatise of Human nature and An enquiry concerning Human understanding have received more attention than his Dialogues concerning natural religion. Perhaps this is because the Dialogues were published post thumously.</p> <p>Consequently, this study is significant as it draws our attention and invites us to critically reflect on Hume’s views on religion with the aim of appraising such views and establishing it validity or relevance.</p> <p><strong>1.4   METHOD AND SCOPE OF THE STUDY      </strong></p> <p>Every discipline, every science has its peculiar method of investigation,, this being a treatise in philosophy, one would be expected to apply the method or methods of philosophical enquiry or investigation. The activity of philosophizing is essentially a reflective activity, thus the method of philosophy involves several related activities. Speculation, analysis, critical evaluation, logical explanation and prescription, since the philosophical method relies on ‘pure reason’ the critical temperament is carried all through the study.</p> <p>David Hume’s philosophy of religion will be critically examined and its implication will be highlighted. This will clearly show the strengths or weakness of Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, but the scope of our study is not limited to the dialogues, we need to have a general understanding of Hume’s empiricist epistemological formulation, particularly his theory of impression, and ideas, because this is the foundation upon which his entire philosophical system rests, as well as his attack on religion.</p> <p><strong>1.5   ORGANISATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is broken up into four chapters. The first chapter concerns itself with the methodological consideration. This chapter is introductory and states the problem, the objective and purpose of the study. Its significance and justification the method adopted in the study in the scope of the study.</p> <p>Our concern in the second chapter is of broad over view of Hume’s philosophy. Here we will examine his postulations in epistemology for which he has won great renown in Ethics, in this chapter we will also attempt to bring to focus Hume’s place in the history of philosophy.</p> <p>The third chapter focuses on Hume’s views on religion and this is the main concern of our study, we examine first Hume’s concept of God and then his criticism of the argument from design as a proof of God’s existence. We also in this chapter examine Hume’s views on miracles, Hume was highly skeptical of reports of miracle as we shall see subsequently.</p> <p>Hume also addressed the question of the presence of evil in the world that an infinitely good and omnipotent deity created. We also concern ourselves with those issues in chapter three that chapter is rounded up with a discussion of Hume’s views on soul and his position on religion generally.</p> <p>The fourth and concluding chapter is evaluatory. Here we critically examine the postulations of Hume presented earlier with a view to discovering the strengths or weaknesses of his arguments. We also examine the position of some commentators and interpreters of Hume’s position. Generally Hume is considered to be an atheist in matters of God and religion. But we raise the critical question, is this classification of Hume correct?</p>\n\nA CRITICAL EVALUATION OF DAVID HUME'S CRITIQUE OF NATURAL RELIGION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF DAVID HUME'S CRITIQUE OF NATURAL RELIGION", "id": 15}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Robert Nozick (1938-2002) was an American philosopher, best known for his rigorous defense of libertarianism in his first major work, <em>Anarchy, State,</em> <em>and Utopia</em> (1974). During his high school and college years, Nozick was a member of the student new left and an enthusiastic socialist. At Columbia, he helped to found a campus branch of the league for industrial democracy. While in graduate school, he read works by libertarian thinkers such as F. A. Hayek and Ludwig Von Mises, and his political views began to change. His conversion to libertarianism culminated in 1974 with the publication of <em>Anarchy, State, and Utopia</em>, a closely argued and highly original defense of the libertarian “minimal state” and a critique of the social-democratic liberalism of John Rowls.</p> <p>The main body of this work falls into four parts; introduction, Nozick on moral right Nozick’s minimal state and appraisal of Robert Nozick political philosophy.</p> <p><strong>1.1     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Nozick’s natural rights – particularly the right of self-ownership and the consequent right to the fruit’s of one’s labour present an obvious problems if we desire any state at all, no matter how minimal.</p> <p><strong>1.2     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objective of this work is to look at moral rights and side constraints, state of nature rights, foundation of rights, the attenuation of rights, the minimal state versus individualist anarchy, the minimal state, the challenge of individual anarchism, response to the anarchist challenges, justice holdings, the historical entitlement doctrine about justice in holding, the critique of end state and patterned principle, Nozick’s Lockean Proviso, the rectification of historical is justice and utopia.</p> <p><strong>1.3     JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Nozick’s political philosophy is researchable because of the problem that usually surround the issue of right. In most case, some government try to intervene with individual right. A good example could be seen in Nigeria, where individual rights to religion, life, speech etc is often been constrained by state coercive power. Based on this, Nozick’s political philosophy is researchable on the ground that individuals have rights, and there are thing no person or group may do without violating this rights.</p> <p><strong>1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><em>Anarchy, state, and utopia, </em>these works essentially revived the discipline of political philosophy within the analytic school, whose practitioners had, until Nozick came along, largely neglected it. Nozick’s also revived interest in the notion of rights as being central to political theory, and it did so in the service of another idea that had been long neglected within academic political thoughts, namely libertinism.</p> <p><strong>1.5     SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is important to point out that although we are working in Robert Nozick’s political philosophy, we are however working specifically at Nozick’s natural rights as well as to criticize some view made by Nozick in <em>anarchism, state and utopia.</em>       </p> <p><strong>1.6     OVERVIEW OF NOZICK’S POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of Anarchy, State and Utopia is to show that the minimal state, is morally justified. By a minimal state Nozick means a state that function essentially as a “Night Watchman”, with powers limited to those necessary to protect citizen against violence, theft, and fraud. By arguing that the minimal is justified, Nozick seeks to refute anarchism which opposes any state whatever, by arguing that no more than the minimal state is justified Nozick seek to refute modern forms of liberalism as well as socialism and others leftist ideologies which contend that, in addition to its power, as a night watchman, the state should have the powers to regulate the economic activities of citizens to regulate the economic activities of citizens to redistribute wealth in the direction of greater equality, and to provide social services such as education and health care.</p> <p>Against anarchism, Nozick claims that a minimal state is justified because it (or something very much like it) would arise spontaneously among people living in a hypothetical “state of nature” through transactions that would not involve the violation of anyone’s natural rights following the 17th century English philosopher John Locke. Nozick assumes that everyone possesses the natural rights to life, liberty, and property including the right to claim as property the fruits or products of one’s  labour and the right to dispose of one’s property as one sees fit (provided that in doing so one does not violate the rights of any one’s else). Everyone also has the natural right to punish those who violate one’s own natural rights. Because defending one’s natural right in a state of nature would be difficult  for anyone to do on his own. Individual would band together to form “protection association”, in which members would work together to defend each other’s rights and to punish rights violator.</p> <p>Eventually, some of these associations would developed into private business offering protection and punishment services for a fee. The great importance that individuals would attach to such services would give the largest protection firms a natural competitive advantage, and eventually only one firm, or a confederation of firms) would have a monopoly of force in the territory of the community and because it would protect the rights of everyone living there, it would constitute a minimal state in the libertarian sense. And because the minimal state would come about without violating anyone’s natural rights, a state with at least its powers is justified.</p> <p>Against liberalism and other leftist ideologies, (modern form of liberalism) Nozick claims that no more than the minimal state is justified, because any state with more extensive powers would violate the natural rights of its citizens. Thus the state should not have the power to control prices or to set a minimal wage because doing so would violate the natural right of citizens to dispose of their labour as they see fit. For similar reasons, the state should not have the power to establish public education or health care through taxes imposed on citizen who may wish to spend their money on private services instead. Indeed, according to Nozick any mandatory taxation used to fund services or benefits other than those constitutive of the minimal state in unjust, because such taxation amount to a kind of “force labour” for the state by those who must pay the tax.</p> <p><strong>1.7     AIM OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of the work is to critically examines Robert Nozick’s political philosophy which is contains his book <em>Anarchy, State and Utopia</em>. According to Nozick is to show that the minimal state is morally justified. By a minimal state Nozick means a state that function essentially as a “night watchman” with powers limited to those necessary to protect – citizens against violence, theft and fraud. Nozick adopts and defends what he calls “The Entitlement Theory”. By way of explaining the entitlement theory of justice Althan (10) maintains that Nozick’s vision of legitimate state power thus contrasts remarkably with that of Rawls argues that the state should have whatever powers are necessary to ensure that those citizens who are least well-off are as well off as they can be (though these powers must be consistent with a variety of basic rights and freedom). This viewpoint is derived from Rawls’ theory of justice one principle of which is that an unequal distribution of wealth and income is acceptable only if those at the button are better off than they would be under any other distribution. According to Althan (11) Nozick’s response to such argument is to claim that they rest on the false conception of distributive justice; they wrongly define a just distribution in terms of the pattern it exhibits at a given time (example, an equal distribution or a distribution that unequal to a certain extent) or in terms of the historical circumstances surrounding its development (example those who worked the hardest have more) rather than in terms of the nature of the transactions through which distribution came about. For Nozick, any distribution of “holdings,” as he calls them, no matter how unequal, is just if (and only if) it arises from a just distribution through legitimate means. One legitimate means is the appropriation of something that is owned in circumstance where the acquisition would not disadvantage others. A second means is the voluntary transfer of ownership of holdings to someone else. A third means is the rectification of past injustices in the acquisition or transfer of holdings. According to Nozick, anyone who acquire what he has through these means is morally entitled to it. Thus, the entitlement theory of justice state that the distribution of holdings in a society is just if (and only if) everyone in that society. Thus the aim of this work is to show that Nozick’s moral justification for the state is far from compelling on the ground that the independent (few individual) where force to pay for the services they initially do not want  may be they do not have money to pay for security but the dominant protection force them to pay, as such Holmes (40) is of the opinion that since the minimal state has considerable power, it is not different from a state with all powers usually associated with it. The paper is of the view that at time it is not only necessary but desirable to redistribute wealth and resources so as to help those in need. Moreso, possession of wealth by individuals might be a product of chance rather than talent and ability. We should at this point look at Nozick’s on moral rights in order to have clear idea of state of nature right.</p>\n\nA CRITIQUE OF ROBERT NOZICK'S POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITIQUE OF ROBERT NOZICK'S POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY", "id": 16}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Soren Kierkegaard is regarded as the father of contemporary existentialism. Existentialism, according to J. I. Omoregbe (39) deals “with concrete existence as opposed to essence.”  This means, for the existentialists, existence precedes essence. Kierkegaard, described by Wittgenstein (cited in Pattison, 1) is “by far the most profound thinker of the last century”. His notion of human existence stems from the fact that Hegel metaphysical idealism presented human existence in an abstract, objective form. Kierkegaard saw Hegel’s philosophy “as inadequate because it shifted attention away from the concrete individual to the concept of universal” (Ozumba 86). For Ozumba (86) this implies that Hegel “merely invited humans to think instead of seeing them as existent being that should be involved in decisions and commitment that have bearing to their individuality and existence”. Kierkegaard’s thought also served as a reaction against speculative philosophy.</p> <p>In his reaction, Kierkegaard built his existential thought in such a manner that it tended to become “a clarification of issue and an appeal to choose, an attempt to get men to see their existential situation and the great alternatives with which they are faced” (Copleston 336). Kierkegaard’s quest was to disassociate the conception of human existence from abstract object to questions that confront the individual as an existing being. Questions such as: What is the meaning of human life? How can one live authentically as a human person?  What is the meaning of human freedom? How can one use his freedom in the face of moral chaos? are pertinent.   Kierkegaard understood existence as a distinctive way of being, and that humans often focus on thought of a group to the detriment of their own unique individuality. Other than being an authentic individual, he is therefore subsumed in the crowd, thus, losing his individual self to abstract objective and societal control. In this sense, what it means, therefore, to be an authentic human being forms energetic question prompting this research on Soren Kierkegaard.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The question of human existence has attracted so many considerations. There are some who approached it from the point of view of its absurdity and meaninglessness. Most of such people are atheists like Martin Heidegger, with Albert Camus and Jean Paul Sartre who played down very much, the essence of human existence as Hegel also did. However, there is the other group of existentialists who discussed human existence as a worthwhile venture. Such include the chief founder of contemporary existentialism in the person of Soren Kierkegaard. These philosophers expounded certain existential tenets which according to Lescoe (9) are geared towards “analyzing the basic structures of human existence and to call individuals to an awareness of their existence in its essential freedom”.</p> <p>The problem of human existence is related wholly to this concept of freedom. Its use and abuse makes and mars man respectively. This is because freedom remains the pivot upon which man asserts himself. It is his relationship to this that categorizes him either as authentic or inauthentic individual. Thus, the measure of the meaningfulness or meaninglessness of life is highly subjective but whichever way it is determined by the degree of commitment which one puts in as he tries to assert himself by the exercise of freedom.</p> <p>Another question to be examined here remains whether one can live authentically when one has no authentic relation to the community which Kierkegaard regard as the crowd? It also takes into consideration the question of freedom and choice, man’s quest for existential meaning and Kierkegaard’s analysis of man’s stages on life way.</p> <p>It is therefore in a bid to clarify some of these mind-bogging issues that the researcher is out to expose what Kierkegaard considers to be the gauge or the standard of meaningful human existence. With this in view, the work is a confrontation of man with the naked facts of his freedom and duty through which he makes the best out of his life as an individual.</p> <p><strong>1.3   AIMS/OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In view of the above stated problems. This work aims at:</p> <ul><li>To awakes from slumber those who are yet to give in or enjoy the latest possibilities in them while those who have lost hope in realizing meaning out of their human existence as x-rayed by their excessive obsession or addiction to working so hard are to be reminded that Kierkegaard was right when he said that “until man actualizes his essential self in God, his life is full of anxiety” (Ibe 43).</li> <li>To make all see the difficulties in life as things designed to make all better and not bitter.</li> <li>To make all realize that human existence is meaningful in so far as it is approached subjectively through individual’s personal experiences, adequate sense and use of freedom, solemn and sincere fear of the Creator.</li> <li>To oriented contemporary man with the expression of their individual potentialities to an appreciable extent.</li> <li>To ascertain the possibility that man realizes himself when he denounce his moral obligations in submission to the commandments of his Creator.</li> <li>To purge man in seeking questions as well as offering answers regarding the meaning of his existence.</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.4   JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Human day-to-day challenges impact highly at all levels and leaves us with so many complexities to eventually falling into the disposition of ‘follow the trends’ for existential survival. The weaknesses in human authenticity in nearly every facet of human life or society cause man to almost be a blind copy of itself or the other person. Typically, daily problems of existence sometimes isolate us from engaging in self-realization to fully understand ourselves and deal with questions that impugn our very nature so as to realize our purpose in an ever changing and ever complex world. Man often focuses on thought of others to the detriment of his unique individuality. Other than being an authentic individual, who answers the question of freedom, meaning and faces the existential phenomenon of death, suffering, dread, despair, absurdity etc, man is otherwise subsumed in the crowd thus losing his individuality to abstract objective or societal control. Kierkegaard’s opposition to this trend and his answers to the question “what does it mean to be existing as a human being?”, informs the energetic question gingering this research on his notion of human existence. Thereby justifies the rationale behind this research bearing in mind it impact in awakening the contemporary man to the reality of himself as an existing being.</p> <p><strong>1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Existential philosophy rest on the conception that man must first exist, then take responsibility of creating meaning or essence for his existence. This task of creating meaning can be says to be enormous. Therefore, man must be at its best to be able to exercise such responsibility. Consequently, questions regarding the human person arise. Questions such as who is a human being? What does existence like? Or what is the meaning of man’s existence. Does man have absolute freedom to make choices? etc. It is in this sense that this research plays a significant role to man as he hopes to realize himself. Thus, the significance of this work can be outline as follows:</p> <ul><li>It helps man to realize his purpose of existence thereby fashioning his own life through realization and reflection on himself by excluding himself from the crowd.</li> <li>Kierkegaard proposed three stages on life would benefits contemporary man to come to the actualization of his essence with the understanding that to exist is to be an individual who strives, who considers alternatives, who chooses, who decides and who makes a commitment more importantly, for ensuring existential commitment, worthy of making the individual sound, critical focused, brave, courageous and analytical minded in making decisions for his very life.</li> <li>It is also of relevance to contemporary man in re-orienting the contemporary world on the fact that self-realization and valuation is possible only if man makes personal decision out of deep personal reflection and free exercise of his will power while being ready to take responsibilities for his subjective decisions than objective crowd following.</li> <li>Also, bearing in mind the scope of epistemology which deals with the nature, scope and criterion of knowledge. The research contributes epistemologically by revealing such knowledge that qualifies such a conclusion on human nature. It’s also awakes the slumbering man to take responsibility and create his essence or meaning even in the face of existential predicaments.</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.6 METHODOLOGY OF STUDY                                          </strong></p> <p>In order to give this work its required philosophical grounding, the researcher made wide consultation of research materials on Kierkegaard. The outcome of that effort is manifested in the acquisition of deep knowledge of existentialists’ concept of human existence. However, there is strict adherence to Kierkegaardian method. Some necessary opinions or insights of others are employed as and when due as the research progresses.</p> <p>The work therefore employs the philosophical methods of analysis, criticism and prescription. Analytical, as to how it relates the existential ideas to subjective experiences. Critical, in that it does not assimilate all Kierkegaard’s assumptions, rather it appraises his strong points but criticizes the unwholesome aspects of his notion or teachings in regard to human existence. Prescriptive, as it seeks to prescribe answer to the questions regarding the meaning of authentic human existence.</p> <p><strong>1.7   SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>What formed the scope of this work stems eventually from what Kierkegaard applied in his effort to ascribe meaning to human existence through authentic individuality. This implies his ideas of the individual and the mode of the individual’s existence. Also, the scope of this research covers Kierkegaard’s existential philosophy, particularly on his notion of human existence and, by extension, his thought as it affects the contemporary man.</p> <p><strong>1.8   Organization of the Work</strong></p> <p>The work is organized into four chapters. While chapter one introduces the work, it also presents the background of the work states the problem, aims/objectives, justification, significance, method, scope, organization of the work and definition of some keys terms. Chapter two reviews related literature, with specific attention to some other existentialists’ views on human existence. Chapter three exposes the main ideas of Kierkegaard as regards human existence. And chapter four concludes the work by evaluating Kierkegaard’s idea of human existence.</p> <p><strong>1.9   DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Meaning of Human</strong></p> <p>Etymologically, the English loanword from old French “human”, ultimately from Latin “humanus”, the adjective form of homo “man”. In common usage, the species of the genes homo (anatomically and behaviourally modern homo sapiens). It usage often designates differences between that species as a while and any other group or entity. It is a synonym humanity which could be refers to a specific individual of either sex.</p> <p><strong>DEFINING EXISTENCE</strong></p> <p>Existence denotes the state of being alive or being real; the fact or state of existing. In other words, existence denotes the continuance or maintenance of life; living especially in adverse circumstances. It is synonymous with life, being, duration, subsistence, reality, survival, actuality, continuance, and continuation. In a nutshell, existence implies man’s way of life, situation or life style.</p> <p><strong>What is Existentialism?</strong></p> <p>Existentialism as a philosophical endeavour is seen differently from the perspective of different philosophers. According to R. C. Solomon, existentialism:</p> <p>“is the explicit conceptual manifestation of an existential attitude–a spirit of ‘the present age’. It is a philosophical realization of a self-conscious living in a “broken world”… a world into which we are “thrown” or “condemned” yet “abandoned” and “free”…a world which appears to be indifferent or even “absurd”…” (ix)</p> <p>This definition sees existentialism “as an attitude which begins with a disoriented individual, facing a confused world that he cannot accept” (Olawonyin 24). On his part, G. O. Ozumba sees existentialism as “the philosophy of human existence…concerned with the individual in the uniqueness of his existence. It therefore renounces reason, universality, abstraction and objectivity in favour of privacy, particularity, randomness and subjectivity” (87-88). Supporting this view, Idang (99) writes that “it would seem, man with his problems, is the main focus of existentialism. It is a manner of philosophizing, a way and manner of looking at the world especially of man and his place in the universe.” For Aqulanna (147) existentialism “is concerned with the ambiguities and paradoxes that constitute the inner being of man”.</p> <p>From the foregoing, existentialism, generally, is a philosophical outlook that stresses man’s predicament, and lay emphasis on man existence as an individual rather than an abstract being. </p>\n\nAN EXAMINATION OF SOREN KERKKEGAARD'S NOTION OF HUMAN EXISTENCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN EXAMINATION OF SOREN KERKKEGAARD'S NOTION OF HUMAN EXISTENCE", "id": 17}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND OF STUDY  </strong></p> <p>Falsification as a principle or theory which holds that for any hypothesis to be cognitively significant, true or scientific it must be inherently disprovable by experience before it can be accepted as a scientific hypothesis or theory. This principle is associated with the twentieth century Austrian- British Philosopher of science known as Sir Karl, Raimund Popper. Science is a discipline that is interested in trying to uncover or discover truths about nature; our natural environment and the world at large, this is why Archibong (89) conceives science as the systematic enterprise of gathering knowledge about the universe by organizing and condensing that knowledge into testable laws and theories”. These laws and theories are used to give explanations to natural occurrences and make further predictions about the future.</p> <p>Scientific method is procedural, that is, it adheres strictly to laid down principles through which an objective knowledge is obtained. It is widely accepted that empirical science is that discipline which employs inductive methodology in the formulation of hypotheses or theories by observing a limited number of instances. Induction therefore becomes accepted by some scientists (inductivists) as a valuable method and practice in the scientific enterprise.</p> <p>It was based on this method of doing science which popper saw as problematic, that is, difficult to accept since it relied on an equally problematic principle of verifiability for the determination of its truth. The verifiability theory states that statements are cognitively significant or empirically tested if they can be conclusively verifiable by experience. Popper rejected this inductivists’ criterion of truth because it does not adequately provide a distinguishing feature between scientific and non-scientific statements and on the reason that “a theory can never be proven to be true by accumulating move and more positive observations (French 53).</p> <p>Hence, his postulation of the falsification theory as a better alternative for the criterion of science. The falsification theory states that a statement is meaningful or scientific  if it is falsifiable by experience or observation.</p> <p>This work will therefore be concerned with the analysis and a critical examination of Karl Popper’s falsification theory.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Popper summits that the more a theory is falsified, the more it becomes scientific. By this, every scientific theory must be such that it can be refuted. This position is founded upon Popper’s quest to demarcate science from pseudo-science. In as much as the position looks plausible, there are problems that are associated with it. These can be noted thus;</p> <ol><li>What happens with theories that are falsified?</li> <li>If scientific hypothesis or theories are conjectures, why do they need refutation?</li> </ol> <ul><li>Should scientists abandon a theory because facts contradict it?</li> </ul> <p>All these are problems that revolves around Popper’s theory of falsification.</p> <p><strong>1.3   AIM OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study aims at re-examining the method of arriving at scientific truth, the problem that are inherent in it and why Popper debunked it and opted for a better method or theory. It further seeks to establish whether or not Popper’s falsification theory is a better alternative or substitute for testing the truth of scientific statements.</p> <p><strong>1.4   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is significant because the notion of truth in science is sometimes arrived at by hasty or faulty generalizations; thus, what is believed to be the truth in science, that is, scientific truth often turn out to be false or probable. Hence, to remove the obstacles that hinder or disrupt scientific truth, we must examine Popper’s falsification principle to see if it can aid scientists to know the truth.</p> <p><strong>1.5   METHOD OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This is a philosophical research work; since philosophy is always critical in its outlook, we shall therefore employ the methods of analysis, speculation and criticism to the study at hand in order to have a synoptic understanding.</p> <p><strong>1.6   SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work does not incorporate the entire works of Karl Popper, it only deals with a section of his philosophy which is in the area of philosophy of science and it will also be limited to his falsification theory as an alternative theory of testing the truth of scientific statements.</p> <p><strong>1.7   DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>The Falsification Principle:</strong> A theory is falsifiable if it is capable of conflicting with observable phenomena or events. Delanty and Strydom (44), opines that “falsifiability is a principle which states that “it must be possible for an empirical/scientific system to be refuted by experience”. Thus, a good scientific theory or statement must be capable of being falsified or refuted by conceivable events; if there are no means of refuting the theory, it implies that it is not scientific and should be abandoned or rejected.</p> <p><strong>Induction:</strong> Traditionally, induction is viewed as an argument which proceeds from particular instances to a general conclusion. “It is an argument in which a particular conclusion is derived from certain premises from the report of specific observation” Aigbodioh (142). It is further described as that which give the premise(s) give a supportive evidence for the truth of the conclusion to the accepted. Mautners (273) defined induction as “inference from a finite number of particular cases to a further case or to a general conclusion”.</p> <p><strong>Verisimilitude:</strong> This term simply means truth content, approximation to truth or nearer to the truth. It was used by Karl Popper to explain that since cannot know or discover the truth but they can only be closer to the truth.</p>\n\nA CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF KARL POPPER'S FALSIFICATION PRINCIPLE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF KARL POPPER'S FALSIFICATION PRINCIPLE", "id": 18}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>      J.S Mbiti contended that Africans perceive time composition of events which must be lived through.

This education comes to us from nature, from men or from things. The internal development of our faculties and the organs is the education of nature. The use we learn to make of this development is the education of men. (Cahn 155) These are the words of a man who has had a propound influence on the field of education. This man is none other than Jean Jacques Rousseau. Rousseau is one of those philosophers who has been greatly misunderstood. Many have criticized his philosophy as being totally outdated and not much applicable in today’s situation. But this seems paradoxical as Rousseau has also been that person who has had a great influence in the field of education. If not his method, then other methods fashioned on his philosophy have been introduced in different fields of education. So one would consider whether Rousseau has something to offer us or not. The reply to such a doubt is yes. If not his method, then the philosophy behind the method is of great importance. It is important to understand that Rousseau has been criticized more because people have not really understood why he expressed himself the way he did. Two main aspects come out very strongly in his philosophy. They are nature, and the child. Both these were of great importance in his philosophy of education. In order to grasp the reason for his philosophy one ought to understand his background and the context in which he wrote. Thus a brief life-sketch and his works, in the Introduction, should enable us to see what events and situations conditioned Rousseau to think andwrite the way he did. he simple Protestant city of Geneva. His father, a watchmaker, was descendent from a Parisian family, and inherited much of the Romanticism, mercurial temperament, and love of pleasures of his forbears. The mother of Rousseau, too, although the daughter of a clergy man, was of a morbid and sentimental disposition. She died at the birth of Jean Rousseau. (Graves 77) Rousseau was brought up by an indulgent aunt, who never bothered to correct him when he faltered. She completely failed to instill in him any moral principles. This tendency for a want of self-control was furthered increased by his father, who had an equally careless attitude. When Rousseau was only six, his father would sit with him night after night and read to him the most silliest and sensational romances, which were left behind by his wife. It is for this reason that extreme emotionality, imaginativeness and precocity were nurtured within the child at a really early age. “After a year or so, the novels were exhausted and Rousseau had to turn for material, to the more sensible library of his grandfather, the preacher.” (Graves 78) Some of these works included the parallel lives of Plutarch and the standard histories of the day. These works had a lasting impression on his character. They contributed to his sense of heroism and what he afterwards termed ‘that republican spirit and love of liberty, that haughty and invincible turn of the mind, which rendered me impatient of restraint.’ His want of control may in this way have first come to turn itself toward the revolution and the destruction of existing society. (Graves 78)Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778) was the precursor of the romantic movement in arts (and literature). The eighteenth-century period in history commonly tagged: “The Age of Enlightenment” was characterized by a revolt against the established order. The period also marked a turning point in the history and identity of Europe, and, by extension, philosophy itself. It was an age that was critical of existing theories, methods, systems and practices; an age petrified with individualistic doctrine that man was free to express himself; an age in which the arts and sciences gained an extra-ordinary prominence; an age whose common trademark was the rejection of the authority (of priests and kings) and consequently anything which could be recommended by reason or common sense was accepted (John, 2009:221). Thus, The Age of Enlightenment was mainly rationalistic in its outlook. It was during this period that reason gained ascendancy over faith; a period in which certainty was only possible through reason. That is, reason was seen as the only answer to man’s difficulty and confusion. It was a time of individual (not political) liberty, reformation and revolution in sciences, arts and education. In describing this age, Curtis and Boultwood agree with Rogers (387-388) that the most obvious features of The Enlightenment were: “its practical and unimaginative character, its hatred of vague enthusiasm, and misty ideas; its determination to apply the test of a severely accurate reason to everything and reject out-rightly whatever will not stand the test of time; the constant reference in all this, as the court of final appeal to the one undoubted fact was the individual himself with his rights and his rational power of understanding” (263-264). Though Rousseau was certainly a member of The Age of Enlightenment, but he was not all this about this Age as alleged by Curtis and Boultwood. He can be reckoned as a reactionary to this movement. He became a reformer who was set to reform the “reforms”. It is pertinent to posit that most outstanding thinkers of this period discovered something about self in various ways and senses. For instance, Descartes discovered the thinking-self in his Cogito, ergo sum; Locke discovered the experiencing-self in his empiricism; Schopenhauer discovered the diminishing-self in his pessimism; Luther discovered the believing-self in his “by faith only”. Rousseau, on his part, discovered the feeling-self, the unique kind of self that feels; the self that is passionate, the self that is natural and emotional; the self that is in need of freedom and equality with all men (John, 2009:222). Speaking like Pascal, Rousseau, in this new discovery on self, holds that the heart has its reasons which the head can never understand. Rousseau’s peculiar thought is an issue in philosophical circle. Though he attended no university, and he started doing various kinds of menial jobs at the age of twelve, yet the kind of intellectualization which he displayed and lived by eventually became a challenge to the hitherto academic and philosophic status-quo of his time, and the very thing that shook the foundations of France, Russia, Britain, Germany and America in particular and the whole world in general. The entire philosophic build-up and the current of the Enlightenment pioneered by Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Voltaire, Schopenhauer, and other professional philosophers was once again forced to be re-examined in the light of Rousseau’s mental paradigm. Rousseau was a prolific writer, a powerful and original thinker, whose productivity generated the flames of the French Revolution of the 18thcentury and summarily compelled Tozer in the “Introduction” to his 1948 translation of The Social Contract to concur with Sir Henry Maime in the following words: “The world has not seen more than once or twice in all the course of history a literature which has exercised such prodigious influence over the minds of men, over every cast and shade of intellect, as Rousseau’s between 1749 and 1762” (12).</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Before one delves into Rousseau’s child-centered education, it is important to give a summary of his educational thought. This is to enable us have a background of his philosophy. Rousseau’s educational ideas came to limelight in 1761 with the publication of Emile, seminal work on education. The book marked the beginning of a new revolution in education. Rousseau even declares: “My thoughts are not like those of others” (1975:15). The book caused a universal outburst of indignation; the Catholic Church condemned it and ordered for its copies to be publicly burnt and the arrest of its author. In Emile, Rousseau presents a tripartite discussion on education, namely: the natural or negative phase, the social or moral phase and the civic or political phase. In this study, we shall not be concerned with the social and political dimensions. This is because Rousseau believes very strongly that the natural phase takes preeminence over and above the rest: the natural phase therefore becomes the anchor upon which the social and political angles rest. This stands to mean that the social and political phases are mere products of the natural phase of education. It is in view of this that the researcher intends to evaluate J.J ROUSSEAU’s concept of education.</p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study is to evaluate J.J ROUSSEAU’s concept of education.

Finally the study will be of great importance to students, teachers and the general public as the finding will add to the pool of existing literature</p> <p><strong>1.6      </strong><strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>The scope of this study covers critical evaluation of J.J ROUSSEAU’s concept of education, but in the cause of the study, the researcher encounters some constrain which limited the scope of the study;</p> <p><strong>a)     AVAILABILITY OF RESEARCH MATERIAL:</strong> The research material available to the researcher is insufficient, thereby limiting the study.</p> <p><strong>b)     TIME:</strong> The time frame allocated to the study does not enhance wider coverage as the researcher has to combine other academic activities and examinations with the study.</p> <p><strong>c)     FINANCE</strong>: The finance available for the research work does not     allow for wider coverage as resources are very limited as the researcher has other academic bills to cover.</p> <p><strong>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS </strong></p> <p><strong>Education </strong></p> <p>Education is the process of facilitating learning or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussiob, teaching, training and direct research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university or apprenticeship.</p> <p><strong>Enlightenment </strong></p> <p>European politics, philosophy, science and communications were radically reoriented during the course of the “long 18th century” (1685-1815) as part of a movement referred to by its participants as the Age of Reason, or simply the Enlightenment.</p> <p><strong>1.8 ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work is organized in five chapters, for easy understanding, as follows. Chapter one is concern with the introduction, which consist of the (background of the study), statement of the problem, objectives of the study, research questions, research hypotheses, significance of the study, scope of the study etc. Chapter two being the review of the related literature presents the theoretical framework, conceptual framework and other areas concerning the subject matter.     Chapter three is a research methodology covers deals on the research design and methods adopted in the study. Chapter four concentrate on the data collection and analysis and presentation of finding.  Chapter five gives summary, conclusion, and recommendations made of the study.</p>\n\nA CRITICAL EVALUATION OF J.J ROUSSEAU'S CONCEPT OF EDUCATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF J.J ROUSSEAU'S CONCEPT OF EDUCATION", "id": 20}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>A CRITIQUE OF DAVID HUME’S EMPIRICISM</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>One of the never ending processes in life is the process of knowledge acquisition which to the lay man may not constitute any problem as regards how it is acquired. But to philosophers, from time past this has constituted serious debacles. However, in philosophy, it has become the special concern of epistemology one of it’s branches to analyze how knowledge is acquired.</p> <p>Epistemology has rationalism and empiricism as its most outstanding schools. These two schools in analyzing how knowledge is acquired have come to be the opposite of each other, because while rationalism hold that knowledge comes through reason,empiricism on the other hand holds that it comes through sense-experience. In this long history of philosophy, however, David Hume has remained the most consistent empiricist and for some reasons, we deemed it necessary to make the aim of this work be the critical analysis of David Hume’s theory of empiricism so that in the end we would have demonstrated whether it exhausts all possible knowledge of reality or not.</p> <p>Now our problem is what must have led to Hume’s radical position that sense-experience is the only possible guide to the acquisition of knowledge that is certain? We however, discover that it is not unconnected to the fact that the search for knowledge that is certain, which Aristotle shifted to concrete objects through experimentation and which also cut through the time of John Locke and George Berkeley who laid emphasis on perception, influenced Hume to a great extent. Therefore by building on the philosophy of Locke and Berkeley which emphasized sense perception, Hume came to develop his radical position about sense experience as the limit of human knowledge.</p> <p>In this, Hume categorized the objects of human reason into relations of ideas and matters of facts and he concentrated on the latter which he argued can only be ascertained through sense-experience. He went further to hold that these sense-experiences are acquired as impressions that is at the time of direct contact with an object, and later as ideas when the mind reflects on the impressions.</p> <p>Analytically one discovers that impressions are however Humes only guarantee for measuring reality, even the ideas in the mind he argued must conform to these impressions so as to be considered as guaranteeing knowledge as real. In short, for something to be considered as real, it must generate impression.</p> <p>Hume argued, causality can not be real because in reality, only what we experience are the proceeding and succeeding events separately and not any causal relation between the two events. All other metaphysical concepts are not real because they do not generate impressions and therefore cannot be experienced. To demonstrate his utter rejection of metaphysics, Hume campaigned for the burning of every book that contains metaphysics.</p> <p>In spite of all these, Hume’s rejection of metaphysics was an unsuccessful exercise because Hume used the method of knowledge acquisition through sensation which does not apply to metaphysics.</p> <p>Then come our wonder, why should sense-experience be the only standard of the measurement of reality for Hume? Are the senses not fallible? Of course, they are. Hardly do two people perceive on thing the same way, what of illusions and hallucinations, all these demonstrates that the senses furnish us most times with appearances and not reality. It therefore amounts to wrong conception of reality as guaranteeing reality.</p> <p>What the sense furnish us with has to be moderated by human reason before they are considered, qualified as certain knowledge.</p> <p>OUT LINE</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1    Background of  study</p> <p>1.2    Statement of  problem</p> <p>1.3    Purpose of study</p> <p>1.4    Significance of  study</p> <p>1.5    Scope and Scopmethodology</p> <p>1.6    Methodology</p> <p>1.7    Literature Review</p> <p>        End Notes</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO: HUME’S LIFE AND THE INTELLECTUAL INFLUENCES ON HIM</p> <p>2.1    Hume’s life and works</p> <p>2.2    Intellectual influences on David Hume</p> <p>2.3    General overview of empiricist philosophy</p> <p>        End Notes</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE: HUME’S EMPIRICISM</p> <p>3.1    Hume’s theory of empiricism</p> <p>3.2    Contents of the mind and Association of ideas</p> <p>3.3    Hume’s concept of causality</p> <p>3.4    Hume’s attack on metaphysics</p> <p>        End Notes</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR:         PROBLEMS AND CRITIQUE OF HUME’S EMPIRICISM</p> <p>4.2    The limitations of the senses as a source of knowledge</p> <p>4.2    Wrong conception of reality</p> <p>4.3    A systematic empiricism leads to idealism</p> <p>        End Notes</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE:PERSONAL REFLECTION</p> <p>5.1 End notes</p> <p>5.2 Bibliography</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The search for knowledge that is both absolute and certain has been continuous. However, since at least the time of Aristotle, there has been a strong epistemological tradition based mainly on human experience, which is not directed towards the possibility of achieving absolute knowledge.</p> <p>This tradition is a typical example of the doctrine of empiricism. Empiricists argue that it is unreasonable to set a goal of absolute and all-inclusive knowledge, especially when there is close at hand the power to increase practical knowledge by slower but dependable methods.</p> <p>Empiricist are content in building a system of knowledge that has a high probability of being true even though it’s absolute certainty cannot be guaranteed.</p> <p>David Hume is one of the greatest empiricists in the history of epistemology and metaphysics who has distinguished himself as a consistent and coherent radical empiricist.</p> <p>According to him, the only true knowledge is experimental, and any concept that is not available to sense perception is mere fanciful thinking.</p> <p>The only abstract objects of the abstract science or of demonstration are quantity and number, and all attempts to extend this more perfect species of knowledge beyond these bounds are mere sophistry and illusion.1</p> <p>With an ideological ferocity, he calls for a book-burning campaign of any metaphysical work.</p> <p>He proclaims:</p> <p>When we run over libraries persuaded of these (empirical) principles, what havoc must we make? If we take in our hand any volume: of or school metaphysics, for instance lets ask does it contain any abstract reasoning containing quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter-of-fact and existence? No. Commit to it to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.2</p> <p>Hume’s proposal of vigorous sensism as an alternative to our natural and acquired scientific, metaphysical and socio-cultural deposits, creates more problems than it resolves. It withers all foundation of science and philosophy. It leaves us in make-shift, sandy subjectivism of dry empiricism.</p> <p>David Hume’s empiricism within the context of knowledge is great, but a consistent empirist will end up destroying the very foundation of knowledge. The epistemological, scientific and ontological heritage of humanity is we think more than a series of impressions.3 To reduce them as bundles of impressions. To reduce them as bundles of impressions as Hume would want to believe is myopic.</p> <p>The above as a way of introduction forms the background of our study.</p> <p>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>There are problems in Hume’s theory of empiricism. The major one arises in an attempt to answer the question of how reliable is our senses. Very often, our senses deceive us. This is true when we see a mirage, in the changing size of objects according to our psychological and physiological state, in hallucination and other forms of illusions.</p> <p>The problem is that there is no way of immediately differentiating the real from the unreal in such situations. The mirage for example is an effect caused by hot air in deserts or on roads, that makes you think you can see something, such as water, which is not there.</p> <p>Now the question is, how do we differentiate between a true sense experience from a false or illusory sense experience?</p> <p>Thus, arises the famous arguments from illusion which places doubts on the reliability of sense experience.</p> <p>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>It has already been pointed out that David Hume maintained a radical stand in his position on knowledge acquisition by maintaining that knowledge comes only from sense experience. He did this by drawing out the problems inherent in reason as a source of knowledge.</p> <p>The purpose of this study is therefore to examine David Hume’s position and also to show that in as much as we agree that human beings acquire knowledge through senses experience, sense experience alone cannot constitute or guarantee knowledge. Just as Jacques Maritain pointed out that every philosophical system contains some truth and tells something about the real, some philosophies however exaggerate their claims and this is where they then run into problems. This is so with David Hume, he ran into this kind of problem and this was because though knowledge can be acquired through sense experience, he exaggerated the position by maintaining that knowledge can only come through sense experience.</p> <p>It therefore becomes part of the purpose of this study to point out some of these problems as we can in order to show that though sense experience leads to knowledge, however knowledge does not stop there after there are some limitations to the senses in epistemological procedure so that whatever information we receive through the senses are subjected to judgment before it is accepted.</p> <p>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>When this work is completed, it is our hope that it is going to be of importance in the sense that at least we would have succeeded in bringing to light some of the very important aspects of David Hume’s empiricism and at the same time would have also succeeded in pointing out problems inherent in it.</p> <p>The work will equally be of help or assistance to students who will want to do some works in the area of David Hume’s empiricism as it will provide some aid to them by providing them with a kind of insight into the nature of Hume’s empiricism. But we must point out here that this work should not be taken as all there is in Hume’s empiricism. But where however, we could not cover, the references. That appear at the end of the work will therefore be adequate to direct or refer students to where information as regards those areas will be gathered.</p> <p>To people who may not be doing works on David Hume`s Empiricism; to non-philosophers, who may thus be reading for knowledge acquisition or for pleasure, this work will equally be of immense help as the approach that will be adopted here and the choice of works will not be difficult to understand. </p> <p>1.5    SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY</p> <p>We have already shown from the title of this work that this work is concerned with providing a critique of David Hume’s empiricism. However, just as it is done in every critical study, we are not going to rush into the criticism just like that, we therefore will have a guide or focus as regards what to criticize. Hume’s empiricism itself is to provide the guide because, as we are going to criticize it, we will have to present his empiricism so as to point out what it entails. After doing this, we will then know how to anchor our criticism to the problems we will observe, having discovered the nature of Hume’s Empiricism.</p> <p>1.6    METHODOLOGY</p> <p>The method to be adopted in this work is that of critical study. As the work is on David Hume’s empiricism, the method will therefore be, first of all to present a general overview of empiricism. After this we will then narrow our attention down to Hume’s notion of the subject matter empiricism. It will be after presenting these that we will therefore settle down to criticize.</p> <p>For the purpose of convenience however, our criticism is going to be in two phases.  The first phase will be to provide the attacks which had been leveled against Hume’s empiricism by other people, this is because we are quite aware that Hume’s empiricism has come under attacks over the years.</p> <p>The second phase of the criticism will therefore be our own criticism. We will here point out as will be able, some of those problems Hume’s empiricism are shrouded with due to Hume’s radical position, and based on these, we will therefore draw our criticisms against his empiricism.</p>\n\nA CRITIQUE OF DAVID HUME’S EMPIRICISM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITIQUE OF DAVID HUME’S EMPIRICISM", "id": 21}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><b>PLATO’S CLASS DISTINCTION: THE BACKDROP OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b></p> <p><b>TITLE………………………………………………………………………...i</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>CERTIFICATION…………………………………………………….…….ii</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>DEDICATION……………………………………………………………....iii</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>ACKNOWLEDGMENT………………………………………………........iv</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>TABLE OF CONTENTS…………………………………………………...vi</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>INTRODUCTION………………………………………………………....viii</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>GENERAL BACKGROUND</p> <p>1.1     Plato’s Background……………………………………………..1</p> <p>1.2     His Works and Chronology………………………………….....4</p> <p>1.3     Plato’s Class Distinction………………………………………..8</p> <p>1.4     Plato’s Intention for the Distinction…………………………...15</p> <p><b>CHAPTER TWO</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>VIEWS ON CLASS DISTINCTION</p> <p>2.1                      Aristolte’s view……………………………………………….18</p> <p>2.2                      Karl Marx’s view……………………………………………..20</p> <p>2.3                      Sociological views……………………………………………22</p> <p>2.4                      The tenability of Egalitarianism……………………………...26</p> <p><b>CHAPTER THREE</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATION.</p> <p>3.1     The Notion of Education……………………………………..30</p> <p>3.2     Ancient Theories……………………………………………...32</p> <p>3.3     Early Christian Education…………………… ……………....35</p> <p>3.4     Medieval Education…………………………………………..37</p> <p>3.5     Modern/Contemporary Education…………………………....41</p> <p><b>CHAPTER FOUR</b></p> <p>PLATO’S CLASS DISTINCTION AND CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION.</p> <p>4.1                  Practical Implications of Plato’s Class Distinction……….....43</p> <p>4.2                  Nature of Contemporary Education………………………....47</p> <p>4.3                  Influence of Plato’s Class Distinction on Contemporary Education………………………………………………….....49</p> <p><b>CHAPTER FIVE.</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>CRITICAL EVALUATION AND CONCLUSION.</p> <p>5.1                Critical Notes on Plato’s Class Distinction…………………...55</p> <p>5.2                The defects and Impact of Contemporary Education………....59</p> <p>5.3                Conclusion…………………………………………………....60        </p> <p><b>BIBLIOGRAPHY…………………………………………………………63</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p>The integral nature of the human society makes the interaction of one another within the society necessary. Thus, there exist economic, social, religious and political institutions that foster this required integration. The popular John Donne’s phrase that ‘no man is an island’ advocates a complementarity of each other’s capacity for a wholesome society. Aristotle in his Politics asserted that nature intends man to live in a society. “He who is unable to live in society or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself must either be a beast or a god.”[1] It is only in a society therefore that man can develop his potentialities as a human being. The state, which is described as an organized political community, becomes therefore a plat-form for the realization of this natural need for complementarity.</p> <p></p> <p>For Plato, the nature of the state requires a division of labour so that the diverse needs of man within the state would be met. The outcome of this division, if followed according to the natural disposition of each to his class, is justice in the state and happiness for the individuals within the state. </p> <p></p> <p>The itinerary of Plato’s class distinction within the state as he proposed for the then Athenian state left a significant mark on education. Through out the history of the development of education, some imports of Plato’s political propositions seemed evident especially in contemporary education. In a bid to make this clearer, it is necessary in this introductory part to state the purpose, scope, method and division of this work.</p> <p></p> <p><b>PUROSE OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Having stated the nature of the human society and the necessity of the state above, I intend to look at Plato’s view of the ideal state. His propositions on the nature of the ideal state introduce the role of education while answering the questions of ‘who’ occupies ‘which’ class in the three classes of his ideal state.  The end of this would be to explain how his class distinction remains the backdrop of contemporary education.</p> <p></p> <p><b>SCOPE OF WORK</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This work examines Plato’s proposition for an ideal (Athenian) state through his class distinctions in the state. A look at different views on this class distinction gives more explanation to the reality of different classes within a state/society. With an inference of the implications of Plato’s class distinction and a look on the nature of contemporary education, the influence of the former on the latter is easily brought to limelight.</p> <p></p> <p><b>METHODOLOGY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Expository method is employed in explaining Plato’s propositions for an ideal state and the distinctions in class within the state. However, an analytic tone underlies the whole thesis purposely for realizing the philosophical evaluation of the influence of his (Plato’s) class distinction in contemporary education.</p> <p></p> <p><b>DIVISION OF WORK</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Apart from this introductory part, this work comprises five chapters. The first chapter exposes the general background of Plato’s political philosophy, which also treats his idea of the make up of the ideal state. The second explores some views on class distinction, which is concluded with the tenability of egalitarianism. Chapter three traces the historical development of education from the ancient to the contemporary ages of education. Chapter four derives the practical implications of Plato’s class distinction from which the influence of the class distinction on contemporary education is gleaned. Chapter five makes a critical evaluation on Plato’s class distinction and the impact of contemporary education. </p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] Aristotle, <i>Politics, </i>Bk I, Chapter 2</p> </div> </div>\n\nPLATO’S CLASS DISTINCTION: THE BACKDROP OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PLATO’S CLASS DISTINCTION: THE BACKDROP OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION", "id": 22}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><b>THE NIGERIA POLICE AND MOCKERY OF COMMON GOOD</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b>(A Critical Investigation)</b> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b></p> <p><b>                                                                  </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>TITLE PAGE……………………………….....………             i</p> <p>CERTIFICATION………………….…………………              ii</p> <p>DEDICATION…………………………………….….             iii</p> <p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS…………………….…….              iv</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS……………...……….…….              v</p> <p></p> <p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.O    GENERAL INTRODUCTION………………              1</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.1     Background…………………………………….               1</p> <p>1.2     Statement of the problem……………………….             4</p> <p>1.3     Scope and purpose of the study…………………           5</p> <p>1.4     Method of the Research…………………………             6</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>CHAPTER TWO</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>2.O    COMMON GOOD………………………….                  8</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>2.1     Literature Review…………………………….                 9</p> <p>2.2     The Ontology of Common Good……………..              14</p> <p>2.3     Obstacles that hinder Common Good.....………           15</p> <p>2.4     Common Good and Institutions……………….            17</p> <p></p> <p><b>CHAPTER THREE                                                                  </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>3.0            </b><b>UNDERSTANDING THE ACT OF POLICING….   19</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>3.1     The meaning of police and act of policing………..                  21</p> <p>3.2     Community policing……………………………….                 23</p> <p>3.3     Roles of police in a Society…………………………     25</p> <p>3.4     The Structure of Police Force in Nigeria………….…    27</p> <p>3.5     The philosophy of police service…………………….   29</p> <p><br/></p> <p><b>CHAPTER FOUR</b></p> <p><b>4.0            </b><b>THE NIGERIA POLICE AND SOME CASES OF MOCKERY OF COMMON GOOD……………….   31</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>4.1     Some possible causes of police mockery of</p> <p> Common good in Nigeria……………………………    32</p> <p>4.2     Nigerian Police and Destruction of lives and</p> <p> Property… …………………………………………      36</p> <p>4.3            Nigeria police, Bribery and Extortion of Twenty Naira </p> <p>Syndrome…………………………………………..       37</p> <p>4.4              Police Conniving with Armed Robbers – A mockery    </p> <p>of common good……………………………………..                   39</p> <p>4.5     Police Brutality and Extra-judicial killings……….                 41</p> <p>4.6     Police meddling with Public Funds and property…………………………………………..                   43</p> <p>4.7     Nigeria Police, other Human Rights Abuses, </p> <p>Corruption and Indiscipline………………………        45</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>CHAPTER FIVE</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>5.0            </b><b>EVALUATION AND CONCLUSION</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>5.1     Critical Evaluation……………………………….          49</p> <p>5.2     Some Recommendations………………………..           53</p> <p>5.3     Conclusion…………………………………….              57</p> <p><b>BIBLIOGRAPHY</b>…………………………………..              60</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><b>1.0                               GENERAL INTRODUCTION</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1  BACKGROUND</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Mind cast on some capitalist societies shows that sometimes, pursuit of personal interest overrides and militates against the realization of <b>common good</b>. Ipso facto, Nigerian society has not been an exception to this. Yet, the fact still remains that it is in working together for the common good or welfare that one achieves one’s private good, and not the reverse.  This is because the adoption of a capitalist system does not presuppose a society where the sense of justice and mutual co-existence is totally lost.  Hence, some social philosophers have become exponents and defenders of common good of the human society.   No wonder Aristotle holds that man is a social being.  That is to say that the goals which man sets for himself, are those he pursues in common with other men.  This, as a matter of fact, defines the existence of human society.  Taking a cursory look on one of the reasons why man seeks to live in a society:</p> <p>…is to attain the fullness or end of his life, which is achieved only when it is integrated in a body of social communication.1</p> <p>Thus, the society more or less, exists for the realization of the common good of the whole.</p> <p>But it seems that even people, who suppose to make others adhere to the promotion of common good, are sometimes found to be those who directly or indirectly oppress the common good. The Nigeria police for example, sometimes go against the common good of the members of the society, which results in loss of lives and property here and there, and they swim in the ocean of indiscipline and corruption in the force. This is because there is a gruesome pursuit of private interest and so, the end for which man comes together in a society is seriously defeated.</p> <p>Thus, in this social ill, human right and dignity is compromised. It is on this that Pope John Paul II holds that “respect for the dignity of the person which implies the defense and promotion of human rights, demands the recognition of the religious dimension of the individual”.2  This is in consonance with social, economic and political order respectful of the dignity, freedom and fundamental rights of each person. There exist both fundamental and other human rights, which every citizen should enjoy. This underscores the urgency of promotions of such common good.</p> <p>There are several definitions of common good. In general parlance, common good highlights a specific good that is shared by and beneficial to all, or most members of a given community, and also this is how this common good is broadly understood in philosophy, ethics and political science. The idea of common good could also be seen in certain degree, as the general welfare of the people.</p> <p>Nevertheless, sometimes people propound certain theories in criticism of the idea of common good. There is, for instance, a theory called psychological egoism, which argues that man is selfish and self-seeking by nature, and so, every person always seeks his interest in whatever he does. According to this theory, whenever a person does anything, he does it only because he has seen that somehow (either directly or indirectly, either immediately or in the future) he will derive some benefits for himself from it.3 The theory claims that behind any human action, there is always a selfish motive which prompts it and which acts as its driving force. Thus, any human action could aim at a selfish desire for fame, a desire for wealth, a desire for praise, a desire for money, a desire for power etc.</p> <p>But, one may not have to say for sure that this theory completely holds water. If it were true, then, it would be impossible to be altruistic, since altruism is the very opposite of egoism. Altruism has been found to be a moral ideal; the more morally mature a person is, the more altruistic he becomes, and the more morally immature he is, the more egoistic he is. According to J. Omeregbe, the truth is that man has, by nature, the potentialities for both selfishness and altruism because he is by nature, both individual and social.4 </p> <p>But why does a human society exist? One can say that society exists in order to ensure the free movement of the individual members in the pursuit of their interest as a community.  This underscores the notion of common good, which is part of what we set out to consider in this work. Man realizes his private good more genuinely when it is pursued in the general or common good of the society in which he belongs.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2                                     </b><b>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM.</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Every civil society exists for the realization of common good of the social whole.5 This underscores the establishment of some institutions or bodies that would be charged with the responsibility of helping to achieve, promote or realize this common good. The police force, then, is one of such institutions. As a matter of fact, the basis for establishment of police force is mostly geared towards the welfare of the society.6</p> <p>However, it has been found out that in Nigeria, there are instances where insecurity of life and property are rather found in the hands of security agents, who leave the common good in pursuit of private interests. When this becomes the case, there is no promotion but the mockery of common good. This is when law enforcement agents become lawless themselves. They are even seen to use their police authority to pursue their selfish interest, to the extent of using bullying and killing to the detriment of the general welfare of the people, of which they are called to protect. Lives and properties are lost in the hands of those meant to protect them.</p> <p>But a person is not meant to be subject to whomever that can control him by force without regard for reason of law (common good of the whole) and order of a society. When this prevails in a society, Thrasymanchus’ ‘might is right’ reigns, where the stronger (armed policemen) takes along what belongs to the society. Injustice becomes the order of the day, where the rights of the weak and poor, are trampled on.7 The problem then becomes: who, after all, guards the guardians, if the entire common good is to be realized. This is a question that has bedeviled man for a long time. The recent excesses and illegalities of our respected police force, give special urgency to the question of control over and accountability of our police establishment. Certainly, the sight of such ill activities of some of our police officers intimidating its citizens, or interrupting the flow of life of justice, is sufficiently unnerving to force us to seek answers to the challenge.</p> <p></p> <p>1.3                                     <b>SCOPE AND PURPOSE OF THE STUDY.</b></p> <p>In this research work, my realm of concentration and concern will be limited to the consideration of notion of common good by some thinkers and then use it to investigate into only some ill activities of Nigeria police that militates against the general welfare of the people. As a matter of fact, Nigeria police has cases where they promote common good, but I shall only limit myself to some cases of their negation of common good.</p> <p>The purpose or objective of this research is streamlined towards exposing certain indiscipline and corruptive activities of Nigerian police force that ridicule the realization of common good of the people, which defines the role of police institution, and which underscores the fundamental end of a civil society.  It seems that this work sets to answer, to some extent, the question: who will guard the guardians for the realization of common good. Hence, the aim is to consider perhaps, some possible solutions to the problem.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4       METHOD OF THE RESEARCH</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The method used in this work is strictly expository in the sense that it portrays some police misconducts with a view to proffer possible solutions; investigative because it is a search for instances of police misconducts; critical because of its reasonableness and that it is given to expressing severe judgments of what the police ought to be; and evaluative in the sense that it assesses the value of common good in relation to the end for which a civil society exists.</p> <p>Thus, for proper handling of this task, the work is divided into five chapters with sub-headings under each one.  Chapter one will be a general introduction. Chapter two has to do with literature review, ontology of common good, obstacles that hinder common good and then, the common good and institutions.  </p> <p>In chapter three, we shall consider an understanding of an act of policing, roles of police in a society, the structure of police force in Nigeria, and philosophy of police service.  Chapter four, will furnish us with some instances or cases of police mockery of common good in Nigeria. Then, the final chapter is all about a critical evaluation, an attempt to proffer some solutions and then conclusion of the whole work. </p> <div><br/><div> <p>1 J.

On the strength of this, Gabriel Marcel, the leading religious existentialist in Europe, considering our state of life in a relational level, propounded the theory of I-thou relationship.  Francis J.C. quotes Marcel as saying:</p> <p>“The meaningfulness and the authenticity of one’s existence as an ‘I’ is totally conditioned by the generosity with which I make myself available in mutual love, fidelity, faith and disponibility to thou”.1</p> <p>It is obvious and clear that the authenticity of one’s existence to the other is absolutely anchored on one’s genuiness, openness to the other who is the only unique way of oiling one’s existence.  Thus, it does not give much confidence for being exceptionally sensitive, thoughtful and honest without the other.</p> <p>I-Thou relationship therefore, is a total commitment to the other which involves inter-subjectivity, Fidelity, Disponibility, Faith, Hope and Love.  It concerns the hidden and the mysterious nature of “being” itself.  This type of relationship is predominantly innate to man rather than theoretical.  Mysterious in the sense that there is no room for particular involvement, objectification and thingfication of the individual.  As opposed to a problematic or problem-solving type of relationship that verifies and lacks involvement.</p> <p>The nature or content of I-Thou is non-verifiable, rather it is ontologically mysterious.  This notion of mystery central to I-Thou, if not given a due consideration, can be devalued by the technocracy of the functionalzed world.  Marcel committed himself to the breaking down of such barriers by placing a priority to human values as against the functional values of technology.  For a brilliant success in I-Thou relation, there should be a personal commitment to the absolute and eternal Thou.  This act of genuine relationship and commitment is possible only when it is rooted in the absolute and unconditioned Thou, God - the giver of I - thou in its fullness.</p> <p>For Marcel, a lasting relationship must take to heart the above tenets in order to have a clear viewpoint about life as a mystery and not a problem.  This work therefore, is an exposition and analysis of his thoughts which suggest an alternative to genuine contemporary relationship.</p> <p><strong>1.2     CLARIFICATION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>In the course of this work, there are some technical terms used by Marcel that are strange and known to the initiated alone.  The ‘thou’ of Marcel depicts a partner or the other in relationship.  Mystery is not as in theological terms, but as an act of being involved or part of one’s problem than parting away or trying to solve such a situation by any easy method.  This is the height of his second reflection.  To solve this problem demands a sense of reflection and not thinking alone.   Problem is the wrong attitude towards the difficulties confronting me and my partner, which I never wanted to be a part of.</p> <p>Ontology refers to the idea of “being,” and the value attached to it just by virtue of the fact that one exists.  Creative fidelity is that faith, trust, love and hope we have for our beloved ones which does not manifest itself on the plane of physical presence alone, but is also effective in the absence of the other.  With such fidelity, the memories of our beloved departed ones are kept in us with passion.  It is a nostalgia which reproduces itself especially with our distant loved ones.</p> <p>The Absolute ‘Thou’ suggests the transcendental God. Availability is translation to the term “Disponibilite”.  The ‘functionlized and technological man’ is the man who is used as a means to an end and not as an end itself, the man that is valued for his functional and technological worth and values, for what he does and not for what he is.</p> <p> The mastery of the above terms will help the readers of this work to follow without much stress and cost.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>     <strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Today, we are living in the midst of irrationalism and inconsistency as witnessed in many areas of life: such as the families, marriages and other aspects.  As a result, it seems the center can no longer hold.  It is, therefore, the purpose of this ground project to remould and re-evaluate most of our ideas in contemporary and existential issues, as mentioned above, using Gabriel Marcel’s “I-thou” authentic existence as a firm edifice. It equally suggests ways of being meaningfully and creatively responsible in our affairs with the other while not seeking utilitarian satisfaction from a  relationship.  Minds are strengthened up following this work on what real friendship should be while advocating for a committed and sacrificial union with the other. </p> <p><strong>1.4     SCOPE OF STUDY.</strong></p> <p>Having established the purpose of this study namely; the re-moulding of our contemporary and existential issues, the scope of this study then falls within the range of relationship between ‘I-Thou’ as an existence with other entities and ‘beings’ in the world.  This study exposes what genuine relationship should be in the perspective of Gabriel Marcel’s analysis and exposition of “I-Thou” as a prototype.  It also incorporates God, the absolute and eternal thou, our societal life and life in the family which it sets to re-evaluate.</p> <p><strong>1.5            </strong><strong>          METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>Since the anthropocentric period, many philosophers have devised methods in the study of man: Edmund Husserl’s transcendental phenomenology, Boros dialogical interpretation, Marcel’s analytical method and others.</p> <p>It is my intention to adopt Marcel’s analytical, expository and practical method in the course of this study.  Consequently, this work is made up of four chapters.</p> <p>Chapter one deals with general introduction with an over-view of Gabriel’s life and philosophy.</p> <p> The second chapter will examine properly, Marcel’s significant I-Thou, I-absolute Thou, Notion of mystery and idea of problem and the existentialist’s approach to I-Thou.</p> <p>Chapter three dwells on other aspects of I-Thou, such as Fidelity, Hope and Love; man in the fictionalized and technological world, and lastly presence as inter-subjective relationship.</p> <p> The last chapter (four) centers on the evaluation and conclusion of the work. It suggests an alternative to genuine contemporary relationship.  Then comes the Bibliography.</p> <p> <strong>1.6            </strong><strong>          AN OVER-VIEW OF GABRIEL’S LIFE AND PHILOSOPHY.</strong></p> <p>A general remark about Gabriel’s life and philosophy makes it easier to understand his ideologies clearer.  Copleston  calls him: </p> <p>A peculiar elusive thinker, a philosopher whom it is extremely difficult to summarize.2</p> <p>Born in Paris, in 1889, and was brought up in a well-off family of civil servant.  He lost his mother when he was only four years old and was privileged to be raised by an aunt whose physical presence juxtaposed with his dead mother’s spiritual presence, and this influenced his concept of creative fidelity.  He worked for the Red Cross during the First World War. This experience shaped his view of human relationship and confirmed a religious conviction by which he was converted to Catholicism in 1929.3  Marcel regretted the agnosticism of his father who was brought up as a Catholic, and had ceased practicing his religion at an early age and had taken the position of the late nineteenth century agnostics.4  Raised therefore in a home dominated by the cultural agnosticism of his father and the liberal Moralistic Protestantism of his aunt, Gabriel saw and confirmed that he was not living an authentic life.  Not minding his delicate health situation, he endured  unhappy and lonely home life.  It is therefore not surprising the emphasis on “the other” and the desire and need of Love, Friendship and Fidelity in him as a life-long quest.</p> <p>Lescoe, quoting Marcel, recounts how he (Marcel) had observed to him, </p> <p>Nothing is lost for a man – I am convinced of this and firmly believe it, if he experiences a great love or a true friendship: But everything is lost for the one who is alone.5  </p> <p>The nostalgic memories of the past preceded his relational philosophy of commitment, the I-Thou. He insisted that to be genuine in our interpersonal relationship we must be totally and unreservedly available to the other.6  He left behind a plethora of works among which are: Being and Having 1965, creative fidelity 1964, the mystery-of Being, reflection and mystery, the philosophy of existentialism, 1968 and many dramatic works.</p> <p>As a matter of fact, he provides us with a full and undespairing zeal in participating in the world with the interest of the other at heart.  He therefore, summons people to be available (disponibilite) a stance best manifested in absolute fidelity or commitment to a “thou”.</p> <p>In his work, we understand the fact that he is a personal thinker in the sense that he reflects on the personal experiences he had and which was very special to him. Those experiences formed the nucleus of his philosophical discourse on this “I – Thou” relationship. As a philosopher of his time, he reflects on experiences such as love, hope, presence and fidelity.   According to Copleston:</p> <p>This reflections of him do not take the form of exposing “results,” they are rather a series of explorations of various themes.7  </p> <p>He distinguishes two modes of thoughts, primary and secondary reflection.  On the primary reflection, objectification and idea of problem “go together”: Here we have a problem – solving thinking that aims at knowledge which is universal, abstract and verifiable, excluding thereby the personal, the particular and the contingent aspect of thoughts as being irrelevant to its purposes.  As such, it involves only a partial relation between the thinker and his object.  Marcel’s second reflection is not concerned with a “problem” but with a mystery.  The second reflection therefore, and the notion of “mystery go together”.8  It is such that seeks a wider and richer understanding of the meaning of human existence by a return to the unity of experiences within which the mystery of being is apprehended.  Primary reflection exemplifies itself in objectification, the problematic I-it relationship, which reduces a person to mere object.  While secondary reflection entails participation, the mysterious and I-Thou relationship-the level and realm, which illuminate authentic human existence.</p> <p>Above all, the basis of Marcel’s thought and ‘being’ cannot be an “I am” rather “we are.”9  Obviously, there cannot be a systematized summary of Marcel’s thought which can convey a wholesome spirit of him</p> <div><br/><div> <p>1 J.

In other words, the individuals are prior to the state, and the state cannot exit outside the individuals. Hence, the individuals and the state are dialectically related. Again Nigeria as a state has a dialectical relationship with the citizens. To this end, any policy in Nigeria, for instance be it economics, social or political policies made by those who pilot the affairs of the state ought to be directed towards insuring the satisfaction of the needs of the individuals or the citizens. The constant tension between the sate in Nigeria and her citizens is often brought about by inability of the state to live up to such essential responsibilities towards the individuals. The consequence of such neglect in Nigeria is better experienced than described.</p> <p></p> <p>As to avoid such unfortunate clashes, this study aims at examining the place which Aristotle gives to the individuals in the state as a means of surveying Nigeria situation. Furthermore, it aims at bringing to lime light the dividends of Aristotle’s citizenship in his political philosophy. For the subsequent application to Nigerian social, political and economic situations. </p> <p></p> <p>And by implication the study aims at finding a lasting solution to the age-long and staggering Nigerian problem being manifested in unemployment, bribery and corruption economic crisis injustice, violation of human rights among others</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2            </b><b>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The inability of man to satisfy his countless needs compels him to seek the services of other individuals, hence the origin of the state. Here a state as we have pointed out earlier, exist for the preservation, protection and satisfaction of individual’s needs and for his assimilation.</p> <p></p> <p>Unfortunately, in Nigeria today just in Athens at the time of Aristotle, the individuals at the corridors of power have lost sight of the aim for which the state is established. The crux of the matter is that the state seems pitched against the individuals in Nigeria. Sadly enough, this negligence has given rise to a lot of problems. These problems include: injustice, marginalization, economic crises, inadequate social infrastructures, exploitation, bribery and corruption, incessant violation of human rights, selfish leadership, election malpractice, gansterism, sqandermania mentality, labour strikes, to mention but a few. Furthermore, workers are not paid their salaries as and when due. There are inaccessible roads all over the nation. This has resulted in the loss of many lives of the individuals through road accidents. The education system is grossly in a dilapidated state. The university lecturers, primary and post-primary school teachers often embark on strikes due to poor condition of workers and poor enumeration. Nigerians suffer economic hardship resulting from the constant increase in the pump prince of petroleum products. Some political leaders do not have proper sense of patriotism. They often make policies that favour egoistic interest at the detriment of the poor and the powerless. This situation calls for an urgent attention, as well for enduring solutions that would salvage Nigerian form the above socio-political predicaments.</p> <p></p> <p>It is against this backdrop that we delve exposing first of all the Aristotle’s notion of “individual” and “state”. Our intention is to present Aristotle’s views as a paradigm to the problem of Nigeria.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3            </b><b>THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Our concentration in this work dwells specifically on Aristotle’s notion of the individual and the state, and the relation the individual has with the state.</p> <p></p> <p>With genuine humanity, we do not intend to present an exhaustive work or study on the socio-political concepts. This study is specifically limited to the Aristotle’s teachings or views of these concepts as they appear r contained in this politic.</p> <p></p> <p>The above being the case, this study is but a stepping-stone towards more wholistic uncovering of the greatness that lies hidden in Aristotle’s socio-political philosophy. In this regard, effort will be made in this work to abstract some relevant truths from Aristotle’s political teachings and apply them as possible solutions to the heart-rending, protracted and precarious Nigerian socio-political and economic predicaments.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4            </b><b>METHODOLOGY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The methods to be used are both expository and evaluative. The study will first explore the background and the environment that helped Aristotle to nurture his socio-political philosophy. Then we shall give a thorough expository explanation of the concepts of the individual and the state as articulated by Aristotle in his political philosophy. Finally, the study will be critical evaluation bring to limelight both the positive and practicable dividends accruing from Aristotle’s notion of the individual and the state.</p> <p></p> <p>In general, the work is divided into five chapters. Chapter one offers a synoptic view of the entire work. And the political environment, that is the background of Aristotle’s social-political philosophy. The chapter two is the literature review. In chapter three, we shall dwell on Aristotle’s notion of the individual and the state, including the relationship existing between the individual and state. The fourth chapter is meant to expose the extent of promotion it of human Rights in Nigeria, in the light of Aristotle’s notion of the individual and the state. Here the fundamental human rights will be discussed under economic right, political rights and social rights. And we shall also point out where the human rights are violated. Finally, the chapter five serves as the critical evaluation and conclusion of the work.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5            </b><b>ARISTOTLE’S BACKGROUND</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>It was K.C. Anyanwu who states that “the understanding of the mindset of people leads to the understanding of their behaviour”1. Therefore, for us to understand Aristotle’s political philosophy in general and his notion individual and state in particular, an exposition of the environment in which he lived and had his experiences becomes imperative. This is because “facts have no meaning except within a system of reference”2. Consequently, as depicted in the dialectics of background and foreground by Gadamer: There is no open discourse without hidden presupposition. No explicit statement without an implicit. There is no reflection except against a background of the unreflected3. In the light of the above, we shall discuss in this the nature, life work and characteristics of Aristotle’s environment. </p> <p></p> <p>It was this that let to the postulation of his political philosophy, which anchors on his notion of the individual and the state. K.C. Anyanwu gives credence to this fact when he sates: “Human beings are the products of culture, that is to say that culture has made people what they are or almost what they are. Culture cannot be separated from human experience”4</p> <p></p> <p>Aristotle was born in 384 BC at Stageria in Thrace, and was the son of the Nicomachus, a physician of the Macedonian king, Amyntak II when he was about seventeen years old; Aristotle went to Athens for purpose of study and became a member of the Academy in 368BC. Where for over twenty years, he was in constant intercourse with Plato until latter’s death in 348BC.</p> <p></p> <p>It will be very pertinent to note here that Aristotle’s master (Plato) influenced his life. As we know that his father was a physician but he developed interest also in politics because of his studies at Athens, following the experiences of his master in Athens within his life span. These could be categorized into two aspects, namely: the Athenian socio-political crisis and its most outstanding resultant effect, the oppression of the individual.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5.1    </b><b>THE ATHENIAN SOCIO-POLITICAL CRISIS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The Athenian city-state like every other nation of the world, suffered lots of political crisis in her historical and political development. There was indeed a pronounced political instability then in Athens. Within the thirty years of Periclean democracy, Athens was booming in all aspects of its life, especially in commerce and (or economic) and social life. Unfortunately the political peace, social and economic advancement associated with the Periclaen democracy did not last. The glory was in fact, short-lived. The glory was short-lived. The city-state of Sparta, a neighbouring Greek state, out of sheer jealousy and covetousness for Athenian wealth, state and power, declared war (a war that lasted twenty-seven years) against Athens…5 When the war ended in 404 BC, Athens was subsequently defeated. This defeat was not only a disaster but also a turning point for the Athenian social, political and economic peace. Historically, this defeat of Athens marked the end of the only democracy existing in the ancient world.</p> <p></p> <p>At the end of the war, a thirty-man commission was set up to draft new constitution for Athens. The members of the commission were also given the mandate to govern Athens until the completion of their assignment. In practice, the reign of the thirty men was harsh on the people of Athens. They were ready to act on the belief that it is natural and sensible to exploit the weak. These thirty men seized the opportunity to settle old political scores, to oppress and suppress the individual citizens.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5.2    </b><b>OPPRESSION OF THE INDIVIDUAL</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The Athenian city-state was arranged in such a way the inhabitants were classified into different groups and privileges as well. The system provided some possibilities or avenues from marginalization. The citizens were grouped into three social-political classes namely: the freeborn (indigenous citizens) the resident foreigners and the slave. The members of the first class were the only citizens entitled to take part in social and political affairs of Athens.</p> <p></p> <p>They attended town meetings: they were eligible to arrange of public offices. They also participated in public debates and election. This class was a privilege attained by birth.6 The second group was made up of none indigenous citizens, that is the residential foreign individuals. They had no part in political affairs of the city-state. The slaves occupied the third group. The slaves were used for domestic, military and industrial purpose. The fact that there were slavery and slaves in Athens points to the fact that some human elements were marginalized and kept under subjugation and oppression by the wealthy and free citizens.</p> <p></p> <p>Hence, it could be stated that the political instability, marginalization, intimidation, an oppression of the individuals in Athens led Aristotle unto the postulation of an ideal state where he envisaged justice, peace, harmony and fair play would reign supreme.</p> <p></p> <p><b>REFERENCES</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.                 </b>K.C.

And why things will remain the same despite the occurrence of change?  This central question provoked many others, thus how can one and the same entity turn into that which it previously was not? If everything changes all the time, could there actually be any permanence, real, unchanging feature of the universe? And if reality were actually unchanging and unchangeable, how could it have any thing to do with the apparent world of change and how could it explain the world of change.</p> <p>Commenting on this, Egbeke Aja states that,</p> <p></p> <p>As early philosophers explored these problems, it seemed to them that change and permanence were incompatible, and that reality had to be one or the other, either ever changing or completely permanent.9</p> <p></p> <p>This originated because of the conflict between our sense perception and that made by the intellect.  The intellect sees reality as one while the senses grasp reality as many and always in flux.  But how can we reconcile this apparent contradiction between our sense perception of reality and that given by our intellect?</p> <p></p> <p>In all, two basic problems could be deduced from this topic, namely</p> <p>1.                 Must we take seriously both multiplicity and the oneness of being or can we affirm one aspect and dissolve the other as mere appearance, illusion, or projection of the mind?</p> <p>2.                 If we take both aspects seriously, how are they co-possible? What kind of unity is involved? How can the unity and diversity be harmonized?</p> <p></p> <p>Confronted with this philosophical problem of change, Aristotle posited his doctrine of act and potency, Hylemorphism and categories as a solution.  Thus, these doctrines arose as an attempt by Aristotle to provide a lasting solution to the problem of change and permanence, which had challenged philosophy for a century and a half.  But did he actually succeed? This is actually the problem that motivated this research. </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3            </b><b>   PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>It is the answer to these arrays of thought provoking questions that this paper is geared to find.  It is the search for the most fundamental truth about this world.  Truth about reality never completely manifests itself at an instance but through a process of gradual unfolding.  This paper inquires into the origin of the problem of change and permanence, and then will investigate the views offered by two great philosophers of timeless repute, Heraclitus and Parmenides. Further, it studies in a more detailed manner the solutions offered by one of the greatest genius, Aristotle.  Lastly, the tremendous impact of his thought on practical life will be viewed.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4            </b><b>   SCOPE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Cognizance of Aristotle’s vast contribution and discussion in philosophy, the scope of this study is based on his mediation on the problem of change and permanence.  His key concept to this realization is the unification of the Parmenidean and Heraclitean positions.  His notion of Act and potency, Hylemorphism and categories should be highlighted though in relation to Parmenides and Heraclitus’ perspectives.  To make the study scholarly and easy to comprehend, the nature of change and permanence are to be discussed.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5            </b><b>    METHODOLOGY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The work is expository and analytic. Heraclitus’ and Parmenides’ concept of change and permanence shall be exposed with their views and reasons.  Then, in the light of these expositions, the notion of change and permanence in Aristotle’s perspective shall be analyzed.  In approaching this topic for a better apprehension, it is divided into four chapters.  Chapter one explicates the background, aim, scope, problem and method of the study.  In chapter two, the concepts of change and permanence, which will focus simply on the etymological derivation of the two terms and on their elucidation and explication, will be discussed.  The historical perspective of Parmenides and Heraclitus who were extremists in their treatment of the subjects of change and permanence will be viewed in the same chapter.  Chapter three deals with Aristotle’s mediation between the two positions with his doctrine of Act and Potency, matter and form (Hylemorphism), and substantial and accidental change (Categories).  In chapter four, the whole exposition will be evaluated which will also touch on the influence the resourcefulness of Aristotle’s philosophical mind had on the practical life.  This will be followed by a general conclusion</p> <div><br/><div> <p>1 Aristotle, <i>“Metaphysics</i>”, in J., Barnes, (tr.), <i>The complete works of Aristotle</i>, vol.2, (U.S.A: Princeton press, 1985), p. 1552.  </p> </div> <div> <p>2 R.H., Popkin, <i>Philosophy made simple,</i> (London: Heinemann, 1993), 100. </p> </div> <div> <p>3 E., Mullin, “Matter”, in <i>New Catholic Encyclopedia</i>, vol.9, (New York: McGraw-hill Books, 1967), p. 475.</p> </div> <div> <p>4 “Change”, in P.

All the philosophical epochs have tried in diverse ways without success, to expound a wholesome review of this question. According to L. Okika, he stated that, </p> <p>The initial difficulty about being or reality is that, it is so very obvious, so that it is preternaturally easy to overlook; and yet at the same time, we find that if we try to construct a strictly logical argument to demonstrate what being is, we cannot do so[1].<i></i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p></p> <p>It is never a doubt that, history of philosophy is a history of problem; hence the question of being is never a new question. Though the problem of being is as old as time, it has continued to arouse the curiosity of many philosophers. The question of being remained unsolved because, it has no logical status or possesses a logical status so reduced that it cannot be what it appears to be, consequently, it has no logical status.</p> <p>          Some philosophers of different epochs came up with the aim of providing a permanent solution to this problem. Prominent among are Parmenides, Heraclitus, Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas et cetara. Parmenides declared that 'what is, is' and 'what is not, is not’ in relation to being, so also other philosophers continued to explore and expose this question of being.</p> <p>          Etymologically, being has a Latin and Greek derivative ‘Ens and ‘ons’ meaning; ‘which is’ and ‘that which exists’ respectively. Due to the fact that being lacks univocal definition, it could only be described, hence different philosophers have their views about being. For instance, Thomas Aquinas and Martin Heidegger gave their own definition of being. Thomas Aquinas defined it as, “that whose act is to be”[2] But for Heidegger, “Being is the most universal and the emptiest of all concepts. As such, it resists every attempt at definition”[3]</p> <p>          We are here concerned primarily with the question of being in the existentialist philosophy of Jean Paul Sartre. The question of being proved problematic for Sartre like every other philosopher. In his utmost desire to locate and situate being, he came in contact with existence hence he writes:</p> <p>…Usually existence hides himself. It is there around us, it is in us, you cannot say a couple of words without speaking of it but finally you cannot touch it<i>.</i><i><b>[4]</b></i> </p> <p></p> <p>Sartre after locating the question of existence began fully to treat the problem of being. He categorizes existence into two major kinds of being namely; Being-in- itself (L’etre-en-soi) and Being-for-itself (L’etre-pour-soi). In his major philosophical text<i>, Being and Nothingness</i>, being-in-itself is one of the key concepts. However, it may not be surprising that most of this work is devoted to being-in-itself, for according to Sartre, being-in-itself is opaque, massive, self identical and of this existence, there is little that can be said about it. Moreover, Sartre being an existentialist is primarily concerned with the beingness of man or as he prefers to put it, “the human reality”. </p> <p></p> <p>1.1.1  BEING-IN-ITSELF (L’ETRE EN SOI)</p> <p>    Being-in-itself stands non-conscious things, which can be said to have essence, which exist independent of any observer and which constitutes all the things in the world. Being-in-itself is dense, massive and full. It harbours no nothingness and signifies all the objects around man. It is impermeable and dense, silent and dead. From it and in it comes no meaning. </p> <p>          This being-in-itself, Sartre tells us, is simply there. “It is without reason, without cause and without necessity”[5]. All hopes that are behind their appearance must be an essence, a “Ding un sich” (thing-in-itself) or any other vehicle of meaning is futile. Being-in-itself has no “Within’ which is opposed to a “without” and which is analogous to a judgement, a law, a consciousness of itself. Hence, this mode of being in all its entirely is absurd. Regarding this Copleston writes:</p> <p>If we think away all that is due to the activity of consciousness in making the world appear, we are left with being-in-itself, (L’en-soi, the in-itself), opaque, massive, undifferentiated, the Nebulous background as it were, out of which the world is made to appear[6].</p> <p>          </p> <p>       Sartre maintains that, this being-in-itself is only illuminated in the light of non-being. Being-in-itself is therefore, without consciousness and to this extent, is obviously not free, since, freedom is an attribute of only conscious being. All objects in this state of being have exhausted all their potentialities and are left only in the state of actualities. They have nothing secret and are solid. The in-itself is immovable, dead and cannot move in itself unless a conscious being moves it. It is ultimately there and is an isolated being which is not conscious of its existence. Sartre in describing the origin of this mode of being writes:</p> <p>…questions on the origin of being or on the origin of the world are either devoid of meaning or receive a reply within the actual province of ontology.[7]</p> <p> </p> <p>Some good example of being-in-itself includes: stones, blocks, cloths, desk etc. In itself, it exist, it simply is and is thus, in no need of any compliment. It is uncreated and is without any relation to another being. This mode of being is opaque to itself precisely because, it is filled with itself. </p> <p>The in-itself is full of itself, and no more total plenitude can be imagined, no more perfect equivalence of content to container. There is not the slightest emptiness in being, not the tiniest crack through which nothingness might slip in.[8]</p> <p></p> <p>Being-in-itself is completely different from being-for- itself; it is simply put, a world of objects that are simply what they are. Being-in-itself is solid and at the same time, permanence. It is these qualities that make it the extreme opposite of the for-itself. The qualities of the in-itself are mute, shapeless but all the same, they possess such a great density, which even threaten to overtake and overpower the for-itself. They exist in themselves independent of any conscious spontaneity. Using a white sheet of paper, Sartre illustrates that which presents itself to consciousness. </p> <p>One thing is certain, and that is, that white sheet, I observe cannot be the product of my spontaneity. The inert form, which is beyond all conscious spontaneities and which must be observed and gradually learned is what is called a ‘thing’.[9] </p> <p>To this extent then, it is no overstatement to conclude that, Being-in-itself is a world of existing things, which actually has no reason to exist, since Sartre denied the existence of God. In the absence of God, everything just exist without even any rational foundation, origin and meaning. According to Sartre in his Nausea, “Every existing thing is born without reason, prolongs  itself but of weakness and dies by chance.”[10]</p> <p>    These words contain the basic themes of Sartre: existing is absurd, in that it can neither be explained nor justified; that existing itself is problematic, and bad faith, and that death too is absurd and wholly beyond anticipation and preparation. Regis Jolivet, <i>in Sartre ,The theology of the Absurd, </i>paints a striking picture of the term in-itself. He writes:</p> <p>The in itself, the specific revelation of nausea, is being itself: massive, opaque, gloomy and glutinous. We can say nothing about it except that it is, for it is devoid of any relationship either interior or exterior. It is so helpless that it cannot stop itself from being. Where does the in-itself or being come about? From no place, from nothing. It is without reason, unjustifiable absurd, too much for all eternity. It is and it proliferates itself horribly obscenely. Any attempt to explain it is fruitless. First of all, God does not exist being is self-contradictory. Moreover, the very idea of creation is meaningless.”[11]</p> <p></p> <p>1.1.2  BEING-FOR-ITSELF</p> <p>This is the being of consciousness, capable of thinking for itself. Making decisions and accordingly, choosing between alternatives. This consciousness differentiates it from other thing, the in-itself. We shall consider being-for-itself under two categories: first as consciousness of an object and secondly, being-for-itself as nothingness. Considering the being-for-itself as consciousness, we have to acknowledge the fact that, it is forever incomplete (openness), fluid, vacuous and lacking in determinate structure; what he is now is neither what he was in the past nor what he will be in future. It is at this level that it corresponds to the being of human consciousness. Thus, being-for-itself is equivalent to consciousness. Here, it should not be forgotten that Sartre was very much influenced by Husserl’s concept of intentionality, according to which consciousness is always consciousness of something.</p> <p>          This means that, “there is no consciousness which is not the position of a transcendental object or if one prefers, that consciousness has no content”12. Suppose for instance, I am aware of this table, the table is not in my window, or near a window, or near the door or wherever it may be. And when I intent it, I posit it as transcending and not as immanent in conscience. One is not wrong them to say that, there is no consciousness without affirming the existence of an object, which exists beyond and transcends it. Commenting on this, Stumpf has this to say:</p> <p>Without consciousness, the world simply is, it is being-in-itself (L’etre-en-soi) and as such, it is without meaning of things in the world, though it does not constitute their being13</p> <p></p> <p>It must be recalled that in Heidegger’s search for fusion with being, consciousness lost its central position, but in Sartre, this central position, consciousness was regained. Thus, Sartre realizes very clearly that consciousness is possessed only by the pour-soi (man). For him, man is not-something. He is not an already made being and his course is not predetermined;</p> <p>…Man is condemned to be free by his choices, man makes himself not that he creates himself out of nothing but rather, by a series of choices and decisions. He converts his existence into the essence of his final self14<i>.</i></p> <p> </p> <p>The for-itself is an extreme opposite of the in-itself. This was illustrated in philosophical work of Mary Warnock where she stated that, being-for-itself brings nothing into the world both in the sense of emptiness and in the sense of negation; Being-for-itself is aware that, it does not have pure concrete existence. The pour-soi (man) is like an empty shell but, through his choices in his life, he fills this shell. Sartre quite agrees that, all consciousness is always consciousness of something but unlike all other beings this consciousness is embodied and concretized in man. To this extent then, he is related to the world of things and people in variety of ways. At one level, man is consciousness of the world, which is everything that is beyond or other than himself and which therefore, transcends him. At this level, the world is experienced simply as solid, massive and undifferentiated, single something that is not yet separated into individual things. Here, consciousness shifts a person from simply being there, being-in-itself to being-for-itself where consciousness dramatically differentiates the object of the world from the conscious self as subject. This brings us to the question of consciousness and its twofold activities. Stumpf has this to say about the twofold activity of consciousness:</p> <p>…First consciousness defines the specific things in the world and invest them with meaning. Second, consciousness transcends, that is, puts a distance between itself and objects and in that way, possesses a freedom from those objects.15</p> <p></p> <p>Because the conscious self has this freedom from the things in the world, it is within the power of consciousness to confer different or alternative meaning on things. The activity of consciousness is what is usually called choice.</p> <p>          Being-for-itself in its aspect of nothingness can be perfectly defined as, “being what it is not and not being what it is”.16 Sartre explains that man is not what he is in as much as he is not now what his past has been. At the same time man is what he is not since he is not as yet the undetermined future which he will become in terms of the choice he makes.</p> <p>            Sartre admits that consciousness is always a consciousness of something, something that is extremely different from the conscious object, hence consciousness is always used to denote a separation from, a distance from, and above all, a negation of its object</p> <p>Sartre attempts to demonstrate… that consci-ousness is non-substantial or nothingness. Nothingness not in the sense of not being anything but a nihilating activity. As nothingness, it is separated from the object by not being the object and preserves a distance from it17</p> <p>          </p> <p> 1.1.3          BEING-FOR-OTHERS (L’ETRE-POUR-AUTRUI)</p> <p>Generally, being-for-others refers to the inter-human or inter-subjective relationship, the relationship that exists between the for-itself and another for itself. The question is, how do I know that there are other beings in existence except myself? Sartre refashioned the question thus: what is the fundamental relationship that exists between one person and another that led him to posit the question of this being for others? </p> <p>          The certainty of the existence of the other cannot be doubted as Jolivet R. stated that, once one is in the world, he does not only find out that he is conscious of himself but also that there are other people imposing themselves on him which implies relationship. Consequently, this relationship brings about conflict because looking at other, I reduce him to an object. It is this being-for-other that Sartre generally calls inter-subjectivity. For Sartre, the other is ‘‘The one who excludes me by himself, is the one who I exclude by being myself”18, The other is that “self which is not myself, the one which is not me and the other one whom I am not”.19  My apprehension of my own being is so structured that, it presupposes the existence of other conscious beings which is manifested in the feeling of shame. In this, I discover simultaneously the other and the aspect of my being as standing in front of the other, thus I am uncomfortable. The other is obstacle to the fulfilment of my own existence and his arrival brings about the alienation of my existence. The whole look of the other is to expose me in my nakedness and them, empty my whole being into his, that is, terminate my being as subject into an object. I experience my freedom being threatened by another who is about to absorb me into the orbit of his concerns. But for Sartre, I can defend and affirm my freedom in retaliation by rendering the other into an “it”. The other as well can stage a similar counter attack and the cycle simply repeats itself. I can defend, affirm and regain, my consciousness in retaliation by rendering the other an object. For Sartre, conflict is the original meaning and essence of being-for-others. Each seeks to dominate the other as a free being, to possess him both as an object and as a free being.</p> <p>          According to Sartre, there can never be cordial relationship between the other and I. He contends that the impossibility of achieving true love inevitably begets one or other of two extreme attitudes. Either I try to make myself a kind of object in the eyes of the other (masochism) or I try through violence and pain to make the other an instrument and to pulverize his subjectivity for my own pleasure (desire, sadism, hate).</p> <p>          From Sartre’s view then, he calls for a reconsideration of Heidegger’s general account of being together (mit-sein). For Sartre, there can be consciousness of community togetherness, a sense of we, as in the case of pre-reflexive outburst of applause at a concert or at a festival or theatrical performance. But on the love of reflexive consciousness, it is conflict and “to this extent, them, a conflict is the original meaning of being-for-others”20.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] L.

Consequently, it is pertinent first and foremost to look at the life of Aristotle, the influences that motivated him and finally, the product of his philosophical life.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.1     HIS BIOGRAPHY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Aristotle was born in the summer of 384 B.C in the small town of Stagira on the north east coast of Thrace. His father, Nichomachus, was a court physician to Amyntas III king of Macedonia, father of Philip II and grandfather of Alexander the Great. His parents were both Ionians in origin. Aristotle was thus not an Athenian by birth although he lived a greater part of his life and did all his writings in and around Athens</p> <p>Being a son of a doctor, he was heir to scientific tradition. He was thus introduced to Greek medicine and biology at an early age. It was the custom according to Galen, for families in the guild of Asclepiadae to train their sons in the art of dissection. While Aristotle was still a youth, he lost his father. Under the auspices of Proxenus, probably a relative of his father he studied in the platonic academy for twenty years. He was said to have been called by Plato, “the intellect of the school.” He was greatly influenced by Plato’s thought and personality though he was eventually to break away from Plato’s philosophy in order to formulate his own version of certain philosophical problems. The years Aristotle spent in Plato’s academy formed the three main periods comprising his intellectual development. </p> <p></p> <p>On Plato’s death in 348/47 B.C, Aristotle left the academy and accepted the invitation of Hermeias to come to Assos. He gathered a small group of thinkers into his court, and here Aristotle was able for the next three years to write, teach and carry on research. While at Hermeias’ court, Aristotle gave a sentimental collaboration to their tie by marrying Hermeias’ niece and adopted daughter, Pythias, who bore him a daughter. Later when he had returned to Athens, his wife died and Aristotle entered into a relationship with Herpyllis who bore him a son, Nicomachus, after whom the Nicomachean Ethics was named.</p> <p></p> <p>In 343/42 B.C, Philip of Macedon invited Aristotle to become the tutor of his son Alexander who was then thirteen years old. As a tutor to a future ruler, Aristotle’s interests included politics. He was to prepare Alexander for his future role as the military leader of the now United Greek World. Upon Philip’s death, Aristotle’s duty as tutor came to an end as Alexander now ascended the throne. A brief stay in his hometown of Stagira saw him once more in Athens. </p> <p></p> <p>Upon his return in 335/34 B.C in Athens, Aristotle founded his own school, the Lyceum. The school was so organized that it included philosophical discussions, lectures and technicals, for small audiences and others of a more poplar nature for a larger audience. For twelve of thirteen years, Aristotle remained as head of the Lyceum teaching and lecturing and above all, formulating his ideas about the classification of the sciences, fashioning a bold new science of logic and writing his advanced idea in every major area of philosophy.</p> <p></p> <p>When Alexander died in 323 B.C, a wave of anti-Macedonian feeling arose making Aristotle’s position in Athens very precarious because of his close connection with Macedonia. Aristotle was charged with impiety for the elegy he wrote to Hermas twenty years before. Recalling the fate of Socrates, he fled to his mother’s property in Chalcis declaring, “I will not let the Athenians offend twice against philosophy.” He lived in Chalcis for some months and died in 322 B.C of a digestive disease of long standing. His will discloses the care with which he puts his affairs in order. He provided for his wife as she wished. </p> <p>Aristotle’s thought was of such decisive power that it was to influence philosophy for centuries to come. Having gone so far, let us examine certain elements in Aristotle’s eventful life, which might have left their influences on his thought.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2     MAJOR INFLUENCES</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The development of Aristotle’s philosophy was motivated and influenced by a number of individuals and conditions. A look at a few of these influences will help us situate our study in Aristotle.</p> <p></p> <p>Firstly, Aristotle’s father was a doctor and a physician to the king of Macedonia. Little wonder why he so expertly handled his treatise on Biology. It could be said that his interest in Biology and science in general was nurtured in his early childhood. This can be linked to a custom in those days that made it possible for children from certain families to be taught and trained in the art of dissection. Furthermore, the influences on his biological works may have come from other influences:</p> <p>Some of the observations used in Aristotle’s biological works probably came from the Easter Aegean …we might trace his biological interests to the      academy.[1]</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Secondly, the shadows of Socrates and especially Plato lie across his thought. Aristotle accepted in general the ethical positions of Socrates and Plato though his philosophical outlook proved some marked differences. Aristotle was more interested in something else:</p> <p>…he was more interested in the concrete details of the moral life than in the abstract underlying principles, and we have in his Ethics not a description of an ideal community as we have in the Republic of the moral life as it was found in the Greek city states of his own day.[2]</p> <p></p> <p>Again, the long stay at the academy of Plato had a huge influence in Aristotle’s thought. This is most evident in several passages of his work that explicitly reject or defend a platonic thesis. A close look at some of Aristotle’s work shows that he drank deeply from the platonic springs.</p> <p></p> <p>Thirdly, Aristotle’s life was largely devoted to the acquisition and dissemination of scientific knowledge. This may explain his classification of state from the study of a hundred and fifty-eight constitutions. The age in which Aristotle lived was politically unstable and his own life was constantly interrupted by external events. This is surely connected to the stand he maintained and the answers he proffered in his Ethics. A brief look at his Ethics would help us focus more on the aim of our study.</p> <p></p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.3     HIS WORKS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Aristotle’s writings fall into three main periods, the period of his intercourse with Plato, the years of his activity at Assos and Mitylene, and the time of his leadership of the Lyceum.</p> <p></p> <p>By the end of his life, the Lyceum had become a well-established school. Some of Aristotle’s frequent critical discussions of Plato and other Academics may have been written during Aristotle’s years in the Academy. The topics reflect the character of dialectical debates in the Academy.</p> <p></p> <p>There is no specific chronological order of Aristotle’s work .The order in which his works appear in the Greek manuscripts goes back to early editors and commentators. It reflects their view not about the order in which the works were written but the order in which they should be studied.</p> <p>In his first period of literary writings, he adhered closely to Plato, his teacher. To this period belongs:</p> <p>a.     The dialogues of Eudemus, or on the soul, in which he shares Plato’s doctrine of recollection and apprehension of ideas in a state of pre-existence.</p> <p>b.     The Protrepticus (an epistle to Themison) Here he maintains the Platonic doctrine of forms.</p> <p>c.       The Physics</p> <p>d.      De Anima</p> <p></p> <p>In the second period, Aristotle began to diverge from his former Platonic position to adopt a more critical attitude towards the teaching of the Academy. It is the period of criticism or of the growing criticism in regard to Platonism. The works include:</p> <p>a.     The dialogue “On philosophy”: a criticism of some of Plato’s most characteristic theories. For instance the theory of Forms or ideas,</p> <p>b.      The Timaeus</p> <p>c.      The Metaphysics</p> <p>d.      The Eudemian ethics</p> <p>e.       The Politics: deals with the ideal state and criticisms of platonic Republic.</p> <p></p> <p> The third period carries more of his activities in the Lyceum. Here, he appears as the empirical observer and scientist, who is concerned to raise a sure philosophical foundation. Most lectures here represent his published works. The works of this period include:</p> <p></p> <p><b>a.     </b><b>The Logical works</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>                   i.                  The categories</p> <p>                 ii.                  De Interpretatione</p> <p>              iii.                  The prior analysis and posterior Analysis</p> <p>              iv.                  The Topics</p> <p></p> <p><b>b.    </b><b>Works on natural philosophy, Natural science, psychology etc</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>i.                          The Physics</p> <p>ii.                 De Caelo</p> <p>iii.              The Materology</p> <p>iv.              The Histories of Animals </p> <p>v.                 The Problemata</p> <p>vi.              The Parva Naturalia (dealing with subjects like perception, memory, sleep and waking etc.)</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>c.      </b><b>Works on Ethics and Politics</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>i.                           The magna Moralia</p> <p>ii.                 The Nicomachean Ethics</p> <p>iii.              The Politics (collection of constitution of 158 states)</p> <p></p> <p><b>d.    </b><b>Works on Aesthetics, History, and Literature</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>i.                          The Rhetoric</p> <p>ii.                 The Poetics</p> <p></p> <p>All these works may not have been written by Aristotle himself as F. Copleston make us believe, but they may have been initiated by him and done under his supervision.</p> <p></p> <p>Having listed Aristotle’s works, in this long essay, we hope to focus more on his Ethics. Let us briefly see his Ethics.  </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4     ARISTOTLE’S ETHICS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Ethics as defined by William Lillie is,</p> <p>a normative science of the conduct of human beings living in societies- a science which judges this conduct to be right or wrong, to be good or bad, or in some similar way.[3]</p> <p></p> <p>This explains why Aristotle started his ethics by giving an account of rational agents, choice, deliberation and action. Ethics is concerned with the praiseworthy and blameworthy actions and states of character of rational agents; that is why virtues (praiseworthy states) and vices (blameworthy states), come in.</p> <p></p> <p>Aristotle’s ethical theory is said to be mostly contained in three treatises: <i>The Magna Moralia, the Eudemian Ethics and the Nicomachean Ethics. </i>The name Eudemian Ethics was coined from the name Eudemus (a member of the Lyceum) and the name Nicomachean Ethics was coined from Nicomachus (son of Aristotle and Herpyllis).</p> <p></p> <p>Aristotle conceives ‘ethics’ as a part of political science; he treats the Nicomachean Ethics and the politics as parts of a single inquiry .His ethical thought is teleological. No wonder he begins his Nicomachean Ethics with the statement:</p> <p>Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and choice is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the good has rightly been declared to be that which all things aim.[4]</p> <p></p> <p>His ethics in particular seeks to discover the good both for the individual and the community. We see this in his Nicomachean Ethics:</p> <p>For even if the end is the same for a single man and for a state, that of the state seems at all events something greater…for one man, it is finer and more godlike to attain it for a nation or for a city –state.[5]</p> <p></p> <p>In order to discover this good, he begins with an examination of Happiness. Aristotle chooses to start his ethical theory with happiness because in his view, rational agents necessarily choose and deliberate with a view to their ultimate good, which is happiness; it is the end we want for its own sake, and the sake for which we want other things. In what follows, Aristotle tries to find a more definite account of the nature of this ultimate goal of man. </p> <p></p> <p>This study hopes to give a good account of how Aristotle described this ultimate goal and complete end of man. Thus, our next chapter will do justice to “HAPPINESS” carefully parading the views of different philosophers on what happiness is all about. We shall end it with what Aristotle, who is the main concern of this study, has to say about happiness and how it can be attained.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] E.

Its importance in human life is so evident, yet no single human being has been able to give a conclusive explanation of what sex is. No human experience has been able to demystify the hidden meanings of this particular concept. Freud rightly asserts that, “the misunderstanding of sexuality is no intellectual error, nor an accidental ignorance”.[1]</p> <p>On the other hand, sex has exerted many impacts on human life. These impacts of sex in the society can be seen in different human experiences. If we have a detour to the sacred scripture, we can see some of the negative impacts of sex in the human society. Some of these impacts can be seen in the story of Samson and Delilah in the book of Judges 16:17.</p> <p>Another is seen where sex has led to the ruining of the interest of kingdoms as can be seen in the book of Kings Chapter 21 where Jezebel influenced Ahab to give order to the killing of Naboth. Another instance is seen in the story of Herod and Herodias, which led to the beheading of John the Baptist. Matt 14:10.</p> <p>On the other hand, there are many positive impacts of sex as we can see in the story of Abraham and Sarah in the book of Genesis. A positive aspect is also seen in the lives of many families in our contemporary society.  “The highest positive impact of sex in the human society is its place in the continuance of the human race”.[2] When sex is integrated, it makes for maturity and good human relationship.</p> <p>In spite of the positive aspects of sex in human life, its place in our contemporary society has regrettably deteriorated. The reason is not far fetched and can be seen in the misconception of the concept of sex. Majority now see sex as a pleasure-giving thing and as a result, everyone is free to indulge in it at any time he feels.</p> <p>Furthermore, the indiscriminate use of sex has led to the present day proliferation of diseases including the dreaded HIV, which is capable of wiping off the entire universe if precaution is not taken. These negative impacts of sex can also be seen in the anti-natural scientific inventions of many countries ranging from abortion, cloning etc. It has also led to some anti-cultural practices like gay marriage, marital unfaithfulness and pre-marital sex. The different religious denominations of the world also suffer these negative impacts as can be seen in the ordinations of gays as clergymen in the Anglican Church.</p> <p>As a result of the debasement which sex has experienced in the contemporary society, I find it pertinent to advocate for a reasoned thought among all. Just as Plato asserted that “The kind of knowledge that helps one to distinguish between shadows, reflections, and real objects in the visible world is just the kind of knowledge that man needs to discriminate between the shadows and reflections of the genuinely good life,”[3]. I have set out to bring out a reasoned thought on how man can be able to discriminate between the shadows and reflections of sex and what it genuinely entails. </p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.2 PROBLEM OF THE STUDY </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><i>Very deep is the well of the past … </i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p><i>For the deeper we sound, the further down into the lower world of the past we probe and press, the more we find that the earliest foundations of humanity, its history and culture reveal themselves unfathomable</i>. </p> <p>- Thomas Mann </p> <p>The place of sex and its influence on the formation of the psyche of the adult through the developmental processes was what Sigmund Freud (1853 – 1939) set forth to offer to the world in his psychoanalytic theory. However, he did not do that without encountering some problems ranging from over centralization of sex as what constitutes man’s maturity and entire life to many other problems.   </p> <p>Freud’s lack of religious tenets made him justify many anti-natural problems, which he should not have done. For instance, he regarded sexual perversions like homosexuality, fetishism, sadism and masochism as justified though they are abnormal.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This work is intended to be a proper itinerary into Freud’s psychoanalytic theory in order to study his views, analyze them and finally to make a proper criticism of these views.

Anyone who by his nature and not simply by ill-luck has no state is either too bad or too good, either sub-human or super- human[1]</p> <p></p> <p>Thomas Hobbes regards the assumption that man is by nature political animal as false. In his view, man became a political animal only after the institution of the civil society. The period prior to the civil society is what Locke, Rousseau as well as Hobbes called ‘the state of nature’ - the apolitical state of man. In the hypothetical state of nature, there lacks a central and sovereign power. Life in this state is unrest, misery, constant fear, war, and insecurity and is ruled by egoistic law of self- preservation. This is because in this state, all men are equal and equally have the right to whatever they consider necessary for their survival.  On this Hobbes notes:</p> <p></p> <p>The right of nature is the liberty each man hath to use his own power as he will himself… and consequently of doing any thing which in his own judgment and he shall conceive to be the aptest means there unto.[2]</p> <p></p> <p>Equality here means simply that anyone is capable of hunting his weak neighbour and taking what he thinks he needs for his own protection. </p> <p></p> <p>In Hobbes’ state of nature, there exists the survival of the fittest for instance, a physically strong man could overcome the physically weak and take what belongs to the weak, but the weak could by his intelligence gain advantage over the strong by joining forces with those in the same danger with him. Therefore, a lack in one aspect could be compensated with some other thing. We have to note also that the right of all to all that prevails in this state does not mean that one man has a right whereas others have corresponding duties.    The word right in the state of nature is man’s freedom:</p> <p>To do what he would, and against whom he thought fit and to possesses use and enjoy all that he would or could get”. [3]</p> <p>.</p> <p>Hobbes later identified three reasons for the disorder and quarrels: he says </p> <p>In the nature of man, we find three principal causes of quarrel. First is competition, secondly, difference, and thirdly, glory”.<i> <b>[4]</b> </i>Hobbes said that the first makes meaning for gain, the second, for safety, and the third for reputation. Hobbes asserted that before the formation of civil society and sovereignty, men were in continuous state of war with each other. This situation he technically called ‘the threat of war’. And war here does not necessarily imply battle (fighting) but portrays the situation where man lives in continual fear, and insecurity. One sees his neighbour as a threat to his existence and obstruction to his well-being.</p> <p></p> <p>There is no common power ipso facto, no rules, no morality and justice, personal and selfish inclination was the principle that governed all actions. Everyone feels he is entitled to every thing. Ownership is effective only in so far as no stronger person has interrupted. And because man is constantly in want, he tries to eliminate the other. The continuous conflict of desire remains the order of the day.</p> <p> </p> <p>The situation is precisely that of war of all against all. There exist a continual fear and danger of violent death, all individual deciding how best to survive this anarchy and disorder. Hence:</p> <p>“There is no place for industry because the fruit thereof is uncertain; no navigation nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea. No commodious building, no instrument of moving and removing such things as required much force. No account of time, no art, no letters, no society and which is worst of all continual fear and danger of violent death. And the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short”.[5]</p> <p><i></i></p> <p><i> </i></p><i></i> <p>Hobbes held that it was man’s continuous desire for power, honour and fame that result in the disorderliness in the state of nature. Thus he writes;</p> <p>I put for a general inclination of all mankind, a perpetual and restless desire of power after the power, that cease the only in death. And the cause of this, is not always that man hopes for a more intensive delight than he has already attained to, or that he cannot assure the power and means to live well which he hath present without the acquisition of more. And from hence it is, that kings whose power is greatest, turn their endeavour to the assuring it at home by laws or abroad by war”.[6]</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Rousseau, one of the political philosophers held that man is naturally good; but was corrupted by contemporary society of man. He further believed that it was competition and lust for private property that was responsible for this corruption. He equally believes in the essential goodness and sympathetic nature of man. For him, state of nature is of idyllic happiness since man is free being who enjoys equality.</p> <p></p> <p>Locke on his own part has a very optimistic view of the Human nature. For him,</p> <p>The state of nature has a law of nature to govern which obliges every one, and reason, which is that law, teaches all mankind… that being equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty or possessions”.[7]</p> <p></p> <p>Nevertheless, the state of nature as proposed by Hobbes is not a historical fact. Rather it is a situation that obtains in lawless society. The central questions how can man agree to form society since they are according to Hobbes, antisocial, politically and culturally apart. To fight these societal maladies, Hobbes found out what he referred to as natural law (Lex naturals). These laws will urge them to organize themselves into civil society.</p> <p></p> <p><b> 1.2   LAWS IN PRE-POLITIAL SOCIETY (NATURAL LAW)</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Natural law dates from the time of rational creation. It does not vary according to time but remains unchangeable, because it is written in the hearts of all men, right from birth as the scripture held it. Hobbes in his political philosophy saw natural law as:</p> <p>A precept or general rule founded out by reason, by which a man is forbidden to do that which is destructive of his life or taketh away the means of preserving the same, and to omit that which he thniketh it may be best preserved.[8] </p> <p></p> <p>Nature takes the second position after the eternal law as a source of law. There are mainly three sources of law: namely God, Nature and Sovereignty. It is from these that we derive the eternal, natural and civil laws respectively. Naturally, law is a divine will discovered in nature by man through the dictates of reason, while the civil law is the law made in accordance with the rule of nature by one who has the command over others. The natural law, therefore, is the dictates of right reason. Men discovered that they must lay aside the right of nature in order to preserve their lives. None of these laws is man-made rather they are discovered by human reason which already exist from the very nature of individual existence. They are laws which man cannot change or influence, but can only conform and abide by.</p> <p></p> <p>Hobbes described the condition of man before civil society as a state of equality between individual freemen.  Everyman has the right to all things he desired. The condition was described by Hobbes as war of all against all, hence the condition of man becoming wolf to man. It is through nature that each man knows that he has to protect himself.  Everyman quarrels. So the need to protect his natural right of self-preservation that leads men to form a civil society. The laws of nature are those rules that rational man must accept, if he were conscious of his horrible predicament in the state of nature, where men are selfish. To answer the question how men move from the state of nature to form social state, Hobbes deduced nineteen other natural laws from the fundamental right of self- preservation.   Among these laws, deduced by Hobbes, only three of these laws will be discussed here. The first of these laws states that: Everyman ought to endevour peace, as far as he has hope of obtaining it, and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek all helps and advantage of war”.[9]   From the above quotation, we can see that it contains the first and the fundamental law of nature; which is to seek peace and follow it. It also contains the natural right, which we can by all means protect and defend ourselves. </p> <p></p> <p>The second law of nature by which we are urged to endeavour peace, this law states;<i></i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p>That a man be willing, when others are so too, as far forth as for peace and defence of himself he shall think necessary, to lay down this right to all things, and be contended with so much liberty against other men as he would allow other men against himself”.[10]<i></i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p><i></i></p> <p><i> </i></p><i></i> <p>It is from the compromise arising from the second law of nature that made it possible for men to come together and form a social society. This is because if everyman holds his natural right, they return to their former condition, that is, condition before civil society. The second laws also held that man has to lay down his right on the condition that others will do the same because he will make himself prey to others if they refuse to lay down theirs. Right is laid aside, either by simply renouncing it or by transferring it to another. Men are bound not to hinder those they have entrusted their right from exercising them. If they eventually go contrary to that, they have committed injustice or injury. This mutual transferring of right is that which men call “CONTRACT”.</p> <p></p> <p>From that law of nature, by which we are obliged to transfer right to another, such rights as being retained, hinder the peace of mankind, there followeth a third law of nature which is, <i>“that man perform their covenants made.” </i>Without which covenants are in vain but empty words, and the right of all men to all things remaining, we are still in the condition of war. This law of nature constitutes the foundation and origin of justice. To break the covenant made is unjust and the definition of injustice is no other than non-performance of convent. But because covenants is a mutual trust, where there is a fear of non performance, on either part…. are invalid, therefore before the names of just and unjust can have place, there must be some cohesive power to compel men equally to performance of their covenants, by terror of some punishment, greater than the benefit they expect by the breach of their covenant. </p> <p></p> <p>Natural law according to Hobbes binds in conscience, and still maintains that all men have an obligation to obey the natural law in a state of nature. And it is obeying the natural laws that made it possible for the mutual transferring of rights, and man forming political society.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] Aristotle; <i>The Politics</i>, (Great Britain: Penguin Bks.

Numerous scientists, biologists, paleontologists and philosophers have remarkably worked, researched and discovered some useful information that will help us understand the origin and structure of life.</p> <p>Characteristically, these researches and discoveries about origin of life in general and man in particular have been classified into two major circles of understanding, <i>vitalistic</i> and <i>mechanistic</i> views.[2] Some philosophers like Descartes and Gassendi followed this idea <i>mechanistic</i> view and sought to propagate it to posterity.</p> <p>Invariably, this teleological while the former explains life as originating by chance, with no plans and hereunder we have two levels of determination, ‘the <i>evolutionists</i> and the<i> traditionalists that considers life as a cause-effect’</i>. The traditional view takes care of the mythical and legendary account of the origin of life, as contained in the Holy Writ, hence: The Lord formed man of the slime of earth and breathed into his face the breath of life.[3] This approach commanded a greater affection of many scientists and philosophers. Basically in defense of the theory of traditional account of origin of man, Jean Servier eloquently condemned the possibility of scientific evolution, thereby reducing scientific claim of factual basement to a mere mythical claim. Consequently, the criticism led to a mid-way consideration which incorporates the origin of life by direct creation through God’s intervention and the opposite by pure chance or spontaneous generation. This mid-way is known as <i>programmed evolution</i>.</p> <p>Programmed evolution as a theory has become acceptable to many philosophers as well as the scientists, unlike the scientific evolution held <i>formerly</i> which created much polarity between them. Thus, for the philosophers, it entrains ‘that the soul* arises through the action of an intelligent being to give origin to life’.[4]  </p> <p>In addition, Teilhard de Chardin describes him as ‘<i>the arrow-head of evolution</i>’. These evolutionary discoveries are far away from philosophical truth. Nevertheless, Aristotle’s scheme seems to vary under this evolutionary perspective.[5] Since in Aristotle’s schemes, there is no such evolution as in the modern sense, <i>scientific temporal evolution</i>, though he may have developed an <i>ideal evolution</i>.[6] </p> <p>Finally, we must note therefore, that the problem concerning the origin of man is yet unsolved, since evolutionary theory cannot satisfy philosophical curiosity, even the claim of an evolution of a reflective consciousness by Teilhard[7].</p> <p><b>1.2     The Background of Study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>No doubt at all that there were so many views about what constitute the essence of man, but all did agree in the first place that such essence exists, that is to say that there is something by virtue of which man is man and so are all other beings in nature before Aristotle, and at its climax after him, having succeeded in arousing interest. The traces of this devotion in philosophy are identifiable in the ancient and classical, Middle Ages and enlightenment philosophers culminating in Kant and then those of the contemporary era. The pre-Socratics to begin with, were mainly cosmologists who reduced all that is to material existence and origin. Pythagoras introduced <i>form</i> and not only that, he brought forward the idea of form limiting the matter which is boundless. For him, balance or equilibrium is achieved through the imposition of form over matter.[8]</p> <p>According to Enoch Stumpf, Anaxagoras in addition brought forward, the phenomenon of ‘<i>nous’</i> (the mind as that responsible for the actualization of matter by form, thus he maintains that <i>the nature of reality is best understood as consisting mind and matter</i>.[9] Accordingly, Aristotle later expressed a double evaluation of his views.</p> <p>Furthermore, the materialists came to fore, exalting the material existence of all things. Socrates in contrast emerged as a spiritualist in defense of the soul and Plato asserted man as this soul, separating apart the two worlds of reality and ideas, hence the emergence of his dualism as the case may be. However, this psychological dualism was inherited by the immediate successor, Aristotle, who sought to reconcile them. Thus, the problem of balance and relation between matter and form (body and soul) is seen scattered all over his fragments.                                                                                                                  For instance, the whole of his ethical, political, metaphysical treatises as well as his scientific writings incidentally bear some elements of this problem of his major concern. Biologically, Aristotle proceeded with the analysis of nature. According to him the term, ‘<i>phusis’</i>, means <i>essence or form</i> in general.[10] Nature means for him ‘a formed or active principle of movement and rest in corporeal reality’.[11] The Physics BK II of Aristotle was strictly dedicated to the explanation, justification and above all the articulation of the notion of nature as ‘an intrinsic principle of movement’[12].  Considerably, to act intelligently is to act in accordance with rational nature, while to act instinctively is to act in congruence with the animal nature.</p> <p>In the first book of <i>De Anima</i>, Aristotle speaks of the soul as <i>the entelechy</i> or act of the body that possesses life in potency.  In the same manner and within history of psychology appropriate to the dichotomized notions of philosophers on the soul, he observes thus:</p> <p>… the most far-reaching difference is that between the philosopher who regard the elements as corporeal and those who regard them as incorporeal.[13]</p> <p>In a bid to reconcile them Aristotle portrayed soul as the actuality of the body which cannot be distinguished from it, though some parts are separable for him, since they are precisely not the realizations of the body.  </p> <p><b>     1.3      The Definition of Man</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p>Having seen previously the stand, which Aristotle takes on man, as a different nature among other nature, can we now at this point try some sense of definition? Generally, the question should be what is man, (Was ist der mensch), but in Aristotelian concept of man, it goes thus: who is man, (was ist der mensch). However, this question is not only onerous to man but also most rancorous to him, since he evades approaching it. Inadvertently, ‘man is a being so vast, so could, so multiform, that every definition demonstrates itself as too limited. Man’s aspects are too numerous’16.</p> <p></p> <p>Also, Martin Heidegger has the opinion that man cannot be defined until death. Therefore, it is only in death that one can define man from his own perspectives. On the contrary, we can only accept their propositions on the ground of the <i>utopic </i>nature of man, as the humanity in Aristotle. Thus, the idea of Bloch’s ‘<i>utopic being’</i> (utopischer Raum) stands supreme. But this is not the case even Mondin’s claim that man is <i>a kind of prodigy that combines within himself apparent antitheses: a fallen unrealizable, divinity, unsuccessful absolute value etc…17 </i>Hence, he mutually concluded the part of his own jolt by a two word definition of man as an <i>impossible possibility</i>. Actually, A.J. Heschel observed this in his book, ‘<i>Who is Man’</i>, when he writes that man portrays: </p> <p>a conscious desire in man to be animal ‘natural in the experience of carnality or even to identify himself as animal in destiny or essence.</p> <p>Considerably, the definitions of man since Aristotle bear the vestigial traces of this truth of ‘animality’ in man calling for recognition. The real predicament in man springs up and as well becomes intensified by the attention of man to understand the human ideal of reason as man’s ‘human’ nature, instead of accomplishing the real natural level of animality in his experience of the world so far, not neglecting the passions in man. The most ridiculous drama going on in man’s unconsciousness is his abhorrence of his authentic existence in evasion towards the definition of his nature which he projects in the explanation of other beings other than himself. Thus he denigrates them in an anthropomorphic greed, to be of lower strata to himself.</p> <p>Whenever man is seen analyzing other beings, it is just a projection of greed. Unless this consideration is taken, man continues to remain an animal, a project and a mystery. Man has no perfect knowledge of himself.</p> <p><b>1.4              Aristotle vis-à-vis Some Philosophers</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Some schools of thought view man as a mere spiritual singularity, while others view man as somewhat a material body. And thirdly, those at the mid-way have no acceptable explanation. Aristotle belongs to this last group, as he attempted the reconciliation of the two through his metaphysical theory of ‘<i>hylemorphism</i>’. Thus for him, man is a substantial union of body (matter) and soul (form). But he couldn’t balance the equation in the relation between passion and reason. Hence, reason predominates, as it controls man in all his actions<i>.18</i>                                                                                                                   Thanks to the scholastics who inherited this Aristotelianism, especially Thomas Aquinas who presents man as a man by the actuality of spirituality, existing form that informs an organic body and makes it a human body.19Thomas Aquinas unearthed and developed this “mutual affinity” between body and soul as that co-opting for the natural repugnance to death. Man, for Aristotle, then is not only a rational subsistence but also: an ‘unam’ per se, composed of essence, and ‘to be’ of body and soul, of substance and accident.20                                                                                                                                    In the modern era, Rene Descartes believed strongly that he can be more certain of himself as a “thinking thing” than as a body. This understanding of man as an automata or mechanism creates sharp dichotomy in his ‘cogito ergo sum’, between mind which can outlive the bodily extension. Leibnitz followed this pattern of thought.         </p> <p>The contemporary thinkers conversely hold against this metaphysical parallelism of the exaggerated dualism. Hence Marxists proffered their <i>‘dialectical materialism’</i> as in defense of the body. Hence, the body contrary to Aristotle’s view becomes the ‘<i>elan vitale’</i>, instead of the spirit, which now is turned into a product of the creative body and its instrument. Thus, man was rated a brute animal. The existentialists, among whom Sartre is a chief exponent confirmed this materialistic outlook on man and upturned man’s centre of gravity to his body. For him, it is the body <i>that gives man his individual species to be what it is.21</i> He is Aristotle’s most drastic opponent. He defined man as ontologically pure spiritual being. Sartre remarks thus: The concept of man is spirit and no one ought to allow himself to be deceived by the fact that he can also walk on two legs.22</p> <p>It is categorically clear that the consciousness he projects is not the same kind with Aristotle’s. Human body is only ‘an encumbrance and ballast for man’s spirit’. Man for him is anguished by the body limits. Also, in the contemporary era thinkers who are exaggerated realists, like L. Klages, maintain that man is made up two substances, spiritual and corporeal but the elements are always at war with each other portraying the spirit as the enemy of biological and psychosomatic life. Thus he asserts more seriously that:</p> <p>spirit benumbs life which is essentially becoming and moving, thus two powers are in mutual conflict here which were originally similar and this conflict is not merely factual but inevitable. And yet both of them are supposed to build up the person, the personal ego, which is the carrier of the spirit and life.23</p> <p></p> <p>In line still, Freud is one of the greatest theoretician on man, who with some psychological bent envisaged the conflicting existence in man, thereby defining man as a component of two instincts: death and life instincts. With all these views above, we can easily see with Soren Kierkegaard that the human being which Aristotle structures becomes one which would be formed fully from disagreement, clash or dissension. The question now could be: between the body and the soul, which is so antithetically opposed to the other and which excludes the other to be united, in order to form the personal self. Moreover, the contemporary opinion of the present day thinkers against exaggerated dualism is that both are phenomenal forms of an unknown</p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] B.

Joseph Omoregbe aptly captures this idea when he says that no one can rightly claim to be independent of the society, because no man is an island. To buttress these points, Aristotle maintained that:  “he who is unable to live in a society or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god.”[1]</p> <p></p> <p>This is to say that man is a social being by nature. Thus, man identifies and associates with his fellow man and the society in which he lives. More so, man as a member of the human society has been endowed with some fundamental human rights.  Hence, it is the duty of justice to get their rights protected and ensure a peaceful co-existence of man in the society he lives.</p> <p></p> <p>Justice is something essential to a society, for right is both the basis of the political association and the criterion for deciding what is just. This is because where justice fails to reign, man will face the difficulties in life; he cannot again attain the goal of life.  The rich gets richer while the poor gets poorer, power becomes might; and there will be a survival of the fittest.  These above facts however, are evident in the case of Nigeria.  Our polity is devoid of justice, and as a result, we are living in a corrupt and unjust society.  Those at the corridors of power have completely lost the sense of justice in piloting the affairs of the public. They pursue their selfish interest and make conflicting claims on public resources, which most often lead to economic hardship and violation of human rights.  This situation therefore, calls for an urgent and lasting solution which could definitely assist in the restoration of justice into Nigerian democratic government.</p> <p></p> <p>As it could be noticed right from the ancient era, philosophers and social theorists equally uphold this view that justice is a virtue, which is pertinent or dialectically related to moral conduct. And in line with this thought, Rawls had to say this, </p> <p>Justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others.  It does not allow that the sacrifices imposed on a few are outweighed by the larger sum of advantages enjoyed by many. 2 </p> <p></p> <p> That is to say that end does not justify the means. So, the investigation into the social significance of justice in Nigeria democratic system is our guiding spirit.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.1            </b><b>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>History indicates that right from the ancient times to the contemporary period, justice has been regarded as one of the cardinal virtues which man as a political animal makes quixotic effort to establish in the society he lives.  Thus, justice is the ultimate goal of political life, but experience has shown us that it is injustice that dominates political debate.  The reason is that it is easier to identify and deplore injustice than define precisely what is lacking in an unjust political society or what an ideally just political society might be like.  This however, is the kind of predicament John Rawls sees in modern period, where moral thought and the means of assessing moral behaviour are dominated by utilitarianism. Those who set out, according to him to criticize it often did so, on much narrower front.  They pointed out the obscurities of the principle of utility and noted apparent incongruities between many of its implications and our moral sentiments.  But they failed to construct a workable and systematic moral conception of justice to oppose it.  In reacting to this, Rawls had to develop the concept of justice in which he wanted to work out certain principles that will provide a reasonably systematic alternative to utilitarian conception of justice.  The principles he developed dwell strongly on the constant way of equal distribution of wealth and division of benefits and burdens resulting from social cooperation in well-ordered society.  Similarly, in Nigerian democratic government today, I think it could be an obligation if not indispensable task to seek social justice, where the political elites in the country have completely lost the sense of justice in piloting public affairs and engaged constantly in violation of human rights and injustice.</p> <p></p> <p>And to do that however, the Rawlsian concept of social justice should be our stepping stone through which we shall endeavor to restore justice economically, socially and politically in Nigeria.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2            </b><b>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>A nation as a political society is fundamentally characterized by association of human beings working together for common good and possessing adequate means for attaining it.  Nigeria is a typical political society but seriously lacks the quality of a good political society.  The national peace is threatened by self-interest at all levels of the society.  Caught in the grip of Nigerian systems of government, leaders and various sectors in government are led to pursue their particular aims and ambitious of power, progress and wealth, without taking sufficiently into account the necessity and duty of national solidarity and co-operation for benefit of the common good of all people who make up the human society.</p> <p></p> <p>However, the fundamental task or purpose of this research work is to expose the principles of justice as fairness in Rawls and then to extract its relevance and apply it accordingly for the restoration of justice in Nigerian democratic system.  Thus, the summit of our task is how best could these principles of social justice in Rawls help in salvaging the decadent, dilapidating and wounded Nigerian society.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3            </b><b>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>IT is believed that all humans as social being cling to justice in some kinds or another, but the difference is in the application of the concept of justice.  But it is required that justice as a virtue should be interpreted in terms of goodness in human society.  In line with these thoughts, Rawls affirms that “injustice, then, is simply inequalities that are not to the benefit of all.”3  Thus, our concentration in this work dwells specifically on Rawls notion of justice as fairness and its relevance to Nigerian democratic government.  We shall therefore, rely so much on his famous work, A Theory of Justice as our primary source in this research work.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4            </b><b>METHODOLOGY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The method will be more of analytical and expository in approach.  Our primary and specific aim is to analyze critically the primary aim of Rawls, why he decided to invent and develop the principles of justice as fairness.  After that, we shall carefully and adequately place them side by side with Nigerian democratic government, to find out the difference and similarities between the principles, and then to incorporate the good aspects of the principles into the Nigerian democratic system.  In general, the work is to be divided into five chapters. Chapter one will be the introduction, methodological consideration and literature review.  The second chapter, will expose the general notion of justice, and examine the background of Rawls and some key principles of his notion of justice.  Consequently, the analysis of the concept of democracy and Nigerian democracy should be taken care of in chapter three.  In chapter four, the exposition and examination of Rawls’ principles of justice and the social implication of it to Nigerian democracy takes place.  Finally, the last chapter will be the critical evaluation and conclusion.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1]  See J.

Thomas Aquinas’ treatise on natural law is contained in the first part of the second part of his <i>Summa Theologica</i> where he treated Law. To be precise, he dedicated question ninety-four of the said book to it (the natural law). The Ethics of Thomas Aquinas closely followed the eudamonological ethics of Aristotle; Aquinas built upon Aristotle’s theory. Just like Aristotle, Thomas sees morality as a quest for happiness. He argued that happiness is closely connected with a person’s end or purpose. He further maintained that human nature has both its source and ultimate end in God. For Thomas, God who created man provides him with the means of arriving at his end. This means, through which man arrives at his end, is what Thomas calls Natural Law.</p> <p></p> <p>For Thomas Aquinas, natural law is that law which the ultimate efficient cause (GOD) infused in man commanding him to do good and avoid evil in order that he (man) may attain his end. Natural law appeals to reason that naturally has the capacity of discovering it. Natural law, Thomas maintains, is based on the rationality of human nature. Thomas holds that the natural law has such properties as: knowability, universality, immutability, indelibility and indispensability.</p> <p></p> <p>However, in spite of these properties of the natural law, it still lacks coercion, i.e., the physical force of law. As a result it is not always obeyed by all. To this effect, natural law needs to be supplemented by human positive law. This is due to the differences inherent in human nature. Consequently, human positive law is needed to ensure an ordered society. Human law lucidly defines and coercively guides social interactions among men. Hence, it greatly contributes to the achievement of common good.</p> <p></p> <p>It is an indubitable fact that every law should seek to protect the common good of the people. It is also a well-established truth that morality has to do with the good of the people. Consequently, law and morality are always seen as two sides of a coin. Unfortunately, certain human laws are not based on moral standards. That is to say that there are some human laws that do not consider the common good. For instance, certain governments enact tyrannical laws. Some others enact laws that are immoral. In this kind of situation, the purpose of law, which is to ensure common good and happiness, is not realized.</p> <p></p> <p>It is in the light of the above that this excursus will examine the nature and properties of Aquinas Natural Law as well as the nature of human positive law. This will lead us into seeing the natural law as the standard with which human positive law is measured. This is because, as has been mentioned earlier that there are some human positive laws that deviate from the principles of the natural law at the expense of morality. In presenting the natural law as the standard for human positive law, I shall discuss such issues as just and unjust human positive laws, the justification of civil disobedience, distinction between morality and legality of law. This is to know to what extent the natural law in Aquinas is the standard of all human positive laws.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.1 A Brief Profile of Thomas Aquinas</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Thomas Aquinas was born in the castle of Roccasecca near Naples at the end of 1224 or the beginning of 1225, his father being the count of Aquino. When he was five, he was placed by his parents in the Benedictine Abbey of Monte Cassino as an oblate. He stayed in the monastery from 1230 to 1239 when the Emperor Frederick II expelled the monks. Thomas returned to his family and stayed for some months and later went to the University of Naples in the autumn of the same year. Later Thomas was attracted to the life of Dominican friars that made him enter the Order in the course of 1244. His joining the Dominican friar was not acceptable to his family, instead they wished him to enter the abbey of Monte Cassino, as a step to ecclesiastical preferment, and it may be as a result of this family opposition that the Dominican General decided to take Thomas with him to Bologna, where he himself was going for a General Chapter from where he would send him to the University of Paris. Thomas was however kidnapped by his brothers and was put in prison at Aquino for about a year. Due to his determination to remain steadfast to his Order he later made his way to Paris in the autumn of 1245.</p> <p>Thomas was probably at Paris from 1245 until the summer of 1248, when he accompanied St Albert the Great to Cologne, where the later was to find a house of studies (Studium generale) for the Dominican Order, remaining there until 1252. In 1252 Thomas returned from Cologne to Paris and went on with his studies, lecturing in Scriptures as <i>Baccalaureus Biblicus</i> (1252-4) and in <i>Sentences</i> of Peter Lombard as <i>Baccalaurus Sententiarius</i> (1254-6), at the conclusion of which he received his Licentiate, the license or permission to teach in the faculty of theology.</p> <p></p> <p>In 1268 Thomas returned to Paris and taught there until 1272, engaging in controversy with the Averroists, and also those who renewed the attack on the religious Orders. In 1272 he was sent to Naples to erect a Dominican <i>studium generale</i>, and he continued his professional activity there until 1274, when Pope Gregory X invited him to Lyons to participate in the council. Unfortunately Thomas could not complete the journey he started as he died on the way on March 7th, 1274 at the Cistercian monastery of Fossanuova, between Naples and Rome. He was forty years old when he died. His life was devoted to study and teaching.</p> <p><b>1.2- Purpose of the Study:</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Many philosophers of different epochs have philosophized on law and its applicability to the human society. Correspondingly, some of them dealt with the law of nature or the law of reason, which Thomas Aquinas referred to as <i>Natural law.</i> Some of such philosophers include Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, and St Augustine etc.</p> <p></p> <p>However the purpose of this study is to expose and analyze St. Thomas Aquinas’ <i>Natural Law</i> theory. This will take us into viewing natural law as the basis as well as the standard with which human positive law is measured.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3- Statement of the Problem:</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Law is no doubt viewed in relation with morality. Again every society has one system of law or the other. Yet our society today is witnessing some legal and moral disorder; some laws that are in existence today have no bearing on morality any longer. This makes one to question the link between law and morality.  What makes morality to be? Is it the law? If it is the law, then, there is nothing wrong with the decline in morality in some societies. This is because there are a number of issues that are not touched by the law. For instance, in some societies abortion and all forms of unnatural sexual relations are legalized. These are but few instances of unjust laws that are in human society today. Is that to say that morality changes with a change in human law? When do we obey and when do we not obey human law?</p> <p></p> <p>Consequently, this work is an attempt to find a solution to the above-mentioned problem.  We are therefore hopeful that this exposition and analysis of Aquinas’ <i>Natural law</i> theory will help us appreciate the natural law as a true foundation and standard for human laws. According to Aquinas, every law derives from natural law.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4            </b><b> Scope of Work:</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Morality has to do with good living and good living is the objective of law. Unfortunately, certain laws seem to deviate from the purpose of law. For Aquinas, every law must necessarily derive from the natural law for it to be just. And for Augustine, any law that deviates from natural law is no law.</p> <p>As it were, Aquinas dealt with many philosophical issues, among which is his concept of law. However, this work is not to deal with his concept of law in general but fundamentally on his natural law theory. </p> <p></p> <p>This work is to particularize the natural law as a way of providing a yardstick with which human law is measured. This is geared towards finding a panacea for the promulgation of unjust laws, which is caused by deviations of human laws from the principles of the natural law.       </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5 Methodology</b>:</p> <p>This work is both expository and analytic. It is expository in the sense that it exposes the tenets of Aquinas <i>Natural law</i> theory. On the other hand, it is analytic in that it involves an analysis of the natural law in order to present it as the basis of human law.</p> <p></p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.6 Division of Work:</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This excursus is divided into five chapters. Chapter one contains the general introduction, a short profile of Thomas Aquinas, the purpose of the study, the statement of the problem, the scope of work, methodology and division of work. Chapter two presents some philosophers’ view on the natural law. Chapter three dwells on Aquinas notion of law but most especially on his <i>Natural law</i> theory and its properties. Chapter four presents the natural law as the standard for human positive law. Here we talk of the natural law and just and unjust human law, when civil disobedience is justifiable and then the distinction between morality and legality of law all to show that the natural law remains the basis of human positive law come what may. Finally, chapter five recapitulates the entire study by way of evaluation and conclusion.</p>\n\nTHOMAS AQUINAS’ NATURAL LAW THEORY: A STANDARD FOR HUMAN POSITIVE LAW.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THOMAS AQUINAS’ NATURAL LAW THEORY: A STANDARD FOR HUMAN POSITIVE LAW.", "id": 33}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><b>THE FATE OF MAN IN A SCIENTIST-TECHNOLOGICAL ERA. (A PHILOSOPHICAL EXAMINATION OF THE IDEAS OF ALEXANDER DENIS.)</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/></p> <p><b>1.0            </b><b>Science In The Seventies</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>If a reasonable analysis is made of the whole periods in the history of science, the fact that science brought much innovation to mankind cannot be denied. Throughout the history of science, one could see attempts by scientists to exhaust all that are practicable as far as our world of reality is concerned. But these achievements of science have not been without problems.</p> <p></p> <p>Alexander Denis sees the problem as a turning point in those advancements of science. He traced back the foundation of scientific evolution and its social impact to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For instance, in the year 1905, Einstein came up with his theory that mass could be converted into energy. Within the camp of the scientists, some doubts were raised as to the possibility of this theory. But 40 years later, his theory was confirmed when Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed by atomic bomb.</p> <p></p> <p>In the 1950s, scientists were bent on constructing nuclear weapons. Weapons of war became more sophisticated with an increasing hope that no one would be foolish enough to use them adversely. But unfortunately, as hopes were rising towards what science could offer as good, there was a corresponding increase in disillusionment. At this point, one stands to ask where mankind was going in the 1970s. This boils down to the fact that one-fifth of the world’s political manpower was (and is still) employed for military purposes. As this was foreseen as something more deadly than life giving, some moves were made to the imminent excesses. Many countries engaged in the formation of groups to arouse social and moral conscience among scientists, one of which was the British society for social responsibility in science. All these groups were put up because of the fact that a single misuse of science anywhere is likely to attract its own heavy repercussions. The extent to which these groups in different countries could go was immediately seen. They could not achieve much, and the reason was quite obvious: a country tries to out do the other in the production of weapons, at least for defence purposes. This situation leads to a kind of dominos effect. Alexander demonstrates this with the production of biological weapons. </p> <p>If one country is going to attack the other with biological weapons, one needs to know how to defend oneself. And to defend oneself, one needs to know how the weapons work. And to know how they work, one equally needs to make them. Since the individual has known how to make them, even if he does not stock pile them, he can always make move if he wanted to1</p> <p></p> <p>This kind of situation leads to a deep struggle for superiority and a vicious circle is created. </p> <p>                                                                                                       </p> <p> What was happening in the production of biological weapons was present in other areas such as in the science of molecular biology. By the 1970s,according to his analysis the chances of begetting life artificially were no longer deemed impossible.                           </p> <p>                                                                                          <b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1     Genes, Sex and Society</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>“Genes are strings of chemicals that help create the proteins that make up the body”2. Genes are composed of chromosomes, which are responsible for our different characteristics. But these characteristics are summed up in the DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, which is the sum total of the genetic make up of every living thing.</p> <p></p> <p> DNA is very stable such that “mutations”3 occurring in the germ cells will be passed on to the children. It has been found that some genetic defects are linked with chromosomes that determine sex. For instance colour blindness, webbed toes and muscular dystrophy are caused by chromosomes related to sex chromosomes.</p> <p></p> <p>In 1969,the first fertilization of the human ovum which was carried out under laboratory conditions was made. Earlier before this date (1969), human ovary was not accessible and so studies concerning human conception could not yield any positive result. But, this breakthrough has taught man that artificial fertilization of the human ovary is hundred percent possible. As years go by, more discoveries were made. Alexander Denis made allusion to the new discovery about human blastocyst in 1974.He noted the report that “human blastocysts had been grown artificially in the laboratory and re-implanted into women, with subsequent birth of apparently normal several children”4.      </p> <p>No doubt, there was some social impact accruing from these discoveries. It became obvious that infertility and other related problems can be stopped. A wife with blocked oviduct or a husband with ineffective sperm can get an aid.</p> <p></p> <p> There was equally a way of determining sex chromosome. In this case, the sperm containing the Y chromosome is identified as male chromosome while the sperm containing X chromosome is identified as female chromosome. Hence Alexander averred that “sex could be determined by separating sperm containing the Y (male) chromosome from those containing the X (female) chromosome”5. He also noted the discovery made by a group of German scientists, that sperm could be made concentrated 85%. This concentration he said, makes the Y sperm to swim more strongly.</p> <p></p> <p>  In the past centuries, man submitted to the dictum that children are gifts from God and that their (or children’s) absence is an expression of God’s wrath. It was taken that the sex of one’s children is determined by the mind of God such that one was made to be grateful for what he gets even if it is a girl again (may be for the fourth time). The case of infertility was then seen as the actualisation of God’s will on man. But in this era, not only that infertility has a total cure; man can now choose to have more males than females in as much as he adroitly follows the rubrics of science concerning the modernised form of reproduction.</p> <p> </p> <p>More still, the developments in science have also led to the discovery of genetic abnormalities. It is true that under normal circumstances, chromosomal donations during the period of human conception do not go beyond or below the usual 23 chromosome pairs from either parent. But sometimes the unusual may happen such that the chromosomal donations may not keep to the usual 23 pairs. According to R.F. Biehler “The unusual number of chromosome may either be 23+24 making an overall number of 47 instead of the usual 46.At other times it may be 23+22 making a combinatory total of only 45 instead of the usual 466.”</p> <p></p> <p>Biehler explained that there is bound to be a genetic abnormality when either of these situations occur. The type of abnormality that occurs in this situation is Down’s syndrome. He explained that Down’s syndrome occurs when the cell is produced by 47 (i.e.23+24) chromosomes.</p> <p></p> <p>The missing of a sex chromosome or the addition of an extra sex chromosome may lead to a type of genetic abnormality called Turner’s syndrome. This abnormality occurs when a sperm with a missing sex chromosome fertilizes a normal egg or an egg with a missing an X-carrying sperm fertilizes X chromosome. Biehler explained that this lack of a second X chromosome may cause stunted growth in the female child and will eventually lead to a blockage of breast development and menstrual flow in the female child at puberty.</p> <p></p> <p>However, in the midst of these genetic discoveries, mankind should not submit to geneticists as those who have the final answer about gene and sex. Sometimes, their projections can really cause more harm than good. In his book, “<i>The Technological Society</i>”, Jacques Ellul argued,  “If the choice as to what type of human is desirable be left to those who are making the choice possible –the geneticists, then the doom of humanity must crop up”7. Under what I may call the magic wand of biology, man is now gradually becoming quite different from what he was. He is changing into a new and paradoxical animal. The very ‘Homo sapiens’ has now become a ‘Homo biologicus’ who attains the level of fertilizing his female at a long distance like the molusks or like the Kangaroo that develops outside his mother’s body. </p> <p></p> <p>Some molecular biologists had much questions to respond to in regard to the manipulation of living things and human beings. The effects of science and technology were also beginning to draw attentions and questions; for instance, population density was much with a corresponding increase in pollution, deaths from war and other social ills were in the steady progression: these situations made the enthusiastic applications of biological discoveries to everyday life to fall down drastically. However, the advancements in science does not only revolve around gene and sex, it equally encompasses the human brain.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2     Chemistry of the Brain</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The human brain can be described as two handfuls of tissue, which weighs a little more than 1.2kg with colour and pulp-like substance responsible for man’s feeling, speaking, seeing, smelling, remembering, engaging in sexual union and other activities that characterises the daily human life.</p> <p></p> <p>The human brain indeed contains about ten thousand million nerve cells. Thus, in comparing the computers to human brain, Denis Alexander avowed that “the biggest computers ever built manage less than a hundred units unlike the human brain that contains ten thousand million cells”8.</p> <p> </p> <p>Initially, brain research was the major preoccupation of Neuro-physiologists, those who are primarily concerned with the electrical activities of the brain. In 1974, Sir John Eccles of Buffalo University used a microelectrode less than a thousandth of millimetres in diameter to explore the electrical behaviour of individual neurons in living cat brains. However, in not more than ten years of this discovery, it was also discovered that “if the electrical activity of individual neurons varies so much, it is also likely that their chemistry varies as well”9. Thus, among the complex task of biochemistry in the early seventies, was to find out the disparities in chemistry between the ten thousand million nerves contained in the brain.</p> <p></p> <p>There has been a tremendous increase in our knowledge of the structure and chemistry of the brain. Our detailed knowledge of the brain chemistry makes it inevitable that new and more sophisticated drugs are produced to exert certain effects on man’s behaviour. The implantation of electrodes in the brain, which was initiated by Dr. Hess in 1928, now serves as a routine procedure. This is a situation where a hole is made in the skull of the animal or man, and a fine metal planted in specific areas of the brain. Through these electrodes, simultaneous electrical recording can be done while the animal or person moves freely to wherever (it) he chooses. Even the cerebral areas related to pain, pleasure, eating, sexual gratification and learning have all been detected through this medium. It was equally ascertained that electrodes could be used not just for picking up electrical activities alone but also to stimulate specific regions of the brain.</p> <p>Before delving into the interpretive cortex of the brain, it is nice to highlight some diffuse pathways in the human brain. There is what is known as the cholinergic pathways, which regulate attention, learning and memory function. In other words, a projection from the nucleus basalis of Meynert </p> <p> provides the cholinergic input to the cerebral cortex. The medial septum in turn provides cholinergic innervations of the hippocampus.</p> <p></p> <p>The Dopamine pathways also regulate movement, cognition, learning and memory function. Hence, a projection from the substantia nigra provides dopamine input to the neostriatum. Then the ventral segmental area supplies dopamine for the cerebral cortex and the limbic system. These activities of the brain are not unconnected with its plasticity. According to Malcolm Jeeves “the most characteristic features of the brain is its plasticity”10. The absence of this plastic nature of the brain will result to inability of the human brain (man) to learn or memorize something. Man’s response or adaptation to his world and its changing circumstances will be impossible.</p> <p></p> <p>The Serotonin pathways play important roles in mental health. So it is discovered that projections from the brainstem raphe nuclei innervate a wide variety of brain regions. Therefore, Serotonin is implicated in the etiology of depression and hallucinogenic agents such as LSD, and mescaline equally plays their role.</p> <p></p> <p>According to professor Giles Brindley of the Institute of psychiatry in London, “Electrodes are being planted in human brains for very different purposes”11. He explained that a wide range of wires could be planted in the back of the brain, which receives signal from the eyes. He also noted that photo-electric cell devices can be used to convert light waves into electrical impulses which has the feasibility of giving blind people the ability to recognize objects and possibly to read. Enumerating various researchers on the brain will not be complete without some theories on memory. This has been a fascinating thing about the human brain. How do we store information and then recall it in years later? Infact, how do we remember? According to Prof. Penfield, “memory is an area of the brain called interpretive cortex”12. From experiments made, he opined that man has the potential to recall any past experiences. He went on to say that any theory of memory must provide for the storage of a directional, sequential series of events complete with sound, vision and colour. However, this assertion has led to many theories about the memory though we shall not be delving into them now. From the researches made so far, it has also been discovered that the vital region of the brain called hippocampus, is responsible for short-term and long-term memory</p> <p></p> <p>It is quite evident that some big steps have been made in brain research but we are not going into details so as to focus on the scope of our study.</p> <p>In many ways the ethical issues raised by such researches and experiments are similar to those that come from our acclaimed potential to control our own heredity. Just as the genetic content of our cells may be manipulated in the laboratory, in the same way, some specific information will (if not already experimented) be fed into human brains at birth.</p> <p></p> <p>Already we can exert enormous power over the mind by the use of drugs and even more by the use of electrodes. And one can attest to it that “never before has man held such power in his hands. And never before has there been such a temptation to misuse it”13.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.3 How brave the new world</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>For Alexander Denis, by 1970, matters were coming to its zenith. The richer countries were becoming over-extended. Most of them were becoming over-populated, over industrialized and over-reliant upon cheap imported raw materials. Resources were either becoming less plentiful or were being deliberately withheld by the producing countries, all in the interest of long-term conservation.</p> <p></p> <p>The twentieth century has seen the most rapid technological development in human history. As such, people who were born before powered flight saw men walk on the moon. Within five decades, medicine has moved from leeches and cupping to organ transplant. Thus, if the main feature of a god were his power, it might seem that man was more like a god than ever before. “It is man who with his inclination to science and technology has travelled to the space. It is this same man who fits people with new hearts, keeps them alive in machines and even changes their minds or their sex. Mankind has even gone to the realm of trying to produce himself artificially (cloning). There is no doubt that man has benefited much from his own effort of research to gain the potential for healing the minds and bodies of the sick ones”14.</p> <p></p> <p>But amidst all this, Alexander believes that one of the outstanding characteristics of this present generation is a U-turn from science. It is no more a hidden fact that the prospect of technical innovation has now become almost a threat to humanity. In his book “<i>chance and Necessity</i>”, Jacques Monod spoke of the apparent frustration, which has brought about the rejection of science and a resultant shift to religion as the only moral approach.</p> <p></p> <p>The hope of our filling and ruling the earth is turning sour as it is realized, and the prospective future seems nightmarish. Another effect of the new human situation is that our environment, and the forces which shape our lives, become more and more man-made. Even our basic thoughts about our situation and ourselves are continuously geared towards anthropocentricism. Looking at those countries of the world where science and technology already developed, one notices a total feeling of disillusionment. What can we say is the cause?</p> <p></p> <p>The obvious reason is that the glorified science and technology with the peripheral standard of living has not curbed the evil that is rampant in our society. Alexander, in giving credence to the views of M. L. Smith, avows that “collectively we are much more like two-year-olds in a petrol store with a box of matches than we are like gods or even responsible adults”15. We really call it a new world. But how brave is the new world? One can admit the fact that the acutest social and technical problems facing mankind today come not from the so-called under-development’ but from ‘over-development’16. This is why the various applications of modern science will continue to constitute mayhem to peace and human life.</p> <p></p> <p>In the face of all these, some proponents of science would still hold it as being neutral. For them, man’s discoveries are neutral, what varies is their application, which involves moral choice. Such views maintained that “when a man discovered fire, he could either warm himself with it or go out to burn the surrounding villages with it. Iron when discovered, could either be used to make cooking-pots or be beaten into spears for killing people. At the same time, drugs may be used to heal the sick minds or to break it. Nuclear power as well may be used to warm a house or set a nation ablaze”17</p> <p></p> <p>However, if we should take it in another sense, one can prove it that science is never neutral. Scientific research is only empirical and cannot be said to be wholly rational or objective. Every human activity involves value judgment. Since science is a human activity, it should not be left out. In other words, decisions have to be made concerning projects that are worth undertaking and hypotheses must be evaluated as well.</p> <p></p> <p>The paradox of modern science is such that while it gives man a god-like power, it also appears to reduce man to a rather confusing animal in a confusing world. Is man just a mere Heideggerian Dasein who is thrown into existence? Can man be only a bundle of conditioned reflexes predetermined by his genes, chemistry and environment? But science as a god seemed to have reduced its (man) worshippers to nothing.</p> <p></p> <p>Obviously, the value of man surpasses whatever science and technology can offer. Therefore, mechanisms, which underlie the application of science, should not be completely upheld at the expense of meaning through which human life excels.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>1 D.

But every “society is made up of unique individuals who fail or succeed, are powerful or weak, not as a consequence of stratification but because of their individual biographies”.[i]  It implies that man, being naturally social, unique and differs from one another in terms of individual biography, forms a society, which is comprised of different individuals with different or diverse natural dispositions and talents. Due to this diversity of human natural ability in doing things in the midst of limitless human needs, there arise the need for exchange of service, which, for Plato, is the source of origin of any society2. Because of the limited means of achieving one’s needs, man consequently devised scale of preference. As a result, different people with different functions in the society receive different regards and rewards. Therefore one could be right to say that social division in terms of status is real, tangible and inevitable in every society.</p> <p>Any social status ascribed to a person or group of persons, most a time is in relation to the role the person or group of persons played or is/ are playing in the society. Plato was also in this frame of thought, of functional stratification, when he was formulating his ideal state. He ascribed more important social position or prestige to the ruling class in the state. But classification of individuals into social strata was not the end-in-itself of the ideal state. Rather the aim was one way of demonstrating his dissatisfaction with the then existing Athenian government. So, he formulated his dream state, which will be free from all the known social, political, economic, and moral evils.</p> <p></p> <p>Consequently, the ideal state was based on his idea of man as a rational, social, political and moral being. He wanted the kind of society with the necessary conditions or qualities for attainment of man’s natural needs in accordance with the hierarchy of human social status. For this he says, “If we have founded it (state)3 properly, our state is presumably perfect… Then it will obviously have the qualities of wisdom, courage, self- discipline, and justice” 4</p> <p></p> <p>How hierarchy of human social status and the method of stratification contribute to the well-being and attainment of man’s needs is the central purpose of this work. But we see it in the light of Plato’s idea of idea state. Before going on, let us first of all reveal the profile of Plato briefly in order to understand his thought more properly. </p> <p></p> <p>1:2    A BRIEF PROFILE OF PLATO </p> <p>Plato was born in about 427 BC to Ariston and Perictione, a wealthy aristocratic family, in Athens. He grew up when Athens were in war conflict with the Spartans, which started few years before his birth. His life ambition was to become a politician. So, he joined the company of other young aristocrats who studied under Socrates. He wished to find some better political arrangement for his city. But Plato was disappointed by the way the Athens treated his master, Socrates. After the death of Socrates, Plato traveled to the Greek city of Megara, Mediterranean and returned to Athens mentally richer.</p> <p></p> <p>He founded a philosophical school known to be the first western European intellectual organisation.5 The academy later became inclined to politics. That is why some ancient accounts hold that the academy functioned in part as a political consultants’ group. This was so because Plato believed that ignorance is the cause of those social and political evils in Athens. Therefore, the Athenian bureaucrats need to be educated lest they continue to sin against philosophy by killing another Socrates. Having traveled far and wide, and experienced different types of governments, Plato found non of them satisfactory; and so, he sought to formulate his dream state free from the known errors. This is the background from which Plato propounded his Ideal State. He died in Athens in about 348 BC. </p> <p></p> <p>1:3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>In any existing human society, irrespective of time and place, there is always politics. Because togetherness calls for orderliness; yet, any ordered or well-organised society implies well-structured society. Every society comprises of different people of different talents and interests some doing one thing and others doing another, some leading, others being led, yet cumulatively making a kind of anatomical whole.</p> <p></p> <p>Unfortunately, Nigeria as a society does not appear to be ordered nor well organised. This is, in a way, not because of the lack who does what, but because of the prestige, honour, and status attached to what one possesses or achieved has become more important than the need for better society. That is why I chose Plato’s ideal state in portraying how social status in Nigeria contributed towards the social situation in Nigeria today. I so much believe that if the aim and spirit in which Plato created his ideal state is followed in reevaluating and reconstructing our society. It will lead to a harmonious and well-ordered society. Plato wanted a society free from corruption, injustice, economic wastes (through poverty and extreme riches), laziness, ignorance and other social evils. He wanted a well structured and organised society where everyone from any social class does his duty well.</p> <p></p> <p>My purpose is not to reveal which social class is inferior or superior to others; rather, I want to demonstrate how a well organised society, in terms of attachment of importance to one’s social status can aid development. I am trying to portray that it can be of help when every one in any social class considers his position and those of others as equally important, since they make a complementary whole. No wonder Plato said that “quality and quantity are more easily produced when a man specialises appropriately on a single job for which he is naturally fitted.”6</p> <p></p> <p>1:4    METHOLOGICAL APPROACH TO THE WORK</p> <p>To bring out the necessary areas in creating the state, which are of immediate relevance to the work. In the literature review, I brought out two groups of philosophers; those who dealt with the analysis of the operative concepts; and those who dealt with the method of social stratification or status classification. Then I did a kind of comparative study of social status and method of stratification in Plato’s ideal state and what is obtainable in our Nigerian society. On another note, the work look more sociological, yet, I sounded ethical in certain areas, especially in chapters four and five. This is because; my aim is to demonstrate how well structured society contributes to the well-being of the society. And well-being is encompassing, including religious and moral aspects of life.</p> <p></p> <p>Secondly, on the part of scope covered, my area of interest in this work is limited to the organisational patterns in the society. I used the social stratification of citizens into different functional strata by Plato as a paradigm. It is not because of its perfect nature; rather because of the aim and spirit behind such stratification. I tried to use that pattern to evaluate the Nigerian society, in terms of social classification of its citizens into classes and the importance attached to them. To make the work more clearly, I sighted some philosophers’ analysis of the operative concepts and how some postulated theories on social status. Due to the size of the work, I did not go into historical background of the terms; rather, I limited myself more to its practical manifestations in writings and practice.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>Lastly, the work is divided into five chapters. Chapter one is the general introduction. It gives an overview of what is to be discoursed, source of inspiration, the aim, the angle from which it is going to be approached, and how the work is divided. Chapter two deals with revealing some philosophers’ conceptions of the operative concepts and how it should be practiced. Plato’s ideal sate, the aim of its postulation and the importance of social classification in the state are the concern of chapter three. My own aim of dealing with Plato’s ideal state was revealed in chapter four. Social status in Nigeria, dimensions of the stratification, effects and social mobility in Nigerian society are also treated in this chapter. Chapter five handled the critical evaluations and then conclusion of the whole work: it is here also that I made my own stand and opinion clear</b></p> <div><br/><div> <p>1 B. Andy and B.

So much notoriety has gathered around his name that the charge of being a Machiavellian still remains a serious accusation in current political debate. Political thinkers from time immemorial had propounded one theory after another, all geared toward the betterment and upliftment of humanity. One salient feature of all these theories is that the propounders have the same objective mentally but their ideological and methodological approaches are what alienated one from the other.</p> <p></p> <p>In the case of Machiavelli, he posited a complex relationship between morality and politics, and associated the office of a ruler with the ability to know and act within the political world as it is and with the beastly abilities to dispense violence and practice deception. Besides, the hallmark of Machiavellianism lies in the fact that evil means can be used to achieve good end. Hence, when one has a good intention personal to him, what matters is not the process through which this goal is achieved but the emphasis lies on the fact of being able to attain the selfish interest. However, my concern is to x-ray philosophically the principle of Machiavelli and how its influences have held the contemporary Nigerian society to ransom.</p> <p></p> <p>                         PURPOSE OF STUDY</p> <p></p> <p>The high level of moral decadence that has permeated every facet of Nigerian society has instigated me toward embarking on this topic. The dangers of Machiavellianism constitute one of the most problematic threats to the moral basis of political life of every nation in general and Nigeria in particular.</p> <p></p> <p>My primary purpose is to x-ray how Machiavellian principle has penetrated our political and other dimensions of life right from the moment Nigeria got her independence to this present time. Thus, by x-raying this principle, I intend to place it side by side with Nigerian situation and how it has permeated the political, economic and the religious scenario of our country. In addition, I shall critically appraise Machiavellian principle and how reliable it has been in solving human precarious political predicament and whether his ideology has any hope for Nigerian society.</p> <p></p> <p>                                          METHODOLOGY</p> <p></p> <p>The entire work is arranged into five chapters. It employs the following methods: expository, analytical, comparative, review, critical and evaluative methods. However, the method that appears to dominate the work is the critical method. Chapter one deals with the explanation and analysis of Machiavellianism, the political ideology and background to the political theory of Machiavelli. In chapter two, the views of some philosophers are discussed together with Machiavelli’s idea of morality. Chapter three exposes Nigerian situation and Machiavelli’s influence on her. Chapter four analyzes critically Machiavellianism and Nigerian government together with the effects of Machiavellianism in Nigeria. While chapter five, which is the last chapter, contains the evaluation and conclusion.  </p>\n\nA COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF MACHIAVELLIAN  PRINCIPLE AND NIGERIAN SOCIETY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF MACHIAVELLIAN  PRINCIPLE AND NIGERIAN SOCIETY", "id": 36}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><b>BIAFRA AGITATION: </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>ANY JUSTIFICATION?</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b></p> <p><b>BIAFRA AS LED BY CHUKWUEMEKA ODUMEGWU OJUKWU</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1 The Remote Causes of the Biafra Declaration</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>          By remote causes we mean those errors committed, mistakes made, events, etc. that in one way or the other contributed to the Nigeria’s political instability, which are often ignored, but form the bedrock of the immediate crises that led to the attempted secession. We need to note, and importantly too, that these remote causes date back to pre-amalgamation era, and equally too, that their negative consequences still persist as freshly as ever till today.</p> <p>          Before the arrival of the colonial masters, the different peoples that make up what we now call Nigeria lived as independent kingdoms, empires, republics, caliphates etc. These peoples had their different socio-political structures, cultures and (sometimes) religion, which in most cases differed greatly from one another’s. In the North, it was a highly centralized socio-political structure, with the caliph at the head possessing an absolute power both in political, judicial and religions matters. It was a theocracy with Arab oriented culture and the official religion was Islam.</p> <p>          In the South the case was different. Here we see diverse political administrative systems and cultural orientations, with some little similarities among some groups. In the Yoruba dominated South-West it was another form of centralized system of government which was more democratic and largely less totalitarian than the one in the North. Their orientation was basically African both in religion and culture. The most prominent among the Yoruba kingdoms was the old Oyo Empire. Moving eastwards from there you meet Benin kingdom in the Mid-West which had some similarities with the Yoruba kingdoms but politically independent of them. There are equally some other smaller independent political entities and kingdoms in places like Bonny, Kalabari, Lagos etc.</p> <p>          Coming to the Igbo dominated East, the system of government was mainly republican. The small political units scattered everywhere independent of one another. The system was totally decentralized and no one had the power to lord it over the other, yet they had leaders who just had the mandate to represent their people the way the people wished. Everybody was involved in the political life of the community and everything was by consensus; thorough republicanism.</p> <p>          When the colonial masters came, they signed treaties of protection   with these different peoples and these treaties were most often signed after long wars of resistance1. This means that some of these peoples never for once accepted the colonial masters’ protection, but were rather overpowered. What followed immediately was total exploitation of their resources in the name of protective administration. These different peoples were summarily administered separately but the major dividing line was drawn between the North and the South as separate entities. These peoples were later fused together for the British economic and administrative conveniences without their consent; they were only talked to and not talked with. This is how what we now call Nigeria falsely came to be a country, after the 1914 amalgamation.</p> <p>          After the amalgamation, one would expect the colonial masters to begin to unify the minds of these peoples who had little or nothing in common and more still who never consented to the amalgamation. This never happened; instead the reverse was the case. The British did all they could to plant as much disharmony as possible among these different peoples till they left, that the effects are ever strongly holding the so-called country to ransom till today. Yet they tried their best very cleverly to prevent any section from leaving the fold and granted them independence as a country and still fight for its corporate existence more than any person till today. At this point a normal thinking mind will ask, ‘Why this double standard?’. Alexander Madiebo puts the answer thus: </p> <p>The federation of Nigeria as it exists today has never really been one homogenous country, for its widely differing peoples and tribes are yet to find any basis for true unity. This unfortunate yet obvious fact notwithstanding, the former colonial master had to keep the country one, in order to effectively control his vital economic interest concentrated in the more advanced and “politically unreliable” South.2</p> <p></p> <p>          Despite all these, there have never been any serious efforts by either the British themselves or the Nigerian government afterward to find a basis under which there would be true unity, to bring these peoples together. The colonial master would not allow that to happen for such a move would be a great threat to their economic interest for which the disunity was deliberately created. They would rather go on to introduce more measures of ‘divide and rule’ policy which would always go further to widen the gap between the different ethnic nationalities.3 What this is saying is that contrary to our belief, Nigeria as a country does not exist. What we rather see is a mere shadow whose real existence is in the British economic world, in the manner of Plato’s world of forms. Thus, it is only the peoples identified with this name that exist.</p> <p>          My conclusions may sound superfluous, or frivolous, or even sentimental to some ears. To such people I would demand to see the following with me. What should be the case in a country? Is it not supposed to be a place where all citizens are equal in everything as the case may be? A place where all citizens live safely in every part of the territory without molestation by fellow citizens? A place where every citizen has equal civil rights and can hold any political office in any place within the territory? A place where citizens are recruited to government institutions based on qualification and not on ethnic or religious identity? Is it not supposed to be a place where all citizens are first class citizens and see the whole territorial landmass as fatherland? The questions can go on infinitely. But what has been the case in Nigeria from the time of colonialism to date?</p> <p>The case has been extremely opposite in Nigeria. In the first place, there are as many territories as there are ethnic groups in Nigeria. An Igbo who finds himself in Hausa land is totally an unsafe stranger who can be attacked and killed any moment by the citizens of the land. An Hausa who is in Yoruba land is in turn a stranger, and the case continues on. All these are products of the British ‘divide and rule’ policy which they carefully and consistently created and maintained in their successive administrative constitutions. They emphasized what divide the peoples than what unite them, and rather than treating them as a people, they projected them as Igbo, Hausa, Yoruba, Christians, Muslims, etc, among themselves and as enemies. They went further and polarized the so-called country into Hausa-Fulani dominated North and, Yoruba and Igbo dominated South, with the North having the seventy five percent of the total landmass and the purported sixty percent of the total population.4 Yet some of the Hausa-Fulani dominated minorities in the North have more affinity with the South than with the North. The South was further divided into Igbo dominated East and Yoruba dominated West and the later extraction of the Mid-West. This calculated unbalanced polarization did not go without protests from the leaders of the two sides of the South, yet it was imposed on them and meant to be the platform for political activities from that moment on.</p> <p>As one would expect, based on the fact that this unbalanced division into regions was meant to be the platform for political activities, the federal government automatically became dominated by the North who had at least fifty percent of the total seats in the Federal House of Representatives. This became the climax of events that injected instability into the bloodstream of Nigeria’s polity. How can a section of Nigeria dominate the rest put together and always dictate to them what would be done? This single act destroyed every aspect of Nigeria’s life as a political entity, starting from politics, which is the life wire of a society, to civil service, economy and so on. Worse still the dictating North was far behind the South intellectually that it became a case of the blind leading the sighted. What would one expect from this other than a constant revolt by the sighted who would always see the leading blind dangerously taking him to a pit? The situation is even far from being better in the military as the ethnic quota system of recruitment introduced shortly before the independence offered a compulsory sixty percent recruitment to the North, fifteen to West and East each and ten to Mid-West in any recruitment at all in the Army.5 The sum total outcome of this would be nothing short of sacrificing merit, competence, excellence, productivity, etc,  on the alter of ethnic politics. Yet it is always imposed on me to say that Nigeria is a country. But I know that in a country every citizen is as important as the other and everything is therefore done on the basis of the most competent whether or not they all come from one section or even a family, provided they do it for the general good.</p> <p>At this juncture I would like us to think a bit. Do the above events appear coincidental? Emphatically no! All the above happenings during the foundation laying stone of the Nigeria’s permanent political structures were done for certain ends, not for the people called Nigerians, but for the people that masterminded them. They were permanently laying the foundation for the inter-ethnic rivalry, conflicts, suspicion and hatred that has always made it extremely difficulty for Nigeria to be a real country, besides laying the foundation for today’s Nigeria’s steady movement away from development instead of the other way round. If one is in doubt I would suggest that one casts one’s mind through the history and study more closely the developments of events to date.</p> <p>Before the arrival of the British, these different peoples, even though they were of different political sovereignties, had some friendly and diplomatic relations among themselves especially through trade. They dwelled side by side more peacefully than now. Their relationship with one another turned very bad with the above happenings. They now find it extremely difficult to co-exist and since then have always held one another to the throat. Yet they were going to be a country by 1st October 1960, without first being a people. How would they manage together to get their independence, one may ask? What would follow afterwards?</p> <p>The answers to the questions above are not surprising at all. They never worked in harmony even close to the independence. At a point the date for the independence itself became a source of serious political clash between the poles, which was crowned with the Kano riot of 1953 that left tens of thousands of Southerners in Kano dead and their properties looted. It further led to the attempted secession of the North5. Even among the Southerners themselves there was no unity of purpose. Apart from the earlier nationalists like H.O. Davies, Herbert Macaulay, Ernest Ikoli etc. who were true nationalists, in the West, the younger generation of Yoruba politicians led by Chief Obafemi Awolowo were ethnic nationalists who were fundamentally interested in the welfare of their ethnic group other than the general good. 6 The same was also the case in the North, were Ahmadu Bello was totally playing egocentric sectionalism, especially after the independence. The Northerners led by Ahmadu Bellow once said that the 1914 amalgamation of Nigeria was a regrettable mistake in the Nigerian history7 while Awolowo said that Nigeria is a mere geographical expression.8</p> <p>In the East, you again find a people of different belief altogether. Led by Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, they strongly believed and worked for a united Nigerian course, sometimes to a self-destructive extent. Thus Uwalaka puts it:</p> <p>The early Igbo positive disposition in the construction of this Nigerian project contrasted sharply with the attitude of the leaders of the other two major tribes, the Hausa and Yoruba… in 1947, Alhaji Tafawa Balewa(later to become the first Nigerian Prime minister) said “since the Amalgamation of the Southern and Northern provinces in 1914, Nigeria has existed as one country on paper…”…Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto(later to become the first Nigerian Governor of northern region ) said “Nigeria is so large and the people so varied that no person with any real intellectual integrity would be so foolish as to pretend that he speaks for the country as a whole.” We know the famous statement of Obafemi Awolowo, the post independent Yoruba leader, that “Nigeria is a mere geographical expression.”9   </p> <p>   </p> <p>After everything the summary is that there was no unity of purpose. There has always been a strong division between North, East and West, but the division has been stronger between North and South in general. Therefore the people we now parade as Nigerian nationalists were actually ethnic nationalists, except in some cases. But after everything, they got their so-called independence as a country. How come that this could happen? At least from the story so far, there is no basis for unity. Instead there have been some separatist signs. The Muslim North had never wanted to associate with the Christian South, and had at least once made a bold step to secession but which was neutralized by the British.</p> <p>Looking at all these, there are certain things glaringly clear to any thinking mind. The totality of the Nigerian political structure is a product of the British mind, imposed on the people, for the former’s future use, despite protests by the later. They had all this while been putting things in positions for use, mainly after the so-called independence. Now look at it. The British strongly wanted to lock these peoples together as a country, not in a real sense, but in a formal sense, so that they would continually exploit them after the so-called independence, as they would be at one another’s throats as had been institutionalized. For this they cleverly neutralized every move towards disintegration. Because they felt they could always deceive the North than the South, they put everything in the control of the North, through the regional inbalance by which the North would always control every political decision in Nigeria through their population domination, and then they would now make the North their mouthpiece and hence control Nigeria through them. That was why they hypocritically played romance with the North to the detriment of other sections, to deceive them into believing that they were friends, and always inspired every of their political moves. But the North is only a means to an end; we are all looked at together as Africans. Therefore Nigeria is not real; instead it is a mere economic institution of the British. The so-called Independence Day was the day everybody in Nigeria ‘gloriously’ matched into the tract of the race to perpetual dependence and slavery, otherwise called neo-colonialism. What happened after the so-called independence, which I classify in this work as the immediate causes of the Biafra declaration gives credence to this.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.2 The Immediate Causes of The Biafra Declaration.</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>After the federal fraud called federal election 1959, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and Chief Obafemi Awolowo became the Governor-General, the Prime Minister and the opposition leader in the Federal House of legislature respectively. Also, Sir Ahmadu Bello, Chief S.L. Akintola and Dr. Michael Okpara became Premiers of North, West and East respectively and the race started.</p> <p>After the independence, Nigeria was hailed as Africa’s hope for democracy. This was because the independence was by peaceful means rather than violent revolution, and because Nigeria was economically viable with great potentials for future development, particularly in view of the large market it presented for industrial goods.10 All this big hope came to nothing for the destructive seed of ethnicity, corruption, inter-ethnic mutual hatred already institutionalized in the system during the foundation laying by the colonial masters, which had long matured into a big tree, soon began to disperse poisonous fruits into every sector of the society’s life. There were socio-political explosive situations originating from unhealthy inter-ethnic rivalry, nepotism, chauvinistic and egocentric sectionalism, corruption, power tussle etc.</p> <p>In the West it was Action Group party crisis through which Awolowo and his group were permanently neutralized with the purported treason offence and Akintola imposed on the people despite their protests. The West turned into ‘Wild-West.’ The East had relative peace except for the census crisis of 1962/63 and federal election crisis of 1964, none of which was regional crisis in a strict sense, and perhaps, the case of Isaac Adaka Boro. In the North, the Chief actor was Ahmadu Bello who ruled the whole federation from Kaduna through the puppet Prime Minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. He was a Muslim fanatic and an Hausa-Fulani ethnic bigot.11 He was openly, and shamelessly too, an ethnic chauvinist to an embarrassing degree.[2] He was the unrivalled leader of NPC, a party which developed from a Northern ethnic organization. Because of the regional imbalance, this party would perpetually have the majority seat in the Federal House of Representatives and therefore was very powerful. The Sardauna was therefore very powerful and enjoyed an unrivalled popularity in the North. Because of his unrivalled popularity among the Northern politicians, coupled with the Northern domination in the Federal House of Representatives, he held the whole federation to ransom, and was politically undisciplined. He was actually the Prime Minister in the body of Sir Tafawa Balewa.[3] He used federal institutions like the military at will. Thus he used the military for private matters and mainly for political purposes; with the federal Army he politically suppressed Tiv minority uprising in the North. He was equally behind the crisis in the West.[4]</p> <p>In his bid to stuff the whole rank and file of the federal military with the Northerners he suffocated it with Northern chaffs, that every Northerner on trousers became a military man, just to out-number the Southerners. Because of his power and influence, military promotions were mainly based on ethnic identity, which naturally favored the Northerners, while the Southerners who were ambitious had to openly identify with Northern politicians before realizing their dreams.[5] The military thus turned into a place of political maneuvers. The climax of this maneuver was the competition between Brigadier Ademulegun and General Aguiyi Ironsi on whom to succeed the last British General Officer Commanding (GOC). Ademulegun was seriously romancing with Northern politicians by all means while Aguiyi Ironsi showed little interest, but the latter was however made the GOC after everything.[6] The result of all these was that the military became a mockery; where seniority and competence did not matter again, and they became politically conscious. The standard was fast running down to zero degree because recruitments and promotions were based on ethnicity, rather than competence. When all these things were happening remember, people were daily being killed in the West and in Tiv land on political basis.[7] Worse still, there were strong reasons to believe the rumours of an impending Islamic jihad which was again linked to the Sardauna.[8]</p> <p>As usual, the poor masses bore the brunt of the above situation and could naturally anticipate a military revolution. In the military, the issue of an impending coup became a common talk. Seeing what was going on in the federation, some more radical soldiers believed that coup d’etat was the only way out and consequently struck on January 15, 1966. This coup, generally accepted as Nzeogwu’s coup (but Ifeajuna’s for Ojukwu), took about a total of fifteen lives of both soldiers and civilians, including the Surdauna and the Prime Minister.[9] It succeeded in the North while failed in the South for the following reasons.</p> <p>The soldiers had different views about the coup d’etat. There were those who believed that the only way to move the federation foreword was through coup d’etat. They include Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu, Emma Ifeajuna, Don Okafor, Chris Anuforo, Wole Ademoyega and their accomplices. Some supported the coup but would not risk their lives and thus, remained neutral. Some others saw it as a mutiny, considering their reaction during the coup. There were equally some others who would not support it if they knew about it. These were mainly those who dinned with the corrupt politicians; the circumstance favoured them. And so on.</p> <p>The soldiers led by Major Nzeogwu succeeded in the North as Nzeogwu was in total control of Kaduna. However, it is clear Odumegwu Ojukwu anticipated the coup and was on the watch out. He could therefore arrest those sent to take over his unit and maintained peace in Kano.[10] In the South, the coup was a total mess-up. General Aguiyi Ironsi, the legitimate commander of the whole federal military, escaped those sent for him in Lagos and still retained the control of the army especially in Lagos.[11] Those sent to the East were placed between the devil and the blue sea. They were placed in dilemma of either endangering the life of an international guest, Archbishop Makarios, the Cypriot leader who visited the Eastern Premier, Dr. Michael Okpara, as they went on with the coup or, save his life by waiting till he left, which means delaying the coup.[12] After everything, the coup was a caricature. Ironsi, still retaining his power, having escaped the soldiers and seeing the coup as a mutiny, could successfully foil it in the South. When some of the soldiers taking part in the coup found out that Ironsi was still in control of the army in the South, they immediately switched over to his side in fear while others ran away.[13] Everything now boiled down to a situation of polarization of power; Ironsi in control of the South while Nzeogwu in control of the North. Ironsi ordered Nzeogwu to surrender but Nzeogwu was ready to have it out to a conclusive end with Ironsi before he was advised by some army officers to surrender to Ironsi, at least having succeeded in dethroning the corrupt regime.[14] Nzeogwu eventually surrendered on certain conditions, which included non execution of those who took part in the coup.</p> <p>What remained of the first republic regime formally handed power over to General Aguiyi Ironsi through Dr. Nwafor Orizu, who was the acting president as Dr. Azikiwe was outside the country, purportedly on health reasons.</p> <p>When Aguiyi Ironsi came to power, he made the greatest mistakes of his life which cost him both his life and those of other millions of people. He wanted to impress the Northerners by all means that he was not Igbo-centric but he ended up worshipping them. He surrounded himself with too many Northerners and his regime could in fact be called Northern regime, for he hardly took any decision without their knowledge. To avoid suspicion, he forbade any Igbo person from speaking Igbo in his office.[15] Again those he appointed to inquire into the January 1966 coup were mainly biased Northerners.[16] Moreover, some Northerners he placed in important positions were close associates of the corrupt politicians killed in January coup, some of whom narrowly escaped the executing bullets of the coup.</p> <p>All these people, realizing that Ironsi was ready to please them, had and used the whole time to poison the minds of the Northern populace about the coup, which initially was very popular among them. They aroused their emotions against the Easterners and prepared their minds for reprisal attacks, in a well planned programme of events. Ironsi himself lost his life in one of these attacks.</p> <p>All that eventually led to the civil war could have been avoided had Ironsi listened to his Southern brothers, especially the Igbos. He only listened with full confidence, to the Northerners around him who were heartlessly bent on destroying him. The first part of the well organized pogrom which was evidently of Northern government initiative, started on May 29, 1966, after which thousands of corpses of Southerners littered the major cities in the North. The rioters afterwards could not agree on a particular reason. For some, it was Ironsi’s unitary system of government; some others, it was to avenge their leaders killed in January coup; but for majority, they wanted secession for they would not be part of any federation that is not headed by a Northerner.[17]</p> <p>Seeing no punitive measure from Ironsi against their first act, with full confidence they came back the second time. It started between 28th and 29th May when Ironsi visited the West on his nationwide tour. He was killed along with Lt. Col. Francis Fajuyi, the Governor of the West. The same fate awaited soldiers of Southern origin and Easterners in particular, majority of whom were not lucky enough to escape. After the soldiers, the Eastern civilians became the primary targets. Already Gowon had taken over power and declared ‘no basis for unity’.</p> <p>What followed afterwards was a momentary but continual massacre of Easterners outside their region especially in the North, with a horrifying brutality that took tens of thousands of lives. The killing cut across age, sex, status, and took several barbaric forms. Some were locked up in houses and were either cut down with sharp objects or set ablaze with the house. Many women above the age of ten were raped to death while pregnant ones had their wombs ripped open, and their foetuses publicly executed. Crying children scattered everywhere as they were chased about and cut down. Some people’s heads were set on fire and allowed to die a slow death, and so many other horrifying stories. Those who successfully returned to the East alive were scarcely seen without serious damage in their bodies and the East became over crowded as the Easterners streamed back to the East.</p> <p>As Ojukwu was looking for a solution to this problem, Gowon remained heartless and was officially pursuing Northern agenda aimed at perfecting a total extermination of the Easterners. His diversionary ad hoc constitutional conference that took off on 12th September 1966 was more of dictation than discussion for within few weeks he and his Northern brothers endorsed one stand after the other till they ironically came back to square one: They rioted for secession initially. In the conference they now endorsed confederation. They later shifted to federation, and eventually ended with the unitary system of government against which they initially rioted, all within very few weeks, and with a threat to use force on any group that failed to comply. What a hypocrisy and heartlessness!</p> <p>The last hope for peace was squandered when Ojukwu and Gowon interpreted the Aburi Accord differently despite the fact that it was well documented. Ojukwu had already seen the unrelenting thirst for the blood of the Easterners, and called the Eastern Nigerian community leaders on May 26th , 1967, and detailed them on the situation. The Consultative Assembly mandated him on May 27th, 1967, to declare Eastern Nigeria at the earliest practicable date, a sovereign and independent state with the Name ‘Republic of Biafra. Gowon’s swift reaction to this was to abandon the Aburi Accord and create Nigeria into twelve states on May 27, 1967. Ojukwu declared the republic of Biafra on May 30, 1967 and the Biafran war started on July 6, 1967.[18]</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.3 The Resultant War, Its Challenges and Responses.</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>As secession was the only remaining alternative for self-defence, the Easterners wrongly believed that the world having seen how greatly they had been treated unjustly, would not support any attack on them by the Nigerian government. But this was not to be true for international politics is a game of gain and not of conscience. Moreover, some of the so-called powers had all these while been collaborating with the Nigerian government that immediately the war broke out, they threw their weight behind Gowon. Britain was actively supporting Nigeria while America, though claimed neutral, did not recognize Biafra. Most of the jets used by the Nigerian troops were Russian jets. Even though these people posed as their reasons that secession was illegitimate, it was all for selfish motives. Muslim African countries like Egypt pitched their tent with the Nigerian government perhaps, on religious ground. Thus Egyptian pilots were very active in Nigerian Air Force during the war. The most outstanding European power on Biafran side was France and Black African countries like Ivory Coast, Gabon, Zambia and Tanzania recognized Biafra, but their total help was far from being sufficient. Faced with extreme difficulties, the creative ingenuity of the Biafrans shone out. Thus they could invent in the areas of Agriculture, armament etc.</p> <p>The nature of the war made Biafrans regard it as genocide, because from every indication there were serious moves to exterminate every human being on the Biafran side. The Russian jets were spreading explosives every place indicative of human lives, like hospitals, market places, schools, houses etc. The total blockade from foreign contact and the starvation measure which took more lives than ammunition did, were basically targeted on the civilians. There was equally an alleged poisoning of food coming into Biafra by the Nigerian government.</p> <p>This war dragged on for thirty months and Biafrans unable to withstand the pressures any longer, surrendered shortly after Ojukwu had left for Ivory Coast. The total death estimate is about three million.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4 </b><b>       The Consequences of the Biafran War.</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>After the Biafran surrender, the Nigerian military head of state, Yakubu Gowon, declared that there  was ‘No Victor No Vanquished’ and declared the move of the federal government towards reconciliation, rehabilitation and reconstruction concerning the war. In reality, the opposite became the case for the war continued in a worse form; no longer as two independent sovereignties but as a conqueror nation and the conquered territory. Contrary to the expectation of the Easterners, there was a systematic further blockade of relief materials immediately after the Biafran surrender by the Nigerian government, causing more civilian deaths even more than recorded within the last weeks of the war. Many Biafran soldiers were shot by Nigerian troops after their surrender and those who survived were dismissed from the forces like army, police etc. Many people’s last drop of hope for survival of the extremely dehumanizing war-caused conditions were destroyed when they were allowed only twenty pounds each from all they loaded into Nigerian banks before the war ended, while those paralyzed by the war have since then been languishing at Oji uncared for. Again, the reconstruction propaganda has not been matched with action as the wanton destructions of the war have remained forgotten by the federal government. To ever increase their sufferings and equally create disunity among the Easterners, the properties of the Igbos in some places, especially in Port-Harcourt, were declared abandoned till today. Besides making life ever more difficult for the Igbos, this was meant to create disunity between the Igbos and the inhabitants of Port-Harcourt, who being desperate beyond control would most likely accept the offer of inheriting the properties of the Igbos in their midst. To facilitate the destruction of Igbo solidarity and identity, many Igbo communities have been forced to states dominated by Igbo-hostile communities, which makes these Igbos deny their Igbo identity in order to escape maltreatment. As these people were still desperately battling with these blood-sucking and dehumanizing situations, indigenization policy was introduced to sell the indigenized foreign companies to the ‘real citizens’ of Nigeria; like the Yorubas who benefited most and are now the sole controllers of the economic sector of the federation. This was systematically done in order to permanently nail the Easterners to poverty and state of total exclusion, while the ‘real citizens’ over-take them and permanently maintain control of every sector of the federal government. Thus after everything, the Hausas control power, Yorubas control economy, while the Igbos are labourers.</p> <p>These and so many other steps continually being added in order to systematically and completely shatter the ‘Biafrans’ have continually and increasingly been the case for more than thirty years after their surrender. This ever worsening situation of perpetual slavery and dehumanization becoming increasingly unbearable, and without any hope for a future change, this people remembered Biafra again and bounced back to it but in a new way; it is now a new Biafra.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>1 I.R.A.Ozugbo<i>,A History Of Igboland In The 20th Century</i>, Snaap Press Ltd., Enugu, 1999, p.33.</p> </div> <div> <p>2 Mag-Gen A.

In his ethical theory, Kant sets out to discover and justify the supreme principle of morality and the foundation on which the whole structure of moral law must rest if it is to be valid as a genuine law of duty. On his part, he has nothing to do with utilitarianism or with any doctrine which gives to morality a purpose outside itself. The basis on which his entire ethics rest are; Goodwill, duty and the imperative.<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p></p> <p><b>1.1            </b><b>GOODWILL</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The concept of “goodwill” is a very important concept in Kant’s ethics. Infact, it is at the center of his moral philosophy. Kant argues that reason must have some functions. It then follows according to Kant, that our existence has a different and far nobler end, for which reason is </p> <p></p> <p>properly intended. This end can only be the cultivation of a will not merely good as means to something else, but good in itself.</p> <p>For Kant, goodwill is the only thing that is good par excellence. Thus he writes;</p> <p>Nothing can possibly be conceived in the world, or even out of it, which can be called good, without qualification except a goodwill.”1</p> <p></p> <p>Thus, all other things we generally refer to as good are conditionally good; their goodness needs to be qualified because they can become bad when misused. For instance. Intelligence, courage, resolution, perseverance, as qualities of temperament and other talents of the mind, are undoubtedly good and desirable in many respects, but these gifts of nature may also become extremely bad and mischievous if the will which makes use of it is not good. There are even some qualities which are of service to this goodwill itself and may facilitate its action, yet which have no intrinsic unconditional value, but always presuppose a good will, they are not good absolutely. Moderation in the affections and passions, self-control and calm deliberation are not only good in many respects but even seem to constitute part of the intrinsic worth of the person. However, they are far from deserving to be called good without qualification, although they have been so unconditionally praised by the ancient thinkers. This owes to the fact that without the principles of goodwill, they may become extremely bad. </p> <p></p> <p>For Kant goodwill is intrinsically good and is always good. Hence he opines;</p> <p>A good will is good not because of what it performs or effects, not by its aptness for the attainment of some proposed end but simply by virtue of volition that is good in itself.2</p> <p></p> <p>Succinctly, we can say that for Kant, Goodwill is the only thing that has absolute and unconditional goodness and that which gives meaning to other limited goods.</p> <p></p> <p>However, Kant’s conception of goodwill attracted two questions by way of objection. First, what does Kant mean by Good without qualification? Second, what is Goodwill? In answer to the first question, Professor Paton in his book The Categorical Imperative explains good without qualification as meaning an unconditional good. By this he means that goodwill transcends all conditions and therefore is good in whatever condition it is found. </p> <p></p> <p>Kant distinguished the two senses of the word”Summum” extracted from the phrase “ summum bonum” and therefore drew a distinct line of demarcation  between supreme and perfect good. According to him,</p> <p>The Summum may mean either supreme (supremum) or perfect (consummatum). The former is that condition which is itself unconditioned, i.e. not subordinate to any other (origianarum); the second is that whole of the same kind (perfectissimum)3</p> <p></p> <p>By this, Kant means that the supreme good is the unconditioned good but not the perfect good; it is only a part of the perfect good, while the perfect good is the whole good. According to Kant, goodwill means supreme and not a perfect good, while the perfect good is realizable in the life after. Thus Kant gives the condition under which goodwill can as such be called the “summum bonum” He thus denies the possible existence of any other perfect goods.</p> <p></p> <p>As regards the second question, which centers on the nature of goodwill, Kant gave some elaborations of this in his notion of duty. He succinctly defines goodwill” as that which acts for the sake of duty.”4 Hence for fuller understanding of the nature of goodwill, we turn to Kant’s notion of duty.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2            </b><b>THE CONCEPT OF DUTY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Kant defines goodwill as that which acts for the sake of duty as we have earlier written. This does not necessarily imply that an action done for the sake of duty is what solely makes a will good. This leads Kant to distinguish between the holy will and human will. According to Kant, a holy will is that which is inescapable of any maxim conflicting with the moral law. In other words, it is that which naturally and necessarily acts in accordance with the moral law. Such a will, in Kant’s conception is not above the moral law but is above the restraints and constraints of such law and therefore is above duty.</p> <p></p> <p>On the other hand, a human will is that which does not necessarily act in accordance with the dictates of moral law because of the influence of passion and inclination. However with the help of reason, acting in accordance with the dictate of moral law becomes a standard a good towards which such a will strives amidst the opposing torrent of passion. Hence, acting for the sake of duty is for human will, a constraint, a duty. Therefore human will is a will under duty and can only achieve its goodness by acting for the sake of duty.</p> <p></p> <p>Kant further distinguishes two types of actions in relation to duty; an action which accords with duty and an action which is done from duty or for the sake of duty. By an action which accords with duty, Kant means an action which is performed from any other motive like from inclination, sympathy or selfishness which happens to coincide with the requirements of duty.</p> <p></p> <p>On the other hand, by action done from duty or for the sake of duty, Kant means an action performed from no other motive but the moral one, such an action is done solely because it is what duty requires. Hence, only such an action, for Kant, has moral value. Thus he says:</p> <p>An act is morally praiseworthy only if done neither for self-interested reason, nor as the result of a natural disposition, but rather from duty5</p> <p></p> <p>By way of synthesis, Kant defines duty as “the necessity to act out of reverence for the law”6. In Kant’s conception, it is only moral law, detectable by practical reason that could be the object of respect. This law awakens respect for itself, by checking and humiliating our passions and inclination. Thus, whereas moral law awakens respect in us, duty makes us conscious of this law and gives us the reason for acting out of respect of it.</p> <p></p> <p>So far, we have seen that goodwill is manifested in acting for the sake of duty; and that duty is acting from respect of law as an obligation says by J. Omoregbe. According to him, “duty is what a person has as an obligation to do”7 Hence, we can identify a goodwill with that which acts in respect of moral law.</p> <p></p> <p>Kant’s notion of duty has attracted criticisms and objections which could be summarized under these questions.</p> <p>i.                   Must an action be absolutely excluded from feeling and inclination in order to possess moral value?</p> <p>ii.                 Does an action done for the sake of goodness and not for the sake of duty have any moral worth?</p> <p></p> <p>Professor Paton reacted to these criticisms in his book,” The Categorical Imperative.” He tries to make explicit, the relation of inclination to duty as Kant conceived it. According to him, Kant never divorced inclination from duty or moral motive, but rather accepted as moral, those actions which though done from duty, have bearing of inclination. He therefore gives the two senses of an action done from duty.</p> <p>i.        That an action is good precisely in so far as it springs from a will to do one’s duty.</p> <p>ii.       That we cannot confidently affirm an action to be good except in so far as we believe that the will to do one’s duty could by itself have been sufficient to produce the action without the support of inclinations8.</p> <p></p> <p>What Paton precisely means is that in so far as the sufficient reason for our action is the will to act for the sake of duty, our additional inclination to such an action does not affects its morality. That is, our inclination or emotion does not affect the morality of our action, rather our acting for the sake of duty. Kant extols action done for the sake of duty and places it above the one done from duty. This is very clear in his distinction between a holy will which performs an action from its goodness and human will which performs from duty. However, Kant believes that a human being can never act from sense of goodness, because such an action is so noble and magnanimous that it cannot be achieved by man.</p> <p></p> <p>Summarily, for Kant, duty implies a constraint, a restraint. This constraint is of consequent to the imposition of the universal law, dictated by the practical reason to an imperfect will- the human will. The relation of the law to the will is that of a command, an imperative. Kant gave an elaborate treatment of this imperative to which we now turn.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3            </b><b>THE IMPERATIVE</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The relation of the objective principle or universal law to a human will is that of constraint. The conception of such a relation in so far as it is obligatory to such a will is a command and the formula of such a command is what Kant called an imperative. Thus, Paton writes;</p> <p>The conception of an objective principles, in so far as it is necessitating for a will is a command (of reason) and the formula of this command is called Imperative.9</p> <p></p> <p>The imperative for Kant is expressed by an “ought” in which case, the law of reason proposes to the will what is to be done by use of obligation.</p> <p></p> <p>Kant distinguishes the two main types of imperatives – the hypothetical and the categorical imperative. Hypothetical imperative is that which commands an action only as a means to an end. It says: If you desire X, you ought to do Y. It commands an action only as a means to an end. Kant further distinguishes the two types of hypothetical imperative: the technical or imperative of skill and the pragmatic or counsel of prudence.</p> <p></p> <p>The technical imperative gives a direction to a will which wants to attain a particular end. It says: you ought to do this if you want to attain the other. According to Kant, this imperative is more of a counsel on techniques than of a moral principle. And since it is morally neutral, in the sense that it can be appreciated to good principle as well as bad one, Kant qualifies it as being problematic.</p> <p></p> <p>Where the end is one that every rational agent wills by his very nature , the imperatives are assertoric or pragmatic. Thus for Paton;</p> <p>The end which every rational agent wills by his very nature is his own happiness, and an actions enjoined by a pragmatic imperative are good in the sense of  being prudent10.</p> <p></p> <p>The categorical imperative on the other hand commands an action as an end- and never as a means to an end. It recognizes the intrinsic finality in human act and thus commands an action as being necessary of itself. It says; you ought to do X. The imperative is not conditioned by the hypothesis that some particular end is desired.</p> <p></p> <p>According to Kant, he calls this an apodictic imperative, which is demonstrably or indisputably true, thus it is the imperative of morality.</p> <p></p> <p>With these principles, Kant lays the foundation to his supreme principle of morality- The Categorical Imperative, Goodwill, which is a will that acts for the sake of duty with its unconditional quality an intrinsic goodness, is the only will that  can act in accordance with the dictates of the unconditioned command- the Categorical Imperative. Duty gives the necessity of this command as well as its impacts to a finite will, while imperative gives the formula of this command.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>1 J.

Both the advocates of peace and terror, theists and atheists explicitly or implicitly speak and write about conscience and its place in the pursuit of particular causes. Hence the notion of conscience is a point of interest to all.            </p> <p></p> <p>The term conscience appears in the constitutions of many nations today as well as in the official documents of the church.  Civil rights activists have often used the terms “<i>white conscience</i>”, <i>“public conscience”</i> <i>Christian conscience</i>” and so on, as weapons of remedy against various ills and excesses of ideologies.  Scholastic philosophers are themselves neither unanimous nor constant in their use of the word conscience.</p> <p>This overview is nevertheless sufficient to show that conscience embodies various meanings and covers situations ranging from view of life to personal conviction, social values and objective standard of conduct for different peoples.  The nature of conscience has, as a result, been variously interpreted as an interior voice, a faculty, an act of judgement, a habit, etc.  The lack or absence of unanimity in the usage and interpretations of conscience by both secular and ecclesiastical writers often blur and make ambiguous its true meaning.  Thus, the ordinary man is all the more perplexed with regard to its function as a norm of morality. In this light, it is an onerous task to arrive at an understanding of the nature of conscience and its obligation.</p> <p></p> <p>Authority irks modern man. For him, freedom is the absence of restraint.  In many democratic countries, for instance, freedom becomes equated with irresponsibility.  Often the basis of dissent is sought in conscience, which serves as an arsenal of defense against the demands of authority.  In moral matters, the emphasis is on personal autonomy that refuses to look beyond self, for moral values and guidance.  However, appeals to conscience in cases like these often result in an inability to resolve moral problems.  The consequence is chaotic existence, which has become the mark of our times.</p> <p></p> <p>This long essay is an attempt to clarify some of the uncertainty that surrounds the word conscience using the philosophical framework of St. Thomas Aquinas. </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.1             </b><b>Background Of The Study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Conscience is man’s nearest guide with regard to his moral decisions on actions.  Man makes a rational judgement over the actions performed or about to be performed in order to know how good or bad they are.  He does this because of the natural inclination to attain happiness and satisfaction.  Hence, conscience is of interest to all.  Teachers make lesson on it, leaders consider it, parents address their children on it, Christians respect it; lawyers act on it; while philosophers examine it critically.</p> <p></p> <p>Aquinas’ attention was drawn to the issue of “conscience” as a result of the hot debate on the relationship of conscience and synderesis as well as its nature in the Middle Ages.  He looked into the matter to see if there were any distinguishing features of conscience, its operation in the intellect with regard to the actions of man.  He came out with the conclusion that conscience incites or binds.  There is no doubt that his stand on the issue alleviated the problem to a certain extent.  However, it is still subject to critical examination, because his view appears to be very subjective.</p> <p></p> <p>Thomas Aquinas {c. 1225-74} was born into an aristocratic family at Roccasecca in the south of Italy.  He studied philosophy and theology at Cologne with and under Albert the Great.  Aquinas’ best-known work is his <i>Summa Theologia </i>and others like <i>Scriptum Super</i> <i>Sententiarum</i>, <i>Quaestiones Disputatae De</i> <i>Veritate</i>, <i>Summa Contra Gentiles</i>, which he wrote around 1254 to 1273.  He died on March 7, 1274 in the Cistercian abbey at Fossanova.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.2    Statement Of The Problem</b></p> <p>          A historical survey of philosophers and thinkers who delved into the problem of conscience shows that conscience and synderesis are inevitable in making moral decisions on actions.  However, man cannot appreciate and appropriate this function of the human intellect without an epistemological cleansing in order to see the relationship between synderesis and conscience.  Aquinas’ doctrine established that conscience has a binding force whether true or erroneous[1]. This means that one who yields to erroneous conscience is not free from a bad act.  Does it imply that one with erroneous conscience must act wrongly?  What measure could be employed to correct the error and how?  The problem of a doubtful conscience entails a feeling of uncertainty about something as to the lawfulness or obligation of an action.  Aquinas’ reply seems naïve: of course, “a man needs only to put aside his error for he is really not in a quandary”[2].</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b> 1.3     Purpose Of The Study</b></p> <p>          The main objective of this work is to expose and make a philosophical reflection on Aquinas’ doctrine on conscience, his understanding of conscience and synderesis. An attempt will be made to see the relationship between Aquinas idea of conscience and man as a moral being in quest of ultimate end. I shall attempt also to contribute to resolving the problem of error and doubtful conscience, in addition to what Aquinas has said about the problem.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.4   Scope Of The Study</b>         <b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>             I am concerned in this research work with Aquinas’ teaching on <i>antecedent conscience</i> not <i>consequent conscience</i>, since only the former is a norm of morality.  I am bent on finding out exactly the <i>‘quid’</i> of his antecedent moral conscience with its attendant obligation.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b> 1.5     Method Of Research</b></p> <p>           The method of research is expository and analytical since our objective is to know and understand Aquinas’ thought and it’s   relevance to man as a moral being that acts for an ultimate end.  The word “conscience” throughout the work is to be taken as antecedent moral conscience unless noted otherwise.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.6          </b><b>Division Of Work</b> </p> <p>          The work is divided into four chapters.  The first chapter is the preliminary consideration of the research.

The reason is certainly associated with the religious propensities of man. Man is however religious by nature, “<i>Homo Religiosus</i>”. Man’s preoccupation with Sacred, which Rudolf Otto described as… “A mystery inexpressible and above creatures”1.  <i>Mysterium tremendium</i>. – a mystery which attract and repels, must have accelerated the growth of priesthood in human society.  So many social scientists are not deluded in classifying religion as one of the five social institutions of mankind2.</p> <p></p> <p>By social institutions is meant…. “a complex or cluster of roles, which are knit together for accomplishment of given ends…”3  In religious sphere, communication with the sacred  is often through sacred rites and the maintenance of the sacred order within the various spheres of human activities become an essential aspects of any society.</p> <p>Emil Durkheim4 certainly exaggerated in equating religion with divinized-society.  However, on its function in any society, he scored a pass mark. Since religion is endemic to any human society – ancient and modern, those tools which prop it up and fan the embers of religion in the hearts of its votaries worth giving attention.  One of these tools is the institution of the priesthood. And we shall discuss it from Catholic and Igbo traditionalist perspectives. Therefore, in African traditional set up, religion is almost synonymous with culture.  Africans who are notoriously religious who “eat religiously, drink religiously, bath religiously, dress religiously and sin religiously.”5  Cherish, nourish and sustain the institution of the priesthood as part and parcel of their culture.  Priesthood and sacrifice are relatively interwoven.  Sacrifice is an act of public worship offered in the name of the community.  However, sacrifice could never be carried out without the intermediary performance of the priests, hence the importance of priesthood in religion.  Man has always been longing for the need of a special mediator between himself and the object of his worship.  “It is on this note that Aristotle supports the importance of having a priest in every community,”6 this issue of priesthood in religions is what we are set to discuss in this long essay, laying more emphasis on the Igbo traditional Priesthood and the Catholic priesthood. This long essay, apart from buttressing the unequivocal importance of priesthood in these two religions, will also try to make a comparative study of the concept of this office (priesthood) in the two religions.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.1.         </b><b>BACKGROUND OF STUDY</b><b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The observer in Igbo traditional priesthood sees the priest as crooked and tattered. This is because they wear tattered clothes; carry dirty bags and many other things, which make them to be feared. This helps to make the casual observers to think that they are only perpetrators of evil in the community.  They see him also as a fetish priest or idolatrous priest, but no Igbo traditional priest worships idols or fabricated objects as they think.  Nevertheless, they fail to understand that they have their dos and don’ts and their deity will kill them  if they do evil. The traditionalists believe with their whole heart that their priests are genuine priests dedicated to offer sacrifices to the spirits for the benefit of humanity.  This long essay will try to clear the prejudiced views on priesthood especially, that of Igbo traditional religion, and try to raise the status of this office of priesthood in Igbo traditional religion, to the actual elevated status it is supposed to share with the office of priesthood of other religions (especially catholic priesthood).</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p>It is quite unfortunate that this Igbo noble institution has not received fair treatment from many scholars of African Traditional Religion. So, it has been the subject of wrong labelling, caricature, ridicule and disdain.  The worst part of it is complete misunderstanding, miss-interpretation and miss-representation or wrong labelling which Parrinder and Arinze[1] rightly considered as serious obstacles to positive picture of the institution in African Religion.</p> <p></p> <p>Igbo traditional priests have been labelled fetish-priests, witch doctors, medicine men, sorcerers, magicians, juju-men devilish priests and so on.  The majority of Christians and many others in various religious sects regard them as the promoters of idolatrous worship.  In the whole world, moreover, this type of misconception has caused a negative attitude to the study and complete disdain for African traditional priesthood.  On the other hand, since a traditional priest in African society can also be a herbalist, diviner, witch-healer, and seer and so on; then the problem of identification of specialized boundaries emerges.  There are also problem of modern life in Africa whereby anything tagged traditional is equated with being archaic, obsolete, primitive, useless and irrelevant as the case may be.  So with all these in mind, reflections on the priesthood in Igbo traditional religion may not be considered worthwhile.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3             </b><b>PURPOSE OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>One may ask what is it that still arouses interest in the study of priesthood in Igbo traditional religion at this modern era.  The reason is that the institution has witnessed a radical change caused by the attitude of the Christians.  This can be observed in what we call evangelization, conversion and so many other tenets, which they use to confront the traditionalist.  At the same time telling them that without entering their own religion that heaven is not for them; that is (salvation). And that is why I developed an interest in studying of the concept of the priesthood of the two religions meticulously to do a comparative analysis of both without any bias in mind.  </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4             </b><b>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The importance of this long-essay is to show that there is not much difference between the Jews and the Greeks.  We shall also understand that the Christians (Catholics) are serving their God in a conventional and accepted way, while the traditionalistsareserving the same God in a traditional or natural but conventionally unaccepted way (albeit their own way) though it depends on the approach one wishes to take.  We should bear in mind that traditional religion was in existence before the Christian religion.  Therefore, we hope that this long essay wills also contribute in the domains of our intellectual pursuits, in trying to uphold this institution.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5             </b><b>SCOPE OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>It is difficult to deal on African Traditional Religion and Christianity in general.  Therefore, we want to examine one of the major elements that are in common to the both religions and then contribute our little quota to the intellectual domains.  Our areas of interest are on priesthood.  Then in the light of the call of the second Vatican council for dialogue between Christianity and other religions. (cf Vat. II, Nostra Aetate).  We shall examine some aspects of Igbo traditional priesthood in relation to the Catholic understanding of priesthood, so as to sift out the similarities and the differences.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.6             </b><b>METHODOLOGY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The method to be employed in the work is a synthetic, interpretative and expository analysis. Synthetic in the sense that relevant insight of various scholars on this topic will be collated and utilized for more comprehensive knowledge of the topic under discussion.  Interpretative because as an insider with some experience of the activities of some Igbo traditional priests, I will try to make sense of this religious institution.  Byexpository we mean that all the hidden meanings and many ambiguous words will, be laid bare.  For proper understanding, these methods will bring out the comparative nature of the long essay.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.7.              </b><b>DIVISION OF WORK</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This work comprises six chapters.  Chapter 1 is regarded as the introductory part of the work.  It contains the background of study, statement of problem, purpose of study, significance of study, scope of study, methodology and the division of work. Chapter 2 is the literature review of what other authors said on the topic which also I include the documents of the Church, especially the Vatican Council II, and the Scriptures. Chapter 3 is an elaboration on the Igbo traditional priesthood and peeps into the vocation to the Igbo priesthood, his training, his installation or consecration and his functions.  Chapter 4 is also an elaboration of Catholics priesthood and its contents; his call to the office, training, ordination and priestly call to holiness.

Looking at this topic, certain basic questions readily come to mind. These may include: What is freedom? Is man actually free? What do we actually mean when we talk of freedom? This thesis is devoted to an attempt to answering these questions and a whole lot of others.</p> <p></p> <p>A thorough introspection into the being of man reflects the fact and role of freedom. In fact Sartre writes, ‘Man does not exist first in order to be free’. Subsequently; there is no difference between the being of man and his being free.”[1] The essential consequence of our earlier remarks is that man being condemned to be free carries the weight of the whole world on his shoulders; he is responsible for the world and himself as a way of being. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Considering the identity of the being of man and his freedom he said, “for lack of getting out of it, I have chosen it”[2]. We flee this knowledge and responsibility by lying to ourselves. </p> <p></p> <p>However, the essence of a lie implies that the liar is actually in complete possession of the truth. In fact, the ideal liar must know the truth precisely in order to conceal it. Unfortunately, when we lie to ourselves we usually half-believe ourselves, falling victims to our own untruths. Thus, though we should know that we posses absolute freedom as well as absolute responsibility, we do not. </p> <p></p> <p>Though man has been viewed as sharing similar characteristics with other creatures, it is deducibly provable that apart from the distinctive property fundamental to man, he is equally endowed with the special quality of being free. His freedom follows from his intellect. Hence, Aquinas notes that; “The very fact that man is rational, necessitates his being characterized by free decision (Liberum arbitrium)”[3]. No one can freely choose or even will an alternative, which one does not know. The will only pursues the object, which the intellect presents to it as good. Moreover, everyman desires to be totally free irrespective of all the constraints that surround him.</p> <p></p> <p>In his philosophy, Sartre advocates for freedom. He maintains absolute freedom for man. He says that man creates himself and that man is condemned to be free. He goes as far as what may be considered as complete atheism and amoralism, and as such says that there is no God. Everything is permissible.</p> <p></p> <p>This work is divided into four chapters. On the first chapter we shall deliberate on the general notion of freedom, we shall as well consider stating the problem and the scope of research; some philosopher’s notion on freedom, the problem of freedom, and the nature of human freewill. The views of some philosophers on the term freedom will consist in the ancient philosophers down to the contemporary ones.</p> <p></p> <p>Having dwelt so much on the views of the philosophers in their history, we shall then move over to chapter two, in which we shall consider freedom in its absolute nature, with special reference to Sartre, we shall as well consider its relation to authentic self-assertion and, this freedom and moral responsibility.</p> <p></p> <p>For Sartre, freedom and responsibility are the two attributes, which belong necessarily and absolutely to man. In fact, he made man synonymous with freedom and responsibility, and this became the necessary condition for existence. Authentic existence is presupposed by living in freedom and responsibility and thus; any attempt to dodge these qualities (freedom and responsibility) brings man inauthentic existence. It is this inauthentic existence that Sartre called bad faith.</p> <p></p> <p>In chapter three we shall consider a juxtaposition of freedom with determinism, consider human law and the practicability of Sartre’s absolute freedom, and the world of being and nothingness in relation to passion and freedom. Combating Sartre’s absolute freedom some schools of thought have undermined human capacity and projected the existence of a higher law, order, and have maintained that human actions are not freely chosen but are determined. And even through the influence of passion and beauty, human actions come by chance.</p> <p>Following from all these, the final chapter shall tackle the absolute position of Sartre on freedom and, considering some limitations to human freedom, shall give a reasoned critique on the notion of absolute freedom and, finally take a position or stand on human freedom, which is the final conclusion.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.1         </b><b>      THE STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p></p> <p>This is a work proposed at exposing and satisfying the project topic: The Doctrine of Absolute Freedom and Responsibility in Jean Paul Sartre as the fundamental principles in an authentic existence in all its ramifications.</p> <p></p> <p>The sense in the authenticity of being was summarized in the association of the terms: freedom, consciousness and nothingness. So, existence per se according to Sartre is realized in consciousness and freedom, and the absence of these is nothingness. Simply put, ‘you cannot not be free or else you are not’. Man can be something other than nothing by being limitlessly free in the choice of his actions. Thus, to be human is to be free. He carefully maintained that human freedom precedes the essence in man and makes it possible. He made freedom fundamental to every human action, which goes to define our essence. So, to be for human reality is to act. It is not to be and then to act, but to be means to act.</p> <p></p> <p>Furthermore, taking cognizance of Sartre’s background which undoubtedly led to some of his shortcomings in a bid to portray his views, there will be a form of scholastic or reasoned reconciliation on the subject-matter by recognizing man’s natural affiliation to religion, which most at times leads man to recognizing a being beyond him, which he refers to as God.</p> <p></p> <p>Human laws as levelling principles seem to obstruct human infinite manifestation and assertion. It serves the need for protecting the weakest and so creates the sense of equality. This brings in the possibility of consideration and accommodation, and consequently sets in some limitations to human freedom. And so, it becomes inabsolute other than absolute.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2 THE SCOPE OF RESEARCH</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p></p> <p>This work will not go as far as presenting everything Sartre and other thinkers have said about freedom, but will be bent on exposing the doctrine of Sartre essential to achieving an authentic existence from the primary fact that man is free to decide for himself and assert himself, by standing to be responsible to whatever he has chosen to do. It will as well be geared towards attaining reconciliation between freedom and determinism and the limitations of human freedom in reference to natural and human positive laws. Thus, the invalidity or impossibility of absolute freedom as Sartre would conceive of it.</p> <p></p> <p>Just in a form of intellectual stimulation and response, Jean Jacques Rousseau would simply say in his treatise on social contract and determinism that, “man is born free, but everywhere in chain”4. This is not unconnected with some events that would by punishment or correction limit man in is freedom. The fear of responsibility and the maturity expressed at responsibility make the authenticity of being inconclusive in its connection to freedom.</p> <p>Remember, you have freedom now and the other person has privilege, and next time, he has freedom and you have privilege. </p> <p></p> <p>Human freedom should not interfere with others’ privilege otherwise it 1negates the being of the persons. It rather integrates the privilege of others    into a union, and forms a universal mode of living acceptable to all.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3 NOTION OF FREEDOM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p></p> <p>It was William James who in his treatise on the dilemma of determinism said that, “no subject is completely worn out in such a way that no new contributions could be added to it”5. However, we must admit the fact that great efforts have been made by different philosophers and thinkers to solve the problem of freedom. Thus, before entering into the problem of freedom in man’s realization of authentic existence with reference to Jean Paul Sartre, let us have a look at some Philosophers’ conception or notion of freedom. </p> <p></p> <p>Freedom is the object of man’s yearning. Poets extol or acclaim it, Politicians promise or proclaim it, and some others have given their lives to win it for </p> <p>themselves or for others. Yet what is it? </p> <p></p> <p>The word freedom in the world of philosophers has many and different meanings and these give rise to many nuances. Freedom is the power rooted in reason and will, to act or not to act, and so to perform deliberate actions in ones own responsibility. </p> <p></p> <p>Human freedom is a force for growth and maturity in truth and goodness. It can refer to the absence of external social pressures and demands. It can simply mean the lack of physical restraints. It can signify that capacity by which individuals are able to form their own lives in a sense through their choice. </p> <p></p> <p>Etymologically, freedom comes from the Latin word “Immunitas a coercione” which means immuned from coercion, which could also mean the capacity to decide what to do. According to P. H. Partridge; </p> <p>Freedom refers primarily to a condition characterized by the absence of coercion or constraints imposed by another person; a man is said to be free to the extent that he can choose his own goals or course of conduct; can choose between alternatives available to him, and is not compelled to act as he would not himself choose to act, or prevented from acting as he would otherwise choose to act, by the will of another man, of the state or of many other authority6.</p> <p></p> <p>Man by nature is free some would say; the dictum “man is free” explains all about man and freedom. Historically, man’s existence is endowed with freedom. So freedom is as old as man himself. John Locke speaking on freedom says “men are naturally in a state of perfect freedom, to order their actions and dispose of their possessions as they think fit…”7 </p> <p></p> <p>Though the notion of freedom is as old as man, it started in time with the ancient Greek thinkers, but only on moral reflections. They did not delve directly into the problem of freedom because of three prominent reasons, which include:-</p> <p>1.     They believe that everything is subjected to fate and absolute will, superior to men as well as gods, which indirectly determine every action.</p> <p>2.     Men is part of nature, and thus, is subject to the general laws that govern everything including man himself, and as such cannot but obey such laws.</p> <p>3.                Man is also subject to the influence of history, which the Greek conceived as a cyclical movement in which everything repeats itself within a certain period of time. This is not unconnected to the fact that they were unable to understand human nature and the cosmos exactly. </p> <p></p> <p>      The above reason led to asking such questions as; are we truly responsible for our actions? And how imputable are our deeds to ourselves? The issue of freedom went philosophical when Socrates took it up. He argued that “virtue is connected with knowledge, but vice is simply due to ignorance”8. This stand rather than solving the issue of freedom exonerated man totally from any act of intransigence. Plato instead of repudiating the stand of Socrates broadened the scope. He argued that the “body is a kind of prison and the soul is entrenched in it, but could be liberated through the exercise of virtue and philosophical contemplation”9. The problem of freedom acquired new dimension and attracted a great interest in the medieval period. Fate never existed; rather God was seen as the loving father and a provider. History and nature were placed at the service of man instead of being above man. During this period, freedom moved to a question of relationship between man and God. </p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>With regard to the above assertion, some questions arose as: Why has God created man free knowing that he would abuse the gift? Thomas Aquinas representing the medieval thinkers said that, though man is under the authority of God, he has the freedom to choose his own destiny by free act of the will. Thus, he writes;</p> <p> The rational creature governs itself by its intellect and will, both of which are required to be governed and perfected by the divine intellect and will. Therefore, above the government whereby the rational creature governs itself as master of its own act, it requires to be governed by God10.</p> <p></p> <p>       In the modern period, freedom took another conception; The Theo-centric aspect was replaced with anthropocentricism; man became conscious of his autonomy and thus, the issue of freedom changed its dimension to human faculties, passion and man’s relationship with the society. Descartes the father of modern philosophy has this to say through the immanentic premise of his philosophy of the <i>Cogito ergo sum:</i> “Freedom is no longer perceived as a choice of good, but as a choice of pure and simple as the spontaneous self determination of the individual”11. Leibniz says that the principle of reason causes everything. Hence, “every event must have a cause for its being”12. Hegel, on his treatise on the mind and body relationship posited that all is absolute Spirit, and that an “authentic freedom is not merely individual choice but obedience to the objective reason”13. Karl Marx substituted Hegel’s absolute Spirit with dialectical materialism, holding that the idea of individual choice is necessitated by social value. Kant in his view of ‘existential analytic’- a treatise on the justification of human existence in relation to freedom argued that, freedom is neither direct intuition nor logical demonstration, but a postulation that demands moral law. Thus, Kant defines freedom as “the property of the will to give to itself a law and to be subordinate to the law of necessity, as the phenomena are”14.</p> <p></p> <p>In the contemporary period, the existentialists appeared on the stage.           Freedom for them is not a property of the will but the very structure of the being of man. </p> <p>Summarizing the general view of the contemporary philosophers, it can be said that freedom is something that is lived in any concrete existence. Above all, freedom for me is a human condition of action, which is devoid of any influence, which impedes human consciousness or motivates human decision. </p> <p><b>1.4 THE PROBLEM OF FREEDOM </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p></p> <p>Though freedom is an integral part of man, it has constituted a great and intricate problem in practice and theory. It has often been debated if man is in fact free. This debate has become loud in the modern times, when the rights and freedom of people are infringed on, and when political and economic oppression held people in chain. Besides, it seemsthat the freedom of choice is completely absurd since it contradicts the laws of nature, which the theory of evolution tends to hold in a deterministic way. This is precisely why William James writes,</p> <p>I know of no subject less worn out in which an inventive genius has a better chance of breaking new ground, of deepening our sense of what the issue between the two parties really are, of what the ideas of fate and freewill imply.15<b>    </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The above statement of James reveals the problem in reconciling freedom with the idea of fate. Man’s life indeed reveals some occasions when he is constrained to act in a particular way. For instance, a man in so far as he is alive is determined to breathe; he cannot freely choose not to breathe and still remain a living human being. One may ask if man is really free to act as he has been directed by the will; whether he should be responsible for his actions. The issue of freedom is truly controversial; this is why many thinkers have diverse views on it. </p> <p></p> <p>Historically, the Greek Philosophers did not give any satisfactory answer to the problem of freedom. “They regarded all things as subject to fate, an absolute will, superior to man and to gods which consciously or unconsciously determine an action.”16 </p> <p></p> <p>In Christianity, the problem of freedom was reversed to God, and God was emphasized rather than fate, natural law or history. As Augustine would say, “There is the God of scriptures to reveal to us that in man there is the free choice of the will”17. </p> <p></p> <p>The opinions that presented God as determining man’s actions began to emerge in the patristic or medieval period. Hence; Aquinas asked, “how is it possible to assert that man is free while God is the principal and ultimate cause of everything?”18</p> <p></p> <p>In the modern era, Philosophers like Spinoza, Hume and Descartes hold that “human passions and emotions are propellers of man’s action not free will.”19 </p> <p>Then, in the contemporary era, the problem remains how man can be free in a society in which political systems, communication media, and technological advancement have become potent instruments of oppression. </p> <p></p> <p>In fact, the solution to the problem of freedom lies in the reconciliation of freedom with determinism.</p> <p>  <b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.5 NATURE OF HUMAN FREE WILL</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p></p> <p>The question of the freedom of the human free will has put up an exhibition worth recognition within the epochs of intellectual inquiries. The prominent question that occurs often is “is the human free will free?  If it is, how free is the human free will? But following the scheme, the main concern here is the nature of this free will and its mode of operation. </p> <p></p> <p>The free will is sometimes called free choice or free decision. In Latin, it is termed “liberum arbitrium”. “Free will is an ability characterizing man in the voluntary activity of choosing or not choosing a particular good presented to him”20. It is often defined as freedom possessed by a person to evaluate and to yield to or not to the attraction of an object. However, with regard to this definition, it is worthy of note that, the will is drawn towards “a good” in so far as it is actual and attractive. Thus, a differentiation between particular and universal goods must be made.</p> <p></p> <p>.</p> <p>However, as Sartre would conceive of it, “I could not describe a freedom which is common to both the other and myself. I could not therefore contemplate an essence of freedom”21. On the contrary, it is freedom, which is the foundation of all essences since man reveals intra-mundane essences by surpassing the world towards his own possibilities. “This in essence means that freedom has no particular essence and so, since the essence is beyond realization within a particular confine, it then means that it varies in selves”22. </p> <p></p> <p>Thus, one is only sure of one’s particular freedom, because freedom exists in a particular experience. Yet it is a pure factual necessity appealing to human consciousness.</p> <p></p> <p>Taking from this, the will in the presence of particular goods, has some exercise of choice, but before a universal good, the will necessarily chooses it. </p> <p>Hence, Aquinas affirms that the “freewill is determined with regard to the infinite or universal good”23.</p> <p></p> <p>Descartes describes the nature of the freewill in the following words:</p> <p>It is proper to the nature of the will to have a large aperture, and the sum perfection of man is of acting by way of will- that is, freely-and thus of being in some peculiar way the author of his action and of meriting praise for them.24</p> <p></p> <p>The will is solely an independent reality, and so it is very closely linked with the intellect as well as other drives in man since it cannot act in the absence of the cognitive faculty. This is why Aquinas would say “the act as good is materially an act of will, but formally an act of reason because it is directed towards its end by reason.”25 </p> <p></p> <p>Still on this effort to finding meaning to free will and the method of performance, the proponents of free will distinguished acts of the free will from voluntary acts because “all acts of the free will are voluntary, but not all-voluntary acts are acts of the free will”26 </p> <p></p> <p>The human free will in its nature tries in a way to determine and properly separate conscious and unconscious acts in their fields of identification. </p> <p>This is why Igwemma C., has carefully deduced that, “the issue of human free will also gives rise to the essential distinction in ethics between acts of man and human acts”27. A human act is that which is resulted by the interaction of the human intellect and the free will. It is a voluntary and deliberate act, and consequently belongs to man.</p> <p></p> <p>In a way of summary, the will and the act define themselves separately, and one cannot and does not suffice for the other. For instance, I desire to ride a car, I cannot do so unless I have the capacity or ability to do so.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] J. P.

No wonder then, Piaget pointed out that “… life is a continuous creation of increasingly complex forms with the environment”[1] This complex forms provided a ground for the contemporary research on human development to consistently emphasize the multidisciplinary approach needed to describe and explain how people change (and how they remain the same) </p> <p>over time. More still, Kail asserts that another way to approach development is to focus on thought processes and the construction of knowledge[2], which shows that interest in cognitive development, is a relatively recent phenomenon.  Hence, developmentalists, who have been operating mainly within the framework of either psychoanalytic or learning theories now, discover a new aspect of development to explore – a new framework for their thinking.</p> <p></p> <p>According to Hilgard (1964), “Probably, the best way to view cognitive psychology is to look at it as trend of humanism and behaviorism, with an emphasis on thought processes, reasoning and problem solving.”[3]  By this, we mean the process of becoming aware, or coming to know a perceptual image.  In Piaget’s own view, cognitive development centers on the movement of a child through succeeding stages of cognitive organization, whereby this progress is accomplished by means of assimilation and accommodation.  As the child encounters new experiences he/she both reacts to them in terms of what the child already knows (assimilation) and revises his/her worldview as a result of the new information (accommodation). Thus, Cognition is in a process of constant change and reorganization. Piaget believes that “at certain points in development, these reorganizations are so momentous and fundamental that they represent a whole new way of understanding the world”4.</p> <p></p> <p>When such a transformation happens, for him, (Piaget), a new stage of cognitive development is reached.  The major stages he proposed are the sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational periods. I have set out to counteract in line with the contemporary researchers, some of the underestimated views of cognitive development of infants and young children and then give it a positive position as will be seen in the chapters that follow.<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.2 PROBLEM OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The fact of a child’s stages of growth constitutes the current understanding of cognitive development, which is based upon conclusions drawn by scientists who formulate questions and device methodologies by which their questions can be answered. For instance, it is said that, “Swiss developmental Psychologist, Jean Piaget was so often asked by American audience, “what should we do to foster a child’s cognitive development…?5</p> <p></p> <p>It is by understanding clearly the true humanistic nature of this process that Jean Piaget set forth to offer the world his cognitive developmental theories. However, “we should remember that no particular theory which provides such a comprehensive  explanation of  development, can be  expected  to  withstand  the  tests of  further  investigations  without  undergoing  some criticisms  said,  Beilin, 1989, 1990’ Daehler &amp; Bukatko, 1985; Halford, 1989, 1990.”6 There are:</p> <p>1.                 In his (Piaget) child’s developmental theories, he underestimated the cognitive capabilities of children.  For instance, the kinds of memory, which researchers now find in babies at 6 months of age, were not found by Piaget until babies were 18 months old.</p> <p>2.                  The concept of stage has also encountered many objections: for example, that it gives the false impression that development proceeds by a series of abrupt jerks rather than smoothly; that intellectual functioning at any one age shows more fluctuation than the concept of stage would suggests; that cross-cultural variability limits the usefulness of the concept; that environment is more influential than Piaget allows; and so on.</p> <p>Of course, Piaget did not have many of the methods that are now available to scholars, including equipment and procedures to measure the electrical activity of the brain.  These and various others, which we shall see later constitute a great problem about his theories and therefore needs to be carefully examined in order to clarify matters not well presented. A proper examination into Piagetian theories of cognitive development, as well as critically analyzing the theories, is what this writer set out to explore in this research work.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3            </b><b> PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The aim of this work is to make a proper study into the Piagetian theories of cognitive development, as well as placing them side-by-side with other cognitive theories, with a view to eliciting from them the positive views and criticizing others that seem vague to the contemporary mind.<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p>The main area this research work covers is the view of Piagetian theories of cognitive development.  Hence, the views of other psychologists, scientists, and some philosophical opinions will be entertained, but only as they affect Piaget’s line of thought.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><br/></p> <p><b>1.5 METHODOLOGY OF THE RESEARCH</b></p> <p>The method is expository, analytic, and prescriptive. As this is a philosophical work fideistic arguments are carefully avoided.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.6            </b><b> THE DIVISION OF THE WORK</b></p> <p>This research is sectionalized into four chapters for a better apprehension. Chapter one explicates the background, problem of the study, purpose of the study, scope, method of research and division of work. Chapter two is devoted to the Piagetian Ideology. It traces his historical background as well as presents a general orientation to his theories. Chapter three comprises of the Piagetian theories of cognitive development in comparison with other cognitive theories. Finally, the evaluation of the whole work is conveyed in chapter four.

Hence, the origin of the state is traceable to the fact that man naturally is a social being who cannot but live in the society comprising of other men. It is only in the society that man can realize his being and attain the goal of his existence. Therefore, the state exists for man and not man for the state, since man creates the state. In this regard, it is the function of the state to provide for man’s needs. The primary purpose for establishing the state is to work for the goal of man.</p> <p></p> <p>However, the goal for which the state is established is never completely achieved, most often due to man’s egocentric nature, injustice, factionalism, incompetence, etc which leads to disorder in different spheres of the state. For instance, in Athens, the Athenians were undergoing various forms of social perversion ranging from injustice, intimidation, marginalization, and socio-political crises leading to the disrespect of the fundamental human rights. All these were happening in the days of Plato and he was moved to postulate what he thought was the best government for the human society, especially in Athens. </p> <p></p> <p>Meanwhile, man as a political animal (ens politikos) and a social being (ens socialis) encounters such problems as to how he should live, who should rule or be ruled, what form of political society to be adopted, what are the ideas for the state? And, many such questions, as we shall see in this work.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2 Purpose of the Study.</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>“Love is the basis of Justice”1 as Augustine would have it, and this agrees with Plato’s idea of harmony between the three classes in the state each performing his duty out of love of each other so as to achieve the common goal (good of the society).  Plato and the rest of the moral philosophers who sort for Justice in the world could be called the prophets of social Justice. </p> <p></p> <p>Given the nature of this work, it is limited to the most striking points in Plato’s discussion on politics, and the emergence of an ideal state governed in Justice i.e., on how best the state should be governed for the interest of both the state and citizens. This work is directed to solving social political problems that arise in the contemporary politics, following the paradigm, which should be applied in the present day politics, </p> <p>1.3 Scope of the Study</p> <p>Plato gives an idealistic interpretation of Justice in his state. Meanwhile, this research work will be based mainly on the theories of ideal state propounded by Plato. The views of other Philosophers will also be entertained as well.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>1.4 Methodology</p> <p>The work is philosophical. The method is expository, descriptive and evaluative in nature. It will examine the relevance of Plato’s just state when applied to Nigerian, and finally conclusion is drawn at the end of this work.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p>1.5 Division of Work</p> <p>This work is divided into five chapters. Chapter one takes into consideration the background of the study and the literature review of Justice beginning from the most recognized ancient philosophers till the time of Plato. Chapter two is a brief survey of the key concepts. The definition of state and Justice as the leaven of the ideal state. Chapter three is a brief assessment of the nature of the Just state in Plato. It is further divided into three namely the origin of the state, the citizens of the state. The state should be self- sufficing and capable of protecting its citizens from internal and external problem since it is natural to man and exists for the provision of numerous needs of man. Hence, leadership of the state by competent hand i.e., philosopher king. Chapter four, considers the various forms of political society in Plato showing the bad and good forms, where the former aims at satisfying the selfish interests of the rulers, the later at the good of the state and the entire citizenry. Chapter five deals with evaluation, pointing out Plato’s relevance to the present day (Nigerian) politics, and lastly the conclusion of this research work. </p> <p></p> <p>1.6 Literature Review</p> <p> “No one speaks from nowhere,”2 said Hans Gadamer. It is on this ground that we wish to explore our literature reviews, surveying how some political writers conceived this concept justice, taking cognisance of its definition as the strong and firm will to dish to each that which is his/her due. Meanwhile, their notions of justice differ considerably, especially the sophists, which was one of the major reasons that brought Plato into the scene.</p> <p></p> <p>1.6.1 Sophists</p> <p>They are teachers who came to Athens to deliberate more on human nature, how knowledge is acquired and how human might order their behaviour. But, in the real sense of it they were political and legal men. Meanwhile, we shall look at two of them.</p> <p></p> <p>1.6.1.1 Protagoras (481-410BC)</p> <p>He was best known for his statement that “man is the measure of all things, of the things that are, that they are, and of the things that are not, that they are not”3. For him, knowledge is limited to our various perceptions and these perceptions differ with each other.  He maintained that moral judgments are relative. He was willing to admit that the idea of Justice or law reflects a general desire in each culture for a moral order among all people. Nevertheless, he denied that there was any uniform law of nature pertaining to human behaviour that all peoples everywhere could discover. Though, he distinguished between nature and custom or convention and said that law and moral rules are based, not upon nature, but upon convention, thereby taking a conservative position that the state makes the laws and that these laws should be accepted by everyone because they are as good as and that can be made. </p> <p>Hence, for the interest of a peaceful and orderly society, people should respect and uphold the customs, Laws and moral rules their tradition has carefully nurtured. One should not set his private judgment against the law of the state so that Justice may prevail.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p>1.6.1.2 Thrasymachus  (Late 5th century)</p> <p>He was a man who asserts that injustice is to be preferred to the life of Justice. He did not look upon injustice as a defect of character. On the contrary, he said, “Justice is pursued by simpletons and leads to weakness”4. For him, people should pursue their own interest aggressively in a virtually unlimited form of self- assertion. </p> <p></p> <p>He regards justice as the interest of the stronger and believed that might is right, for laws are made by the ruling party for its own interest. Hence, he defined law as what is right and is the same in all states with the same meaning as the interest of the party established in power.  Stumpf affirms that, “what is right is the same everywhere, the interest of the stronger party”5. That is the reduction of morality to power, an inevitable logical consequence of the progressive radicalism of the sophists, which led them to a nihilistic attitude toward truth and ethics.</p> <p></p> <p>1.6.2 Socrates (470-399BC)</p> <p>He was the first great moral philosopher among the Greeks. Though he wrote nothing, his life and teaching made much impression on his disciples who penned down all about his philosophy and life. He was a man of confounding self- discipline and strong character who lived and died in accordance with his moral principles.  Omoregbe states that: </p> <p>He told the people of Athens that his mission was to do the greatest good to everyone of them, to persuade everyone among you that he must look into himself and seek virtue and wisdom before he looks to his private interests....6</p> <p> Seeking for the truth helps them to live a good life and knowledge is a means to this moral life. Then, virtue and good actions flow from knowledge, while wrongdoing is the result of ignorance.  The goal of life is happiness, and the only path that leads to it is virtue.  To sum it up, he was a man of great discipline (justice). He placed justice under the highest kind of virtue. Hence, Justice is a prerequisite for happiness and it culminates into love.</p> <p></p> <p>1.6.3 Aristophanes (448-380BC)</p> <p>He was a critique of the democracy of his time due to its ridiculous practice of Justice. His attack was highly based on the fact the democrats failed to abolish private property and the institution of marriage. For him, these were the causes of inequalities among the citizens. Thus, he advocates for communism where he believed that righteousness or justice could be maintained. And as he said it, “…will abolish poverty, eliminate the ubiquitous Athenian lawsuits, introduce genuine equality, and destroy crime”7. </p> <p></p> <p>For him, there was nothing natural about war, for it destroyed so large a part of Athenian life due to the fact that men had departed from the paths of justice, which had somehow been formerly enshrined in the traditional order8. He advocates for the restoration of old order, thereby eliminating both the disease of the polis internally and the disintegration caused by war in the external scene. Advocating for equal share and proposition of communism where he thought that Justice would be maintained in its fullest.</p> <p>                    </p> <div><br/><div> <p>1  Cf. S. E.

Chinua Achebe summarized it thus in his book “The Trouble with Nigeria” that, “the problem with Nigeria is simply and squarely a failure of leadership.”[1]</p> <p>In a global level, Oyebola minced no words when he said in his, “Blackman’s Dilemma” that, “very poor leadership appears to be the Blackman’s greatest problem.”[2] </p> <p> Achebe, articulated it further as the inability of the leaders to rise to their responsibility:</p> <p>There is nothing basically wrong with the Nigerian land or climate or water or air or anything else. The Nigerian problem is the unwillingness or inability of its leaders to rise to the responsibility, to the challenges of personal example, which are the hallmarks of true leadership. [3]</p> <p></p> <p>Lack of genuine leadership has been chorusly condemned and generally blamed for poverty and the travails of the Nigeria society. There is no doubt that Nigeria’s or Africa’s problem is due to lack of leadership. Rev. C. Kingston Ekeke, Nigerian-Atlanta based pastor observed that there are at least three main areas of failure in Nigeria’s leadership. For him they include: “lack of bold and courageous leadership, lack of moral ingredients of leadership and premature exposure to leadership.”[4]</p> <p>Our country is doing little to develop the younger generation on the act of leadership. No one wants to take the risk for the survival of our country. The few who want to demand for their right are being pursued about. Think of Alhaji Mujaheeden Dokubo Asari, the fearless and outspoken leader of the militant Ijaw youth who has persistently and passionately called for an independent state of Ijaw people and peaceful separation of Ijaw people from Nigeria. </p> <p>          Chief Ralph Uwazuruike, the leader of the revived movement for the actualisation of the sovereign state of Biafra (MASSOB) is not left out. There is nothing like press freedom in the dictionary of Nigerian leaders. The military dictator of Abacha was able to silence the people of Ogoni after the brutal killing of Ken Saro Wiwa, a man of intellectual ability, and his Ogoni compatriots.</p> <p>Most of those who were at the helm of affairs both at the federal and state levels were retired military men who were trained …to defend the nation from external and internal aggressions. Their war-war style of administration instead of the jaw- jaw method practiced by civilized human beings took this country many years back.[5] </p> <p>Many of our leaders, weighed down by avalanche of criticisms, always fall out with the Press. Think of several imprisonments of human rights defenders like Gani Fawhinmi, Femi Falana, and Baba Omojola. Nations must certainly grow out of challenges and criticisms. </p> <p>Many Nigerians are yet to enjoy much of the dividends of democracy such as good roads, pipe borne water, rural electrification, healthcare services due to the poor performance of our leaders. For our leaders, all these matter not. Today millions of Nigerians would not be starving to death if our leaders had known that there primary duty is to care for the masses and not to enrich their foreign accounts and western mentors. Regrettably, all they are interested in is having masters degree in travelling outside the state, competing on who becomes the widest traveller, and making every possible plan to handover a state bereft of infrastructure.</p> <p>Now that we have seen that our problem is that of leadership, we have to implore the idea of one of the prominent political theorist, Plato -philosopher king.                    </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2     AIM OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The most urgent issue in Nigeria currently seems to be the issue on how to address the problem of leadership. Having done away with military leadership, Nigerians thought that embracing democratic rule would bring to us a responsive and responsible political institution that would promote a government that is accountable, government that would prevent corruption, respect human and civil rights, and ensure popular sovereignty, but the reverse is the case. In view of this, the aim of this work is to see how the issues of corruption, incompetent leadership, tribalism and nepotism, since they remained the most difficult problems in Nigeria leadership system, could be addressed.</p> <p>          For most Nigerians however, the pressing problems of everyday survival remain the highest immediate priority. And how could such immediate priority get to us without effective leadership and management? Nigeria is undoubtedly endowed with abundant human and natural resources to address its problems. The solution for addressing its problems and so consolidate democratic governance in the federal republic lies in having a government that works on the principles of good governance and is most especially, accountable to the Nigerian people. </p> <p>          Leadership crisis has done more harm than good in this nation of ours. The paupers are marginalized, men are shouting, women are screaming, children are crying- it is chaotic. The most baffling and awful of all is that Nigeria has all that it requires to be great, but who can bell the cat? Who can lead the people of Nigeria out of this dungeon? Our leaders have lost the quintessence of true leadership in pursuit of shadows. We have not truly had any significant input into the design and structure of our polity. Consequently, Nigeria is gradually but inevitably dwindling into mediocrity and ineffectiveness. Our leaders are no longer servants but masters. There is utter disregard for Ojukwu’s advice that </p> <p>Those who aspire to lead must bear in mind the fact that they are servants and as such cannot ever be greater than the people, their masters.[6]</p> <p></p> <p>In his political philosophy, Plato thinks that the most qualified in the state should be the person to rule. So, this work is aimed at bringing to lime light the need for someone who can pilot the affairs effectively and should be entrusted to take up the task.</p> <p>Following the trend of Plato, those who have the greatest of the great qualities should have the first place unless they fail in some other respect, and for the scripture, when the good man is in power the people will rejoice.</p> <p><b>1.2            </b><b>SCOPE OF THE RESEARCH</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>One could recall that the major problems witnessed in the world; first and second world wars were all as a result of leadership tussles. As a matter of fact, these had made great thinkers to examine and propound various leadership theories that seem to be the best and are widely accepted form of leaderships. It is on this regard that I wish to dwell basically on Plato’s political theory with regard to leadership. </p> <p>The range of this work embraces both the pre-colonial and the post-colonial era in Nigeria political history. Plato’s political theory is brought in to juxtapose it with Nigerian circumstance. So, within the limit of this work, attention will be given not only to Plato’s political theory but also to Nigerian political situation. </p> <p>I will be indebted to justice if I fail to mention some of our political leaders who have not done well both in the past and the present administrations.  We shall try to present also the possible causes of leadership failure etc. </p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.4     METHODOLOGY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Because this research delves into the political theory of Plato, we shall try to employ expository method. Moreover, it has to be critically evaluative, historically discursive and philosophically interpretative. Some analysis will also be carried out. </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5     DIVISION OF WORK</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This work surveys critically and carefully Plato’s idea of “philosopher-king” and “Nigerian leadership crisis”. And in order to ensure that no stone is left unturned, the work is divided into five chapters.</p> <p>Like many other political philosophers, Plato recognizes the need for a civil society - to - be. But unlike many, and especially in this particular polity, Plato maintained that if a civil society must arise, it must be an ideal and must be perfect. Its leaders must be worthy of emulation and well trained. In view of this, chapter one of this research work takes a look at how actually the whole work will look like-the aim of the research, the methodology and scope.</p> <p>In the second phase of this work, comes Plato’s political theory. There we shall see the composition of any given political society.</p> <p>Chapter three is devoted to Nigerian leaders and their style of leadership, beginning from the pre-colonial, post-colonial to present era.</p> <p>The fourth chapter is where I tried to tinker Plato’s political theory on Nigerian circumstances. In this chapter, we see how possible it is, and the relevance Plato’s idea to Nigerian leaders. </p> <p>The final chapter deals with systematic criticism and evaluation of Plato’s piece. Here also, I offered my own contributions. </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.6     ANALYSIS OF CONCEPTS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>It is often presumed that we know, whereas we do not know. In view of this, there is the need to give some explanation to some basic concepts used in this work.</p> <p>Again, terms or words sometimes assume different connotation and meaning depending on the context they are used. This makes it sometimes difficult to know exactly what a particular word stands for. </p> <p>It is on this ground that I wish to explain briefly, some of the words used, or even, some of the words that would be of help to us in understanding the work. Prominent among them are:</p> <p></p> <p>·                    <b>PHILOSOPHY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The term philosophy is an amalgamation of two Greek words “philein” and “Sophia”, meaning “to love” and  “wisdom” respectively. Etymologically, it means “love of wisdom” when combined together. It is a word Plato attributed to his master Socrates, who called his students lovers of wisdom.</p> <p>In a more technical sense, it could be the ultimate or essential nature of all reality by the use of natural reason.[7] The concern of philosophy distinguishes it from other sciences. In a wider use of the term, one can say that the habitual activity of human being flows directly from his philosophy of life. Each person thinks about life, and the sum total of this thinking constitutes an attitude towards life, which in general shapes and guides his deliberate actions. </p> <p>Nevertheless, that a man sometimes does the wise or right thing is no evidence that he possesses philosophical wisdom; rather what justifies him is his ability to give grounds for his action that will stand up to cross examination. In addition, philosophy proceeds by criticizing received opinions, clarification and critical evaluation of belief and concepts. For John Dewey, it is a “criticism of criticism”.</p> <p>          Apart from the above, B.C. Okolo defines philosophy as,</p> <p>…that department of knowledge that deals with ultimate reality, or with the most general laws, causes and principles of things. In its general tasks, philosophy tries to give a coherent and systematic account of human experience and what grounds it.[8]</p> <p></p> <p>·                    <b>POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Political philosophy is the rational application of philosophical thinking to ideas about the state. It is a rational enquiry into all that concern man and his life in relation with his fellow man in a state. Unlike political science or sociology, it goes beyond the mere collection and descriptive explanation of political phenomena. It belongs to the higher level of scientific enquiry, an enquiry into the ideals.</p> <p>          Political philosophy inquires into the universal nature of the political phenomena. This is done with the aim to clarify concepts and critically evaluate beliefs thereby justify either acceptance of a belief or its rejection in relation to the state.  It is, therefore, both normative and prescriptive. It seeks to mould the totality of political phenomena to accord with some vision of political systems, principals and ideologies.</p> <p>            Political philosophy deals with ideal forms of governments and social organization. It treats, for instance, the essential features of various types of governments such as democracy, socialism, monarch, fascism, communism, etc.  It investigates such questions as, what is the state? What is the common good? Why should men live in society? What are natural rights? Etc.<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>·                    <b>NIGERIA</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Flora Shaw, Sir Fredrick Lugard’s wife suggested the name Nigeria, which was a farrago of two words “Niger” and “area”.</p> <p>Nigeria is located in the Western Coast of Africa on the shores of the Gulf of Guinea. The Sahara desert bound it on the north and on the south by the Atlantic Ocean. Its total area is approximately 356,000 square miles, slightly more than the combined areas of France and Germany – both west and East Germany. Its name is derived from its main inland waterway, the river Niger, which flows some 2,600miles from the hills of Sierra Leone into the enormous fluvial complex of the Niger delta.</p> <p>The republic of Nigeria has the second largest economy on the continent and the most populous sub-Saharan country in West Africa. Nigeria has a federal structure with thirty-six (36) states, with the federal government located at Abuja. A multi-religious society, it has 250 ethnic groups speaking over 350 languages and dialects.[9] It is important to note that it was these groups that were, on the imposition of the colonial rule, merged to produce a modern Nigerian state. The major languages are English, Igbo, Yoruba and Hausa.</p> <p>·                    <b>LEADERSHIP</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Should our society be without leaders? If such were to be possible, then chaos and anarchy would ensue, resulting into nothing less than the Hobbesian state of nature. In view of this, ‘a scrupulous leader’ must man our society with a proven moral integrity for the full self-actualisation of man in the same society. Now the question is, who is a leader?</p> <p>          From the point of view of etymology, the term ‘leader’ stems from the Greek word “proagw” (proagoo) meaning  ‘ I lead forth’ or ‘ I go before’, and the Latin common noun “dux” –leader. </p> <p>Various authors have attempted a definition of this word in different ways. According to Julius Gould William,</p> <p>Leadership denotes the occupying of a statue and the active performance of a role that mobilizes more or less organized, collective and voluntary effort towards the attainment of a shared goal and objective.[10]</p> <p></p> <p>This implies that the activity of a leader should be directed towards attainment of something greater. To buttress this, Sumbye Kapena in his book “How To Be A Wise Leader”, asserts:</p> <p>Leadership is the process of directing the behaviour of another person or persons towards the accomplishment of some objective. This leadership is exercised whenever a person influences the behaviour of another person or a group of people towards achieving an objective. [11]</p> <p></p> <p>          Generally, leadership could be seen as directing, mobilizing and controlling the activities of a group of people with a common interest. It is the pathfinder of the people or society.</p> <p>          Leadership could be associated with any organized group, ranging from family, peer group, social and religious organization, state and country. And the crux of its problem centres substantially upon the soundness of the leader’s goal, purpose and aim.</p> <p>            In human society, leadership is a polyglot process involving ‘knowing the way, showing the way, and going the way’. [12] We can see that it involves one in toto.  Such is the case because, “one essential demand of leadership is to be like a waste-paper basket, a dustbin where all dirt and rubbish are heaped.”[13] </p> <p>Leadership does not mean wealth, great education or position, says J. Keller. Rather, it means initiative, willingness to serve, and an idealism rooted in divine Truth.[14] </p> <p></p> <p><br/></p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] C.

No doubt Ojukwu said that; </p> <p>Since Nigerians took their own destiny into their own hands, every national intercourse has borne the sterile aspect of a<i> coitus interruptus</i>-a primitive method but very effective in preventing the birth of a new nation.[1]</p> <p>For a strong political, economic, and infrastructural development, the various ‘nations’ that make up Nigeria should be united to achieve these. Several efforts have been made, albeit some are pseudo-efforts, to see that Nigeria is united. However, tribalism has constantly threatened the road to Nigerian unity. </p> <p></p> <p>At independence, and subsequent first republic, Nigerians had expected that the political actors then would have used that period as a time for laying a solid foundation for a united Nigeria. This never was; rather the so-called father founders considered it paramount to play tribal politics that stunted the growth of the nation. Nigeria is basically below the waters today because wonderful opportunities that would have fostered national development were dashed at the early days of her life as an independent nation.</p> <p></p> <p>A good number of politicians in these early days of this nation did not consider Nigeria a reality, let alone, work for her unity. This was evident in their utterances then. Some of them are Obafemi Awolowo, Ahmadu Bello, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Yakubu Gowon, to mention a few. Commenting on these differences, Gowon said, </p> <p>Suffice it to say that putting all consideration to test, political, economic, as well as social, the base for unity is not there[2].</p> <p>On his own part, Ahmadu Bello, the Sarduana of Sokoto and a tribalist par excellence said, </p> <p>Nigeria is so large and the people so varied that no person with any real intellectual integrity would be so foolish as to pretend that he speaks for the county as a whole.[3]</p> <p></p> <p>Still skeptical about this word unity, Alhaji Tafawa Balewa, the first prime minister said “ since the amalgamation of the southern and northern provinces in 1914, Nigeria has existed as one country on paper”[4]</p> <p>One cannot forget so easily the ignoble statement of Awolowo that “Nigeria is a mere geographical expression”[5]. These are not the only ones; they have a lot of disciples, however, their positions made them outstanding. In fact, they made these statements when they have the opportunity to retreat into tribe in order to check their more successful rivals from other parts of the country.</p> <p></p> <p>Tribalism retards development especially political development, and since other developments hinge on that, all other aspects of development will also be grounded. A lot of instances from the first republic up until the present third republic show how tribalism has left Nigeria in a comatose. First, it is generally believed that Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe won the premiership of the then Western region, but could not occupy the position because he was of the “wrong” tribe, albeit he showed a bad legacy by rushing to the East and manipulating himself into power by edging out Chief Udoma. In 1964, a group of young Nigerian officer cadets mainly Northerners, were declared academically unfit and repatriated by the Canadian military authorities. These cadets were declared commissioned by the Nigerian Federal Government no sooner than they had arrived at the Ikeja Airport[6]. In 1961, the premier of the North and Sarduana of Sokoto paid a visit to the Royal military Academy, Sand Hurst and wanted to meet with the Nigerian cadets. When he eventually appeared to see his fellow Nigerians, he asked an embarrassing tribal question to one of them: where do you come from? From Nigeria, was the answer. But the premier was not satisfied, so he went on, where exactly in Nigerian?[7]. In 1962, the then Federal Minister of State for the Army, Alhaji Tanko Galadima, officially visited the Nigerian Military Training College [NMTC] Kaduna.  As he was about to leave, he presented both pocket money and kola nuts to only the Northern officer cadets[8]. As expected, this caused great ripples in the army then. In 1960, shortly after independence, the then prime minister, Alhaji Tafawa Balewa, directed the principal of Kings College, Lagos, Mr. P.H Davies, to secure available places annually, for at least fifteen boys from the North, whether or not they passed the required entrance examination[9].</p> <p>Collaborating the existence of tribalism in the army, Janet Mba-Afolabi said:</p> <p>records have shown that the army is one in which an officer’s ethnic origin determines the nature of strategic appointments he holds.[10]</p> <p></p> <p>The absence of Federal presence in certain areas of the country has no other reason but tribalism. The whole of South-east has up until this stage, no international airport or seaport irrespective of the fact that there is a big market they will serve. The federal roads in this same zone and other zones are death paths rather than high ways. It is even a “divine decree” that people from certain areas can never be among the service chiefs, inspector of police, defence and agriculture ministers to mention just a few. Many of the policies initiated by various governments had, in all intent and purposes, tribal undertones. A case in point is the indigenization policy. </p> <p></p> <p>In the various states of the federation, there is rancour everywhere because a particular part of the state will like to take all. People tend to forget that “we cannot dominate; all we can do is to accommodate”.[11] These instances show the extent we have allowed tribalism to take us. It is against these that Gbulie observed that:</p> <p>… the most dreadful of our county’s insuperable monsters was tribalism, Nigeria’s number one killer disease, a canker worm as old as the hills, the fundamental factor of the problems of Nigerian unity.[12]</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2            </b><b>The Meaning of Tribalism</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p>Etymologically, the term tribalism has its root and origin from the Latin “tribus” (tribe) meaning “one third” which originally referred to one of the three peoples that united to found Rome. The <i>Encyclopedia Americana</i> defines tribe as ‘a group of families who have a feeling of community through occupying a common territory and following similar customs.’ In the same vein, the <i>Chambers 21st Century Dictionary</i> defines tribe ‘as a group of people, families, clans or communities who share social, economic, political ties, and often a common ancestor and who usually have a common culture, dialect and leader.’ More recently, the term tribe has been applied to any people having a common territory and customs who are not part of a state society. One thing that is basic with tribe is that the members of a tribe are usually held together by common dialect, customs, social, economic, political sameness as well as observing major religious ceremonies. Tribe and tribal have been observed as convenient terms for indicating that a people still follows customs rather than state law. </p> <p></p> <p>In view of the relatedness of tribe with ethnicity, it is pertinent to define ethnicity as well. According to the <i>Chambers 21st Century Dictionary</i> ‘ethnicity means relating to or having a common race or cultural tradition, seen from the point of view of race, rather than nationality.’ In other words an ethnic group consists of a people who share the same culture, and we know, culture comprises the whole gamut of what the people do. This being the case, tribe and ethnicity are interwoven. This perhaps explains the reason why Ojukwu used both of them interchangeably. In this write up therefore, the two terms will be used to express the same idea.</p> <p></p> <p>Tribalism is the extreme and obsessive protection of one’s tribe to the detriment of the whole nation. The <i>chambers 21st century dictionary</i> defines it ‘as the system of tribes as a way of organizing society, the feeling of belonging to a tribe.’ It is a political attitude guided by tribal customs. While tribe sets out to define a people, tribalism is mainly that negative political attitude that tends to favour only persons from one’s tribe. But this usually retards national growth.  Tribalism promotes such evils as social injustice, inefficiency, moral decadence, unproductivity, and mediocrity. Tribalism thwarts every effort towards unity and integration in any multi-ethnic/tribal nation.</p> <p></p> <p>In an attempt to explain tribalism, Achebe has it that “tribalism is discrimination against a citizen because of his place of birth”.[13] This for me is a practical definition of tribalism, but something appears to be missing in it. One’s place of birth may not be his tribe. A Yoruba may be born in Onitsha. This does not make him an Igbo. Tribalism applies more to one’s tribe of origin. A lot of southerners are born in the North, but they greatly feel the pains of discrimination irrespective of the fact that that is their place of birth. Likewise, a lot of Northerners have various places in the south as their places of birth, yet they are seen as strangers. For Achebe, </p> <p>tribalism manifests itself in acts such as preventing a citizen from living or working anywhere in his country, or from participating in the social, political, economic life of the community he chooses to live.[14]</p> <p></p> <p>In what seems to be the most insightful explanation of tribalism, Ojukwu has it that </p> <p>tribalism is nothing other than ethnic nationalism i.e. a limited, constricted nationalism, a stunted growth. It means a nationalism that has become fixated in adolescence. Tribalism is a consciousness, which emerged as the broadest viewpoint in a society organized on personalities. Tribalism, as a social philosophy, is based on the construction of a series of imaginary boundaries which establish the “us” and the “them” dichotomy.[15]</p> <p></p> <p>These explanations show that tribalism is such a negative force. It divides a nation more than it builds it together. One factor that encourages tribalism, I think, is the fear for the truth about how the various components of Nigeria are; we are afraid to come together.  Many Nigerians, no matter the intellectual heights, are afraid of coming together as a united entity. Hence, tribalism has become the proper avenue of dealing with this fear.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3     Dangers of Tribalism</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Tribalism breeds a lot of dangers impeding the overall development of a country. In Nigeria, for instance, tribalism performs the function of a political tool. According to Ojukwu  “tribalism manifests itself more as a function of politics than as an innate xenophobia amongst the various groups in Nigeria”[16]. Achebe adds that </p> <p>a word will stay around as long as there is work for it to do, in Nigeria, in spite of our protestations, there is plenty of work for tribe, our threatening gestures against it have been premature, half hearted, or plain deceitful[17].</p> <p> </p> <p>There is some work for tribe in Nigeria, and as it does its work, there are bound to be many effects on those who use it and those on whom it is used. Hence, below are some of the dangers of tribalism in Nigeria.</p> <p>1.3.1    <i>Tribalism Leads To Disunity</i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p>Since the independence, every regime sets out to achieve the unity of the country. But these regimes fail regrettably in this project. Most Nigerians have intense desire for this unity, but at forty-five years of existence, we have lived more disunited than we had expected. It is the desire for this unity that has taken Nigeria through various experiments namely: the North-South dichotomy of early colonization, federalism or rather pseudo-federalism, the famous three regions structure and later four, the unitary system of government, the imposition of a twelve state structure, nineteen state structure, a twenty-one state structure, a thirty state structure, and at present, a thirty-six state structure, constitutional conferences particularly the 1995 constitutional conferences, and the just concluded national political reform conference. All these efforts have been to ensure unity, but we have always had pseudo-unity. Disunity comes in when people are attached to their tribes. As Ojukwu said, </p> <p>the biggest obstacle to unity is that which is commonly known and referred to as tribalism.[18] </p> <p>Commenting on the dangers of disunity, he noted that</p> <p>disunity is a danger that the people of this country can no longer endure. Disunity has laid to waste all the noble dreams of our founding fathers. Disunity has nullified all our efforts at national reconstruction and disunity has led us into war. Disunity has also destroyed our peace. The consequences of disunity are too terrible to contemplate and too obvious to require any further demonstration. The legalized barbarism of the contemporary Nigerian situation is the fruit of disunity.[19]  </p> <p></p> <p>The first danger posits by tribalism is disunity. This is not a mere ideological disagreement, but the type that constantly makes us stand “on a soil soaked in fratricidal blood”.[20] </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3.2    </b><i>Tribalism Enthrones Mediocrity</i><b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p>Tribalism favours mediocrity. However, this advantage is the type that destroys not only the persons involved, but also the nation. Mediocrity reigns where tribe of origin is placed over and beyond merit and competence. Tribalism encourages mediocrity mainly in the award of contracts and in employment and promotions. Two contractors may be campaigning for a particular contract, and most often the less qualified “contractor” wins the job, while the one with better qualifications goes home a loser. The amateur contractor wins because he is of the “right” tribe while the other is not. As expected, the so-called contractor eventually messes up the job. In all these, </p> <p>the greatest sufferer is the nation itself which has to contain the legitimate grievance of a wronged citizen, accommodate the incompetence of a favoured citizen, and more important and of greater scope, endure a general decline of morale and subversion of efficiency caused by an erratic system of performance and reward.[21]</p> <p></p> <p>The same thing is experienced in employments. These days, certificates worth nothing once you know somebody in a higher position, your area of specialization not withstanding. It is still a living memory that Bola Ige was appointed a minister to man a sensitive power and steel ministry, despite the fact that he never specialized in that. At the early stage of our nationhood, the effects of tribalism with regard to mediocrity were so evident. Lamenting about the existence then Gbulie observed that </p> <p>the terms ‘long legs’ and ‘as man knows man’ had been injected into the vocabulary of the Nigerian public. Thus, double standards had been created which, in turn led to frustration among millions of Nigerians. Mediocrity now sat unchallenged on the throne—mediocrity that was sustained by blind leadership. For merit meant nothing. Nor did talent and industry mean anything.[22]</p> <p></p> <p> Against these backdrops, Ojukwu maintained that:</p> <p>no amount of sanctimonious injunctions and no amount of erudite constitution-writing, can lift Nigeria from her mediocrity, to the greatest she deserves.[23] </p> <p>1.3.3    <i>Tribalism Creates Social Injustice </i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p></p> <p>Tribalism goes with a great deal of social injustice.  A lot of injustices have been perpetrated in Nigeria, as a result of our myopic comprehension of the term tribe. Some Nigerians, because of their tribe, can never rise to he position of permanent secretaries in their ministries, some can never become the inspector general of police, defense and agriculture ministers. Certain industries must not be sited in certain places, and if they were put in place, a substandard firm would be assigned to handle it. This kind of situation does not help for any development. </p> <p></p> <p>1.3.4    <i>Tribalism Retards Individual /National Development</i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p></p> <p>A nation cannot exist without the citizens. In the same way, Nigeria cannot exist without the concerted mental and physical efforts of Nigerians. Because tribalism is separatist in nature, it retards the development of the nation. Tribalism retards development because in such a situation like Nigeria, due process is thrown to the winds and as such the people who are qualified for certain positions to keep the nation moving will not be given the opportunity. This being the case, the individual’s potentialities are left undeveloped, which in turn affects the entire nation.</p> <p></p> <p>1.3.5    <i>Tribalism Promotes Cultural Underdevelopment</i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p></p> <p>Variety, they say, is the spice of life. One major advantage that accrues from the existence of many tribes is the capacity of producing a variety of cultures that will eventually add more beauty to the national life. The languages and cultures of the various peoples that make up Nigeria have in different ways something to offer for national integration and development. Every culture ought to be open to other cultures, and through that way grows. But when people are too attached to their tribes as well as cultures to the exclusion of others, the cultures will hardly experience any growth.  The silent adherence to tribe has made this possible, and as such, the various cultures remain dormant and underdeveloped.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>1.3.6    <i>Tribalism Leads To Disintegration</i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p></p> <p>In a tribalism-infested society, there is always uneven distribution of the available resources, denial of equal opportunities, double standard,  the born-to-rule mentality, and neglect of persons from other tribes. In such a scenario, some people tend to be marginalized. As expected, they will seek to defend themselves. And one way of defending themselves is to assert their autonomy and work towards secession. In this way, the things that hold the country together will start to fall apart. This is exactly what is happening in Nigeria.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4            </b><b>The Positive Aspect of Tribalism</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p>Tribalism is a word every individual who believes in Nigeria as a united country abhores.  It would be very difficult for any Nigerian to envisage something good in it. The general understanding of this word has been and still remains in the negative.</p> <p></p> <p>On the contrary, the term tribalism is not entirely bad, if anything, it is the way people use it that is bad. “Tribe is very natural and normal; no one is without a tribe.”[24]  According to Azikiwe, the fact of tribe is not specific to Africa alone, it is a universal fact. However, irrespective of tribal differences, the common identity in the association with one another as a nation should uphold and endure.</p> <p></p> <p>Discussing tribalism as a pragmatic instrument for national unity, Azikiwe maintained that tribe has a positive meaning, the positive meaning of community. This means that tribalism could then become a pragmatic instrument for national unity not disunity. Thus Azikiwe said:</p> <p>if the concept and practice of tribalism would be a mode of adaptation to reality, then tribalism is an instrument for national unity.[25] </p> <p></p> <p>Still for Azikiwe, tribe is an anthropological fact. A tribe is made up of race, language and culture, and these, as it were, are the major anthropological factors that determine the level of integrability and assimilability among the tribes. Countries such as Switzerland, United States of America, U.S.S.R are examples of countries that are made up of less integrated tribes. Yet, they maintain their identities as single nations. This goes to show that over two hundred and fifty tribes that make up Nigeria are not disasters but great assets.</p> <p></p> <p>In this line of thinking, Achebe notes also that </p> <p>everyone agrees that there are manifestations of tribal culture, which we cannot condemn such as peculiar habits of dress, food, language, and music[26].</p> <p>These and many other manifestations are positive and desirable and confer richness on our national culture. They add to the beauty richly embedded in African culture.</p> <p></p> <p>Tribalism has some positive benefits, and for Nigeria to achieve the desired positive aspect in tribalism, Azikiwe was of the view that loyalty to tribe must be transferred to loyalty to Nigeria as a nation. This will be well achieved when, according to him, “permanent guarantees of a constitutional, political, and economic nature are met”[27].</p> <p></p> <p>Our differences are therefore assets rather than tools for destruction. The practice of tribalism, I will maintain, is a defective attitude of the mind that eventually manifests itself in the utterances and actions of men.</p> <p><br/></p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] E.

If this be a regular occurrence, is it not the case that we may become suspicious of all claims to certainty? But then, the history of human opinion rightly forms the most fertile source material for the development of any theory of knowledge. Yet, no theory or belief has proved so full of absurdity, that it lacked its own disciples. The history of science is itself replete with theories priory accepted by the sages of old but later on discredited.</p> <p></p> <p>Philosophers are therefore concerned with the basis of all knowledge claims, so that they might arrive at a consensus for judging these claims. For it, much of what had been taken as certain has instead been proved false or sceptical. Then, what can we really know and how can we really ever be certain?</p> <p></p> <p>Such were the feelings of David Hume, as he posited his philosophy of “impression and ideas” of which this work is to throw more light on.  </p> <p>The philosophy of David Hume then is both an attack on rationalism and a “reducto and absurdum” of empiricism since the empiricism he defines is one-sided as the rationalism he attacks. He frankly confessed his dissatisfaction with his position in a passage which seems to be the starting point for a consideration of the outline of his work.:</p> <p>There are two principles which I cannot render consistent nor is it in my power to renounce either of them, namely, that all our distinct perceptions are distinct existence, and that the mind never perceives any real connection among distinct existence.[1]</p> <p></p> <p>Thus, the appeal to those two principles and the understanding of them is the key of Hume’s work. The first principle, that what we can distinguish in perception is distinguished in existence is subjective. I rather see it as making the articulations and distinctions of things depend on the distinctions of the mind. But the second principle is based on the opposite assumptions.</p> <p></p> <p>Hume’s whole account of causation depends on his perception that causation is not a relation among the mind’s own ideas, in the sense that it can be got at by any kind of introspection or reflection. Thus, the result of Hume’s theory of causation seems to be subjective when he reduces the conception of necessary connection to a feeling, and this is precisely because he believes that causation is a relation between real existences and cannot be perceived by the mind. About causation, he said: </p> <p>Causation is a relation, which can be traced beyond our senses and informs us of existence and objects, which we do not see or feel.[2]</p> <p></p> <p>In Hume’s philosophy, the theory of the “association of ideas” plays  the most important part and was the most recognized in the later  history of English Empiricism. No wonder Hume was constantly making association the work of the understanding and through this theory, he succeeded in narrowing the fundamental principles of knowledge to mere feeling. His account of the general principle; also lobbied his explanation of particular instances of cause and effect. Thus, little did he mean to think that by causation, we only mean constant conjunction, but that we sometimes infer causation from the observation of only one instance.</p> <p></p> <p>In his own period, Hume affected the inheritance of the Cartesian rationalism into empiricism and made atomization of perception the very nerve of his philosophy. From this insight, he viewed every question especially metaphysical and proposed every solution.</p> <p></p> <p>It is then our task in this work, to expose the implications of the concept of his “impressions – ideas” theory, which evidently forms his basic epistemological stand. We shall therefore see how plausible they are with a critical mind.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.1     Statement of the Problem</b> </p> <p>The genesis of the history of philosophy is the treatment of the Ionian philosophers whose main concern was to determine the basic constitution of the material substances of the universe[3].</p> <p></p> <p>In this immortal search, Thales posited water, Anaximander posited air, and Pythagoras came up with units i.e. the mathematical numbers. The departure of Pythagoras and his subsequent followers was a gathering storm, which ushered in a sharp digression in philosophical inquiry. Attention now shifted to the problem of change and permanence. In this pre-Socratic era philosophy was more cosmocentric in nature.</p> <p></p> <p>Plato in the ancient period posited the world of forms, saying that the real things exist in the worlds of ideas. Socrates also on his part believes that knowledge is certain, objective and universal. It is quite possible for man to acquire knowledge. His was the dialectical method i.e. beginning from particular cases and concluding with universal knowledge.</p> <p></p> <p>In the Mediaeval period, Augustine toes the line of Plato. Augustine distrusted the senses as source of knowledge. The senses in his view do not give us certain knowledge. The objects of knowledge are not the material things of this world, but the external ideas in the mind of God.[4] St Thomas is said by some scholars to have succeeded merely in Christianizing Aristotle. These mediaeval or Christian philosophers were influenced by the church supremacy at their time.</p> <p></p> <p>In this period, the movement was actually a rebirth of knowledge, a revival of interest and zeal for knowledge. It began with a renewed interest in Ancient writings and eventually developed into humanistic and scientific movements, with emphasis on man rather than God. Two important schools flourished in this period.</p> <p></p> <p>The continental rationalists (Descartes Spinoza and Leibniz) adopted the mathematical method and believed that reason alone, using the mathematical method can attain truth without the aid of the senses. They denied that sense perception was necessary in order to attain knowledge. The empiricists on the other hand, asserted that all-genuine knowledge derive from sense perception. Neither Locke nor Berkeley was a consistent empiricist. But Hume was and he brought empiricism to its logical conclusion.[5] He tried to portray this by his philosophy of impression and idea. When we perceive objects, they make impression on us. Ideas are formed from these impressions. Whether he succeeded in doing this is what we shall be looking at in this work. We shall be evaluating critically his position about impression and idea, within which we shall portray the explicit implication of his position. </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2     Purpose</b></p> <p>My aim or purpose in this research now is to expose the implications of the concept of Hume’s impressions and ideas theory. We shall therefore see how plausible they are, with a critical mind. This work will seek to x-ray the extent to which pure knowledge can be gotten only through impression or that we can only know something through experience and without impression, there will be no ideas.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.3</b>     <b>Scope</b></p> <p>This research does not intend to give an exhaustive study of David Hume’s philosophies. Rather, it centered on his theory of impression and idea. How he tried to resolve the diverse conceptions of philosophers on the acquisition of pure knowledge.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>1.4     <b>The Methodology of the Work</b></p> <p>In this sensitive philosophical discourse, we shall make use of expository method in understanding the notion of impression and ideas and Hume’s argument in denying and rejecting reason as a way of attaining knowledge. Again, we shall use critical method in evaluating Hume’s view. In general, the methodology is going to be scholarly, academic, and philosophical.</p> <p></p> <p>This research work is divided into five chapters. Chapter one deals mainly with the introduction and the framework of the entire study, chapter two deals with the literature review. This takes into account the contributions of other philosophers on the related topic in the various epochs. Chapter three x-rays the Epistemological foundation of Hume’s philosophy, chapter four centered on the impossibility of the metaphysics while chapter five gives an evaluation and critical conclusion to the work.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] D.

It is not easy for one to escape the influence of his epoch or contemporary world. Hegel himself is not innocent of this. His historical judgments and moral evaluations were in fact as much conditioned by time, place and personality, as those of other philosophers.</p> <p></p> <p>However, in virtue of the nature and scope of our topic, this portion will rather concentrate more on the <i>de facto</i> German political condition which presented itself glaringly before Hegel and to which his political thought was nothing but a reaction.</p> <p>Hegel made a comprehensive and scholarly case study of his native German state and discovered the multiple ills that overwhelmed it. He lamented that people considered private property and interest to   be indeed common to all society so as to justify their selfish ends[1].</p> <p></p> <p>He also saw the pseudo-democratic spirit that shrouded the state which he thought would engender more threat to freedom than ever. In effect, he wished to eradicate all these. He wanted to substitute them with a magnificent theory of power vested upon the state and the monarch.</p> <p>From his experiences of the French Revolution, Hegel deplored the consequences of the Revolution. He even tagged it a ‘glorious dawn,’ but he also meant that at the inception of the revolutionary wars, Germany was not free from the revolutionary armies’ invasion. The invasion came up when Hegel was twenty-one.  </p> <p></p> <p>On another note, Germany was infested with a myriad of petty despotisms that were loosely linked together as the Holy Roman Empire under the leadership of Francis I of Austria. Marcus enumerating this noted that:</p> <p>The Reich[2] consisted of Austria and Prussia, the prince Electors, 94 ecclesiastical and secular princes, 103 barons, 40 prelates, and 51 Reich towns, in sum it consisted of nearly 300 territories.[3]</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>Under this heteronomy of despotisms, Germany found it extremely hard to subsume their personal whims under a united national spirit. There was rather an evidence of porosity, individualism and weakness. In view of this Hegel as one of the contributors to the development of the German state   made this elegant remark;</p> <p>Without law and justice, without protection from arbitrary taxation, uncertain of the lives of our sons and our freedom and our rights, the existence of the despotic power, our existence lacking unity and a national spirit… This is the status quo of our nation.[4]                                                               </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Therefore, this was a period when people believed strongly in the divine right of kings even though they could not reach out for laws and justice. This means that rationality was conspicuously lacking and this manifested itself in the introduction of arbitrary taxations and insecurity. However, everyone yearned for the German reunification, which has for long eluded her even after the revolutionary wars during which Austria and Prussia were vanquished.    </p> <p>At this time when the French power was incumbent, Germany experienced much reformation. In Prussia, for instance, Von Stein, a liberal, was appointed chief adviser to the king, and he immediately abolished serfdom and reorganized the system of government. Following him was Von Hardenberg, who promised to give Prussia a representative constitution; but these hopes were obliterated completely after Napoleon’s defeat.</p> <p>On his own part, Frederick William III, the Prussian king lost interest in reform, and after years of delay, in 1823 he set up only provincial ‘estates’ which engaged only in advice, and in any case were completely dominated by land owners.</p> <p></p> <p>Moreover, in 1819, at a meeting at Carlsbad, all the German states agreed to censor repressive measures against those who advocated revolutionary ideas.  After observing all these, Hegel viewed that Germany has had a real genetically political cankerworm. He instantly detected these national defects of German character as ‘provincialism’ and ‘particularism,’ which, he said, are the causes of the empire’s weakness. </p> <p>He also observed that Germany, viewed from the cultural point of view, was a nation but it had not understood what it meant to subjugate parts to whole which was essential to (the) a national government. The central government, he noted, was weak because its power flowed from its parts. Even the existing constitution reflected nothing but an explicit subterfuge for weakness.</p> <p></p> <p>Thus, there was total individualism among the people and sheer sectionalism among corporations, estates, guilds and even religious sects. For this reason then Hegel identified this German particularism with an anarchical love of freedom which misconceived liberty as an absence of discipline and authority[5]. And this he contrasted with “true freedom”, which is to be found only within the bounds of a national state. Freedom as Hegel understood it had nothing to do with the individualism of English and French political thought but it was rather a quality reflected upon the individual by the national power of self-determination.</p> <p>In effect, Hegel saw Germany as revolving around what he termed the’ civil society’ with no greater aim than collective protection of its industrial property. He aimed at elevating Germany from its political and social trash to an organic natural state, the divine idea in the universe. Following his diagnosis of Germany’s weakness Hegel defined the state as a group which collectively protects its property. Its only essential powers are civil and military establishment sufficient to this end.[6]</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1.2 THE PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS</b>      </p> <p>Hegel’s treatment of most of the social issues can rightly be seen as a direct criticism and rejection of some of Rousseau’s liberal opinions. Rousseau had put forward his idea that man is born free but is everywhere in chains. For him man is naturally free. He captures his freedom as soon as he gets the opportunity. This freedom of the individual, ordained by nature, offers the general will. The general will is the will that discrete individual, that appear to be more powerful than their fellow individuals, and the less powerful individual falls the victim of  surrendering  to more powerful individual and as a result pay their obeisance to them. As it were, it was Rousseau who initiated the romantic cult of democracy. This led him to formulate the contractualist theory of the state against which </p> <p>Hegel would hold as a contrary view, one that is strictly organic. More so, the constitution of Germany showed clearly that   Hegel’s conception of the dialectic was controlled by a moral rather than a scientific purpose. Hegel explained that the object of the essay was to promote understanding of things as they are, to exhibit political history not as arbitrary but as necessary. The unhappiness of man is a frustration that arises from the discrepancy between what is and what he is feigned to believe ought to be. It occurs because he imagines that event is mere unrelated detail and not a “system ruled by a spirit.”[7] Its remedy comes with reconciliation, the realization that what is must be and the consciousness that what must be also ought to be. This is manifestly the principle which Hegel later summarized in his aphorism, “the real is rational and the rational is real”[8]   The authority that was fully conferred on the civil society, with the elimination of the state government as it were upheld by Rousseau was seen by Hegel as nothing but transitory means to and end and not the end itself. </p> <p>                                                                                                                        </p> <p>Thus, the absolute democracy of Rousseau was rightly criticized by Hegel. And the criticisms gave direction to Hegel’s philosophy of the organic state. This absolute democracy gave individuals the right to agree and form government of all citizens’ participation. This implies that there is no state outside the civil society, because all are decision makers. This form, according to Rousseau, accords well with individual inalienable freedom that should not be surrendered to another. Hegel found serious faults against this liberalist individualist absolute democracy. He saw its demolition and replacement as the hope of a new socio-political order,</p> <p><b>1.1.3 HEGEL’S AIM OF POLITICS</b>       <b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Hegel aimed at introducing a substantial change in the entire socio-political structure but with a special reference to Germany. To achieve this he brought in his new logic, the dialectic which is the underlying principle for validation of the historical necessity of a people’s national mentality and spirit.                                                                                        Again he wanted to present a view of the individual as an entity whose end is the absolute spirit, and without the existence of the    absolute spirit it automatically loses its authenticity as a substantial individual.</p> <p>                                                                                                                        Also the de facto German government which he says has not yet arrived at a national unity requires a binding force to achieve its organic structure. This, in fact, would elevate it to the level where it will be the teleology or the ‘entelechy’[9] of the individual. It would be the highest authority, the most moral being and the superlative synthesis of all families and civil societies.   </p> <p>At such a <i>stratum,</i> it will dedicate itself to the so-called Hegelian Nobel act of institutionalizing the common interest and defending it against all external and internal conflicts. Thus the state will not only embody or encapsulate its citizens but also pastures them like a flock. This then gave Hegel more courage to hold that the state is far superior to and qualitatively different from the civil society. That is why he said:</p> <p>The state is the actuality of concrete freedom. But concrete freedom consists in this, that personal individuality and its particular interests not only achieve their complete development and again explicit recognition for their right (as in the family and civil society) …they also pass over of  their own accord into the interests of the universal,… they know and will the universal. Even recognize it as their own substantive mind; they take it as their end and aim and are active in its pursuit. The result is that the universal does not prevail or achieve completion along with particular interests and through the co-operation of particular knowing and willing…[10]</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The summary of his political purpose could rightly be regarded as an effort to reconcile freedom and authority which is accomplished when the state emerges and imposes its laws (in the form of the constitution) upon the lesser associations in which the individuals are involved. Sequel to this he upholds a standardized organic system which is directly contrapuntal to Rousseau’s absolute democracy.</p> <p>More over, his desire includes portraying the state as an unrivalled and magnificent institution that invests its government with standards of absolute reason and laws that are universally valid. To this end he sets out to reconstruct political philosophy in general. Little wonder then, the outcome of such an ambitious venture was his elegant work “The Philosophy of Right”- a work that is difficult to comprehend. It was as a result of this incomprehensibility of this material that many people described him as a fellow that embraced an abstract philosophy. </p> <p></p> <p>Hegel’s aim was to set forth a philosophical system so comprehensive that it would encompass the ideas of his predecessors and create a conceptual framework in terms of which both the past and future could be understood philosophically. Such an aim would require nothing short of a full account of reality itself. Thus, Hegel conceived the subject matter of philosophy to be reality as a whole. This reality, or the total developmental process of everything that is, he referred to as the Absolute. </p> <p>According to Hegel, the task of philosophy is to chart the development of the Absolute. This involves first, making clear the internal rational structure of the Absolute; second, demonstrating the manner in which the Absolute manifests itself in nature and human history; and, third, explicating the teleological nature of the Absolute, that is, showing the end or purpose towards which the Absolute is directed.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1]G.W.F.Hegel,<i>Philosophy of Right</i>, trans.by T.M.

P Sartre while writing the preface to Franz Fanon’s Wretched of the Earth glorified violence, saying that it is only violence that pays.[3] These and many other numerous views of thinkers and analysts on the notion of violence and its attendant relation to political power provoke some nagging questions: Is violence necessary for the existence and maintenance of political power? Put differently, can’t there be political power without violence?</p> <p>The above questions are timely, given the contemporary inclination of the world to wars and revolutions in which violence is ultimately believed to be a common denominator.[4]  Technological advancement which hitherto was a blessing seem to be a curse by its productions of weapons of mass destruction which according to J.B Akam, has rendered man powerless[5] by serving as instruments of violence directly or indirectly. This experience of violence cuts across all spheres of the human life. However, it has the greatest momentum in politics. Hence, the quest for political power in the present dispensation is no longer through any other means but through violent acts. Humanity has waved good bye to morality and enthroned to the fullest the Machiavellian principle of <i>the end justifies the means</i>. This is a real problem to tackle.</p> <p>In Nigeria, it is a fact known by experience and authenticated by history that quest for political power through violence is prevalent.  Violence has reared its head in Nigerian politics in the garb of thuggery, riots, ethnic crisis, assassination, kidnapping, denial of electioneering rights etc which the consequences are usually wanton lost of lives especially that of those who are innocent. A trip down the memory lane of Nigerian political activities reveals that politics which is supposed to be the natural activities of man borrowing from Aristotelian definition of man as a naturally political is no more a fair game, instead a game of do or die what can also be known as the survival of the fittest. It is so because in the words of Rev. Fr. J. Odey:</p> <p>Leadership in Nigeria has become a huge investment and a life insurance scheme where one has to engage in many abnormal things to be secure in perpetuity. And no Nigerian who has tasted the trappings of office has ever left them without fierce and often violent pressure while those who aspire to be there spare nobody and nothing on their way[6]</p> <p></p> <p> The tragic experiences of Nigerians in2003 elections are eloquent testimonies or attestation that the Nigerian political positions are reserved for the violent and where all actors in the political theatre are equally violent, it is safely reserved for the most violent. Those who are in office already do everything possible to perpetuate themselves in power, unleashing violence on the people. They are tyrannical such that anybody who tries to challenge them with regard to the way they are ruling is in soup. The death of such politicians like Dele Giwa, Ken Saro Wiwa, Bola Ige, Dikibo, Barnabas Igwe and wife of Anambra state etc. will buttress this fact. With this, one would ask, where are we heading to? What is the purpose of political power?    </p> <p>I should think that the aim of political power in every government as Arendt asserts is to enable men to live together, to promote happiness or to realize a classless society[7]. This meaning is no longer obtainable nowadays instead people have understood political power as the best avenue to make money hence resorting to all forms of violence in order to acquire it.</p> <p>In this write-up, I am going to philosophically expose this quest for political power through violence especially in our country Nigeria toeing the foot step of Hannah Arendt to prove that power and violence are incompatible and that violence can destroy power but not create it[8]. </p> <p><b>1.2     PURPOSE OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>As hitherto mentioned above, man is by nature a political animal. Hence politics is not restricted to special type of people neither is it a dirty game. Instead, it is those who indulge in it that are could be seen as dirty. Therefore, the purpose of studying this topic titled the quest for political power through violence is to redress the above mentioned status quo in which politics is seen as a game of do or die.  To achieve this, the youths who are veritable tools of violence have to be re-orientated for they are gradually imbibing this method as the best option for survival. </p> <p>Again, I want to use this write-up to appeal to the consciences of those whose hands are not yet soiled in politics to keep it up. The fact that violence is seen as the order of the day in Nigerian politics should not make them to join them when they cannot beat them.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3     SCOPE OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>In this write-up I want to narrow the ideas of Hannah Arendt to Nigerian situation even though they were not propounded for that. Of all the political works of Hannah Arendt, I am going to concentrate mainly of her major work on violence. Even though I am going to highlight her other works especially the human condition, they are going to be in passing.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.4     METHODOLGY OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The method of study is that of juxtaposition and evaluation. Juxtaposition, in the sense that Arendt’s ideas on violence are compared with the Nigerian situation, to sieve out what can serve as a better political worldview for Nigeria.</p> <p>The work is divided into five chapters. Chapter one is the general introduction: statement of problem, purpose of study, methodology and scope of studies. In chapter two we are going to examine the nature of violence in Nigeria as well as literature review. In chapter three, we are going to examine Hannah Arendt and the quest for political power through violence. Then in chapter four, we shall examine the evolution of political violence in Nigeria. The above work is brought to an end in chapter five with critical evaluation and conclusion.</p> <p></p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] Mills, C.W., <i>L’elite du pouvoir</i>, Paris, Maspero 1969, p. 171</p> </div> <div> <p>[2] See H.

Hence, it propelled man’s meaning-attaching trait which satisfies his concept of existence. Philosophy as it were has been the vanguard of such innovation traceable from the time of Thales. More still, events and time have rolled out trajectories of philosophy that now constitute different field of studies. Most of these fields hold man as an object of inquiry. All their concern was to conceptualise man.</p> <p> Many philosophers, psychologists, sociologists, scientists have made an incredible contribution in understanding man and his place in this world. Sigmund Freud is among these great men who have sought to make man and his life more comprehensible. Basically, Freud sees man as driven through life by two tides of psychic energy – <i>Eros and Thanatos. </i>These express themselves through the three structures of the mind, namely the Id, the Ego and the Superego. These three structures operate in three regions of the mind- the conscious, the preconscious and the unconscious.  </p> <p> As Freud explained: “the Id is the wholly unconscious domain of the mind, consisting of drives and of material later repressed. The Ego is partly conscious and contains the defence mechanism and capacities to calculate, reason and plan. The Super-Ego is also partly conscious but harbours the conscience and, beyond that ‘unconscious feeling of guilt’. The Id is viewed as the primitive and unconscious primary urges in the psyche. The Ego is developed when the Id realises that there is a world ‘out there’. The Super-Ego is an introverted parental authority which ultimately takes the place of the Oedipus impulse”[1].</p> <p> This approach by Freud, brought to bare a contrast on a claim that man could accumulate real knowledge about himself and his world and exercise rational control over them. This claim in Freudian view is a delusion. Hence, he displayed the intricacies of man in relation to his conception of the “unconscious” as detailed in his work ‘The<i> Ego and the Id</i>’.</p> <p> But to what extent can this Freudian view of the mind withstand the examination of some philosophical currents, especially existentialism and positivism?</p> <p> <b>1.1                  </b><b>A Short Biography of Sigmund Freud.</b></p> <p>Freud, an Austrian neurologist, author, psychiatrist, and founder of almost all the basic concepts of psychoanalysis, was born on May 6, 1856, in the small Moravian town of Freiberg to the family of Jacob Freud and Amalia. In 1860, when he was almost four, he moved with his family to Vienna and entered the University  of Vienna in 1873 at the age of seventeen studying Psychology and neurology. He graduated with a Masters Degree in 1881.</p> <p>For some months in 1885, he studied under Jean Martin Charcot in Paris whose work in hysteria converted Freud to the cause of Psychiatry. Dissatisfied with hypnosis and electrotherapy as treatment techniques, he evolved the psychoanalytic method, founded on dream analysis.</p> <p>    For some thirty years he worked to establish the truth of his theories through his publications. He published <i>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</i> in 1920 which first announced his theory of the death drive; <i>Totem and Taboo </i>in 1913 which set about tracing the Oedipus complex back to the origins of humanity, <i>The Moses of Michelangelo</i> in 1914. <i>The Future of an Illusion</i> which is a convinced atheist’s dissection of religion, was published in 1927, <i>Civilization and Its Discontents</i> which is a disillusioned look at Modern civilization on the verge of catastrophe, came out in 1930. But it was in 1923, that he published his classical study <i>The</i> <i>Ego and the Id </i>improved “structural theory” of the mind.</p> <p>    Despite his growing reputation in May 1933 the Nazis publicly burnt Freud’s books in Berlin and fleeing this Nazi anti-Semitism, he left Vienna for London in 1938 and died on September  23, 1939, asking his physician for a lethal dose of morphine.</p> <p> <b>1.2                        </b><b>Statement of the Problem.</b></p> <p>Man has always been an object of study. But, in ancient and medieval times, when the cosmocentric and theocentric perspectives prevailed, he was studied together with and subordinately to other primary realities such as the world or God. It was with Descartes, that man became the centre and the point of departure for philosophy, as such.</p> <p> In this way, the modern and contemporary philosophers have obtained a whole new series of images of man, images which have often sparked great interest. For example: anguished man (Kierkegaard), economic man (Marx), existent man (Heidegger), symbolic man (Cassirer), problematic man (Marcel), erotic man (Freud) etc.</p> <p> These explain the enigma in conceptualizing man. Hence, the examination of Freudian Ego and Id would to a large extent promote the understanding of man and his place in the world.  </p> <p> <b>1.3                        </b><b>Purpose of this work.</b></p> <p> The purpose of this work is to expose and critically examine the Freudian concept of man as detailed in his work <i>the Ego and the Id.</i> This examination is necessary in order to assess the contributions of Freud to philosophical knowledge and the excesses of his assumptions.</p> <p> <b>1.4         </b><b>Scope of study</b></p> <p>This work is particularly centred on the concepts of the Ego and the Id, and how they help us have a deeper understanding of man and his life. To substantiate our points, views from philosophers will be considered where necessary.</p> <p>       <b>1.5         </b><b>Method of Research</b></p> <p>The method applied in this research is both expository and critical. It is expository in the sense that it shows in great detail the Freudian view of man in relation to the Ego and the Id. It is also critical because we shall subject Freud’s view to a philosophical analysis.</p> <p><b>1.6 Division of the work.</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This work is divided into four chapters. Chapter one is the general introduction. In chapter two, the researcher will dwell on the development of the concepts of Ego and the Id, and there relation to super-Ego and to the classes of instincts.

Good and evil without doubt have constituted lots of discomfort, havoc and other problems in human life. Consequently, so many thinkers of different epochs have contributed in one way or the other according to their own understanding, to unravel this dilemma. Nevertheless, throughout the different periods starting from ancient era to contemporary era, the problem of good and evil have continued to occupy the minds of philosophers. Even at that, no consensus has been reached with regard to a solution.  </p> <p>Moreover, it may interest us to know that in this write up, we are to witness how Spinoza scrupulously did not delve into good and evil from the same perspective with others. His rigorous experiences of the retrospection on the previous philosophers on this topic allured him to conceive good and evil as being subjective. </p> <p>Hence, this solves the numerous problems of some questions people do ask: whether there should be evil in the world created by all-powerful, all-knowing and all-merciful God. He thus based his conception of good and evil on individual differences: “Everyone, therefore, according to his particular emotions, judges or estimates what is good and what is evil.”1  This implies that what is good for one person may be evil for another. In fact, the problem of good and evil in the morality of Spinoza can be summarized with one of the popular dictums, which says, “One man’s protein is another man’s poison”. Hence, Spinoza’s good and evil should provide solution to the aged problem of good and evil which when mentioned remains fresh as can be seen in the work of Joseph Eno Inah who said “The problem of good and evil whenever mentioned, remains fresh and alive despite the fact that it started long ago.”2 The problem at stake has continued to remain a mystery as ever.    </p> <p></p> <p>1.1     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>For the fact, that many philosophers of different epochs have dwelt on good and evil with different mindsets and came out with misconception of what good and evil are, Spinoza as against these views conceived the idea of good and evil in a different way.  </p> <p>          However, the purpose of this work is to expose and appraise the conception of good and evil in the morality of Spinoza. To show how his conception of good and evil differs from that of other philosophers.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2            </b><b>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Inspite of the early thinker’s view on this topic, which are as aged as humanity, the problem still lingers. The problem at stake seem to have confused its history with the history of mankind and have being the bone of contention among philosophers, theologians and even among humanists of all schools and epochs. Now, one may ask, what is the solution to this problem of good and evil, which has persistently continued to occur? Alternatively, has the problem become insoluble or is there any hope of overcoming this problem? The above questions are relevant questions which when considered properly as exposed by Spinoza brings solutions to the innumerable questions philosophers do ask about good and evil. </p> <p>Therefore, this research is an attempt to find solution to the questions above. We hope that our exposure to the conceptions of Spinoza about good and evil would help us to some extent in resolving the problematic notion of good and evil.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3     SCOPE OF WORK</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>          Man as it were from time immemorial associates and dissociates himself with what is good and evil respectively. Such is man’s desire for good and aversion to evil: “Man by nature desires what is good and averts to what is evil.”3 As such, his enquiries, deliberations and thoughts on good and evil have been an outstanding issue from time immemorial until now.  My work is a journey in search of what good and evil really are in the views of Spinoza </p> <p>In addition, I pondered on some philosophers conceptions about good and evil right from ancient period to contemporary period. It should be obvious that grasping of Spinoza’s teaching about good and evil will quench the thirst that eventually could lead to the misconception of the idea of good and evil, which leads to apportioning blames on the creator of the universe. </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4     METHODOLOGY </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The method of research, which I applied in my work is both expository and appraisal. It is expository in the sense that it shows in detail the works of Spinoza on good and evil. It is also appraisal in the sense that his own conception of good and evil creates much room to desire good and to avert evil which when done, human race will turn from its evil ways of life to good ways of life. </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5                             DIVISION OF WORK</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>For easy understanding and grasping of this work, I divided this work into five chapters. </p> <p>Chapter one is the general introduction, purpose of the study, statement of the problem, scope of work, methodology, Division of work and a brief profile of Baruch de Spinoza. </p> <p>Chapter two is the literature review of philosophers on good and evil. Chapter three treats in detail the Spinozistic conception of good and evil. Chapter four is all about peculiar things in Spinoza’s concept of good and evil. Finally, chapter five is the evaluation and conclusion that ends this research. </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.6     A BRIEF PROFILE OF BENEDICT B.

The views of an Igbo man who comes across this topic is bound to be different from that of a European. So will it also be, with any member of the external world not directly affected by this topic. </p> <p>One might see it as a liberation philosophy, another might see it as an attack on what is European, and another still, might see it as a defensive means applied to transfer the responsibility of the ills found in Igbo land to the European world. None of them can be said to be wrong in his particular opinion unless an explanation of the authors import has been relayed to him and he persists in his stand. For this, it becomes very necessary that at this early moment, a brief explanation of what this topic is aimed at be presented to the reader so that he does not jump to hasty conclusions even before reading this.</p> <p><b>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The Igbo tribe of Nigeria today experiences so much political, economic, and social crisis both within itself as a tribe and with the other tribes with whom it makes up this one nation called Nigeria. Most of these crises so much affect the Igbos to the extent that they often see themselves as a marginalized tribe in this nation. This has led to their consistent clamor for a Sovereign state of their own (Biafra), not minding the fact of the failure of its first realization attempt during the early days of Nigeria’s independence. </p> <p>Looking at the present socio-political situation of the Igbos in this multi-tribal nation, one will discover that a greater percentage of the hardships they are facing in their own God-given land cannot be ascertained to have its place rooted in nature. They seem to be man-made, willingly or unwillingly caused, knowingly or unknowingly arrived at. Most of these problems can be said to be aftermaths of some past experiences of the Igbo man both within the confines of his fatherland and outside. It must be acknowledged that the Igbo man has been more at peace with the world around him in the absence of a Nigerian nation than today when he has been forced into a national union with some other tribes. This goes a very long way to prove that some causes of the Igbo mans socio-political predicament can be vividly traced to the period of his being a part of this 'Lugardian' amalgamated nation called Nigeria. If this can be said to be so, then her days prior to this amalgamation, especially within the colonial era, when she was being pushed into acting in a way she does not really accept must have played a major role in the many problems she so suffers today.</p> <p><b>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The Igbo man of today finds himself faced with so much socio-political difficulties in his co-existence with the other tribes that make up this one Nigeria. For this, he so much longs for secession; he longs to have a sovereign state of his own, which will have all its affairs self-piloted and which will have him as its sole controller. He longs for the sovereign state of Biafra where he will be free from the present days’ ‘regrettable Igbo predicament in Nigeria characterized by humiliation, manipulation, and marginalization’[1].</p> <p>A look at the socio-political problems of the Igbo man of today, which has produced in him such longings as these, reveals the fact that the colonial amalgamation of the Nigerian nation has a bigger part to play in it. This implies that the Igbo man’s contact with the European world has a hand in such situations and that it is not just a problem caused by the other tribes with whom he shares this one nation. We the Nigerians also have a hand in it, no doubt. It is based on this fact that this work sets out to expose the present socio-political conditions of the Igbo man, tracing it back to his early life without this colonial amalgam called Nigeria, to see how the Europeans in their contact with the Igbo tribe could be said to have caused a problem for the Igbos of today. </p> <p><b>1.3     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>In the words of Rev Fr. Collins Ojene, “No continent suffered from the scourge of slavery for centuries as Africa. No continent was so brutalized by colonialism, imperialism, and now neo-colonialism as Africa.”[2] The Igbo nation, we have to note, is part of the African continent and as such the afore-mentioned statement, if it is true, also applies to them. This study serves to ascertain the extent of the damage these (colonialism, imperialism and neo-colonialism) had caused the Igbo race specifically. In this study, we are interested in seeing if really we can be very right to say that the colonial masters have been our ‘messiahs’, sent from God above to bring us salvation and light (like Christ was believed by the Christians, to have been sent) as shown by some writers of history. To see if they can be seen as, in the words of F. K. Ekechi, expressing the view of the people of the lower Niger on the early Western Catholic Missionaries, “a kind (white man) who came for the welfare of the people.”[3] It is a study aimed at examining the intricacies of these diverse contacts that has existed in history among the Europeans and the African-Igbo world to see what actually has held the Igbo nation spell bound from advancing to the developmental stage the European world of today is in. It is a work born out of an interest in contributing to the growth and development of the Igbo race. This interest to help move the Igbos forward was born in the course of our study of the African philosophy and the many problems facing it. It grew after a realization of the fact that the ancient Egypt of Africa was amongst the first civilized nations but today is nowhere, development wise. On the other hand, it is aimed at producing what can be accounted by us, as the gains and problems created for us by the westerners and by so doing help our people to know what they need in their present rush for the white-mans land (greener pastures) and culture. It is a way of trying to expose us to the reality that not all that glitters is gold and that the European in all he does is never perfect and should never be regarded so. </p> <p><b>1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Fr. Collins Ojene opines, “The African continent (Igbo world) is daily degenerating into possible state of anarchy or even extinction should something not be done concretely and very urgently.”[4] Our socio-political conditions here is getting worse by the day and so resulting to a mad rush for the European (western) world. It serves to give an Igbo mans understanding and approach to the African (Igbo) socio-political predicaments of this world and as well as help save the Igbo race from extinction. It also serves to expose the Igbos to the likely causes of their present condition. At this time when the Igbo youths so much long for the western world and its culture, viewing it as the paradigm, it becomes very necessary that a work of this nature should exist to point to them the possible problems and benefits that may accrue from such escapade. To the world at large, it serves as an eye-opener, pointing, like a signpost, to the road we (Igbos) have to follow in order to arrive at a brighter future destined for the Igbo race by the creator. </p> <p><b>1.5     DIVISION OF WORK</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This work is broadly divided into five chapters with some sub-sections each. </p> <p>Chapter One serves as an introduction of what we have set out to do in this work. It presents a clear exposé of what the problems we have set out to handle in this topic is all about. In addition, it gives an outline of our reasons and purpose of writing this work and explains the actual methodology we used in the bid to achieve the desired result.</p> <p>Chapter Two dwells on a review of some literatures and authors who have said something in relation to this our topic. It discusses them based on the different aspects or points of view from which they had aired their opinions, giving us an insight into the fact that many have observed and said something concerning these contacts we wish to discuss.</p> <p>Chapter Three discusses in details the three major schemes of Igbo European contact with some issues surrounding them while Chapter four dwells on the positive and negative influences of these contacts. They can be seen as the heart of this work for in them the contacts and their effects are brought to fore. The Igbo socio-political situations, as it concerns our reasons for this write-up was also discussed here. We must note here that the historical contacts of the Igbos and the European world is still on, as such, its effects is bound to continually increase, positively or negatively as the case may be.</p> <p>Finally, chapter five dwells on a critical examination and an evaluation of the many facts that have been presented in chapter four. It also suggests ways for the Igbos to forge ahead.</p> <p><b>1.6     SCOPE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>A project like this needs so much of pure historical foundations so that it may be more effectively handled. This not withstanding, there seems to be only a few of such works available to us. Most of the works to be seen on the historical contact of the Europeans with Nigeria and with the Igbos in particular seem to be written by the west or with their influence. Such works, as we know, can scarcely present the distinct problems, constituted to the Igbos by the European colonial masters. More often, it presents the European man as being explicitly caring for the good and growth of the African. In the face of all these, this work has to depend on the available texts dealing on the European/Igbo contact. Other secondary texts seeking to make a justification or an appraisal of those colonial contacts with the Africans in general were also taken into great consideration. The works concerning African/European contacts were accepted because the Igbos as a group also fall within the confines of the African continents.</p> <p>There were some individual face-to-face inquiries from some individual aged men who have been lucky to have been part of the Igbo experience of the colonial era. From the inquiries we gained some insights of the facts of how these perceived the Europeans and how they still feel about those days even in the light of today’s situation when almost every Igbo man longs for an encounter (contact) with the European world. This very enquiry seems to have been of paramount necessity, and it exposed us to how they felt with their experiences in those days and how they feel about them now. It gave us a specific picture of what that encounter really looked like. In addition, some literate men of integrity were interviewed. Although most of them were not a part of those encounters, our belief that they must have come to build up some specific impressions regarding those contacts, following their quest for more wisdom, which flowed from the fact of their academic literacy, necessitated it.</p> <p><b>1.7     METHODOLOGY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The method of this study was synthetic, hermeneutical, and analytical. Hermeneutics simply implies interpretation and this work had to be hermeneutical. Most of its aspects had to do with interpretative attempts at understanding activities and actions. It was analytical because such works as this require that one set up concrete evidences from which he can drive his points home. Some arguments here were deductive and others inductive. Equally, there was so much combination of elements in this work and these accounts for the totality of what became our conclusion. This makes our work synthetic. In all, our study did follow a very critical and rational process.</p> <p>All these not withstanding, the work is presented in a very coherent order such that anyone encountering it finds no difficulty in understanding and appreciating its stand. Rarely would one going through it find a reason to deny its facts because it is truly rational and realistic, unless he seeks for prolonged arguments. </p> <p>Finally, this research work does not spring from any form of adulterated or biased judgment. Instead, its point of emergence rests solely on the interest in helping the Igbo people move forward to meet up in development and technological advancement with other worlds. For this, the conclusion had to be philosophically constructed carrying along with it, some words of admonition as well as encouragements and suggestions that will aid the African-Igbo in eschewing the psychological trauma precipitated by European imperialism, hence moving his nation (Igbo) forward.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] J.

The New Webster Dictionary of the English Language defined the term ‘contract’ as “an agreement or a covenant”.2 On the other hand, Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy defines social contract as a basis for legitimate legal and political power in the idea of a contract. Contracts are things that create obligation.”3 Hence, if we can view society as organized, i.e., a situation where a contract had been formed between the citizen and the sovereign power, this would necessarily ground the obligation of each to the other. The idea is one of a contract between citizens as a result of which power is vested in government. Traditionally, the term has been used in arguments that attempt to explain the nature of political obligation and or the kind of responsibility that rulers have to their subjects.4 Philosophers such as Plato, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and Kant, had a varied but similar positions that life in a prepolitical “state of nature” would be very difficult such that it would lead them to agree either with one another or with a prospective ruler, which eventually leads to the creation of political institutions. Such individuals believe that such a creation would necessarily improve their lot. </p> <p></p> <p>Despite the fact that many of the social contract theorists admit that there is almost never an explicit act of agreement in a community; however, they maintain that such an agreement is implicitly made when members of the society engage in certain acts through which they give their explicit consent to the ruling regime. Now, how do we definitely understand the terms of a social contract, which establishes a state? Are we to judge it as when the people agree to obey the ruler? Do they surrender their power to him as Hobbes would have us believe? Or do they lend him that power, reserving the right to take it from him, if and when they see fit, as Locke maintained? What really are the terms of a social contract posited by its theorists? It is worthy of note to state that amidst controversies surrounding their interpretation:</p> <p>Social contract arguments have been important to the development of modern democratic states: the idea of the government as the creation of the people, which they have right to overthrow, if they find it wanting, contributed to the development of democratic forms of polity in the 18th and 19th Centuries.5</p> <p></p> <p>In this chapter, we shall critically, but in a lighter form, expose the idea of some major theorists on social contract, excluding Hobbes who we shall, later in this work, critically examine his detailed approach on the idea.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.1        MAJOR PROPONENTS OF THE IDEA</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The idea of a social contract could be traced back to the time of Socrates. Plato and Aristotle, on the other hand, represented their individual views on a social contract. However, these views came to be modified and moreso, the Hobbessian contract marked a turning point in some respect, a genuine innovation in history of political philosophy. Let us now briefly run through the ideas of some major proponents of a social contract.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2      SOCRATES’ ARGUMENT</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Socrates here was so much indebted to the laws of Athens. He personified these laws and appreciated so much the privilege, which the law granted him, especially for his existence. For him, it was the law that made his father and mother to marry each other and beget him. It is believed that there is no force or coercion between the laws and the citizens. One willingly chooses to be part and parcel of the city, thereby accepting the codes of the laws. The citizens on growing and “once they see how the city conducts itself, can choose whether to leave, taking their property with them, or stay.”6 According to Socrates, “staying implies an agreement to abide by the laws and accept the punishment that they met out.”7 Herein lies the terms of the contract. For one to stay in such a society means that the individual accepts the terms laid down by the laws. This invariably hooks the person in a mutual contract with the state and the ruling authorities. The contract described by Socrates is an implicit one. It is implied by his choice to stay in Athens, even though he is free to leave.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3        PLATO’S IDEA</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Plato, in his Republic, and representing his thoughts in Glaucon, noted that each man thought it good to inflict injustice upon others and had to suffer injustice at the hands of others. For him, all men behave in like manner. This means that it is in the nature of man to inflict injustice upon the other. This is because man sees injustice as something good and then works towards inflicting injustice upon the other.</p> <p></p> <p>However, “in due course, men came to consider the resulting state of affairs intolerable and proceeded to agree to covenants and laws that obliged them to behave less rapaciously.”8 This is the view of Plato as represented by Glaucon in the book II of Plato’s Republic. Going further, Plato noted that men accept such laws because it is in their interest to do so. By the very fact of the acceptance of the terms of that agreement, men have entered into a social contract. Plato notes that this is the origin of justice, which is merely what agreed-upon laws command. He further stressed self-interest as the central motivating factor in political behaviour. This invariably leads to the formation of a new society.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4    JOHN LOCKE’S IDEA</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The English Empiricist and moral and political philosopher, John Locke (1632-1704), is renowned for his political thought and especially his social contract theory. Locke’s “state of nature” was meant to be harmonious and peaceful. Men are bound to preserve peace, mankind and even avoid hurting the other. The well keeping and execution of the law of nature is meant for every member of the society. The actual violation of this law by the individual in the society leads to an eventual state of war between the person and others. The power of a man against the other is neither absolute nor arbitrary and must be proportionally restrained. According to James Gordon Clapp, in the <i>Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i>, “the state of nature was for Locke, a society of men, as distinct from a state of government, or a political society.”9 Before his view, however, on the state of nature, Locke had analysed property to be prior even to society. He then proceeded to derive society from the consent of its members. According to George Sabine and Thomas Thorson, Locke defined civil power as:</p> <p>The right of making laws with penalties … for the regulating and preserving of property, and of employing force of community in the execution of such laws… all this only for the public good.10</p> <p></p> <p>We must remark here, that such a power would only be arrived at when there is consent, and though it may be tacitly given, it must be the consent of each individual for himself. This is a natural entitlement. It is the very fact of the existence of certain inconveniences in a state of nature, such as men’s partiality and inclination of some men to violate the rights of others.11 This is Locke’s view of man in the state of nature. To escape these ‘inconveniencies’, Locke notes that men now consent to a civil government. Thus, it is by common consent that men form a social contract and create a single body politic. The aim of the contract “is to preserve the lives, freedom and property of all, as they belong to each under natural law.”12 This is the basis of the state. The general reason for its establishment is for the protection of the lives and property of the individuals in the state.</p> <p><b>1.5     THE SOCIAL CONTRACT ACCORDING TO JEAN JACQUES</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>ROUSSEAU:</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p>Rousseau (1712-1778) developed increasingly deeper and more sophisticated ideas about the origin and nature of the condition of man in the society and what ought to be done to ameliorate this condition. Rousseau regrettably announced that increasing scientific knowledge and refinement of arts and letters, instead of leading to a peaceful and harmonious society, was in fact, the bane of the civilized society. He notes that such sophistication is the offshoot of luxury and idleness and has developed to feed people’s vanity and desire for ostentatious and aggressive self-display. N. J. Dent, in his commentary on Rousseau remarks that:</p> <p>Rousseau allows for the fact that there are a few people of genius who genuinely enrich humanity by their ideas. But the majority are not improved but harmed, by exposure to the higher learning.13</p> <p></p> <p>In his work, “Discourse on the Origin and Foundation of Inequality”, Rousseau gives an account of the fall of humankind. For him, natural man, left alone in his natural environment is self-sufficient. In this state, man is peaceable. Later on, increase in population forces people to live together. Jealousy and envy became the order of the day as “men come to demand esteem and deference.”14 This leads men to compete for precedence, which makes life to be tainted by aggression and spite. </p> <p></p> <p>Lack of individual self-sufficiency, Rousseau argues, requires the individual to associate together in the society. He however does not support a condition of enslavement as the price of survival for those who embark on this contract. Freedom is seen as an essential human need and the mark of humanity. Rousseau holds that freedom and association can only be combined if all the persons of the association make up the sovereign body for that association. In other words, in this contract, there ought to be a mutual consent, freedom and choice made by the individuals as they submit their general will to be ruled by an established authority. Rousseau, however, made it clear that the terms of the contract holds that governmental function must be thoroughly subordinate to the sovereign judgement of the people. Generally, Rousseau’s idea of social contract depicts the union of free and equal men who devise laws under which they shall now proceed to live their lives as citizens of a state.</p> <p>This now brings us to where our beam light heads: Hobbes’ idea of social contract. Before then, let us first of all see what really lead Hobbes to posit his idea of social contract.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>1 Social Contract Theory, <i>The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, </i>2005.</p> </div> <div> <p>2 <i>The New Webster Dictionary of English Language,</i> (New York: Lexicon Publishers Inc. 1995), p.212<i> </i></p><p><i></i></p><i></i> </div> <div> <p>3 Simon Blackburn, <i>Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, </i>(London: Oxford University Press, Inc. 1996), p.354</p> </div> <div> <p>4 <i>The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, </i>ed, Robert Audi (USA: Cambridge University Press, 1999) </p> <p>  p.855 </p> </div> <div> <p>5 Ibid. p.856</p> </div> <div> <p>6 Hobbes, <i>Social Contract Theory, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</i></p><p><i></i></p><i></i> </div> <div> <p>7 Loc.

Now, we witness a great and extraordinary progress in Bio-technological sciences and medicine. This great advancement in medicine and biotechnological sciences has given human beings new pattern of life. However, these efforts of the scientists and biotechnologists have paved ways for extension of scientific researches on the human person. Thus, the great question is: Are these scientific and biotechnological discoveries a blessing or a curse to humanity?</p> <p></p> <p>Now, we can talk of manipulations on human genetic constitution. Modern biotechnologists and scientists have changed the <i>status quo </i>inbiology and medicine.  Presently in Biotechnological sciences, we hear of microsurgery on a two weeks embryo. A stem cell from a human embryo can now be made to turn into a heart, kidney or any major organ cells and replace any damaged cell of the human body, thereby, providing opportunity for manufacturing human spare parts. Scientists claim to produce human embryo through various means like natural reproduction, asexual reproduction, and parthenogenesis. Through these means, they have thrown the entire humanity and the scientific community into confusion as when human life begins.</p> <p></p> <p>However, among all these, the most prominent discoveries include the prodigious changes in genetic engineering, like human foetal experimentations, eugenics, sterilization, in vitro fertilization, abortion, surrogate motherhood, and cloning. In addition, human modifications, such as plastic surgery, sex change, and the preservation and commercialization of human organs and embryos are all strange scientific possibilities. All these are topics in bioethical debates and controversies in biotechnological sciences and medicine. Such issues like the foregoing raised ethical and moral questions. When does human life begin? What is the status of the human embryo? Is human embryo a human person? Does human embryo have legal and moral right? All these are basic ethical question raised by the activities of these scientists and biotechnologists on the human person. Sequel to this, many groups developed positions to defend the human life and thereby restore the human dignity.</p> <p> In this work, I specifically choose to explore the issue of human cloning.  In fact, the central question is: “Should humans be cloned?” Moreover, scientists and biotechnologist have deviced artificial methods of creating human beings. This touches the beginnings of human life, together with the quality of life and end of the human life. The point is that human cloning involves intentional creation and destruction of human being in the name of saving the life of others. Is killing a person’s life to save another’s morally good? That is a basic ethical issue. According to Pope John Paul 11 “what is technically possible is not always morally admissible” Hence, in his address to the International Congress on the Transplants on 2000-AUS-29, he comments, “Medical…methods that fail to respect the dignity and value of the person must always be avoided.”[1]</p> <p> As part of the introduction, this chapter includes the setting of the whole work in its methodological framework. Let us consider these frameworks.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2. THE STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Since the birth of the sheep named Dolly in 1997, the possibility of human cloning has left very little to be doubted. Thus, many debates have been going on about the issue. Should humans be cloned? If humans are cloned, what would be their social status? Who is responsible for cloned humans? Do clones have rights and legal protection? Should the deformed cloned individual be accepted? </p> <p> In actual sense, human cloning techniques involve intentional creation and destruction of human embryos either for transplantation or experiments. The American Association for the Advancement of sciences summarized the problem in these words:</p> <p>…. not only do most attempts to clone mammals fail, about 30 percent of clones born alive are affected with large offspring syndrome and other debilitating conditions. Several cloned animals have died prematurely from infections and other complications… the attempt to clone humans at this time is considered potentially dangerous and ethically irresponsible[2].</p> <p> </p> <p>However, there is diversity of opinions on human cloning. Its morality has been argued. Although, each argument has some interest to protect, the fundamental question is: Should humans be cloned? This is a problem that needed an urgent attention in biotechnological sciences. Here, we need to redefine the status of the human embryo. Human embryo is not just an object for experimentation but rather a unique and distinctive being, and should be accorded a profound respect and dignity. His uniqueness and distinctiveness differentiate him from every other creature. This is the dilemma of the modern science and technology especially genetic engineering.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3. THE PURPOSE OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The real question is what has this work to contribute to the global debates on the issue of human cloning?  That is towards resolving the problem of human cloning. Naturally, it is not ethical or moral to kill. It is against the moral law to destroy another person’s life. But embryos are deprived the right to live by denying them “personhood” by some biologists. This is the basis for their exposure as objects of research and experimentation.</p> <p></p> <p> The purpose of this work as a matter of fact, is to look at the scientific practices or researches on human life and their ethical implications. This consideration will necessarily lead to a redefinition of the status of human embryo in the face of biotechnological sciences. We hope to find out the proper place for the fertilization of the human embryo, whether in the womb or in the Petri dish outside the womb. </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4. THE SCOPE OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>As we observed above, the discoveries in the modern biotechnologies are too broad. An attempt was made to restrict the topic to human cloning and its ethical implications. Recognizing the fact that humans are not the objects for scientific and biotechnological research(s). </p> <p></p> <p>Hence, this work shall not only explore the arguments on human cloning but shall also look at its ethical implications. Since no researcher can boost of thorough exhaustive of its topic, this work does not also claim any exhaustive study of human cloning. It is just a contribution to the contemporary problems in bioethics. Every effort is made to explicitly state the ethical implications of human cloning.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.5. METHODOLOGY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The methods employed in this investigation are exposition and critical analysis. The expository method is used to lay bare the dangers of human cloning, recognize the dangers in the exercise and also draw some implications. On the other hand, the analytic method is employed to explain certain terms in the study. Some of the human cloning arguments are analytically discussed. The relevant information and statistical data for effective discussion of our topic are collected from the library and the Internet.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.6. THE DIVISON OF WORK</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The work is divided into chapters, and subsections for easy explication. In all, there are five chapters. Chapter one deals with the general introduction; setting the work forth in a methodological framework. In chapter two, the explication of the terms was made. I tried to explain the meaning and the purpose of ethics as the guide to scientific and biotechnological practices in any experimentation that involve human being. Still, the biological and philosophical conceptions of personhood and humanhood are explored so as to furnish us with the true status of the human embryo.</p> <p>Chapter three is the backbone of the work. It deals with the meaning and historical background of cloning. Also, the reasons, methods and the dangers of human cloning are equally highlighted in this chapter. The focus of chapter four is on the uniqueness of the human person, which trying to x-ray the legal and moral status of unborn member of human family. This aim is realizable through an examination of the diverse debates on human cloning. The whole endeavour is brought to a close in chapter five through a critical evaluation.</p> <p></p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1]Pope JohnPaul II in an address before international congress on Transplants on 2000, August 29. http/www.religious tolerance.org/clo.ther.htm</p> </div> <div> <p>[2] Internet Media: American Medical association, Human cloning report 2002. cf</p> </div> </div>\n\nMODERN BIOTECHNOLOGY AND DIGINITY OF HUMAN LIFE; AN ETHICAL ANALYSIS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MODERN BIOTECHNOLOGY AND DIGINITY OF HUMAN LIFE; AN ETHICAL ANALYSIS", "id": 53}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><b>THE CONCEPT OF HAPPINESS IN ST.

This existential passion or desire is quite innate and intrinsic in man. Due to that irresistible urge in man to know, he involves himself in a curious and inquisitive search into the reasons for his existence. Perhaps Socrates realized this fact and so maintained, “an unexamined life is not worth living”[2]. </p> <p></p> <p>In other words, the life of man on earth must have a purpose. And, in order to grasp this end of human life on earth, an intensive study is necessarily indispensable. </p> <p>To provide an answer or answers to these timely interrogatives, scholars, thinkers, erudite philosophers from many schools of thought have given diverse views and opinions. St Augustine of Hippo argues and advocates that “Happiness” is the purpose of human life and actions. Put differently, he submits that happiness is the essence of human existence. Following this Augustinian trend of thesis would be that man; by virtue of his personhood has a natural inclination to happiness. </p> <p></p> <p>Nevertheless, the postulation of the end of human life as a search for happiness has altogether become problematic. The issue to grapple with is how to effect a true understanding of the notion of happiness. What do we mean when we say that someone is happy? In this wise, I intend to contribute to the effort being made towards understanding the one human objective – “to achieve happiness.” This will be done by a critical appraisal of the notion of happiness in St. Augustine.</p> <p><b>1.2 THE STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p></p> <p>There are myriads of instabilities – political, economic, religious et cetera. The issues of bribery and corruption and the attendant poverty of purse and mind have remained heart-rending. In the most parts of the world, some countries are characterised as rich but poor nation, no thanks to her administrators, from past to the present.</p> <p></p> <p>Although many interpretations have been given to account for the numerous failures evident in the seemingly non-abating societal problems, I wish to focus on the psycho-existential quest of man as the root of the problem. What this means is that he understands the problem as emanating from the deep human desire to be satisfied and to feel good. Everybody desires <i>the good </i>And even when at the end what was desired turned out to be <i>bad</i>, it was initially desired as an apparent good.</p> <p>Accordingly, the failed administrators are all seeking the ways to be happy. The youths who engage in violent, immoral and criminal activities are invariably seeking for happiness. If all these are so, it then calls for a fresh study of the notion of happiness. This is our contention! This is our aim!! However we do so through the perspective pf St. Augustine of Hippo.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1</b>.<b>3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p></p> <p>What is happiness? What does it mean to be happy? And in what does happiness consist? These and other like questions are what I set out to investigate in this work. This investigation is proper especially at this moment when there is an obvious misinformation about the concept of happiness. People no longer understand what it means to be happy and the difference between happiness and pleasure. The fact we shall gather through this discursive investigation and exegesis, hopefully, will help to redirect our minds towards the proper appreciation of happiness.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p>The centrality of the concept of happiness to man has made it a topic of everybody’s interest. Scholars of various inclinations have commented and written profusely about happiness. Various religions preach it as the goal of human striving encapsulated in the notion of the beatific vision. More so, the goal of scientific and technological advancements has also been noted to be the longing for happiness and <i>good life</i></p> <p></p> <p>But not withstanding the available literary corpus on happiness, I will limit myself to the Augustinean view on happiness, especially as explicated in his works – The City of God and the Confessions. In any case, the views of other thinkers, philosophers and theologians will be made use of when the need arises.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5 METHODOLOGY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p></p> <p>Every literary work goes with its unique style and methodology. In this work, I will employ the methods of exposition, analysis and evaluation. The views of Augustine on happiness are brought to the fore through a systematic narrative exposition to highlight the basic tenets. Now abreast with his doctrine, I shall analytically evaluate the whole idea with the strength of some existential facts. The whole methodological approach will be critical. </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.6 DIVISION OF WORK</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p></p> <p>The work is divided into five chapters. Chapter one is the general introduction for Proper understanding of the essay: the statement of the problem, the purpose and the method used, the scope, division of the work. Chapter two bears literature review on happiness. Chapter three provides us with the clarification of various concepts. The view of Augustine of Hippo is portrayed in chapter four. A critical appraisal and conclusion brings the work to an end in chapter five. </p> <p></p> <p><b>           </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] Aristotle, as quoted in <i>Metaphysics the kpim of philosophy</i> by Panteleon Iroegbu (Owerri,    International Universities Press LTD, 1995) , p.142</p> </div> <div> <p>[2] E.

He is never satisfied and fulfilled within any particular state. He wants always to move beyond his present condition and consequently realize himself in the ultimate end. In other words, man seeks to transcend himself in all his activities. Man is never a static and motionless being that remains constant at any particular position. He is rather gifted with those qualities that make him an active being full of potentialities and capabilities. What then is self-transcendence? It is that characteristic movement of man in which he continually surpasses himself, in all that he is, all he wishes and all that he has. I mean it is that constant tendency possessed by man to always go beyond the already acquired situation in search of the supreme cause of his being, his primary origin and what should be the final end.</p> <p>     </p> <p>With regard to this, some solutions were given for the essence of self-transcendence and egocentricism is one of them. This was however developed by modern and contemporary philosophy, above all by the representative of the existentialist current, beginning with Nietzsche.  In this project therefore, attempt is made to examine the egocentric interpretation of self-transcendence in man in the light of its greatest exponent and defender by name Friedrich Nietzsche.</p> <p></p> <p><b>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p>Nietzsche has the belief that man, in his present life, finds himself in a precarious, pitiable, devastating, alienated, decadent, and inauthentic condition, full of deficiencies and miseries. Consequently, something has to be done in order to free man from this litany of problems. This is because there exists in every man that tension to free himself from the slavery of ignorance, error, fear and passions. Therefore, the crux of the problem lies in the recovering of the self through the acquisition of a truer and more proper being by effectuating a fuller and more complete actualization of his own possibilities. The message is that man must as a matter of fact be surpassed and to fully realize himself, he must shatter the fetters of metaphysics, morals and religion, and in particular, he must eliminate the idea of God.</p> <p><b>PURPOSE OF THE WORK</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Nietzsche in a bid to free man from his depressed state brought to the consciousness of all the fact that man must abandon or eliminate the idea of God, religion and morality. An exhaustive effort is therefore made towards analyzing, exposing and evaluating this surpassing of oneself in a bid to realize oneself and we shall see also why it is egocentric.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Going through many books especially philosophical Anthropology by B. Mondin, one will see immediately that many people made one contribution or the other on the issue of self-transcendence. Many still said many things with regard to the egocentric interpretation of self-transcendence in man. However, in this work much attention is paid to Nietzsche who as it has been said earlier is the greatest exponent and defender of this egocentric tendency in man. We equally considered the abstract and spiritual manifestation of self-transcendence in other events outside man. Besides, relevant materials could be sought from other philosophers and works of Nietzsche and any other material we consider necessary no matter the source.</p> <p></p> <p><b>METHODOLOGY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>It involves expository and critical approach. Hence, the egocentric interpretation of self-transcendence in man will be diagnosed, exposed, carefully and systematically examined in the light of Nietzsche. This project also gives room for a well systematized and critical evaluation of Nietzsche’s mind on egocentricism in man.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b></p> <p><b>THE NOTION AND MEANING OF SELF-TRANSCENDENCE IN MAN</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Self-transcendence being a quality outstanding in all human actions has its etymological meaning taken from the Latin word “Transcendere” which means to ascend on, elevate oneself above, cross, displace, scale, or simply going beyond. Going with this etymological meaning, the concept transcendence is attained by experience and at this level of experience, it denotes a spatial relation: the relation of surpassing, unboundedness, passing beyond, displacement in the sense of being above, being beyond, outside of etc. Consequently, we have such expressions like “to transcend one’s own confines”, ambient or environment, “to transcend every limit” to transcend the cloud and so on. Following this, the concept of self-transcendence is transferred now from the realm of material or sensible to that of the abstract and spiritual concept. From this angle, it therefore becomes possible to say that the substance transcends the accidents, intellective knowledge transcends sensitive knowledge. The soul transcends the world of matter or body etc.</p> <p>In our own time in philosophy, the term has taken up a technical meaning. It indicates today the divine reality, namely, it can refer to the Divine (the transcendence is God) As Mondin points out, we use the term transcendence today even more often when speaking not only of God but also of man. All along, we have been talking on the transcendence of sensible objects. But we can apply the term to the subject. In this case therefore, we can talk of auto- transcendence. The term therefore indicates the property of man by which he constantly goes beyond himself in all that he thinks, wills and all that he realizes or achieves. We can say therefore that man transcend himself. He transcends himself in thought, in liberty, in language, in association and in many other things. In fact “he is never satisfied with his achievements”[1].</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.1 THE PRINCIPAL PARTS OF SELF-TRANSCENDENCE</b></p> <p>The term transcendence is divided into two principal parts namely horizontal or historical transcendence and vertical or metaphysical auto-transcendence, While horizontal transcendence consists of a simple going towards the future, but remaining within the horizon of space and time and therefore of history. On the other hand “Vertical transcendence refers to the one that pushes higher, and tends to exceed the limits (bounds) of space and time, towards infinite”[2].</p> <p>          </p> <p>In the horizontal transcendence, man tries to overcome his cosmic limitations, and project himself to a better future like in the various technological products such as car, air-conditions, houses, medicine, airplanes etc. The vertical auto-transcendence is seen as a movement from the phenomenal to noumenal level. Here, man tries to discover realities behind the spiritual world.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.1.1 THE EGOCENTRIC INTERPRETATION OF SELF-         TRANSCENDENCE.</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>A careful and critical examination of the philosophies of Plato, Aristotle, Stoics, Descartes, Feurerbach, Hegel and Nietzsche reveals that man is always seen as trying to extricate himself from life shackles, alienation, entanglement or the state of oppression. The purpose of this liberation is to reinstate man back to his true nature and this of course should be done through discovering human potentialities, which will enable him to realize and actualize himself. This solution has the good of the subject as its primary objective. According to the egocentric solution, “the movement of self-transcendence has its one aim, the perfection, the fulfillment, of man’s being in its individual person”[3]. This was retaken and developed by F. Nietzsche, as we shall see later.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.1.2 THE SOCIAL INTERPRETATION OF SELF-          TRANSCENDENCE</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Also called the philanthropic solution. It aims at giving humanity better state of affairs. Its target is the elimination of individualism and egoism, an attempt to create awareness in the people such that they will emancipate from individualism miseries and social inequalities and consequently arrive at perfect happiness. Many people supported this view like Karl Max, Marcus, Bloch, Garaudy etc. Their target is the movement from individual self to the entire community. They have no religious overtone. It is given a social dimension. That is man as a social being is seen going beyond himself.</p> <p><b>1.1.3 THE THEOCENTRIC INTERPRETATION OF SELF-         TRANSCENDENCE.</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The crippling and devastating individualism of the egocentric position and the incompleteness of the social\\ philanthropic interpretation of self-transcendence explains the need for man to search for something more permanent and reliable. Therefore to cling on the egocentric and social interpretation of self-transcendence will amount to absolutizing the horizontal dimension of self-transcendence. When this total dependence on the horizontal level takes place, it will be very difficult for man to really surpass and assert himself. Therefore, the horizontal dimension comprising egocentric and philanthropic interpretation of self-transcendence does not provide a fertile ground for the realization of ones ultimate end. This is because the question of self-transcendence goes beyond the horizon of space and time and as such, recognizes the metaphysical dimension. This is the solution that man’s self-transcendence can only be realized completely in God. Hence, the theocentric interpretation of self-transcendence centers on God and sees God as the end point of every human endeavour. God as it were, pulls all creatures onto himself due to goodness and love. God being the unmoved mover, draws every other being to himself. Some of the exponents of this view include: Plato, Thomas Aquinas, Descartes, Blondel, Lonergan etc. It is therefore only in God that one can gain perfect fulfillment and consequently realize oneself. This is the view of the theocentric interpretation of self-transcendence.</p> <p></p> <p>1.2 ABSTRACT MANIFESTATION OF SELF-TRANSCENDENCE.</p> <p>The concept of self-transcendence does not only exist in the concrete and experiential sense of human existence but also extends to the metaphysical realm. It goes beyond the physical world and extends itself to abstract things. That is “from material things, the concept of self-transcendence was transferred into the realm of a spiritual and abstract concept”4. As a result of this extension of the concept of self-transcendence to metaphysical things, we can then say that substance transcends accidents, the world of spirit transcends that of matter, God transcends the world, the soul transcends the body, intellectual knowledge transcends sensory knowledge and things of this nature. These things are really spiritual and abstract for we cannot touch them. We shall therefore at this juncture examine critically one after the other this spiritual and abstract manifestation of self-transcendence to see to what extent they are true.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2.1 SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>What can we say to be the meaning of a substance? It can be defined as a being whose nature is to exist in itself. For instance, we can see such things like racehorse, maple tree, robin, human being etc whose centers of existence and activity remain independent.  “Beings that go on being what they are behind the restless face of everyday change” 5</p> <p></p> <p>On the other hand, accident “refers to those beings that cannot exist on their own, any more than the grin on the face of the cat can be found apart from the cat”6. The basic and outstanding fact about these ways of being (accident) is that they cannot exist on their own and so depend on some prior being for their existence. Hence “an accident can then be defined as a being whose nature is to exist in another”7.</p> <p>          </p> <p>The word substance is derived from the Latin term sub (under) stans (standing) and it literally means “Standing under” or that which stands under. Substance constitute the very nature or essence of a thing and accident represents any of its qualities which is not essential to its nature; for instance color, size, weight etc. Various philosophers equally contributed on the superiority of substance over accident. Therefore, one can courageously say that substance transcends accident. This was so because the concept of transcendence not only dwells on material and tangible things but also goes beyond. For Descartes “substance is an existent which requires nothing but itself in order to exist”8.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.2.2 BODY AND SOUL</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The concept of transcendence is seen and experienced in the body and soul relationship. It was indeed an issue that captured the minds and thoughts of many philosophers and theologians alike. The human soul is the principle of intellectual activity and as such, it is incorporeal and subsistent. That is to say that the human soul in its relationship with the body can “exist and operate even when it is separated from the body”9.</p> <p>Consequently, the soul being the principle of intellectual life, takes the form of the human body. The transcendence of the human soul over the body is equally seen in the immortality of the soul, but the human soul is a spirit as well as soul; that is, it has activities-understanding and willing – which being intrinsically independent of the body for their exercise, indicate an act of existence equally independent of the body. There is therefore no principle of death in the soul, for neither can it be broken up into parts nor is it vitally dependent upon some other being whose destruction it would share. This is because the soul of man is spiritual as we noted earlier since it performs operations that are independent of matter. Aristotle and Saint Thomas Aquinas would see the human soul as the substantial form of the body as against philosophers like Plato and Descartes for whom the soul is a separate substance independent of the body to which it is accidentally united or as against the views of John B. Watson and David Hume who see the human soul as something that is unknowable or does not exist at all. The point remains that the human soul is superior to the body and many religions will support this view. This is why at the point of death as some religions hold, the soul leaves the body and does not decay and the body on the other hand decays. Therefore as spiritual, the soul of man must be the “product of a direct creation; it must be immortal, for </p> <p>there is no principle of dissolution in a spiritual being”10.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2.3 MAN AND THE CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The creation account shows that human beings are creatures of God, made in his image and likeness (Gen 1:27) and as such “they are the words of visible creation under God”11. The scripture made us understand that no other thing was created in the image and likeness of God except man. Hence, the only animal that resembles God is man. This resemblance is seen in our soul. This therefore bears an eloquent testimony of the superiority and importance of man over all the created things. Besides, an image is a copy of something else, resembling it in some specific way.</p> <p></p> <p>“Men and women are important images of God, who infinitely transcends them, because they have a specific likeness to God in virtue of their spiritual operations of understanding and willing”12. The transcendence of man over the world is also felt in the immortality of man’s soul as against other creatures of God. Whereas other things will one day perish and go out of existence, the human soul does not perish. Besides all these, man is the only animal given the power to walk upright (Homo erectus). He is the only animal that is endowed and gifted with the faculty of reasoning. (homo sapiens) and many other factors that make man unique among the creatures of God. Other creatures like plants and other lower animals cannot boast of these things. Considering the above enumerated talents and gifts to man, we see that he is really a unique being. This uniqueness therefore distinguishes him from all other creatures. For instance, man can engage himself in the production of many things in the field of science and technology. Thanks to his intellect and rationality. Besides, man is a creature that thinks and deliberates over an action before executing it and he is quite conscious of himself. That is why he can be held responsible for his daily actions. These things cannot be found among the lower animals. For instance, one cannot hold a goat responsible for eaten up ones yam in ones farm or barn because a goat does not posses the above outstanding qualities which man possesses. It is not in the nature of a goat to possess these things. On the other hand, man possesses all these qualities and this makes man a unique animal or being. It is because of these facts and many other ones that we say that man transcend his environment and the creatures in it.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2.4 GOD AND THE UNIVERSE</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>To talk about the transcendence of God over the universe is already a clear fact to the human knowledge. Our emergence into this world and the entire universe itself is the handwork of God. This is because created things cannot be greater than its creator and as a matter of fact should remain under its direction and sustainance.</p> <p>In short there is nothing which is not subject to the government of God, for it is God who maintains all creatures in existence and moves all things including subordinate causes, in accordance with his will13</p> <p></p> <p>This implies therefore that there is no cause which can impede his action, because no cause can happen independent of him. God shows his transcendence over all creatures by preserving them in existence. “Just as the song is continually dependent upon the singer if it is to be heard, so the creature is continually dependent upon God if it is to exist”14. God moves and sees to the movement of all the creatures and through this movement which they receive from God, they are able to act since they cannot act outside God. Therefore, we can say that God “rouses creatures from inactivity to activity”15 We can also deduce here that this movement of the universe presupposes a mover who is not moved himself by any other thing since he transcends both the creatures and movement. God is indeed the “prime mover, the unmoved mover and the source of the motion of the universe”16. The creature “remains a contingent being deriving its existence from God and so the creature exists only as long as God sustains it”17.</p> <p>          </p> <p>Stretching the transcendence of God over the creatures, we come to see his immutability. What does this means? It means that “God is in no way subject to change”18. All other creatures can change from one state to another. For instance; man changing from the state of poverty to richness etc. God is eternal because he continues to exist of himself without having beginning and without the possibility of ceasing neither acquiring anything nor suffering the loss of anything. Simply put, God transcends the universe.<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>1.3 MANIFESTATION OF SELF-TRANSCENDENCE IN OUR        DAILY PROGRAMMES AND THE WORLD</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The limitedness of man which springs up as a result of man’s boundedness within space and time does not make him wait on nature in providing for his well-being. For instance, he throws himself into creating and inventing many things. Today, man has many achievements like the construction of modern houses, reduction in infant mortality, and complete eradication of some diseases through medicines, processed food items, easy means of transportation in  the air, sea and land and all these are possible due to the break through in science and technology; that is the outcome of human ingenuity. In politics, man also propounds laws and the rule of life for a better conduct and happy future. Ethics also contributes its own quota. It helps to create the awareness on what to do and what to guard against for the overall welfare of all. These guiding principles make man to live in peace and harmony with others. Economically, man is also making sincere efforts to ameliorate his ugly and devastating situation in the world. </p> <p>          </p> <p>Man also brings in sophiscated implement like tractors instead of relying on local implement in his farm work. But one thing remains clear and that is that man is simply seeking to transcend himself in all these actions and consequently arrive at a better condition and fulfilled life.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1]  L.

THOMAS AQUINAS</b></p> <p><br/>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.0            </b><b>THE GENERAL NOTION OF FREEDOM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The concept of freedom is an analogous one, predicated in different ways to beings of very different types. The various forms of attribution depend, to a certain extent, not by defining the same specific content, but by indicating formal relation, which remains the same. This relation can be put negatively or positively. </p> <p></p> <p>Negatively, freedom means being free from the relation of not being bound to a given being or law, of being independent from something and of not being determined by a given principle of determination. This negative concept is also a relative one because every finite being belongs to a world and is related to the other being in the world. It may be free from this direct relationship to this or that, but only because their place are taken by others.</p> <p>A being fully free in the negative sense could not be a being in the world, without relationship fully isolated, it would be based on nothing and be nothing.1</p> <p></p> <p>Thus in contrast to the negative, relative concept, there is a positive absolute concept of freedom. A being is positively free in so far as it is in possession of itself and possesses in this relationship the sufficient condition for all its being and relations. Here, freedom means self-possession being completely present to oneself, completely self-sufficient.</p> <p>According to Maslaw </p> <p>Freedom is the basic acknowledgment</p> <p>that the individual is more important</p> <p>than his society.2  </p> <p>However, human freedom is clearly neither merely negative and relative nor fully positive and absolute. Man has dominion over himself and so also over parts of the world. But he is non-the-less inserted into the world and dependent on the beings he finds himself. The basic mode of human freedom may be called transcendental freedom, which is the fundamental propriety of man by which he alone can say he is. </p> <p>It follows that man can never be deprived of this transcendental freedom, which is part and parcel of his existence. But its emptiness and importance point on to another mode of freedom. Man is not simply there, he does not simply grow, he has to be, he is a task absolutely imposed on himself he has to decide to be himself or what he will be and there is no way in which he can evade this decision. </p> <p>This mode is called the freedom of decision or existential freedom. This directly implies freedom of choice since an arbitrary freedom would be no freedom, a man free in this sense, will leave his actions at the mercy of mood whim or chance.</p> <p>                   Freedom in general may be defined as</p> <p>                   the absence of obstacles to the realization </p> <p>of desires.3</p> <p></p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1     THE MEANING OF FREEDOM   </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Freedom! Everybody wants it, it makes a man a human being, poets praise it, and politicians promise or proclaim it. Some people have given their lives to win it for themselves or for others, but what actually is it? St Thomas Aquinas sees it as absence of coercion. Coercion or compulsion bears on the external action and corresponds to the absence of external coercion. This is variously named according to the kind of activity involved. </p> <p>Thus we have physical freedom, civil freedom, political freedom, freedom of self-realization, freedom of choice, and freedom for self-perfection. Psychological freedom or freedom of choice corresponds to absence of internal coercion, that is the power of the will to will something or not. External is contingent on internal freedom, since the former has no meaning without the latter, but the converse is not necessarily true.                                       </p> <p></p> <p>A Survey of Yves R. Simons book ‘Freedom of Choice,’ contrasts to some extent the St Thomas Aquinas notion of freedom. For example he investigated on freedom and voluntariness, and said that  “there is unqualified voluntariness without freedom”4 </p> <p>                                                      </p> <p><b>1.2       KINDS OF FREEDOM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Man is full of dynamism, and his activities are equally the same. Hence his conception of freedom differs according to their different activities. Man’s activities are not just determined by external factors like a piece of stone that is moved or a computer game that is moved by the pads. It sometimes comes from his awareness of his own freedom and ability to decide for himself. Among all these, freedom still remain verse to comprehend at each moment, but for better apprehension, I will examine briefly the kinds of freedom in the following sequence.</p> <p>Human Freedom</p> <p>This is simply a matter of accepting the Universe because you understand its mathematical necessity. This done, you will gain peace of mind, be free from passions and be able to return good for evil. This human freedom implies that man has the natural ability to act at length without being injurious to others.</p> <p></p> <p>Freedom Of Religion</p> <p>Freedom of religion could be identified as the right of a person to have free exercise of religion without compulsion or coercion. He is allowed to worship anything, anywhere, anytime according to the dictates of his conscience. Murray said on his own part that religious freedom is ‘…an immunity from Coercion in what concerns personal relation with God’5    </p> <p></p> <p>For the authenticity of religion to be realized, many societies adopt freedom of religion.</p> <p><b>Freedom Of Choice</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p> This is the principle of action by which man judges freely. Apart from this, Aquinas maintained that freedom of choice is not a habit but a power since it proceeds from man. He called it an election. He compared ‘man’ and ‘animal’ and stated that man acts out of comparism in the reason, while animals acts from natural instinct. Since man acts out of comparism, he acts by free Judgment and equally retains the power of being inclined to many things. Thus man has free choice.</p> <p></p> <p>Freedom of choice refers either to the act of the will, or to the object of the will. In the first instance, there is freedom of exercise, in the second, freedom of specification. Freedom of exercise means that the will is at liberty to choose or not to choose, to operate or not to operate. The point to emphasize here is that one is not compelled to act.</p> <p></p> <p>Freedom Of Self-Perfection</p> <p>Here St. Thomas believed and taught that man ought to tamper and train his Soul, and the dignity of man lies in self-mastery. Now, man’s nature is constituted in such a way that reason and will must always guide and direct his actions. In so doing man has self-control, since that makes him a person. Any man who allows passion, money, power etc to overtake him, is not free, since he feels free outwardly, but inwardly remain enslaved to vice, greed, power, pride, and ambition. </p> <p></p> <p>Fulton Sheen in his book ‘On Being Human’ maintained that freedom is not gained at once, but a gradual process, which continues until one reaches the peak. Man is not expected to become an angel, but man, which is his ontological vocation, man cannot be perfect in an imperfect world.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>Freedom of Self Realization </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Each man is a microcosm, in other words, said to be represented in a small scale. He occupies an important and irreplaceable position in the entire universe. He is a being who has a mission in the world. And the achievement of this mission is the realization of himself. Each man is a bundle of potentialities. These potentialities when realized or actualized become the individual’s contribution to development of the entire human family.</p> <p></p> <p>Self-realization, according to Anthony Storr is said to be:</p> <p>The fullest possible expression in</p> <p>life of the innate potentialities of</p> <p>the individual, the realization of </p> <p>this uniqueness as a personality.6 </p> <p>It consists in productiveness, spontaneous activity as opposed to compulsion, love and active solidarity with human beings. It consists in accepting oneself as the bearer of human potentialities and being ready to grow through creative activity. It is the man who uses his powers that answers the fundamental question of his individual existence. Freedom of self-realization is only possible in and through the facticity, which surround each person, it cannot be more than this. They include, height, colour, strength, intelligence, sex, race etc.</p> <p></p> <p>Karl Rahner held that:</p> <p>                   Freedom is only freedom in the </p> <p>                   concrete sense, when all those</p> <p>                   freedoms are combined.7</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Aquinas on his own part noted that,</p> <p>Freedom is seen not as independence</p> <p>from an absolute but as independence</p> <p>From the relatives.8</p> <p></p> <p>In the history of philosophy and social thought, freedom has a specific use as a moral and social concept to refer either to circumstance which arise in the relations of man to man to specific conditions of social life. Philosophical argument about the meaning or the nature of freedom is concerned with the legitimacy or convenience of particular application of the term. Bertrand Russels often held that freedom in general is that absence of obstacles to the realization of one’s desires.</p> <p></p> <p>1.3     AQUINAS NOTION OF FREEDOM</p> <p> </p> <div> </div><p>            This medieval theologian understood freedom to be the harmony of the will and the act. And the consideration is the divine influence and the will. Implicitly, the relation of harmony, the divine influence and the will is freedom. Hence, a free act is constituted by the assent of the will rather than by the decision of the will. It implies then that this cannot be freedom as self-determination.</p> <p>The term in Aquinas closest in meaning and usage to the contemporary term freedom, is perhaps liberty9</p> <p></p> <p>But for John Locke;</p> <p>It is to be free from constraint and violence from others, which cannot be, where there are no law10</p> <p></p> <p>Freedom may mean absence of constraint and this is what is proper to man. There is no right minded individual who would applaud constraints. Being free from constraint means being free from choice imprisonment. </p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.4     LIMITS OF FREEDOM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>While we reject the view that man is not free, or that freedom is an illusion, we must not accept the Sartrean exaggerated notion of freedom. According to Sartre in his book ‘<i>Being and Nothingness’</i>, man is absolutely free. Man he said, is condemned to be free and man’s authentic existence is realized to the extent that he makes use of his freedom.</p> <p> Man is free, yes, but his freedom has to be limited by certain things such as his body, will, environment, desires and passion, pressures from heredity, society etc.</p> <p></p> <p>Walter Farrel in his book ‘<i>A Companion to Summa’ </i>vol.iii supported this when he used the analogy of a wild bird beating out its life against the windows of a desolate house into which it has wondered, to awaken pity on us. Also in man, who is confined to a space and who is imperfect and limited, struggling day in and out to be unlimited and free. We find such a situation in the incessant discoveries by science to know if it can give meaning to human life, but what happens, we still experience some sort of imperfection in all these. </p> <p></p> <p>Also as a social being, man is limited by his very nature of being forced to be social by nature, he is compulsorily limited to stay where his body permits him to be. The existentialists emphasized this when they said that man as a social being in the world is subjected to the laws of nature.</p> <p></p> <p>We should not say that limitation is the essence of human freedom because man’s insatiable tension towards the absolute and good is limitless, rather as an incarnate being, a being in the world, his body which situates him in the world limits his freedom. It then follows that man is not absolutely free, since there are some limitations.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5            </b><b>SOCIAL STRUCTURE OF FREEDOM.</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Since freedom is transcendental distance and transcendental spontaneity, it is essentially part of man. But this primordial freedom is still only the basis for existential freedom, the realization of man as person, it is not yet this personal being in actual reality, transcendental and transcendental freedom are actuated only in the decision of the existential freedom for its own essence – as basic form. But R.S. Peters held that:</p> <p>                   Freedom means not doing what one wills</p> <p>without restraints but accepting</p> <p>the law or the real will of the community.11</p> <p></p> <p>It follows that human freedom can never be a simple state of man or a specialized propriety, but neither is it simply the actuation of selfhood, nor pure act without the history like the divine freedom. But on the contrary, human freedom is history by its very nature. Man is wholly claimed by the works to be done and the states to be achieved. He becomes truly a person by going freely out of himself- to throw himself into the work to be done. </p> <p>Thus human freedom is not a state, as it is in things, freedom from this or that compulsion nor is it as in God a pure act of self-consciousness. Freedom is the history of a person’s coming to himself, which culminates in fully conscious self-possession. In the strict sense, only the individual is with himself, self-possession can be predicted only analogously of a community or a people.</p> <p></p> <p>All these principles recur in the principle which regulates the mode of realization of freedom, the freedom of subsidiary. Freedom in act is identical with the personality of the person. It is the person’s mode of being. This mode of being is at once individual and supra individual condition and uncondition. Conscious selfhood, as an act  feasible only to the self, makes the individual unique as a person.</p> <p></p> <p>These common works are modes of self-realization, of the reality of freedom and the person. But as such modes, there are forms taken by freedom and they retain their meaning and purpose only by being referred back to the person and its reality.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>1 K.

The innate desire, says Aristotle, is both for pragmatic motives and for the sake of knowing. Man wants to know and conquer the realities around him and beyond him. But has not been able, even to unveil the mysteries of his own being “existence.” These various obscurities of man to himself, varied concepts and images of man have been presented according to various ages as below.</p> <p></p> <p>1.1.1 The Ancient Notion of Man</p> <p>The Greek philosophers, interpreted man from ontological perspectives Democritus and other atomists conceived man as wholly composed of atoms and matter. Man is a material reality and possesses characteristics such as singularity, individuality, and concreteness in its being. It is universal and abstract in its qualities.</p> <p></p> <p>Plato, the scribe of Socrates on the other hand laid more emphasis on the spiritual aspect of the being man. For him, the soul pre-existed the body before its union with the body. According to him, the soul pre-existed in the world of forms before it came into the world where it got imprisoned in the body, a vessel and from within this prison exercises its activity.</p> <p></p> <p>For Aristotle, however, man is the only being that has rationality: he reasons, deliberates, imagines etc and so is the only being, animal that possesses the soul, which is in the form of the body. He writes:</p> <p>Man is a soul. The soul has two parts: the rational and the irrational. The rational soul has the power of scientific thought. The reason is capable not only of distinguishing between different kinds’s of things, which is the power of analysis. It is able also to understand the relationships of things to each other, able to deliberate and discover as well the guides for human behaviour.1</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Irrespective of the fact that, no universal concept has been accepted, even the notion of science that man is a machine. Moreover, that man is a composite of cells predetermined by genes. This Aristotelian solution proves most satisfactory.</p> <p></p> <p>1.1.2 The Medieval Notion of Man </p> <p>This is the period of the confluence of philosophy, and theology but more theologically dominated. The Christians, interpreted man as coming from God. For Augustine, because man is unique and unrepeated, he sees him as single specie. Boethius helped him by completing that concept to differentiate man from other animals such as rats, goats etc. For Him, man is not only an individual person but also a rational being. He said; The person is an individual substance of rational nature.2</p> <p></p> <p>For Aquinas, man is a rational subsistent. He is composed of body and soul in his capacity as a “physical substance.”3 He has his highest capacity in the intellect and this makes him a rational animal or a “subsistent rationale” (a rational subsistent).</p> <p></p> <p>Gaurdini in his elegant thought saw man as an autonomous being that decides for him. His notion about man is:</p> <p>Person means that I, in my being definitively cannot be in habited by any other, but that in relation to me, I am only with myself, I cannot be represented by another, but I am guaranteed to myself.4</p> <p> </p> <p>1.1.3 The Modern Notion of Man</p> <p>Anthropomorphism rules this period. Here man is seen as man and later on, as a Supreme Being. He is the measure of all things. It is based on the gnoseological phase since it is all about psychological perspectives.</p> <p></p> <p>Descartes, the rationalist posited that there are two separated substances: the res cogitans et res extenza – The mind and body or the spiritual and corporeal. He says man cannot be composed of mind and body as in the scholastic sense but rather that the mind makes use of the body, as a pilot, would the Plane. He concluded, therefore, that man is the mind. His idea should not be accepted since the mind needs the body to actualize its activities hence function well.</p> <p>Freud, thought man, the true “I” to be the subconscious. For in the subconscious, the requirements of the society and the subconscious meet.</p> <p></p> <p>1.1.4 The Contemporary Notion of Man</p> <p>This is the period of dialogical concepts. It attacks vehemently the Psychological and ontological theories of man. Mounier, in his essay “le personalisme” (personalism) condemned the psychoanalysts, idealists and the Empiricists, who maintained either the concreteness or the spiritual substance of man alone. Rather, he embraced incorporate existence or incarnate existence of thought and body.</p> <p>Other concepts are analyzed thus: economic man (Marx), existent man (Heideggar), symbolic man (Cassirer), Utopic man (Block), Problematic man (Marcel), Cultural man (Gehlem), A thinking reed (Pascal), An image of God (Origin), Will of Power (Nietzsche), Anguished man (Kierkegaard)5 etc.</p> <p></p> <p>We say then, that whether Psychological or ontological, all human beings whether, he or she, white or black, Christian or Moslem, is globally a person made up of four indubitable fundamental elements: autonomy in being, self-consciousness, communication, and self-transcendence. He is free and social. In communication, he intersubjectivises with others in correspondence to love, friendship etc. In self-transcendence, he climbs the ladder of God. He meets the real absolute and eternal.</p> <p></p> <p>Nonetheless, Man as man, as Higgins formulates, means nothing less than the fact that man is also a moral being. He summarized man by the means of Aristotle’s four causes: the material, formal, efficient, and final causes. These four causes make the boldest attempt at satisfying every branch of study that claim to have the concept man. Higgins sees man, in Aristotle’s sense, as a unified whole, a complete substance formed by infusion of two widely differing constituents. One of this is the material element, the undetermined and determined part of him-his body.</p> <p>…by union with a formal or determined cause, this material element put life into a human body, of which its end is a rational animal. This formal cause or soul is a life principle, the absolute, internal reason where man performs his vital action.6</p> <p></p> <p>As for theologians, the efficient and final causes may be regarded as indispensable aspects of man. Augustine (St.), for instance believed that our souls will never rest until, they find rest in Him from whom they come.</p> <p></p> <p>1.1.5 Igbo Notion of Man</p> <p>In every age, every culture around the world has a certain picture of man, vis-à-vis his essential nature.</p> <p></p> <p>Conceptually, the Igbo equivalent meaning for “man” is “mmadu.” Dr. E. M.P. Edeh gives an analysis of the concept mmadu (mma-di), meaning “good that is.”7 Implying that he shares in the being of his maker, the highest good (God).</p> <p></p> <p>Another school of thought gives the analysis of “mmadu” as “mma-ndu,” “the goodness of life.” Here, the concept “the good” is a quality associated with man. He is considered the highest good of all creatures. This concept has a profound implication for the Igbo. If “man” (mma-ndu) is the greatest good,” it follows that for the Igbo, the being of man is an indubitable fact since His life (ndu) is an issue for him (man)8</p> <p>Concisely, there is one indubitable truth about man:</p> <p>There is man. He is there, I am here. Man is a man in the world as J.F. Douceel, noted of the trend of contemporary philosophy. Man does not simply live in the world. He also made us live in it.9</p> <p></p> <p>Thus he writes:</p> <p></p> <p>Man essentially lives in the world that is made up of complex sets of horizons. Man lives in a certain situation in which he can generally not change. It is up to him to assume this situation and make the most use of it.10</p> <p></p> <p>The Platonic-Aristotelian notion of man is therefore crucial with regards to the human existential understanding and our discussion that will be made clear as we proceed.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2 Body and Soul</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The body is one of the elements of man that is naturally sensible and clear in existence. It is the concrete part of man, yet it does not constitute the human reality absolutely. It exists with the soul to make the actual human being. With this fickle nature of the body and soul, we shall look into, the body and soul as a problem; it’s relationship and functions.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2.1    </b><b>The Soul And Body Problem</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Philosophy and anthropology have problem on the usage of the term that designates the psychological faculty in man. Anthropology speaks of mind, philosophers and theologians refer to it as “spirit.” For the scientists, it is operational (i.e. the both terms). It is then left to the philosophers, theologians, and scientists to choose the best, concerning the nature and origin of man.</p> <p></p> <p>The issue of body and soul, at one extreme is the attempt to separate the human body and soul by the Platonic idealism, using the dualism of Descartes. At the other end is the attempt to reduce the mind and body relationship to animal psychology and behavior giving no acknowledgement to man’s soul as truly spiritual entity. “Neither pure spirit nor brute animal, man is an organic spirit and spiritual organism.11  </p> <p></p> <p><b> 1.2.2    Soul and Body Functions</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The body performs both external function as walking, talking, hearing, seeing, taste, smell etc and internal activities as biochemistry and the metrics of genetical informations etc. The somaticity of man transcends and develops into nuclear operations. Mondin. B writes; “Man is able to manage his body, train it, and render it capable of performing movement of admirable perfections”.12</p> <p></p> <p>He is a symbolic being, which is a sign of life health, vigilance, and command. However, man has some characteristics in common with the animals such as growth, reproduction, movement etc.</p> <p>Epistemologically, the body is a vital instrument of acquiring knowledge to Aristotle and Hume, it is through the body that the world manifests itself to me and I project myself on the world (Phenomenology).</p> <p></p> <p>Lastly, the body is the source of evil and likewise a curse to the soul according to the Platonists and Manicheans doctrines.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2.3    </b><b>The Relationship between the Soul and the Body.</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The union of the soul and the body originates as a single being-man. For Aristotle, being soul alone is not man, nor to be body alone but the blend of these two elements. Other supporters of this opinion include; Cajetan, Albert the great, Aquinas and Rosmini. For Hume, their relationship is that of subjective and reflection.</p> <p></p> <p>Plato himself says that the soul is identified with the true essence of man. Freeing the soul is a necessary condition to eliminating the body. Other proponents of this opinion include: Spinoza, Augustine, and Descartes etc.</p> <p>Kant, in his agnosticism rejected all attempts and regarded all soul-body reports as nothing but fallacious. At this point, we say that the soul-body relationship is substantial because the body and the soul cannot operate in isolation. The soul and the body is not a substance because neither the soul nor the body has atoms of autonomous existence or self-initiation. Both of them participate together at the moment of generation. Therefore cannot be identified as a simple accident or a complete substance.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.3 The Origin of Man</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The search for the origin of man dates back to at least the written history of man. This gave rise to some evolutionary theories under Psychological cum biological, scientific, theological, and philosophic thought.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3.1    </b><b>Psychological Cum Biological Thought</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>In this approach, man (Homo erectus, Homo vivens, Homosapiens, Homo volens etc) is regarded as a unique composite of man and spirit, of body and soul.</p> <p></p> <p>For Traducianism, the parents generated both body and soul through the instrumental fission of the ovum and sperm alone. According to it, man originated from a complex structure of molecules called DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid).</p> <p></p> <p>On another note, the soul of man has a proximate spiritual source, the soul of the offspring, must be the soul, which must be an emanation of the souls of the parents.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3.2    </b><b>The Theological Thought</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>According to the theological thought, it is believed the supreme being (God) from whom all things were made and who holds the entire universe in his hands also made man.</p> <p>Let us make man in our image and likeness; let them have dominion over all other creatures… So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.13</p> <p></p> <p>Right down the history, man is an indubitable being that exists in the world otherwise, there would be no history for there would be no man to talk about the past, the present or even predict the future.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.3.3 Philosophical Thought</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>According to the emanation theory, human race emanated from some live forces in the world and some great men fashioned by the gods of Pantheon (The Early Greek pyramid text record). Also, the creationists, pictured man to be descendants or rather, products of Gods so that all things come from divine architecture and genealogy – Theory of creationism. </p> <p>In the 19th century, man was believed to have originated from animals not from gods. An instance is the Darwin’s. “The Descent of man” Here Darwin treated man’s origin and history in the context of animal origins or evaluation. In the evolutionist, theory man is believed to have descended from common ancestors among the primates by natural evolutionary process like isolation, adaptation, natural selection, and mutation.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>1 Stumpf, S.E.

This vision of male supremacy is clearly reflected in all traditional families and societies to an extent that even women were made to accept that they are inferior nature.</div> <div><br/></div> <div>Over centuries, men and women have so internalized this culture of male supremacy, that even when a woman is known to be in possession of the actual power, especially in a family where the woman has the economic power the man would still be expected to assert his authority proudly as the captain of the family ship and the Lord of the society. From the above background men by nature cling to authority and learn to lord it over women.</div> <div><br/></div> <div>Meanwhile, the awareness of certain biological advantages like physical force convinces men  that they are endowed with supremacy nature and the right to control women to their own advantage.</div> <div>In early time, men used because of their intellectual capabilities to justify their supremacy. One of the most influential defence of men is to be found in Aristotle’s writings, where he argues for the justifiability of slavery and the domination of women. Using the analogy of the soul and body, Aristotle argued that men are born to rule women, just as the soul which is superior rules the body and reason rules passion, men should rule woman. For Aristotle, “the male is by nature superior; and the female inferior ; and the one rules and the other is ruled”   </div> <div><br/></div> <div>Aristotle was making his argument from the point of ancient biology, he felt free to universalize the inferiority of women. In another instance he went further saying that women represent a defaced human nature. The female he argued is “a mutilated male” </div> <div><br/></div> <div>The topic “feminists critique on Aristotle’s gender perspective” is really apt within the global crusade for women liberation and empowerment. This crusade can be seen both in the civil societies  and among individuals. The core question is should women be treated as persons with right, dignity and voice within the community? They should be acknowledged as citizens members of the civil society. In recent times, there has been an incessant cry on the plight  of women  in the society, due to this cry that some feminists took as a duty to fight for the unhealthy treatment of women which was traced right from Aristotle’s writings.</div> <div><br/></div> <div>1.1 A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF ARISTOTLE</div> <div>Aristotle was born in Staigeira in 384 B.C His father was a physician and it was no doubt from interest in biology. At the age of seventeen, Aristotle went to Athens to study and there he joined Plato’s academy and remained for over twenty years a pupil of Plato, studying  under him in the academy. After Plato’s death, Aristotle left the academy and began to develop his own philosophy. He eventually founded his own institution, the lyceum, where he lectured and carried out a lot of scientific research. The members of this school frequently help academic discussions while walking up and down on ambulatory, and this earned them his name peripatetic, and the school became known as the peripatetic school. Aristotle’s main interest beside philosophy was in the empirical sciences, especially biology. Aristotle was invited to Macedon in 343 B.C by Philip, King of Macedon to educate his son Alexander who was then about thirteen years old. Aristotle thus became the tutor of the Alexander the Great.</div> <div><br/></div> <div>Aristotle wrote books on a variety of subjects, logic, physics, metaphysics, ethics, politics, psychology, biology, Aesthetics and Rhetoric. His works on logic are collectively known as Organon, those on physics include De Caelo and De Generatione et corruptione. His works on psychology include the De Anima and biological works include his History of Animals his famous work metaphysics is a collection 0f lectures that were considered difficult to understand. His works on Ethics include the famous Nichomachean Ethics and Magna Moralia. His politics was based on a study of 158 different constitutions including the constitution of Athens.</div> <div><br/></div> <div>1.2\tSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</div> <div>Some men up till recent times have not found the situation of women’s predicament as a problem. They are in most cases not concerned with the plight of women. Even in learning about women, men are not interested, they have accepted this situation as normal and any contrary situation is considered as abnormal. Women are valued in most cases only for their outward appearances and services they render to men’s passions. It is worthy noting that the women who suffer this unhealthy treatment are our mothers, sisters, in-laws, wives and daughters.</div> <div><br/></div> <div>1.3\tPURPOSE OF THE STUDY</div> <div>The courage for this topic came from two sources, the first is the personal experience of how people ignore women and regard them as inferior to men and a belief that it is important to seriously what people have said about women. Women are still in many places treated as non persons, inferior, second class citizens and weak gender. The second source was an increasing awareness of and interest in what seemed to be some central tensions in feminist thinking and in the relationship between these tension and philosophical theories.</div> <div><br/></div> <div>I am to explore some of these tensions and in particular to look at these which centre on the idea of a specifically female philosophical  perspective. Women have wanted autonomy and have appealed to philosophical theories to express this, but some women have also argued that many conceptions of autonomy are male defined. They have wanted equality with men and have fought against their exclusion from theories put forward by men and my journey in this topic is to make necessary effort to identify and discuss what seem to me to be central tension in feminist thinking and the way in which these have involved both a use and a critique of philosophical theories against gender equality.</div> <div><br/></div> <div>1.4\tSCOPE OF STUDY</div> <div>In this work emphasis will be based mainly on certain violent practices committed against women especially African women. Some of the various ways in which women have suffered violence will be explored both from the societal circle and that of the individual.</div> <div><br/></div> <div><br/></div> <div>1.5\tMETHODOLOGY</div> <div>The method to be employed in this research work be expository, evaluative and practical. On expository part, I shall expose some of men’s actions that affect women physically and psychological. It will be evaluative, since  I am going to evaluate certain tensions in the feminists thinking and the relationship between these tensions and philosophical theories.  Finally, it will be practical since some research work is experimental and deals with the observable facts of our daily life as Africans.</div> <div><br/></div> <div>Meanwhile, this work is divided into five chapters; in chapter one, general introduction on the nature of the work. In chapter two, literature review on the topic from different philosophical theories. In chapter three, Aristotle’s theories on soul and body as an analogy used in as position of women and men also in his theory of  women and slavery, in the subsection of the chapter, the effect of the above theories on women. In the fourth chapter is the ideology of feminism and types of feminism, also in the subsection of the chapter, is strategies for justice on women. Lastly, in the fifth chapter is the evaluation of the whole work and conclusion of the whole work.</div> <div><br/></div>\n\nFEMINISTS CRITIQUE ON ARISTOTLE GENDER PERSPECTIVE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FEMINISTS CRITIQUE ON ARISTOTLE GENDER PERSPECTIVE", "id": 58}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><b>SOCIAL CONTRACT IN JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU – IMPLICATIONS FOR NIGERIAN DEMOCRACY</b><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>  Table of Contents     </b><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1    General Introduction.   …  …  …  <br/>1.2    Statement of Problem.  …  …  <br/>1.3    Purpose of Study.         …  …  …  <br/>1.4    Scope of Study.            …  …  <br/>1.5    Methodology.               … …  …  <br/>1.6    Division of Work.        …  …  <br/>          CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.1    Rousseau on Social Contract.  <br/>2.1.1    Man in the state of Nature.      <br/>2.1.2    The Social Contract.   …  …  …  …  …  <br/>2.1.3    General will and will of all.    <br/>2.1.4    Civil State and Law.  …  …  …  … …  <br/>2.1.5    Government and Types of Government<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0    Nigerian Democracy in Practice.    <br/>3.1    Review of Nigerian Democratic trials. <br/>3.1.1    The first Republic.  <br/>3.1.2    The second Republic.  <br/>3.1.3    The Third Republic.      <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.1    Rousseau’s Social Contract and Nigerian Democracy.  <br/>4.2    General Analysis.   <br/>4.3    Deductions for Nigerian Democracy via Rousseau’s <br/>         Social Contract <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>5.1    Critical Evaluation<br/>5.2    Conclusion.                 <br/>Bibliography              <br/><b>CHAPTER ONE</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1            </b><b>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>It is in the nature of man as a social being to live together in a community. But, to achieve his utmost fulfilment, man desires to live in peace and harmony with his environment, persons and things alike. Hence, every nation continues to search for a workable system that would permit her citizens to live together in peace as much as possible. It is this quest by man for harmonious living that Rousseau addressed in his Social Contract, which he also refers to as: ‘the Principles of political right;’ a living reality which must be found present wherever there is a legitimate government.  This living reality according to S.E. Stumpf, is the fundamental principle underlying a political association; this principle helps to overcome the lawlessness of absolute licence and assures liberty, because people willingly adjust their conduct to harmonise with the legitimate freedom of others.1 </p> <p></p> <p>By this Rousseau seems set to present a prototype for all legitimate governments, which when conformed to, the sky would be the limit of the political freedom, liberty, equality and rule of law to be witnessed therein.  And even Rousseau emphasised that no demarcation should exist between morality and politics. On this statement is hinged the belief that Rousseau inspired the French revolution of 1789.</p> <p></p> <p>However, the theory of social contract is so important in social and political philosophy that it did not start from Rousseau. Political philosophers like Plato, Hobbes and Locke had used it to situate the origin of the civil society.  Plato holds that the origin of the state is a reflection of people’s economic needs; “a state comes into existence because no individual is self-sufficing; we all have many needs,” there must, therefore be a division of labour.2  Thomas Hobbes in his <i>Leviathan</i> says of people giving up their rights of governing themselves, to this man or to this assembly of men, who undertakes the function of protecting man from the strife and war of the state of nature, which he says leaves “the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.”3 On the other hand, John Locke talks of man uniting into a commonwealth and placing themselves under government, for the preservation of their property. ‘Property,’ here in Locke’s thought refers to ‘lives, liberty and estates.’ 4</p> <p></p> <p> Rousseau prefers to take a middle position on the thoughts of his predecessors.  He presents the problem of social contract as not simply to find a form of association, which will protect the persons, and goods of each member.  But also to find an association in which each member will still obey himself and remain as free as before.5  This point brings out the reason why the peoples’ consent becomes important in major decisions affecting them.  Thus, Rousseau summarises the essence of the social contract in these words:</p> <p>Each of us puts his person and all his power in common under the supreme direction of the general will, and, in our corporate capacity, we receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole.6 </p> <p></p> <p>The general will he referred to is the will of the “Sovereign”, where the sovereign stands for the total number of citizens of a given society.  Such being the case, the general will of the sovereign is the single will, which reflects the sum of the wills of all the individual citizens.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, the thoughts espoused by Rousseau in his social contract have some affinity with the principles of democracy, especially the use he made of the general will.  These principles of democracy are distinctly shown in the definition of democracy, given by the Chambers Twenty-first Century Dictionary as ‘a form of government in which the people govern themselves or elect representatives to govern them.’7 Obviously democracy means rule by the people, the common people. A state of society where freedom for the people, justice and equality of rights and privileges; both political, social or legal equality are recognised.</p> <p></p> <p>Similarly, these principles of democracy are clearly enshrined in the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Hence section 14(1) of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria declares it thus; “The Federal Republic of Nigeria shall be a state based on the principles of democracy and social justice.”8  Further, same section 14(2a) of the 1999 constitution declares, “Sovereignty belongs to the people of Nigeria from whom government through this constitution derives all its powers and authority.”9 And section 14(2b) has it that “the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government.”10</p> <p></p> <p>However, the factual experience of the Nigerian democratic practice for three good republics now, betrays the fact and makes the constitutionalised principle a huge hoax. The principles of democracy have been completely distorted and misrepresented.  It was as if Franklin Roosevelt had Nigeria in mind when he talked about people being fed up with a democracy that breeds unemployment, insecurity, hunger and hopelessness.  Nigerians have continued to wait to no avail for the dividends of democracy.  The present dispensation leaves no light at the end of the tunnel. </p> <p>Thus, in this work the researcher hopes to make some deductions from the social contract theory of Jean Jacques Rousseau, and apply them to the Nigerian Democratic process. The aim is to effect a re-direction of our deceptive democratic principles and engender proper implementation of democracy in all its facets.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2            </b><b>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The democratisation process in Nigeria since independence has remained nascent in every republic; its practices and processes have remained new, strange and fresh, and in most cases have always ended up in confusion, frustration and chaos. What has continued to go wrong? Ray Ekpu succinctly captures the situation in his article the “<i>End Justifies the Means,”</i> when he said: “…the ingredient standing between Nigeria and greatness is leadership… As far as politics and leadership are concerned Nigeria is still a psychiatric case due in part to the haemorrhage inflicted on it by most of its leaders.”11 True to fact, Nigeria’s forty-five years of independence have seen various administrations, military and civilian, all of which can be described as having struggled to make Nigerians strangers in their own land.</p> <p></p> <p>Worse still, despite the huge financial resources claimed to have been expended on the overall administration of the country and the provision of amenities, the socio-economic and political situation in the country have deteriorated almost irredeemably.  While political office holders only scramble for public resources, infrastructures are completely neglected, inflation is galloping, civil servants and pensioners are owed their entitlements for several months, unemployment has almost reached unmanageable levels, and poverty remains a menace people must face.</p> <p></p> <p>It is on this backdrop that intelligent observers would agree that the first forty-five years of our independence have been, even as S.G Ikoku has put it “a monumental failure.”12 What we experience now is the rule of minority instead of the rule of majority, which is the true principle of democracy. Evidently, Nigeria is not practising any “true” democracy. At best what we have is “deceptive” democracy.  This essay proposes to tackle, some of these problems.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>1.3            </b><b>PURPOSE OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The researcher was spurred by the words of the Nobel Laureate, Wole Soyinka; when he said that: ‘the man dies in all who keeps silent in the face of tyranny.’13  Thus, this work seeks to diagnose the political arthritis and democratic rheumatism that have bedevilled Nigeria since independence, and attempt a treatment with the deductions or implications drawn from the Social Contract of Jean Jacques Rousseau.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4            </b><b>SCOPE OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>There is no doubt that Jean Jacques Rousseau has several works to his credit, but the concern of this work is the social contract (of 1762).  The context of study would be limited to the Nigerian democratic experience.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5            </b><b>METHODOLOGY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The method of approach employed in this work is philosophical, expository, and evaluative. More so, narrative technique is adopted by the researcher to bring to limelight, the condition of Nigerian democratic experience since independence.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.6            </b><b>DIVISION OF WORK</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The Work is divided into five chapters.  Chapter one gives a general introduction of the essay, the statement of the problem, method used, scope of study and purpose of study.  Chapter two exposes the social contract theory of Rousseau, while chapter three takes care of the Nigerian democratic practice.  Then, chapter four brings chapters two and three together in a general analysis.  At last we shall conclude with critical evaluation and conclusion in chapter five.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>1 S.E Stumpf, <i>Philosophy: History and Problems,</i> 5th edition (New York: McGraw-Hill Inc., 1994), p. 296.</p> </div> <div> <p>2 Ibid., p. 70</p> </div> <div> <p>3 Ibid., p. 232</p> </div> <div> <p>4 Ibid., p. 273</p> </div> <div> <p>5 J.J.

</b><b>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Human quest for sustainable development can be traced back to the very onset of human existence.  This explains why human history is replete with various attempts by man to better his conditions at various points in time.</p> <p></p> <p>In our own time, this noble quest has assumed a more generic status in an attempt to transform the whole world into a <i>global village,</i> where humanity would share a common developmental experience.  This emerging global order, known as <i>Globalization</i>, is a continuous process and no one can claim to possess a full knowledge of its dimensions or even to exist outside its influence. </p> <p></p> <p>While its proponents have stressed the opportunities and benefits of this phenomenon, there is also increasing disillusionment towards it among many schools of thought in both developed and developing nations.  The rationale behind these changing perceptions and attitudes includes lack of tangible benefits to most developing countries especially those in Africa.</p> <p></p> <p>Hence, there are myriads of questions that challenge the philosophy of globalization and the authenticity of its numerous claims and promises.  This explains why a critical inquiry into the intricacies of the current globalization process is not only pertinent but also inevitable. </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2             </b><b>PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE INQUIRY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Expectedly, many scholars have pondered and are still pondering on the overall effects of globalization on the entire human race.  These studies are not only necessitated by the controversy hovering around the phenomenon, as explained above, but by the apparent marginalization and increasing impoverishment of its less privileged participants.</p> <p></p> <p>I, therefore, wish through an existential inquiry into the dynamics and the philosophical background of the current globalization process, to expose its contents. This would then enable us to extrapolate its possible implications to the quest for sustainable development in Africa.</p> <p></p> <p>As a philosophical inquiry, this study would try to analyze the <i>raison d’etre</i> of the current globalization process. My major contention is that sustainable development is all about human beings and business is about ethics.  Hence, the <i>terminus ad quem</i> of globalization should be the holistic development of humanity in ways that are sustainable for people of all races and for all generations.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3             </b><b>METHODOLOGY OF RESEARCH</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>I wish to employ both expository and evaluative approach to this study.  Thus, we shall delineate the philosophy of globalization <i>vis-à-vis</i> the existential status of Africa. These would serve as the premises for extrapolating the implications of globalization to African development.<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p></p> <p>In general, the work is made up of five chapters. Chapter one offers a synoptic view of the entire work as well as the views of various scholars on globalization. The second chapter exposes and examines the concept and nature of globalization as it pertains to this study. The notion of sustainable development and its current status in Africa is discussed in chapter three, while the fourth chapter carefully extrapolates the implications of globalization to sustainable development in Africa.  Then, as a finishing touch, the fifth chapter critically evaluates the whole intellectual exposure.</p> <p></p> <p>With genuine humility, I do not intend to undertake an exhaustive inquiry into this topic: globalization and African development. Therefore, my research will be in tandem with those already carried out by erudite scholars on the subject.</p> <p></p> <p>1.4       <b>LITERATURE REVIEW</b></p> <p>Globalization is certainly at the heart of the contemporary age as an indispensable factor in its developmental process.  Hence, our effort in this brief literature survey is to explore how some scholars conceive the globalization process <i>vis-à-vis</i> its implications to sustainable development in Africa.</p> <p></p> <p>Obviously, many scholars see globalization as a mere economic phenomenon, involving the increasing interaction or integration of national economic systems through the growth in international trade, foreign investments and trans-border capital flow.  However, one can also point to the rapid increase in cross-border socio-cultural and technological exchange as important and integral dimensions of globalization. In this light, Anthony Giddens, a renowned sociologist, simply defined globalization as the “decoupling of space and time.”[1]  He emphasized that through instantaneous communication, knowledge and culture can be shared around the world simultaneously. </p> <p>This idea is more explicitly portrayed by Rund Lubbers, a Dutch political economist, who defined globalization as </p> <p><i>               A process in which geographic distance becomes a factor of diminishing importance in the establishment and maintenance of cross-border economic, political and socio-cultural relations.<b>[2]</b></i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p></p> <p>In agreement with the afore-mentioned scholars, David Held and Anthony McGrew, in their entry for <i>Oxford Companion to Politics,</i> made a subtle attempt to characterize globalization and its effects on socio-cultural as well as on political structures. They conceived globalization as </p> <p><i>               A process (or set of processes), which embodies a transformation in the spatial organization of social relations and transactions, expressed in transcontinental or interregional flows and networks of activity, interaction and power.<b>[3]</b></i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p></p> <p>Observably, a common denominator here is the optimism of these scholars about globalization. For them, it is a universal process of transforming humanity into a single society or what Marshall McLuhan termed <i>the global village.<b>[4]</b> </i>This transformation, for Henry Alapiki, is usually accompanied by the intensification of universal social relations “which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and <i>vice versa</i>.”[5] In fact, Jan Scholte expressed this view more elaborately when he wrote that:</p> <p><i>               Globalization refers to processes whereby social relations acquire relatively distanceless and borderless qualities, so that human lives are increasingly played out in the world as a single place … Globalization is thus an on-going trend whereby the world has - in many respects and at a generally accelerating rate – become one relatively borderless social sphere.<b>[6]</b></i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p></p> <p>While these scholars view globalization from a “social relations” perspective, others emphasize a more specific economic dimension. The tendency here is to view globalization as a rapid increase in cross-border socio-economic exchange under the conditions of capitalism.  A typical representative of this school is Prof. Oyejide who states that:</p> <p><i>               Globalization refers to the increased integration, across countries, of markets for goods, services and capital.  It implies in turn accelerated expansion of economic activities globally and sharp increases in the movement of tangible and intangible goods across national and regional boundaries.  With that movement, individual countries are becoming more closely integrated into the global economy. Their trade linkages and investment flows grow more complex, and cross-border financial movements are more volatile.  More importantly, globalization has been created, and continues to be maintained by liberalization of economic policies in several key areas.<b>[7]</b></i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p></p> <p>However, the anti-globalization schools view the phenomenon as a worldwide drive towards a universal economic domination by supranational institutions that are not accountable to democratic processes or national governments.  Thus, from the perspective of international “political economy,” Aja Akpuru- Aja and A.C. Emeribe argue that:</p> <p><i>               The engineering mechanism of globalization remains the revolution in science and technology, particularly as it affects transportation and electro-communication systems.  The net result is the creation of a global village, a single market system, a global factory and a global office.  One result of globalization is grotesque and dangerous polarization between peoples and countries benefiting from the system and those that are merely recipients and reactionaries of the effects.<b>[8]</b></i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p>Against this backdrop, one can rightly adduce that globalization seems to transcend mere flow of trade or social relations to perpetrate some form of economic, political and socio-cultural imperialism. This may imply a sort of donor-recipient polarism.  In this case, globalization cannot be a benign force since it would certainly create a world of winners and losers.  This explains why its implications to developing countries, especially those in Africa, appear to be precarious.  </p> <p>Yet, the pro-globalization thinkers maintain that:</p> <p><i>               There is mounting evidence that inequalities in global income and poverty are decreasing and that globalization has contributed immensely to this turn around … The gap between rich and poor is also shrinking with most nations in Asia and Latin America.  The countries that are getting poorer are those that are not open to world trade, notably many nations in Africa.<b>[9]</b></i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p></p> <p>The basic logic here is that poor countries that have lowered their tariff barriers have gained increases in employment and national income.   </p> <p></p> <p>Sequel to this, the World Trade Organization argues that “trade liberalization helps poor countries to catch up with rich ones and that this faster economic growth helps alleviate poverty.”[10] Succinctly put, Professor Ron Duncan of the AustralianNationalUniversity argued point blank that: </p> <p><i>               Although globalization may increase inequality in some countries, this can be remedied with structural responses.  A rise in poverty among the poorest countries results from their not taking part in globalization.<b>[11]</b></i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p>But are we really to blame the poverty in Africa and other under-developed countries on their abstinence from globalization?  Certainly this is not the view of some thinkers, who maintain that globalization is even responsible for the increasing impoverishment and marginalization of the so-called “Third World.” The most frequently used data are those from the UNDP 1999 Development Report. This report shows that the past decade, the decade of the most intense globalization, has shown increasing concentration of income, resources and wealth among people, corporations and countries.[12]</p> <p></p> <p>Situating these findings to the African setting, Yash Tandon, a Ugandan political scientist, argued that:</p> <p><i>            Anybody with any degree of intellectual integrity would see that the globalization of Africa or the integration of Africa into the global economy from the days of slavery to the contemporary period of capital-led integration has on balance of costs and benefits been a disaster for Africa, both in human terms and in terms of the damage to Africa’s natural environment… it is also a measure of their (World Bank/IMF officials) intellectual dishonesty or ideological brainwashing that they cannot see the connection between globalization and Africa’s poverty.<b>[13]</b></i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p>This judgment is in indeed harsh, but it seems to represent the views of many thinkers. For instance, Obiora F. Ike, a theologian and social philosopher, affirms the veracity of this judgment when he questioned and answered thus: “Is globalization good for Africa’s future? Not at all.  I would argue that its present form has been exaggerating the gap between Africa and the so-called developed world.”[14]</p> <p> </p> <p>Thus, Mbaya Kankwenda, a Congolese scholar, concludes that:</p> <p><i>            Globalization has a strong dogmatic and doctrinal dimension.  In this respect it concerns the globalization of market fundamentalism and its paradigm, which in reality is nothing but the keeping in step of developing countries, hence Africa, taking the continent as an object rather than a subject and partner.<b>[15]</b></i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p><i></i></p> <p><i> </i></p><i></i> <p>This is why he considers the globalization of Africa as a forced insertion into the global community through developmental aid conditionalities, resulting in harsh economic and political reforms in Africa.</p> <p></p> <p>Surely, the Church is not passive to the dialectics of globalization since it sees humanity as a single family.  Thus, in <i>Centesimus Annus</i> the church opines that: </p> <p><i>            It is necessary to break down the barriers and monopolies, which leave so many countries on the margins of development and to provide all individuals and nations with the basic conditions, which will enable them to share in development. (Centesimus Annus, no. 35).<b>[16]</b></i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p></p> <p>This view was expressed in the caveat by Pope Benedict XVI (while a cardinal), that: “The economic inequality between the northern and southern hemispheres of the globe is becoming more and more an inner threat to the cohesion of the human family.”[17]The danger of this threat is already portrayed in the new forms of terrorism in the international arena, which paradoxically are the products of, as well as a problem to globalization.</p> <p></p> <p>However, the Church appears to be very optimistic about the possibility and advantages of globalization, since its dangerous tendencies can be easily eschewed.  Thus, in his 2004 World Day of Peace Message, Pope John Paul II repeatedly stressed the fundamental but very simple principle that must guide all our reflections on globalization. According to him,</p> <p><i>            Humanity, however much marred by sin, hatred and violence, is called by God to be a single family … this recognition can give the world as it is today - marked by the process of globalization - a soul, a meaning and a direction.<b>[18]</b></i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p></p> <p>He, therefore, expresses optimistically that: “Globalization, for all its risks, also offers exceptional and promising opportunities, precisely with a view to enabling humanity to become a single family, built on the values of justice, equity and solidarity.”[19]In this way, the Church addresses the question of globalization and its effects on the unity and sustainable development of humanity.  </p> <p></p> <p>As can be deduced from the above expressions, the Church is especially concerned about inequalities as well as the alienation of individuals and communities from economic and social progress.  Indubitably, these seem to summarize the major predicament of Africa in the current globalization process.</p> <p></p> <p>To this extent, we have tried to highlight the views of various schools of thought on globalization <i>vis-à-vis</i> its impacts on Africa. Certainly they contribute to our understanding of the phenomenon.  Yet, it is obvious that more elucidations are still necessary for us to appreciate the existential implications of the current globalization process towards sustainable development in Africa.  This will be our pre-occupation in the subsequent chapters. </p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] Cf.

He stands with Socrates and Aristotle as one of the shapers of the whole intellectual tradition of the West. “He came from a family that had long, played a prominent part in Athenian politics, and it would have been natural for him to follow the same course. He declined to do so, however disguised by the violence and corruption of Athenian political life, and sickened especially by the execution in 399Bc of his friend and teacher, Socrates.”[1]</p> <p></p> <p>Plato sought a cure for the ills of society, not in politics, but in philosophy. It is because of this political instability in Athenian society that Plato wrote his famous book, “The Republic”, and arrived at his fundamental and lasting conviction that those ills would never cease until philosophers become rulers or rulers become philosophers. He believes in the “ideal State”. To Plato, it seemed natural that competence should be the qualification for authority. The ruler of the State should be one who has the peculiar abilities to fulfill that function. Looking at history, the world can boast of some rulers who had natural competence, rulers who are philosophically inclined and these same rulers gave a good account of themselves when they ruled. Some of these great rulers are Odumegwu Emeka Ojukwu, Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Martin Luther King Junior of America, Mahatma Gandhi of India, kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe of Nigeria, Leopold Sedar Senghor of Senegal, Ken Saro Wiwa etc. These great men of history distinguished themselves as prominent and reliable personalities during the difficult periods by helping to bring under control, moments of hardships and difficulty. During the most difficult moment for the Igbo’s (Biafran War), Sir Odumegwu Ojukwu stood as a giant between the poor and helpless Igbo’s and their armed enemies. He left everything he owed, believing to die for his people. Nelson Mandela of South Africa showed what is takes to be a great leader, by choosing to be on the side of his people, and remain in prison to being on the side of the enemies, and becoming free. </p> <p>          </p> <p>Taking a look at the situation in Nigerian politics, it seems that we (Nigerians), like the Athenians, are faced with the same leadership problems. Our today leaders have proved to be incapable and philosophically uncritical. This has seriously affected us negatively both socially, politically an economically. With Plato’s Republic, all hope is not lost on our political leaders. Since Plato’s Republic was written in order to arrest the political quagmire in Athens, we hope that Nigerian leaders will become philosophers. “Plato’s idea of rulers becoming philosophers or philosophers becoming rulers is a positive idea.”[2] It has helped towards the development and liberation of many countries like Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Tanzania, India, etc. He had through his Republic, saved many societies, countries, from difficult moments or early extinction. It is highly commendable. Plato, through the Academy, which he founded, trained young men who are to be philosophically sound, so as to be qualified to become future philosopher kings.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] Plato, The Republic, trans.by Desmond Lee, Great Britain, Haze Watson pub.

Thinkers like Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. John Rawls and Jeremy Bentham have employed it in different ways. This implies that the way the social contract theory is understood differs, at least insignificantly, from one philosopher to the other.</p> <p></p> <p>Theories of social contract differed according to their aims; some were fashioned to justify the power of the sovereign; some to safeguard the individual from oppression by an all-powerful sovereign.1</p> <p></p> <p>Despite all these differences, the theory has one central point it pursues. This central point runs through the various meanings of social contract theory as expressed and maintained by various scholars. </p> <p></p> <p>It is an agreement in which the people decide to journey from the state of nature into the political society, by relinquishing their executive power to an absolute Monarch.  It is also an agreement under which people contract to surrender their liberties in return for the guarantee of responsible government.</p> <p>As if every man should say to every man, I authorize and give up my right of governing myself, to this man or to this assembly of men, on the condition that thou give up thy right to him, and authorize all his actions in like manner.2 </p> <p></p> <p>Be it as it may, the major purpose of this project revolves in stating and analyzing the theory of social contract as seen and conceived by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. Also, it posits to tackle certain questions like: </p> <p>a) Does the theory of social contract in Thomas Hobbes share any similarity with that of John Locke?</p> <p>b) Do they contrast at any point at all?</p> <p>c) Can it be said that the social contract theory according to the two philosophers under consideration is completely the same? </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2        </b><b>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p> As earlier stated, social contract theory has been used by many philosophers in various ways. Thomas Hobbes and John Locke also saw it from different perspectives to a certain level. Hobbes, the first to give its full exposition and defence postulates that social contract is an agreement to which the people surrender their will, freedom, and power to an absolute sovereign called the Leviathan. In his words …Thomas Hobbes saw the contract as one in which the citizens relinquish their freedom inherent in the state of nature to an absolute sovereign.3</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>For John Locke, who came after Hobbes…he conceived  social contract to exist wherever some citizens united into one body having a common established law and judicature to appeal to with authority to decide controversies between them and punish offenders. According to Locke:</p> <p>Social contract exist wherever any number of men so unite into one society as to quit every clue of his executive power of the law of nature and to resign it to the public in all cases that excludes him from appealing for protection to the law established by it4</p> <p>The problem consequently hinges in the confusion and discrepancy inherent in trying to understand the two philosophers’ theory of social contract.</p> <p><b>1.3        </b>           <b>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>It is worthy of note to point out here clearly that the theory of social contract is not the generality of the works of our two philosophers. For instance, Hobbes is noted for his Leviathan, he has other works he wrote. The Leviathan is primarily a book on social and political Philosophy; Hobbes had not intended to restrict his attention to that subject caught up in the ocean tide for scientific discovery. He was deeply impressed by the precision of science and all by Certainty.5 </p> <p></p> <p>On his own side, John Locke wrote other works in addition to his social contract. Locke’s most important and influential political writings are contained in his Second Treatises of Government. The second treatise contains Locke’s own constructive view of the aims and justification for civil government and is titled, Essay concerning the true original extent and ends of civil government.6 </p> <p></p> <p>Locke’s books were the product of long years of reading and reflection. As at fifty-four, he has not published something of importance though he has written a good deal that remained in manuscript.  His letter on toleration appeared both in Latin and English in 1689.  His great essay concerning human understanding saw the light of the day in 1690. And in the same year, he published the two treatises of government.</p> <p></p> <p>Most importantly, it should be understood that this project does not intend in any way to handle all the philosophical works of these philosophers in view. The scope of this study is simply limited to their theory of social contract. It does not tackle any other issue outside this. That is to say that other philosophies postulated by the philosophers are outside the scope of this work.</p> <p></p> <p>For a more academic and scholarly work its scope extends to juxtaposing the theories in order to discover certain points at which they agree and at which they disagree.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4            </b><b>           METHODOLOGY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The method of this research work shall be expository and analytical. I intend to expose the different views of Thomas Hobbes and John Locke on social contract. Since   social contract theory does not mean exactly the same thing to both of them. After the exposition of their thoughts, a comparison and a contrast and critical evaluation will follow. Over and above all, this research uses scholarly, academically and philosophical method.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5                  DIVISION OF WORK</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This work is divided into five chapters. Chapter one is an introduction to the work. Chapter two is the historical background of the two philosophers. Chapter three exposes their idea of social contract. Chapter four compares and contrasts the ideas of both philosophers on the subject matter. In Chapter five, social contract in Thomas Hobbes and John Locke will be critically evaluated. Lastly the work is brought to a conclusion.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5         </b><b>LITERATURE REVIEW</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Thomas Hobbes was the first to give full exposition and defence of social contract. He does not have the monopoly of the idea. Just as many ideas and theories of philosophy have been used in different ways. Social contract theory has also been used and applied differently. Here my effort is channelled towards analyzing the concept, social contract as various philosophers understood it. This literature review is a critical analysis of the different notions of social contract. Philosophers to be reviewed include Plato (ca428-ca348BC), Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), and Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-17178).</p> <p></p> <p>Plato is of the view that the individuals and state are logically related. It is through the individual that the society emerges. This implies that the individual exists before the state, as the state radiates the individual constitution of the citizens. The citizens jointly radiate the qualities of the state. Moreso, the state emerges due to the economic needs of the people. This implies that one man cannot make a state; he needs others to solve his economic needs. He needs the artisans, the cooks, the dry-cleaners, the doctors, the lawyers to help him out in various ways or he cannot be all these at a time. This network of economic relationship and interaction brings about the formation of a state. Apart from these, wars have their root in passion, desires which are the most fruitful source of evils both to individuals and state7. To settle the war, we employ the tripartite nature of the soul as divided by Plato. They are: craftsmen, representing the appetitive element, the guardians representing the spirited element and the ruler representing the rational element. </p> <p></p> <p> For Aquinas, the state is a natural institution. It is obtained from the nature of humanity8. Unlike Plato, who holds that humanity’s needs are not only natural and material needs, they also have a super-natural ends. He stated that the state can be explained in terms of God’s creation comprising the state and the church. The church comes into play here in order to help man attain this ultimate goal. Left alone, the state is not equipped for this. The state needs to meet humanity’s social nature. It secures the common good by maintaining the peace and controlling obstacles to the good life. This function of the state in controlling obstacles to the social life is the point of connection between the state and the church; the state is under the control of the church.9 This does not make the church a super-state. </p> <p></p> <p>According to Rousseau in his book, the social contract begins with the oft-quoted line “man was born free, and he is everywhere in chains” (49)10. He started by describing the state of nature. He sees the state of nature as that in which every person is independent. No one depends on the other for his well-being. A geometric progression in the growth population made people to invent social contract. This invented social contract brings about all sorts of vices.</p> <p></p> <p>Social contract came about the need to find a form of association which will defend and protect the whole common force the person and goals of each associate and in which each, uniting himself with all, may still obey himself alone. It is the total alienation of each associate joined with all his rights to the whole community. He gave the reason why people should obey the laws of government as contained in his book; ‘social contract’. What can make it legitimate and not how the change evolved is of his interest. This he explicates further,</p> <p>The really condition of man eludes empirical investigation. Our interpretation, therefore, must take the form of a hypothetical account11.</p> <p></p> <p>According to him, man in the state of nature does not need social attachment and moral qualities. He is motivated by ‘amourde soi’ a natural sentiment. Which is directed by pity and reason gives rise to humanity and virtues. Man has also the reasoning power, free-will and capacity to become better. Man is faced with the task of procuring the means for his own continuous existence and as with the other species; they were guided in this effort by the instinct12. </p> <p>Due to the increase in the number of people in the society, social bond is developed. The acquisition of private property is also introduced. Man begins to look for what he calls ‘mine’. The natural sentiments are replaced with the artificial sentiments (amour proper). This produces injustice and all sorts of evils. An individual begins to make for himself more than he needs.  Intense and unhealthy competition is inevitable under this condition. The political society is established as a solution to the societal ills. It is established through the contract or agreement to guarantee equality and protection for all. </p> <div><br/><div> <p>1 P.

This is a period whose character of rational optimism was diametrically opposed to tradition and authority upon which stood the veracity and logic of primitive religion. It has been a period oriented to the practical. The possession of and ownership of the real. With Kant, the practical reason is already being understood as will. Schopenhauer took up this indication from Kant and conceived reality as will and idea. He opines that the world is a meaningless and purposeless existence or will to live. Nietzsche however, finally accepts the fundamental notion of Schopenhauer that the will is the principle of existence, but he conceives this will not merely as the will to live, but as the will for power.</p> <p>        Along the way to the will to power, the anthropological subject has become central. This turn towards the subject excludes any supreme value in man. Thus, when Nietzsche proclaimed and declared the death of God, he believed that he was accomplishing the work, which other existentialist philosophers started but were unable to complete. Little did he realize the havoc he had caused to the contemporary man. Consequently he joined other thinkers of his time to sweep off the hold of God on the modern man.</p> <p>           With “the death of God” man could surpass himself and attain his greatness.</p> <p>Now it is up to man to give his life meaning by raising himself above the animals. Our so-called human nature is precisely what we should do well to overcome…[1] </p> <p>  </p> <p>It becomes succinctly comprehensible that God, the supreme value was a barrier to man’s attainment of self-fulfillment. However, with the elimination of the idea of God, supposedly a vacuum will be created and thus nothingness could break out in all directions. This at least goes to show the <i>nothingness</i> of religion, which it’s values and morality, find their meaning in God. This is thus the focus of nihilism, which also involves the revaluation of these values. Through nihilism, Nietzsche was able to posit a new value that would replace the old and eliminated` supreme value.</p> <p></p> <p>  Purpose of study.</p> <p>This project is necessary in the face of the present-day unscrutinized quest for faith or religion. For this reason, it will follow a thought-pattern that will argue for the credibility of God and religion. Thus the major task of this work is to criticize without reservation this religious and moral demise of Nietzsche and restore the supreme value to its place in the world.</p> <p>Scope of study.</p> <p>This work does not however guarantee to exhaust the rigorous arguments concerning the existence of God. It does not even pretend to expose the whole philosophical thought of Nietzsche. It will evaluate and criticize Nietzsche’s arguments concerning the existence of God. </p> <p>Method of study.</p> <p>For the purpose lucidity this work will be largely critical and expository. More so, a brief historical survey of Nietzsche is adopted to bring to limelight, his conception about God.</p> <p>                              </p> <p>  Division of work.</p> <p>This work is divided into four chapters. Apart from the introduction, the first chapter will x-ray the meaning of nihilism for Nietzsche, and the religion and its values as attacked and refuted by him. In chapter two, we shall be exposing the nihilistic morality as presented by Nietzsche. Chapter three centers on the remedies offered by Nietzsche as the ideal value after his nihilism of supreme value. Chapter four will evaluate Nietzsche’s philosophy of nihilism.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>BRIEF PROFILE OF FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE   </p> <p>Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was born on October 15, 1844 at Bocken in the province of Saxony. He was the son and grandson of Lutheran ministers. His father died at the tender age of four and he grew up under the care of his mother Fran Nietzsche and his sister, Elizabeth.</p> <p></p> <p>At the age of fourteen, he was sent to the famous Pforta School where he studied classics, religion and German literature. In 1864, he went to the University of Bonn and studied theology. But having lost his faith in Christian religion in 1865 he abandoned theological studies, left Bonn and went to Leipzig where he studied philology. Here, also he came upon Schopenhauer’s works, <i>The World as Will and Idea</i>, which had an influence on him and confirmed his atheistic standpoint. He was also influenced by the Wagnerian music he came in contact with.</p> <p></p> <p>His outstanding intelligence merited him the appointment as a lecturer at the age of twenty, and later at the age of twenty-four, was yet appointed to the chair of classical philology at the university of Basal. He was at this school until heath forced him to resign his professorship in 1879. It was during this period that he came close to a relationship with Wagner but thy later separated. From 1880 to 1889, he lived life of solitude. He surprisingly became insane in 1889 and remained in that state of mental and physical paralysis until his death on August 25, 1900 at the of fifty-five.</p> <p>Nietzsche was a prolific writer and wrote extensively even while ill. His major works include: <i>The Birth of Tragedy</i>, which he wrote in 1872. Between the periods of 1873 to 1876, he published the Untimely Meditations and <i>Human, All-to-Human</i>. Then, again between the periods of 1881 to 1887, he wrote these five books: <i>The Dawn, The Gay Science, Thus spoke Zarathusthra, Beyond Good and</i> <i>Evil and Genealogy of Morals.</i> In 1888, he yet produced these books: The <i>Case of Wagner, Twilight of Idols</i>, <i>Anti-Christ, Ecce Homo, Nietzsche contra</i> <i>Wagner</i> and completed work, <i>The revaluation of all Values (The Will to Power).</i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] F.Nietzsche <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra, in the portable Nietzsche Trans., ed.

It is the desire to form a coherent and unified interpretation of reality natural to the reflective mind. Starting from the Greek philosophers, this trait is found in their quest for the “urstoff” of all that exists (thereby remaining cosmocentric in their interpretation) through the theocentric interpretation of the medieval era. In the light of this trait, the modern period becomes over-laden with anthropocentricism. In sum, we can bluntly say that philosophy has this single task of forming a unified interpretation of reality to perform. </p> <p>However, the actual task to be performed presents itself in different ways at different times. For example, the development of physical science in the post-mediaeval world meant that the philosopher who wished to construct an overall interpretation had to grapple with the problem of reconciling the scientific view of the world as a mechanical system with the demands of the moral and religious consciousness. Descartes was faced with this problem. And so was Kant. Even though kant rejected the ways of dealing with this problem which were characteristic of his predecessors and offered his own original solution, it is arguable that in the long run he left us with a “bifurcated reality”[1]. On the other hand, a supersensous world of the free agent is provided. There is no valid reason to assert the existence of the phenomenal realm, as well as a theoretical proof of the supersensuous reality. Even though Kant made effort to bridge the gap between the two realities in a way comprehensible to the remote mind, he however related a problem which the German idealists refused to pass over in silence. Thus, German idealism culminating in Hegel, made effort to make the whole of reality intelligible to the human mind, provided that this mind can be regarded as the vehicle, as it were of absolute thought reflecting on itself. The result of this was the Absolute idea in Hegel’s philosophy or Hegelian idealism. </p> <p></p> <p>The point to be made is that Hegel’s point of departure was the theme of the relation between the infinite and the finite or more precisely, between the universal, collectivity and the individual. Hegel evaluated everything on the platform of the Absolute infinite, making the finite, including the human person, a product of the Absolute, and universal. Now, a mind-boggling question surges up: what is actually the role of the individual in this universal? It is obvious at this point that Hegel in order to solve the Kantian dualism created an existential problem for the individual human person who appears to be at sea in the whole Hegelian set up. </p> <p></p> <p>Hence the problem, which obviously faced Hegel as an idealist, was that of including, as it were, the finite within the life of the infinite without depriving the former of its reality[2]. The difficulty of solving this problem is responsible for a good deal of ambiguity in metaphysical idealism when it is a question of defining its relation to theism on the one hand and Pantheism on the other. However, the problem lingered on and constituted the fundamental springboard of existentialist trend. As such, it becomes consistent to ask: How can the human person become fully himself, free and independent in this existential order vis-à-vis the Hegelian abstraction that kept his reality or rather existence somewhere beyond this order. Could the individual human person be said to be free, responsible and actually existing yet remaining a moment in the “self-development” of the absolute thought or universal. If the state is the supreme will of the individual and if the individual exists for the good of the state as an institution, is the human person free from this mere objectification or relegation? How could this utilitarian principle of the many against one contribute to his survival? How could man’s authenticity be assured in this all-consuming absolute universal? In the present era, the submerging of the individual takes other forms in the society. These forms constitute the various ways the implications of Hegelian idealism become evident in our society. The powerful evidence towards political and social totalitarianism with its reduction of personal responsibility and its evaluation of personal value in terms of service to the collectivity are not apart from these forms and consequent implications. This constitutes a hard nut to crack as there arises the need to reaffirm the free individual in the face of this powerful tendency.</p> <p>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>In the light of the foregone (statement of the problem), one easily discovers the task or aim of the whole work. The work is an effort to reinstate the concrete existence of the individual human person which has been swallowed up in abstractions through absolute idealism. Thus, it is primarily targeted on Hegel who is a prime absolute idealist, and it is a reaction against the abstraction of his idealism, which has depersonalized the individual human person. This would be more effectively done via existentialist emphasis on man to restore the essence of individual human person. Thus, it is a piece of evaluative criticism of  idealism with Hegel as a reflex point. </p> <p>SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>Within the limits of this consideration, the work even though it exposes idealist tenets, does not claim an absolute and total exposition. Even at that, it does not expose these tenets to empty idealism of its content. However, in order not to build on the blues, Hegelian idealism is chosen as the reflex or focal point of our reflections. Be that as it may, the work does not claim to expose equally the whole edifice of Hegelian system, but exposes through critical inquiry and analysis some aspects of this system as it relates to the individual human person. Even when the writer toes the existentialist line in his criticism, he does not claim to exhaust all themes of the existentialist in order to buttress the deficiencies of Hegelian system.</p> <p><b>METHOD OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>In line with the purpose of this work, the method employed here is simply expository. This exposition would be addressed via critical analysis and evaluative techniques in order to produce a comprehensive corpus that suits the entire intellectual edifice.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>DIVISION OF WORK</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The work is divided into five chapters that are linked to one another with each succeeding stage being a further elaboration of the preceding one. The work comprises one theme running through all chapters but in a developmental manner from the first to the last chapter. Chapter one delves into idealism that exposes Hegel as an idealist. Chapter two discusses the idealist predecessors of Hegel as the springboard of Hegelian idealism. This gives us the impetus for a critical exposition of the system to be made in chapter three. Having critically exposed Hegelian idealism, a room was created for the fourth chapter that draws out the implications of this system for the individual. Lastly, chapter five aims at practical solutions by evaluating the two sides of the human person: individuality and collectivity. Consequently, the curtain is drawn with the writer’s standpoint on the whole quagmire.</p> <p> </p> <p>A SHORT BIOGRAPHY OF HEGEL</p> <p>George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, greatest of German Idealists and one of the renowned philosophers of western tradition was born at Stuttgart on August 27th, 1770. He was the oldest son of a minor state official. In his school years at Stuttgart the future philosopher was not spectacular. However, at this period, his attraction to the great genius, especially the plays of Sophocles and above all in the Antigone was evident. At the age of eighteen he entered the University of Tubingen as a student of theology. However, he showed little aptitude for theology. The certificate which he received in 1793 commended his excellent talents but declared that his industry and knowledge were mediocre and above all deficient in philosophy. He seems to have profited most from the companionship of his friends, notably Holderlin and Schelling, with whom he read Kant and Plato. The friends studied Rousseau together and shared a common enthusiasm for the ideals of the French Revolution, which obviously might have stirred up in Hegel the later development of his philosophical ideals.</p> <p>            </p> <p>After his stay in Tubingen, Hegel became a family tutor at Berne in Switzerland and Frankfurt respectively. During his residence in Switzerland he wrote a life of Jesus, a critique of positive religion and several studies in the history of religion. Later, his attention turned to questions of economics and government, and he left writings on the reform of the Prussian land laws, a commentary on James Stuart’s Political Economy, and other studies of similar character which have since been published. In 1800, he produced a sketch, which is generally regarded as the first systematic statement of his philosophy.</p> <p>At the time, when Schelling was in his heydays, Hegel made a request from Schelling demanding him to suggest a suitable town for a brief period of studious withdrawal as well as “a good beer”. He joyfully acclaimed the success of his friend in the academic world, which spurred on ambitions in him (Hegel). Consequently, he said: “the ideal of my youth has necessarily taken a reflective form and been transformed into a system… how can I return to influencing the life of mankind?”[3] Shelling must have given him an enthusiastic answer which pushed him into abandoning his previous plans and joined him (Schelling) at Jena. At the university, he became a <i>privatdocent</i> (an unsalaried university lecturer) and gradually famous, through the series of lectures he delivered. As such, before Schellings’s departure from Jena, in 1803, he and Hegel collaborated in the publication of the journal of critical philosophy. This work however, strengthened the impression that Hegel was to all intents and purposes a disciple of Schelling[4]. On the contrary, with the publication of his first great work, The Phenomenology of Spirit (1807), Hegel showed his divergence from Schelling. It was while he was engaged in the details of publication of this work that his academic career was brought abruptly to a halt by the Napoleonic campaign culminating in the battle of Jena in the autumn of 1806.</p> <p>            </p> <p>The “Phenomenology of spirit” appeared in 1807 despite the war, but Hegel himself was at loose ends. Two volumes of his science of logic were published in 1812, and a third in 1816, and he was offered professorships at Erlanges, Heidelberg, and Berlin. He accepted the invitation to Heidelberg, but after the publication of his “Encyclopedia of the philosophical sciences” in 1817, the offer of Berlin was renewed and accepted and he occupied the vacant chair following the death of Fichte.</p> <p></p> <p>His thirteen years of professorship at the University of Berlin brought him to the peak of his career and made him a recognized leader of philosophic thought in German world. His prestige thus rose until his name was linked with that of Goethe. His publication of “The philosophy of Right”, was significant as the last of the large works published in his life time. His lectures on aesthetics, the philosophy of religion, the philosophy of history, and the history of philosophy were constantly revised and improved and finally published posthumously. In 1830, he became the rector of the university and was decorated by Frederick William III of university of Berlin until his death from Cholera in 1831 at the age of sixty-one.</p> <p></p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] F.

Thus, the existentialists have some patterns of thought following their existential traits. Hence, they deny that reality can be neatly packaged in concept or presented as interlocking system. “An inquisitive style of thought that sets to adopt with ardent mastery the world in relation to man’s life in it.”1 Jean Paul Sartre, Soren Kierkegaard and Martin Heidegger made remarkable imprints among the existentialist thinkers. The basic style of their philosophizing begins from man rather than nature. A philosophy of the subject rather than the object per se. William Barrett’s definition of existentialism sets the existentialists’ agenda in motion:</p> <p>                    A philosophy that confronts human situation in its </p> <p>                    totality, to ask what the basic conditions of human </p> <p>                    existence are and how man can establish his own </p> <p>                    meaning out of these situations.2</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>From the foregoing therefore, existential approach to <i>self</i> is not very difficult to define.</p> <p></p> <p>Rene Descartes (1596-1650), the father of modern philosophy was the first to make a dialectical shift in the history of thought, breaking apart philosophy from the chains of scholastic ‘theocentricism’ to the modern ‘anthropocentricism’. In his famous <i>cogito</i><i>,</i> he sets out to posit the “I” as the referential point of existence. Hence, the “I” becomes the starting point and the end point “<i>terminus a quo and terminus ad quem</i><i>” </i>of his ontological status quo. The ‘I’ becomes the thinking subject. </p> <p>But, a remarkable attempt to move the straight points of philosophy from the “abstract thinking subject to more concrete base, in the total, multi-dimensional human experience of involving in a world of affairs was carefully explored by John Macmurray.”3 Toeing the same line of argument, the existentialists owe their thought in agreement with John Macmurray’s view of the <i>self</i><i> as</i> an ‘agent’ as against the traditional understanding of self as the ‘subject’. </p> <p>In his own words, “the ‘I’ act (the self as agent) replaces the ‘I’ think (the self as subject) as the place where existential philosophy finds its beginning.”4 Thinking according to him is an abstraction from the totality of <i>self</i> as agent. Having given a skeletal view of the general notion of the existential self as the existentialism owe to Macmurray, it is very pertinent at this juncture to X-ray what three front liners existentialists have as their views in relation to self.</p> <p></p> <p>In order to bring the intrinsic meaning of the existential self to the fore, Soren Kierkegaard driving home his message made an allusion to the idea of the ‘<i>anonymous crowd’</i>. In his own words, <b>“</b>Being in a crowd unmakes one’s nature as an individual self by diluting self.”5  He further stresses:</p> <p>      Acrowd in its very concept is untruth, by reason of the                 fact that it renders the individual completely impenitent           and irresponsible or at least weakens his sense of duty, vision         and responsibility by reducing it to a fraction.6</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>From a different angle, Martin Heidegger with a bold stroke shifted the nineteenth century continental philosophy away from the traditional concerns about theories and focused it upon the concern of thinking individual (self). He sets out to explore the deepest nature of self as an existing being.  Fascinated by the question of being (Zeins frage) he desires to explore the fundamental ontology - the phenomenological analysis of the ‘<i>Dasein’.</i> In his fundamental task of de-structuring the essential components of the <i>Dasein </i>he does not intend to joke when he remarks, “<i>Dasein</i> has a pre-ontological understanding of his own being because; being reveals itself gratuitously to him.”<b><i>7</i></b> By making serious enquiry into the meaning of being through rational and fundamental questions, the existential approach to self in Heidegger’s line of thought is not very difficult to disclose, implying though it may be.</p> <p></p> <p>Jean Paul Sartre not dismissing his phenomenological background approaches the question of <i>self </i>as the only unique <i>Consciousness.</i> According to him,</p> <p>          The mode of the existence of the Consciousnesses </p> <p>          is to be conscious of itself and being conscious of </p> <p>          his consciousness, its law of existence is correctly </p> <p>          defined.8</p> <p><b><i></i></b></p> <p><b><i> </i></b></p><b><i></i></b> <p>He further maintains that insofar as <i>Consciousness</i>is conscious of itself, it is purely absolute. The central message of the celebrated book of Sartre, <i>Being and Nothingness</i> presents an existential concept of self “as the unique individual that is essentially free even though in chains, is a master of his own fate.”9 He therefore projects the <i>self </i>in conformity with the analysis of Cartesian thought, as individual human being seeking for apodictic certainty as a referential point of departure. The actual message of <i>self</i> in Sartrian philosophy may not be correctly sent without the cause to “make a veritable insight into the ontological and epistemological variations, wherein the Cartesian <i>cogito</i> becomes essentially manifested.”10  <i> </i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p></p> <p>Hans Gadamer would have been forgotten in the arc of intellectual history if not for his celebrated line ‘No one speaks from nowhere<i>’</i>, thus, to speak implies speaking from a particular point of view. Bearing this in mind, the question of self in Sartrian philosophy may not be exhaustively explored without a necessary reference to his phenomenological background.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>1.2</b> <b>Existentialism: A Phenomenological Background</b>.</p> <p>The word “<i>phenomenology</i>” has quite a long history in philosophy. Occasionally, it was employed by Immanuel Kant to stand for the study of phenomena or appearances as opposed to things-in- themselves. Hegel, in his phenomenology of mind, used the word for his exposition of the manifestations of the stages of the mind, from perception, through the forms of consciousness, to the highest intellectual spiritual activities. Husserl’s <i>Introduction to Pure Phenomenology </i>bracketed,<i>      </i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p><i></i></p> <p><i> </i></p><i></i> <p>questions concerning reality and tends to devise method</p> <p>          for detailed and accurate description of various kinds in </p> <p>          their pure essences.<i>11</i><i></i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p></p> <p>A brief intellectual tour in the existentialists’ environment will reveal that, it was Edmund Husserl (1859-1938) that first picked up the intellectual relay- race in the German phenomenology. Thrilled by the <i>Cartesian cogito</i>, he plans to establish from a phenomenological background, the <i>self, </i>from the focal point of action as the existing agent. The undeniable influence he asserted on his successors, thinkers like Martin Heidegger, Merleau-ponty and Jean Paul Sartre carried along the phenomenological relay race. Due to the fact that existentialism owes its definitive emergence to phenomenology, invariably most existentialists are phenomenologist though the reverse may not be the case, notwithstanding, there is an undeniable fact of close tie that developed between the two styles of philosophy. The fact is obvious; “Phenomenology seems to offer existentialism the kind of methodology necessary to pursue the investigations into human existence.<i>”12 </i>Fascinated by Cartesian methodic doubt, Husserl radicalized its tenets with a certain degree of consequence. The transcendental consciousness could no longer be characterized in    terms of a thinking matter, a ‘<i>res cogitans</i>’ but an acting matter. In his argument, he stresses that if consciousness only exists as consciousness of something, then, Husserl’s interpretation of the methodic doubt implies that the ‘physical ‘I’ would perish along the line, “because the ‘I’ presents the character of an object.”13 The existentialists developed   phenomenology to suit their own purpose. The point of divergence between Husserl and the existential phenomenologists is not very difficult to pinpoint. Whereas the former places emphasis on essence and approaches phenomenology as an apodictic science, the latter stresses on existence. The existentialists’ allegiance to existence could be seen in Sartre’s assertion ‘existence precedes essence’. In this regard, they refuted Kantian dualism that supposed some hidden ‘noumena’ of which the ‘phenomena’ is merely the appearance. </p> <p></p> <p>In his book <i>‘L’Action</i>’, Maurice Blondel (1861-1949) argues, “the starting point of philosophy should be sought not in abstract ‘I’ think but in the concrete ‘I’ act.”14 To buttress this fact, the existentialists insist on action, for according to them, only in action does existence attains correctness and fullness. Where thought, passion and inward decision are lacking, there will be nothing worthy of the name <i>action. </i>Despite the premium existentialists place upon action, it does not seem to connote they are pragmatists. A proper juxtaposition of the differences and similarities of both the former and latter leads us into the next sub-heading. The pragmatists and the existentialists without doubts place a greater percentage on man as a deciding agent. But as the former views man as a <i>functional man</i> the later approaches him from the point of ‘<i>Homo Viator’</i>. The former to a greater extent highlights optimism from the utilitarian standpoint. They occupy themselves with issues of success in every undertaking, with a little or no attention to the tragic and frustrating sides of life as expressed in most existentialists’ writings. </p> <p>Berdyaev clearly remarks the difference between the <i>duo </i>in his words, however close the latter could be at some points with the former:   </p> <p>       They are distinguished from them by the fact that their interest</p> <p>       is in the intensity of life even its tragic intensity rather than its</p> <p>       outward expansion and success.”15 </p> <p></p> <p>The existentialists acknowledge the obvious situations of man’s existence as a fact of life. This I plan to unmask in the preceding sub-heading.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.3 Facticity of Existence</b></p> <p>A simple look at this phrase elicits the two contending concepts: Fact and Existence. In philosophy of science, facts are said to be the ultimate tribunal. As such without facts, there would not be any result. The issue is not different in the field of law and other disciplines. </p> <p>‘To exist’ from its Latin etymology <i>‘ex-sistere’ </i>means, ‘to stand out’, ‘to emerge’. To ‘lie around’ seem to highlight the clearer meaning of existence in recent times- ontological location. Here, to exist implies to be located somewhere in the world, to have a place in the real world. In passing the message of what it means to exist, Martin Heidegger made allusion to the idea of ‘<i>Dasein</i>’. Jean Paul Sartre explores the content of the <i>‘Pour-soi’</i> for-itself. The question above all is, what the facts of existence are in the existential mind? Existentialists use the word ‘Facticity’ to designate the limiting factor in existence. From etymology the word had been coined to translate the German ‘<i>Faktizitat</i>’ and French ‘<i>Facticite</i>’. It is as opposed to the background of the word factuality that has to do with objective state of affairs observable in the world.  It is an inward existential awareness of one’s own being. No one has chosen to be. As Augustine Farrer voices out “The loneliness of personality in the universe weighs heavily upon us, it seems terribly improbable that we should exist.”16 Man from time immemorial has formed some beliefs or even revelations about his origin and destiny. How truthful or valid such assumptions are, may not be our concern here. The only fact we know beyond doubt is that ‘we are’. Where we came from and where we are going remains under the confines of mystery. Existence never escapes from the tension between possibility and facticity. Facticity opens for us the radical finitude of human existence. </p> <p></p> <p>Robert Cumming gave a clearer insight to facticity as portrayed in Sartre’s ideology. The “for-itself” is, insofar as it appears in a condition which it has not chosen, it is, in so far as it is thrown into the world and abandoned in a situation.”17 In the thought of Heidegger, facticity means that man finds himself in situation where he is bound to be. ‘Throwness’, ‘<i>Geworfenheit</i>’ in Heideggerian thought underlines to a greater extent the intrinsic meaning of facticity. “Being thrown into existence, without his prior knowledge the ‘<i>Dasein</i>’ finds himself in a circumstance that is not his own making.”18 Facticity is an outright revelation of the limitations of the ‘<i>Dasein</i>’. In a case, the ‘<i>Dasein’ </i>realizes some givens beyond his control, things he cannot alter even if he wants to. </p> <p></p> <p>Some factors project certain unavoidable existential situations. Death, Temporality, Guilt and Alienation tend to summarize those inescapable conditions of life. As Heidegger rightly puts, death is the possibility of the impossibility of existence. Heidegger is one of the existentialists that never approached the issue of death with reservation. At death alone could the ‘<i>Dasein’</i> be correctly defined. He sees death as the last possibility of all, that which makes impossible any further possibility. In temporality, man’s nature as being time-bound is re-defined. Man as creature of time must pass away in time. The transience of human life is one of the most poignant aspects of finitude. No matter, whatever may be the case; man must be a client to the tribunal of birth and death. </p> <p></p> <p>Pessimistic though the existentialists may seem to be, as some thinkers argue as opposed to pragmatists, they have always not failed to recognize the obvious fact of disorder in human existence. Thus, man experiences guilt and sometimes feels alienated from what he encounters around him. </p> <p></p> <p>Karl Marx pointed the fact of alienation in the revolutionary changes in man’s material condition. From the existential angle, alienation implies that one is mortgaged in inauthentic existence. Without facticity, Robert Cumming, avows “Consciousness would choose its attachment to the world in the same way as souls in Plato’s republic choose their condition.”19</p> <div><br/><div> <p>1 J.Macquarie, <i>Existentialism</i> (New York: World-Publishing Co, 1972), p.14</p> </div> <div> <p>2 T.Ajayi, <i>Freedom, Choice and Responsibility</i> (WAJOPS: vol.7, AECAWA Publication, 2004), p.79.</p> </div> <div> <p>3<i>Op.cit</i>.p.125. </p> </div> <div> <p>4 Ibid, p.126.</p> </div> <div> <p>5S.E.Stumpf,<i> Philosophy: History and Problems</i> (U.S.A: Mc Graw- Hill, 5th (ed.), 1971), p.487.</p> </div> <div> <p>6 Ibid, p.488.</p> </div> <div> <p>7 C.Ekwutosi, unpublished lecture note on <i>Heidegger’s Metaphysics</i>  (Pope John Paul II Seminary Awka, 2005), p.2</p> </div> <div> <p>8 R.Cumming,<i> The Philosophy of Jean Paul Sartre </i> (New York, Random House, Inc., 1965), p.51.</p> </div> <div> <p>9 <i>The Cambridge Companion to Sartre</i>, (ed) Christian Howells (U.S.A: Cambridge Uni.Press, 1992), p.68.</p> </div> <div> <p>10 Ibid.p.69.</p> </div> <div> <p>11 J.

Arguably, many (especially Westerners) would immediately succumb to the idea that Africa is a place of tribal slaughters, massacres, urban slums, skeletal children, people infested with AIDS; a place where the earth is dry and cracked, a place of endless stream of refugees without a place to call home, without clothing, medicine, food or water, plus other images of savagery, inferiority complex and hunger.  According to Ezine Newsletter:</p> <p></p> <p>Those are the only images we see in C.N.N during the nightly news, during times of crisis and then there is nothing until the next war, skirmish or famine. Limited, selective images that make a continent look like it is always in upheaval.1</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>But these images about Africa are not only associated with the C.N.N. nightly news, they have permeated for hundreds of years in the West’s perception of Africa. Lending weight to this, the same Ezine Newsletter (African insight) on African images, opines:</p> <p>For hundreds of years, Africa was a blank spot on Western maps, a place that did not exist and then during the Middle Ages it became a dark spot. It was referred to as the “dark continent”, where primitive people without history and civilization dwelled. Where chaos was the norm, even the capacity for an African to love was questioned since a savage being was not capable of love or Christian charity2.</p> <p></p> <p>In concrete, Africans, especially Blacks, having been besmirched with these subhuman statuses, it was as easy as rolling off a log to take this Dark continent filled with savages and ship them to ends of the earth as slaves. This explains the 16th Century African Slave trade, when Bartoleme de Las Casas (Bishop of Chiapas) threw off Christian anthropology aboard and made a clarion call for African slaves, who would replace the emaciated Indians in Hispaniola, Spain, 1517. It was also easy to plunder the riches of Africa, its people and resources, and to colonize them under the guise of bringing civilization and Christianity. No wonder, Jomo Kenyatta opined in his book, ‘Facing Mount Kenya’:</p> <p>The missionaries came with the Bible in their hand and we had the land. They taught us to pray with our eyes closed, and then when we opened them we had the Bible in our hand, and they had the land.3</p> <p></p> <p>But a critical mind would ask, why was it Europe, rather than Africa that conquered and plundered? This, I shall briefly explain in chapter three of this project, while focusing on  the main point of my project. </p> <p></p> <p>Today, we could see the same tune played and danced according to the old methods. We could see veiled distorted images of African continent and “neo-asphyxiating colonialism”4 in the relations of Africa with the West. These we see in most actions of U.N, G-8 club, C.N.N news and other Western means. </p> <p></p> <p>Thus, in chapter one of this project, I will expose the views or distorted images about Africans starting from the Ancient to the Contemporary period. Chapter two of this project will navigate on Martin Heidegger’s task in his “Being and Time”, his idea of the fundamental ontology and his concept of phenomenology, which I will use to interpret these African experiences. Chapter three will dwell on African distorted images vis-à-vis the causes of African predicament. Later, I will use Martin Heidegger’s concept of phenomenology to interpret these distorted images. Chapter four will be on critical evaluation and conclusion. </p> <p></p> <p>PURPOSE OF STUDY</p> <p>My purpose of this project is to showcase and bring to “more” conscious awareness the varied distorted images with which Africans are labeled. These distorted images, though as old as the continent itself, have continued to form ominous clouds of hatred in the mental skies of most Westerners. The notion that Africans, especially Black Africans, are inferior has implicitly continued to petrify in the African relationship with the West. For instance, “eighty five years after the witch hunt against the African soldiers in Liverpool, Anthony Walker, a promising young black student from Liverpool was viciously murdered with an axe on 29 June, 2005 by white youths who were angered by the fact that Walker had a white girlfriend”.5 Imagine this.</p> <p></p> <p>To hedge West’s sheer and implicit distortion of Africans as inferior, Africans themselves have unconsciously submerged themselves to this status–quo. Very soon, they will become “untouchables”.</p> <p></p> <p>As a result of the above, this project is not only aimed at show-casing, but is also geared towards salvaging the tainted images of the Africans. It is aimed at confronting Euro centric superiority by asserting the fact that “we are all humans, irrespective of color, skin and race. Again, my intent is that there is more to complexification (coming together) than there is to particularization. Pierre Telhard de Chardin hit the truth when he remarked:</p> <p>It is precisely this state of isolation that will end if we begin to discover in each other not merely the elements of one and the same thing but of a single spirit in search of itself.6</p> <p></p> <p>Again, like every other project on African experience, this project is an attempt to unmask the “un-freedom” of Africans hobbled by many “positive” and ‘’negative’’ elements (slavery, colonialism et cetera) as a result of the sub-human status created for them.</p> <p></p> <p> I shall interpret these images about African continent, using Martin Heidegger’s concept of phenomenology in his “Being and Time”. Remember, I am not using this concept as benchmark to African situation; instead, I am only interpreting his concept of phenomenology and situating it to African situation. Again, I shall not relegate to the limbo his question of the meaning of being by which he arrived at the fundamental ontology: ‘’Dasein’’-man. Thus “Dasein” is the gateway to other ontologies. It is because of the centrality of Dasein with its existentials that this project focuses on the distortions of African “Being ness”.</p> <p></p> <p>THE SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>The scope of this project covers the whole of African continent, especially the black Africans, bearing in mind that some Africans like Egyptians are white in complexion. It covers the whole of African continent, because the word “Africa” already connotes negative undertones for most Western minds. Hear what was written on “milestones”, December 26, 2005 ‘Time magazine’, vol 166 no.25, captioned “The persons of the year”, with reports by Illa Garger, about Africa 13 years ago:</p> <p>Africa has become the basket case of the planet, the “third world of the third world’’, a vast continent in free fall…. Africa has a genius for extremes, for the beginning and the end. It seems simultaneously connected to some memory of Eden and to some foretaste of apocalypse. Nowhere is day more vivid or night darker. Nowhere are forests more luxuriant. Nowhere is there a continent more miserable. Africa-sub-Saharan Africa, at least – has begun to look like an immense illustration of chaos theory, although some hope is forming on the margins. Much of the continent has turned into a battleground of contending doom . . .7</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Even though, the reporter might have some reservations (Egypt or some nations of North Africa), he painted the whole continent black. Therefore the scope of this project is the African continent. But distinctions will be made when necessary.</p> <p></p> <p>                            METHODOLOGY</p> <p>The method of this project is expository, analytical and hermeneutical. By expository and analytical method, I will carefully expose the varied distorted images of Africans, starting from the ancient period to the contemporary period, with analysis when necessary. And by the method of hermeneutics, I will interpretatively unmask these distorted images of Africans using Martin Heidegger’s concept of “phenomenology” in order to see what lies behind them.    </p> <p></p> <div><br/><div> <p>1 Ezine Newsletter.<i>African Images</i>, (November 2002-african Insights) p.1</p> </div> <div> <p>2 <i>Ibid</i></p> </div> <div> <p>3<i> Ibid</i></p> </div> <div> <p>4 T.

What seemed as latent but constantly boiling in every individual of all ages is a quest to get a fair share of one’s natural entitlement. In other words, man searches for justice. Philosophers through the ages are not left out as they have contributed tremendously to the development and reorganization of human society. Hence their clarion calls for a better society. Thus it is on this note that we are going to review the opinions of philosophers, both past and present, concerning the political situation of any given society; paying more attention to the nature of political power and its structural systems regarding the affairs of the state in general.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>1.1 Ancient Period</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This period witnessed the concern of man to have a well ordered and organized state whereby its citizens will uphold the issue of moral values, especially as it pertains to the issue of justice and equity. As such, there are many philosophers in this period that were involved in the reformation of the state, but we are going to look at the contributions made by few of them. One of the philosophers of this period we are going to see is Aristophanes. He opined in his political philosophy that the system of governing the state should not be democracy but communism. Therefore he criticized democracy saying that many unqualified and lazy persons joined the legislative for the sake of financial rewards. And this is very obvious with regard to Nigerian political situation which we are going to see shortly. Thus many politicians are in politics simply because of money. He goes further to say that “in democracy, people are given political posts even if they were not equipped for it.”[1] In other words, many politicians are given certain positions they do not merit, that is, those we can call political office seekers. Hence he argues for communism as the best option for proper governance of the state. Communism for him will incorporate every member of the state and proper justice will be maintained.</p> <p> </p> <p>Plato in his view outlined five forms of government, namely, aristocracy, timocracy, plutocracy, democracy and despotism, but he favours aristocracy. According to him, aristocracy stands as the best form of government where only Philosopher-kings should be rulers. He intended to establish an ideal society where the state of affairs and the people’s moral conscience will rule. However, he was deeply disenchanted with the type of politics practiced in Athens, particularly with the way the Athenian government executed Socrates, and had consistently failed to produce good leaders. Hence his clarion calls for upholding morality and the agitation for Philosopher-kings to be rulers. Moreover, his intention was to establish an ideal society where its leaders would be guided by reason and justice maintained. He saw them (Philosopher-kings) as the best option in the search for good leaders and the need to promote morality especially among the youths who are future leaders. Thus, Plato envisioned leaders with the aptitude for wisdom to govern the society and legislate for it.</p> <p></p> <p>Aristotle in his contribution viewed the state as the association of human beings where all man’s needs are provided. The existence of the state is for the provision of the natural needs of man; thus, the state is viewed as the natural association of man. And man being a rational and political animal should best secure good life in the society. ‘The good life’ here according to Aristotle includes political good, economic independence and virtuous life. As regards power, he said that, “the citizens at large administer the state for the common interest, so that the government is called by the generic name, a constitution.”[2] The power of those in office should be controlled by the law since good laws are supreme in the state. Aristotle as we could see in his politics elevated the citizens to the level of the administration of the government and as it pertains to the political power in the society. Equally, he opined that the common interest matters as much as it gives everybody equal opportunity to participate in the affairs of the government. Therefore he saw the government as involving, virtually, every citizen, as it is called by a generic name. So the constitution forms part and parcel of the government and it must be properly established and executed.</p> <p><b>1.2     Medieval Period</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Having seen the contributions made by some political philosophers in the preceding period, let’s now talk of the medieval period. Here we have many philosophers to consider, as it were, but we shall concentrate on a few of them. Among them was St. Augustine. He was not a political philosopher as such, but contributed immensely as far as commonwealth and social order of any organized society are concerned. According to him, true commonwealth can never exist if there is no real justice in the community. “But”, he said, “true justice is found only in that whose founder and ruler is Christ . . . we cannot deny that it is the ‘weal’ of the community.”[3] As we can see, he is more of a theologian since he makes Christ the <i>terminus ad quem</i> of man’s existence. Nevertheless his defense of commonwealth and justice are very much indispensable in any political society. Hence for any meaningful political society to exist there must be real justice and commonwealth. Lack of these two principles of government characterizes the Nigerian democracy. And these, no doubt, must have their foundation in Christ just as St. Augustine upholds. However this justice must be equitably distributed and maintained. This, by implication, means that the power holders must pay attention to the citizens’ well-being; and the citizens must not be found wanting in obedience to the leaders. Secondly, Thomas Aquinas in his part also presented us with his doctrine of justice which begets common good. These principles are never found in a vacuum for they are within the reach of men with common good. For Aquinas, the object of justice is “right.”[4] What this means is that every individual’s right ought to be respected. Therefore, every member must respect his or her individual right and the right of others. On this point Isidore opined that, “a man is said to be just because he respects the rights of others.”[5] Finally Aquinas concluded that justice means rendering to an individual his right, all for the common good of the political state.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3    Modern Period</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>From the medieval to the modern period we have seen the contributions of some political thinkers and their ideologies. We can see in those periods the indispensable role of ethical values and how they contribute to the establishment of an ideal state. It is their view that true justice contributes to the shaping of the society, if well appreciated. However their thought appears to be more of utopia than real, especially, when we consider the political philosophy of Plato and Aristotle.</p> <p></p> <p>The modern period could thus be seen as the high point of political theory and ideologies. The philosophers of this period were so much concerned with the nature of political states and their governance. They were so much interested in how best a state could be governed through reasonable and courageous leaders, and at the same time ensuring good relationship among its citizens. Let’s see the political philosophy of Thomas Hobbes, in this modern period, which was summarized in the concept, <i>SOCIAL CONTRACT</i>. The “Social contract”, according to him, “is a contract by which men avoid the state of nature and enter into civil society…”[6] But prior to this civil society man was in a natural state that was characterized by warfare; a situation, where because of man’s freedom, there was struggle for glory, diffidence and urge for competition. A state of war, as opined by Hobbes, where ‘men live without a common power to keep them all in awe; they are in that condition which is called “war”. This happens when one sheepishly follows his inclinations and dispositions. However it is in this contract (social contract) that men surrender their powers and strength to sovereignty to be governed and legislated for. Thus he says, “…by conferring all their powers and strength upon one man, or upon an assembly of men, to bear their person, to reduce all their will into one.”[7] This contract so enacted is called a commonwealth. The contract establishes an absolute government. Commonwealth becomes the sovereign to whom the people entrust their power to provide for their peace and security. The sovereign exercises his authority by prescribing rules where every man may know what goods he may enjoy and what actions he may perform without being molested by any body. Summarily the sovereign exercises the political power, hearing and deciding disputes.</p> <p></p> <p>John Locke was also of the view that social contract should remain the best option for the civil society. In fact he was one of the flag-bearers of social contract, just as Hobbes. He did not see it as a situation of servitude on the part of the citizens to their rulers. Rather the citizens submitted their legislative and executive powers in order to be governed. Hence the pact makes them a “single body politic”[8], making them equal and free men, both the rulers and the ruled. It is important to note that this power is a fiduciary power, which means that it is given on trust. Therefore, the legislature must ensure good, justified governance, otherwise dissolved. Consequently, “there remains in the people a supreme power to remove or alter the legislative when they find the legislative act contrary to the trust reposed in them.”[9] Since it is only a power on trust, it means that the people are still in charge, unlike the absolute monarchy of Hobbes. Rousseau was also in this line of thought when he was talking about the ‘General Will’, which he said, belongs to the people. And so the people’s sovereignty cannot be alienated from them for it belongs to them. Having seen this, let’s see the situation of politics as it pertains to contemporary period.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4            </b><b>   Contemporary Period</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Political thought and theories continued up till the contemporary period. However, the period witnessed a serious political crisis. There is less interest in politics as long as this period is concerned; and Alfred Cobban viewed political philosophy of this period as a discipline that has less attention. This view does not mean that the philosophers of this period were not concerned with political society and the system of governance during their time, but they lacked the interest and the zeal in redirecting their thought towards political situation of the society. In fact, there is a kind of decline as it pertains to political philosophy. The philosophers rather, paid much of their attention to the reality of the universe and the place of man’s existence in the world. They questioned how best one can live an authentic life in the world, not excluding the society, in which one lives. However these not withstanding, we shall see how they directed their thought towards the shaping of the individual’s reason in the society. Here we see John Stuart mill who began his essay “On Liberty” by writing: “The subject of this essay is not the so-called Liberty of the Will… but civil or social liberty: the nature and the limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by the society over the individual.”[10] This civil liberty offers every citizen an opportunity of participation in the government. A liberty that involves: liberty of conscience, which is, of expressing and publishing of opinions, liberty of association, and so on. As regards democracy, he voted Representative Democracy as the best form of government. The reason for this option is that it makes people more active and gives the individual better opportunity for intellectual growth, virtue and socially responsible life. Also the community, according to him, possesses the power of governance. Therefore, everybody has legitimate freedom to take active part in the government. Thus he says,</p> <p> “the best form of government is that in which the sovereignty or the supreme controlling power in the last resort is vested in the entire aggregate of the community, every citizen not only having a voice in the exercise of the ultimate sovereignty, but being, at least occasionally, called on to take on actual part in the government, by the personal discharge of some public function, local or general.”[11] </p> <p></p> <p>This in no doubt presents a true government that is devoid of tyranny and despotism. Power is reasonably and considerably utilized.</p> <p></p> <p>The next person is Karl Marx who brought about his theory of dialectical materialism. According to him, the state is divided into two unequal parts, namely the bourgeoisie and the proletariat classes. It is a state of class struggle and conflict between the bourgeois class and the proletariat class. Such a state could be referred to as “a state of the survival of the fittest”; each of the classes struggling to survive. In fact, it is a situation, which involves a serious struggle of opponents. Thus, the state, according to him, is the society under the control of the bourgeois class. They, as the rulers, dictate their will and interests in the state in the form of law and institutions. This situation was viewed as characterized by struggle, antagonism, domination and all sorts of inhuman treatment. Therefore, it is his dream that there will be a time when everything will be normalized. This will eventually give birth to a classless society of citizens with equal rights. This will come about when the proletariat revolts against the ruling class and overthrow them in order to set up communism. Then this state of equal right will give everybody equal opportunity of participation in a true democracy. Communism according to Marx is: </p> <p>“The positive transcendence of private property or human estrangement, the real appropriation of the human essence by and for man…genuine resolution of the conflict between man and nature, and between man and man…”[12] </p> <p></p> <p>By communism Marx meant a time when capitalism (the oppressive system), with its concomitant evils, will be destroyed through revolution by the oppressed (masses). This will bring to an end the exploitation of man by man, the end of alienation, the end of conflicts and antagonism among men. Also, private property and private ownership of the means of production will be abolished and the goods of the society will be owned by all. The same revolution will introduce a classless society where everybody will be equal and man determines for himself in his natural state. With the disappearance of class distinction in this new society which communism will usher in, the state will equally disappear since the state is simply an instrument of class rule. Thus, the final goal of Marxism is to set up “a classless and stateless communist society in which there will be no more conflicts, antagonism among men, exploitation, poverty, everybody will be free, happy and live in peace with his fellow man.”13 And so, the positive transcendence of human estrangement which Marx is talking about is realized when man has been able to subdue his tendency to keep acquiring, which is done through revolution against capitalism. This will then give man the opportunity to use and make real appropriation of the human resources to reach everybody in the communist society.    </p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1]M. I.

The family had a puritan and a parliamentary background.  He studied at the famous Christ Church, Oxford. He studied sciences, especially medicine under Sir Robert Boyle and was later admitted into the household of the Lord Aschey as his physician and secretary. He later opened up a new chapter in his life and became involved in political affairs of the day.</p> <p></p> <p>One of the bases of his political thought was his teaching on the civil state which he best called civil society.  In order to demonstrate what a civil society is, he traced its origin to the state of nature from where men unite together to go into civil state.  He stated that,</p> <p>This is done wherever any number of men, in the state of nature, enter into society to make one people, one body politic, under one supreme government, or else when anyone joins himself to, and incorporates with any government already made….1</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>From the state of nature, people enter into civil state through consent, to surrender their right of enforcing the law of nature to the society for them to setup a lawful form of government they thought fit2.</p> <p></p> <p>Democracy being a system of government under which the people exercise the governing power either directly or through representatives duly elected by them3, is taken to be one of the forms of government which people in the civil state may choose to set up. There is need therefore, to explore the ideals of the civil state by John Locke, and to bring out its relevance to the practice of democracy in the Nigerian setup.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.2     Statement of the Problem</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>In the light of the above explication, it is good to ask the basic question: </p> <p>what are the problems of Nigerian democracy?  Some of the problems are: the failure of leadership, inadequate checks and balances of the arms of government, lack of security of life and property, and violation of human rights. These problems among others make Nigerian democracy to be in shambles.  Every Nigerian is in one way or the other affected by this difficult situation facing the Nigerian State, and it is every one’s duty to make maximum effort towards solving these problems for the actualization of the ideals of democracy in Nigeria. Therefore, the ugly situation of Nigeria democracy is the problem that motivates the research.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.3. Purpose of the Study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Following the afore-mentioned problems, the aim of the study is to first of all explore John Locke’s teaching on the elements of the civil state, and to demonstrate the necessity of this teaching in solving the problems facing Nigerian democracy.  In other words, this work seeks for the relevance of John Locke’s notion on civil State, to the practice of democracy in Nigeria. </p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.3. Scope of the Study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Taking cognizance of Locke’s vast contribution and discussion in philosophy, this study is limited to his teaching on the civil state, and its importance to the remedy of some of the posing problems of democracy in the Nigerian State.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.4. Methodology</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The method of the work is expository and evaluative.  This means that Locke’s Civil State is explored and it is evaluated by showing its relevance to Nigerian democracy.</p> <p></p> <p>For proper comprehension, the work is divided into five chapters. Chapter one serves as the background which explicates the introduction, the statement of the problem, the aim, the scope, the method as well as the literature review.  Chapter two treats the origin of John Locke’s civil state, which is traced back to the state of nature.  Also Locke’s view of right to private property is stated in this chapter.  In chapter three, Locke’s civil state is exposed properly, with its basic features like the purpose of the civil state, the separation of powers of government, the extent and limit of representation, and the dissolution of government.  In chapter four, how the ideals in the Lockean Civil State can be of good help in tackling some of the problems facing Nigerian democracy, is duly considered. Finally, chapter five deals with general evaluation and conclusion.</p> <p></p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.5. Literature Review</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>In order to properly explain Locke’s notion of civil state, there is need to explicate the views some other thinkers have about the civil state.  A. Appadorai quoting R. Maclver in his book <i>The substance of Politics</i> stated that: </p> <p>The state is an association which, acting through law as promulgated by a government endowed to this end with coercive power, maintains within a community territorially demarcated the universal external conditions of social order[1]. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> He agreed with Herbert Spencer that “the state is nothing but a natural institution for preventing one man from infringing the rights of another; it is a joint-stock protection company for mutual assurance5.</p> <p></p> <p>Following what is said above, from the ancient period, many philosophers in their political thought have in one way or the other viewed on the notion of civil state.  Each of them is influenced by the political affairs of his time, so they have related different views about the civil state. Therefore, the views of various philosophers of different epochs are to be reviewed.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Plato one of the ancient philosophers, in his political thought held that the state originated for the reflection of people’s economic needs.  This means that for him, as he is quoted by Stumpf in his book <i>Philosophy:</i> <i>History and Problems,</i> “a state comes into existence because no individual is self sufficing, we all have many needs”6.  The state exists for the service of </p> <p>needs of men.  In other words, “men are not independent of one another, </p> <p>but needs the aid and co-operation of others in the production of necessaries of life”7.  He divided the citizens of the state into three classes, namely: the guardians who are the rulers, the auxiliaries who are the soldiers of the state, and the common people who provide the material needs of the state.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Aristotle also in the ancient period stated that the state is natural to man.  As he is quoted by Stumpf, “it is evident that the state is a creature of nature and that man is by nature a political animal”8.  This made him to state that “he who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god”9.  The state for him exists for an end, and this end is the supreme good of man.  This means that, “the state comes into existence for the bare end of life, but it continues in existence for the sake of good life….”10 </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Thomas Aquinas in the medieval era viewed the state as a natural society, which has at its disposal the necessary means for attaining its end, which is the common good of the people.  For him “… the government of the state is instituted to secure the necessary conditions of the common good”11.  This means that,</p> <p>The state’s function is to secure that common good by keeping the peace, organizing the activities of the citizens in harmonious pursuit, providing for the resources to sustain life, and preventing as far as possible, obstacles to the good of life”12.</p> <p></p> <p>Hooker a renaissance period thinker whose teaching had much influence on John Locke, viewed the emergence of the state as a natural inclination in man to live in society, and this is only achieved by common agreement of the individuals involved.  This according to Copleston means that “the establishment of civil government thus rests upon consent, without which there was no reason that one man should take upon him to lord or judge over another”13.</p> <p>Furthermore, in the modern era, Hobbes according to M. Sibley in his book, <i>Political Ideas and Ideologies</i>, viewed the emergence of the civil state as, </p> <p>When men contract with one another to leave the state of nature, they then enter civil society where the equality of nature gives way to subordination to the ruler14.  </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>For Hobbes the sovereign is not a party to the contract, he only accepts his power from the contractors and he is absolutely free to act in any way he sees fit, subject only to the primary law of nature that he preserves himself.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Rousseau, another philosopher of modern period, viewed that in the civil state each person gives up his natural liberty in order to gain civil liberty in common with others under the supreme direction of the general will. Rousseau’s own view of the civil state according to M. Sibley, is that, “a legitimate civil state… implies that men have given up their natural freedom and have exchanged for it a civilized freedom broader and more certain than that which they previously enjoyed”15.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Finally, the foregoing is the concise conceptions of philosophers on the civil state.  With these in mind, it is proper to examine John Locke’s exposition of this topic.</p> <p>          </p> <p></p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><br/><br/></p> <p></p> <div><br/><div> <p>1 J.

Certainly, there are problems with poverty, poor health and overcrowding in some regions of the world; but could we then say that the world is simply overcrowded?</p> <p></p> <p>Through the media, we are all familiar with the tragedy of people starving to death in various places. Overpopulation propagandists often use the TV image of the severally malnourished children in Somalia or Sudan, or any other war-torn-areas as a basis to argue that population growth in developing countries is causing poverty and famine. </p> <p>The population controllers to justify the violation of human rights throughout the world have used the myth of overpopulation. Speaking of this, Michael Schwartz said: </p> <p>The myth of overpopulation is one of the most powerful in the world, and is the source of many of the attacks against our moral, cultural and family values. In reality however, it is nothing more than a rationalization for a world-wide war against the poor- a war which inhibits legitimate development and social justice.[1] </p> <p>All these shouts about overpopulation is actually pointing to the fact that the world had a population crisis especially when we consider the fact that the issue of family planning had not been there right from when the world began. </p> <p></p> <p>Openness to life and the extension of love to others must be the dominant qualities for a successful and happy union. Yet maintaining the openness to life brings its own share of problems and tensions. We live today in a world in which the child is often looked upon as a burden, rather than a benefit. Each birth is analyzed in terms of the economic cost, without any measurement of the intangible benefits that accrue to parents, to the family itself and to society. The love of children that leads to parental generosity and sacrifice is often constrained by a propaganda effort, which has arbitrarily decided that the two-child family should be the norm for all couples. </p> <p><b> OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p></p> <p><br/></p> <p>Moreover, from my origin of family planning, we are to see that the quest for family planning is actually coming from well-developed organizations and associations who are bent on checkmating the population of the world. Then, although that so many organs had agreed to do something about the population of the world, several of these organs to say had never reached on a precise way to follow. That is why we can then talk of things like artificial and natural ways of achieving family planning. </p> <p></p> <p><b>PURPOSE OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Expectedly, many scholars have pondered and are still pondering on the overall effects of family planning on the entire human race. It is based on this fact that various camps had emerged as far as family planning is concerned. There is this group that feel that it is not appropriate to embrace family planning since they feel that the world is not overcrowded and therefore, not yet the time to be talking about family planning. Even, they argue that population growth is healthy and highly recommended as a way of balancing our eco-system. The other camp is that of those who support the idea of family planning but insisted that it should be achieved through the natural <br/> means. There are a lot of others who are against this idea as they maintain that artificial method of controlling birth is more appropriate and easier than any other method. </p> <p></p> <p>Yet, despite this progress, a great number of married couples hardly know the basic techniques of family planning, and many more are lacking in confidence because they remain unaware of the dramatic advances that have taken place. In addition, many of these women are always at a lost on which method of family planning to take because they are uninformed in any type of family planning. And also, it will go a long way in creating more awareness and enlightenment to those women who have been forced into adopting a particular type of family planning due to several governmental, environmental and organizational polices. This work will also serve the purpose of bringing a basic knowledge of family planning to those who are uninformed. It will also provide information and assurance that will give new confidence and hope to couples who wish to use the natural methods reliably and effectively. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>SCOPE OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>My work is centered more on the two methods of family planning including the analysis of both of them. However, for the purpose of precision and of the requirements of this study, the research is limited to the views of J. F. Kippley. </p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>METHODOLOGY OF RESEARCH</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Owing to the nature of this work, which is historical and explorative, the method used is expository, descriptive, analytical and evaluative. The expository and descriptive method treated on the nature, origin and history of family planning. That of the analysis treats on the differences among the different methods of family planning as well as the merits and shortcomings. And then, the evaluative will help in accessing the different methods of family planning so as to find out the suitable and more risk free. As a philosophical inquiry, this study would try to analyze the ‘<i>raison d’etre’</i> of the whole philosophy behind the issue of family planning. <b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p></p> <p>In general, the work is divided into four chapters. Chapter one offers the meaning of family planning as well as the historical view on family planning. The second chapter exposes and examines the different kinds of family planning that are applicable in our society today. In chapter three, I will discuss the analysis of Mr. J.F. Kippley’s notion of family planning. Then, the fourth chapter will critically evaluate the whole intellectual exposure.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p>LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>Before we proceed into our main work, it will be right to see the notion of various people who have either said or done something in favour of one of the two methods of family planning. Thus, studies have shown that while some people are greatly in favour of the natural family planning, others are on the other hand in support of the artificial method of family planning. We are therefore to see those various individuals and organization that did something in favour of one of the methods of family planning.</p> <p></p> <p>The first person to consider here is Pope Pius XI’s stand and condemnation of unnatural methods of family planning. For him, there should always be both a call to generosity in the service of life and the acceptance of the principle of spacing babies through natural family planning.</p> <p></p> <p>Pope Paul VI in his ‘humanae vitae’, one of his encyclical letter in July 25th, 1968, lending weight to the course of natural family planning made this assertion: </p> <p>If we look further to physical, economic, psychological and social conditions, responsible parenthood is exercised by those who, guided by prudent consideration and generosity, elect to accept many children. Those are also to be considered responsible who, for serious reasons and with due respect for moral precepts, decided not to have another child for either a definite or an indefinite amount of time.[2] </p> <p></p> <p>Another person to observe his opinion is His Eminence, The Grand Imam Sheikh of al-Azhar University in Cairo, who once provided conference goers with a booklet which was prepared by his international Islamic center for population studies, saying that Islam categorically condemns abortion…except…to…preserve the mother’s life.[3]</p> <p></p> <p>On the other hand, below are the supporters of artificial family planning. The first person to be seen among this group is Margaret Sanger nee Higgins (1879-1966), an Irish American who was the one that introduced the phrase, birth control through her polices in the 1920s and 1930s. Margaret’s theory </p> <p>was very famous in her time especially as to have influenced Hitler so much. Sanger’s objective was to eliminate what she called the unfit members of the society by massive sterilization programs. Unfit members of the public for her include the poor, illiterates, the handicapped and the criminals, the black Americans and the Africans. In a letter, which she wrote to Clarence Gamble on 19th Oct, 1939, she expressed her plans to stop the growth of black population in the USA. Margaret also introduced many groups to channel her views. Among these groups were the Planned Parenthood Federation in America which she founded and was its first president. Sanger’s group saw the Africans as ‘sub man’ and the typical English labourer as ‘sub sub man’ who should be eliminated from the society. For her, 70% of the American people were reckoned as ‘morons’ (morons for her means those with low I.Q), and she recommended that the government should conduct I.Q tests compulsively so that those with low I.Q. will be immediately sterilized so as to curtail their growth. For her therefore: </p> <p>The burden of supporting these unwanted types has to be borne by the healthy elements of the nation. Funds that should be used to raise the standards of our civilization are diverted to the maintenance of those who should never have been born. [4]</p> <p></p> <p>Maria Stopes (1880-1956) on her part in supporting the course of the unnatural method of family planning founded the first birth control clinic in Great Britain in 1921. She also founded a society for constructive birth control and racial progress for which she was the first president. However, it is now widely recognized that these two women, Maria and Sanger were responsible for today’s sexual permissiveness, pornography, divorce, contraception and abortion through their actions.</p> <p></p> <p>Thomas Robert Malthus (1766-1834), an avowed elitist is another personality who was credited to have championed the birth of family planning. In his view, he believed that the poor should be eliminated for the sake of the society. Intrinsic to Malthus theory was a belief that the poor overburdened the world’s resources and that consequently, they should never really exist. Malthus view influenced many so that they began to see anyone who helps the poor as an enemy of the society since he was only helping to prolong and propagate evil.</p> <p> </p> <p>Having said something about some individual views on family planning, let us then see the notion of some organizations and groups that lended wait to the support of one of the methods of family planning.</p> <p></p> <p>The Christian churches were not left behind in the issue of supporting one of the two methods of family planning. Thus, the church insisted that the practice of natural family planning is the only authentic method of family planning. Hence:</p> <p>the church teaches that it is morally permissible for couples to calculate their fertility by observing the natural rhythms inherent in the generative faculties and to reserve marital intercourse for infertile times. Thus, couples are able to plan their families without violating the moral teachings[5]</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Seeing the opinions of a non-profit organization, which was founded in 1971 by Mr. J. F. Kippley, The Couple to Couple League (CCLI), and the organization helps couples build healthy marriages through the practice of natural family planning. The league teaches engaged and married couples how to practice natural family planning. Also, it teaches the most up-to-date </p> <p>methods in natural family planning. CCLI also distributes information on the hazards of unnatural birth control, chastity, raising children, and related medical news.</p> <p></p> <p>The population controllers like the Planned Parenthood Association of America which was founded by Dr. &amp; Mrs. Sanger allege that the world is critically overburdened with people right now, and that this crush of humanity is destroying the environment and creating inconveniences for those who are living. Therefore, they said that it is essential that we slow or halt population growth by making contraception and abortion available to all of the world’s women. Since about 1965, the population controllers have also been hinting that, if we do not put the brakes on our runaway population, the use of massive and widespread coercion will be necessary in order to save the planet. On the whole, they advocated for zero rate of natural population increase. 7</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Some of these population controllers include; International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA). Some other organization and countries that have extensively founded the population controllers are the World Bank, USA, and Rockefellers Foundation in America, Singapore, Bangladesh, China, South Korea, India, Brazil, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Egypt, turkey, Colombia, Nigeria, and others. Among the countries that said they will not lend easier support to abortion were Germany, Poland, Switzerland, France, </p> <p>the Latin and Muslim countries, Kenya, Ghana6.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] E.

His ideas and postulations are not only thought provoking but brain storming; not so much because of his originality but for daring the ‘undared’. In the light of this, Copleston confirmed: “For whatever one may think about Nietzsche’s ideas, one cannot question his vast reputation and the power of his ideas to act like a potent wine in the minds of a good many people”.1 Nietzsche’s fame is not busted by his postulations of the Superman, Eternal Return, Transvaluation of Values and not even the Will to Power. The landmark that makes him remembered today is his famous nihilistic acclamation ‘God is dead!’ Nietzsche identified this calamity with European nihilism. The European culture, once a religious culture, had become religionless. However, since this culture was built on the foundation of the Christian religion, the death of God in the hearts of the 19th century European meant the collapse of the foundation of their culture, moral values, tradition, and this was for Nietzsche a tragedy. To buttress this Omoregbe opined: “Nietzsche foresaw and predicted in a prophetic way that Europe was heading for a period of gloom and eclipse, a period of instability, aimlessness, emptiness and darknes”.2 Furthermore, in his magnum opus <i>‘The Will To Power’</i> Nietzsche wrote:</p> <p></p> <p><i>What I relate is the history of the two centuries. I describe what is coming, what can no longer come differently: the advent of nihilism…for sometime now, our whole European                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             culture has been moving as toward a catastrophe, with a tortured tension that is growing from decade to decade: restless, violently, headlong, like a river that wants to reach the end, that no longer reflects, that is afraid to reflect.3 </i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p></p> <p>With regard to Nigerian situation, there is no gainsaying the fact that Nietzschean nihilistic principles have been directly translated into Nigerian experience. Nigerian situation is that whereby the concept of God has become a dead concept. This is so because God is dead in the hearts of Nigerians. Consequently everything is permitted; nothing is meaningful and nothing works, no central objective and rallying point. Morality is thrown to dogs and meaning goes with it. This explains why there are crisis, violence, lawlessness, assassination, armed robbery, embezzlement, injustice, anarchy and chaos in Nigerian society and this without mincing words or exaggeration is what I identified as Nigeria in nihilism. However to explore Nigerian nihilism with clarity and precision, and to bring it to limelight; moral nihilism, religious nihilism, educational nihilism, economic nihilism and political nihilism, remains the focal point of this memoir. Hence, what does Nietzsche mean by nihilism? What are the consequences and implications? And how do we evaluate Nietzschean nihilism with regard to Nigerian situation? </p> <p></p> <p>This project is divided into five chapters. Chapter one introduces the whole frame of the study with the general introduction and methodology. It further states the problem, the purpose of the study and the scope of the study. Chapter two focuses on definition of the term nihilism and traces its historical account in the history of thought, which is literature review. Chapter three centres on nihilism in Nietzsche where we shall see what he meant by nihilism and its implication. The exposition of Nigerian situation where we shall witness the influence of Nietzschean nihilism in Nigerian society is the proper locus of chapter four. Chapter five takes care of evaluation and conclusion. It is this final chapter that bears my opinion concerning the topic.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2 NIETZSCHE’S BIOGRAPHY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Fredrick Wilhelm Nietzsche was born in October 15th 1844 at Rocken in Prussian Saxony (present day Germany), into a family where his father and grandfather were Lutheran pastors. When Nietzsche was barely five years, his father died. Consequently, he was brought up at Naumburg in the feminine company of his mother, sister, grandmother and two aunts. Between 1854 and 1864 he studied at Pforta. There, his admiration for Greek thought was ignited, as he was particularly attracted to the Greeks gods, writing of Plato, Aristotle and Aeschylus. In October 1864, Nietzsche went to the University of Bonn. Later that year he moved to Leipzig, to further his philosophical studies under Ritsch. During his stay in Leipzig, Friedrich gradually abandoned Christianity, occupying his mind with atheism of Schopenhauer. As at 1869, Friedrich Nietzsche was appointed professor at Basel at the age of 24 years. </p> <p></p> <p>In the years between 1869 and 1889, Nietzsche had published a lot of works including <i>‘The Dawn of Day’, ‘Joyful Wisdom’, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’, ‘Beyond Good and Evil’</i> and <i>‘Thus Spake Zarathustra’</i>, etc. From his multiple works, he was able to posit ideas of the Superman; The Will to Power, Eternal Return, and God is Dead etc. As at 1888, with the publication of the <i>Antichrist</i> and <i>Ecce Homo,</i> clear signs of mental disorder manifested in Nietzsche. Though he was hospitalised in January 1889, he never recovered fully from the insanity till the end of his life. He died on August 25th 1900.  </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM.</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>We live in the era when men are more concerned with power, pleasure, wealth and connection than character formation. An era when Hobbesian theory of man being wolf to man, the Machiavellian principle of might is right, and the Darwinian evolutionism of survival of the fittest are not only accepted but also cherished and adopted as the guiding principle in human relation. Today, what matters is how successful one is, with little or no regard to the means of the attainment of that success thus instead of the means justifying the end, the reverse is the case. Thus honesty is disregarded, indolence is extolled, probity is derided, and ostentation is paraded. Hence, there is apparent disregard of rule of law. Crime is committed with impunity. Therefore, there is loss of order and the society is chaotic.</p> <p></p> <p>This is not unconnected with Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche’s nihilistic proclamation. Having seen the meaninglessness, nothingness and absurdity of Judeo/Christian belief in God, Nietzsche announced to the world his shocking discovery that “God is dead”.4 He does not simply say that God does not exist, but that God is dead. What a catastrophe? Strengthening this, Omoregbe opined that: “What formerly gave meaning and sense of direction to human existence is no longer there. Men are now left simply with nothing, with emptiness and a meaningless existence”.5 Thus, the nothingness and nihilism of human existence, according to Nietzsche is the consequences of the death of God. It is this apparent lack of meaning and nihilism is what we are experiencing in Nigeria today. The situation in Nigeria has grown worse that she is “being described in international circles as the second most corrupt country in the world”6, by The Transparency International. It is to elicit this cankerworm or virus and to quarantine it that is the major problem of which this research sets out to resolve.</p> <p></p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.4 THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Among philosophers, the term ‘nihilism’ is mostly associated with Nietzsche. Thus, the sole aim or purpose of this project is to make clear what Nietzsche meant by nihilism and to see how far this has affected the situation in Nigeria.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.5 THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Even though Nietzsche said many things, this study is limited to his idea of death of God, from which Nietzsche’s nihilism is interpreted. Nigerian situation is also a follow up to Nietzsche’s nihilistic doctrine.</p> <p>          <b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.6 METHODOLOGY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This work is purely expository, interpretative and evaluative. Radically, Nietzsche’s dictum ‘God is dead’ is exposed as it were, which forms the base from which his nihilism is interpreted. This is followed by critical evaluation of Nigerian situation using Nietzsche’s nihilism as guideline.                  </p> <div><br/><div> <p>1 F.

Every organism is essentially endowed with its means of livelihood. So, nature has done so well to provide animals with their own means of attack, nutrition, defence and every means of survival.</p> <p></p> <p>Hitherto, with further development of the organism in higher animal, a higher means of survival is required. This higher requirement manifests itself in the form of human reason and the intelligence. The reason, then, in a gradual process develops in man as an essential tool to discover and to create new ways of satisfaction, in order to conquer its own world – the human world.</p> <p></p> <p>One might not relent to question the value of the human intellect and what it is all about. However, human intellect bestows its subject with the power of reason – ratio or intelligence. And this, therefore, distinguishes   the man, <i>homo sapiens</i>, as that thinking or wise individual from other evolutionary categorization of humans as  in <i>homo erectus</i> </p> <p>[ standing  man], <i>homo habilis</i>  etc. Also, it plays an important role in every  human make-up.</p> <p></p> <p>According to Prof Copleston,  [1963] reason “ has primarily a biological function. If one may so speak, Nature intends it as an instrument for satisfying the needs of a more highly complicated and developed organism than that of animals.”1</p> <p></p> <p>One would not to a greater extent question the insatiability of the human needs and desires. And could one as well question the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer that man and his world are virtually <b>the Will</b>, the blind desire, and representation. Every satisfaction presupposes a desire, and the latter seeks to attend the former in a logical dialectics. So, then, as man wangles in his eternal and insatiable desires, he immerses himself in it and becomes the Will as Schopenhauer opined.</p> <p></p> <p>Consequently, human intellect could be seen as a liberator, a key to human freedom, and emancipation. Schopenhauer [1788] espoused it well that though intellect is by its nature, the servant of the Will, it is capable in man of developing to such an extent that it can achieve its objectivity. That is to say, “that though man’s mind is in the first instance, an instrument for satisfying His bodily needs, it can develop a kind of surplus energy which sets it free at least temporarily, from the service of desire” [1]</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>After man might have been liberated, at least temporarily from the service of desire, what would then happen, if I may ask? Schopenhauer answers that, “he becomes a disinterested spectator: he can adopt a contemplative attitude, as in aesthetic contemplation and in philosophy” This aesthetic contemplation according to Schopenhauer is the way of being a genius.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.1     BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF ARTHUR SCHOPENEAUR</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Arthur Schopenhauer was born at Danzig on Feb. 22nd, 1788. His father, a wealthy merchant, hoped that his son would follow in his footsteps, and he allowed the boy to spend the years 1803-4 in visiting England, France and other countries on the understanding that at the conclusion of the tour, he would take up work in a business house. The young Schopenhauer fulfilled his promise, but he had no relish for a business career and on his father’s death in 1803, he obtained his mother’s consent in the continuing of his studies.</p> <p>          </p> <p>In 1809, he entered the University of Gottingen to study medicine, but he changed to philosophy in his second year at the university. As he puts it, “life is a problem and he had decided to spend his time reflecting on it\"3 In the philosophy of Schopenhauer, German idealism took a new turn. While, for example, Hegel identifies the ultimate reality, the absolute, with <i>Reason,</i> Schopenhauer identifies it with the <i>WILL.</i> For Hegel, the absolute is Reason, but for Schopenhauer, the <i>Absolute</i> is the <i>Will</i>. In Schopenhauer’s idealism, the absolute is not an intelligent being developing consciously towards its goal but rather a blind irrational impulse for life, the will-to-live. His idealism is more directly derived from Kant than those of the three idealists before him, for in his own idealism the absolute is precisely the thing-in-itself (the noumenon) of Kant.4      </p> <p></p> <p>After the failure of the Revolution of 1818, a revolution for which Schopenhauer had no sympathy at all, people were ready to pay attention to a philosophy that emphasized the evil in the world and the vanity of life and preached a turning away from life to aesthetic contemplation and asceticism. And in the last decade of his life, Schopenhauer became a famous man. Visitors came to see him from all sides. And although the German professors had not forgotten his sarcasm and abuse, lectures were delivered on his system in several universities, a sure sign that he has at last arrived. He died in September 1860. May his soul rest in peace. So be it.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p></p> <p>Among so many problems unravelled in the mystery of the mind, stands most prominently, the question and the concept of genius. And to make matters worse is the modern usage of the word “genius”. Genius is conceived hitherto as a “gift of heaven” or a remarkable character imposed on some individuals. Often, geniuses are seen as extra-ordinary being or super-humans. This ideology would to some extent arouse the mind of a philosopher and a critical thinker to inquire why such gift </p> <p>(if it is) to one, and dullness of intellect, or even idiocy to the other.</p> <p> <b>The problem is really philosophical</b> as it questions the one and universal essence of humanity, of which every human being is made of.</p> <p></p> <p>Baffled with the above problem, I, therefore as a matter of fact, invite the philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer into the intellectual stage to know what he has to say. We must acknowledge the fact that Schopenhauer’s view of life is grim and pessimistic. For him, life is an endless strife for the unattainable. The world is a world of endless strife, conflict, suffering and evil. It is impossible to stop any of these because they are manifestation of the Will. This notion makes Schopenhauer the most celebrated philosopher of pessimism. He, however, recommends only two ways by which the pain and suffering of life can be minimized. And these are: “Aesthetic contemplation and asceticism, especially as it is practiced in Buddhism”5          Schopenhauer went further to assert that the ideas that are the immediate and adequate objectivity of the thing-in-itself, of the <i>Will</i>, are <i>Arts</i> - <b>the work of genius</b>. Consequently, only through pure contemplation through which these eternal ideas are comprehended that constitutes the nature of genius. An immediate question then would be: Is a genius consists only in pure contemplation and apprehension of the immutable truths as we see in Schopenhauer? And if so, is everybody given that ability of contemplation and apprehension? However, this is just the statement of the problem.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Among so many puzzles and mysteries in the universe, hitherto, unravelled in the Mystery of Mind stands prominently the question of genius. More often than not, you hear some people say: “Beethoven was a genius”. Albert Einstein was a genius”. “Geothe was a genius”. An obvious observation is the fact that the honour of genius, if so, is only appreciated and accorded to great minds - the <i>Mahatmas</i>, of past generations. Well acclaimed are those people, that, it seems there is no existing genius in every present generation. Would it not be a superficial judgment or observation to measure genius until only after his or her departure from existence?</p> <p></p> <p>Again, the concept of genius and the cognition of the same appear vague and enigmatic when considered from the threads of history. This is so, insofar as people still question the concept. And even, until now, Werner Reyneke in his article, has once more raised some questions on that phenomenon: “What is genius?  Where does it come from? Where is it going to? Is genius just the imagination of the genius himself and the unimaginable bewilderment in the empty hearts of his expectators?” 6</p> <p></p> <p>Our study of the psychology of genius, we tend also to raise such similar questions as:</p> <p>What is genius, and who is a genius? Is genius a natural or a supernatural gift to individuals and not all? Of which benefits is genius to its subject and society in a whole? Again, is one born a genius? Or, is it developed or achieved in the course of life and existence? Is everybody a genius, or is it reserved to few individuals? Besides, what makes a genius, a genius? Does it consist of so many knowledge and highly intelligent quotients? In fact, how do we recognize a genius? Do we know a genius by his or her character and behaviour? If so, of which character does a genius exhibit? And finally, is one a genius just by conventional recognition and a standard measurement?  These critical questions and more are what we intend to investigate and explore in our research.</p> <p></p> <p>Furthermore, this project is an attempt at formulating and exposing the nature and concept of genius and creativity.  It geared also to enlighten the bright ones as it is supposed to help those who consider themselves less intellectually fortunate. In short, it will reiterate the fact that training and persistence can do miracles in one’s life as in genius.</p> <p></p> <p>Again it goes without saying that people seems to have so much regard or repute for the great minds -  the geniuses. They tend to go extra-miles to emulate them. But all things being equal or unequal, they lack the means or knowledge for such attainment. The quest for such endowment of the ambitious- seekers who would like to rise above the sky, shining like a bright morning star and soaring like the eagle is another ultimate purpose of this study.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The gift of genius whether by nature or nurture remains the flower of civilization and development of humanity. Any country, race, nation that involves itself in the massacre of genius would be very remote. Thus, the wail of humanity is checked by the activities of genius in their creative mindedness.</p> <p></p> <p>All things been equal or unequal, our study of the psychology of genius is not to be solely in an abstract or abstruse manner. The Schopeneaurian idealistic concept of genius in terms of aesthetic contemplation must be re-visited to have a practical and useful relevance. It goes without saying that our study will not only add to our knowledge, it will go further to enable students and all lovers of knowledge to adopt the way and the secret of the great minds or the geniuses.</p> <p></p> <p>Once more, the study would go a long way towards self-knowledge, auto-realization and auto-actualization. Of course, we cannot neglect the fact that the project would also pave way for understanding, as a necessary virtue in inter-human relationship.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.6     SCOPE OF STUDY</b></p> <p>This work will not as a matter of truth dwells solely on Schopenhaurian idealistic concept of genius. Neither will this work pretend to present the whole psychological investigation on genius, nor promise to exhaust its concept, for this would bring to a halt our further knowledge. Therefore, this work will not as a matter of fact close any intellectual window to the further knowledge of genius. However, the work would be articulated in five chapters as in the table of contents. Finally, there would be a critical reappraisal of Schopenhauerian’s concept of a genius.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.7      METHODOLOGY OF THE WORK</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>For the purpose of this work, the method to be employed would be expository, critical and mildly evaluative.

This has led some men to the conclusion that man is, in fact, not free.  This is now a big problem in the field of philosophy.</p> <p></p> <p>This problem of freedom of the will and determinism has continued to perturb philosophers from the ancient period till date.  As a matter of fact, this problem has seen philosophers and some scientists divided into two opposing camps; those who hold tenaciously to the freedom of the will and those who deny the reality of the freedom of the will.  The former are known as the libertarians while the latter group is known as determinists.</p> <p>It is in the midst of this controversy that I have set out to defend the reality of the freedom of the will in the light of Immanuel Kant, a philosopher of great repute, despite the fact that the juice seem to have, ages ago, been pressed out of this free will controversy.</p> <p></p> <p>Immanuel Kant lived all his eighty years in the small provincial town of konisberg in East Prussia.  He was born in April 22, 1724.  His family was among the pietists, a protestant sect somewhat like the Quakers and early Methodists. This tremendously impacted on his philosophical works. Kant authored many philosophical works some of which include Critique of Pure Reason {1781}, Critique of Practical Reason {1788}, Critique Of Judgment {1790}, Metaphysics of Morals{1797} and a host of others. His other woks, which he was unable to complete before his demise on February 12, 1804, were gathered together under the title “<b><i>opus postunum</i></b>”.</p> <p></p> <p>This work is divided into four chapters. Chapter one which I have already started deals with the general introduction and the clarification of terms.  Chapter two exposes the thoughts of some philosophers on this problem of freewill and determinism from the ancient period to the contemporary era.  In chapter three, we shall look into the thoughts of Immanuel Kant on the freedom of the will.  Chapter four is a critical evaluation and conclusion.</p> <p></p> <p>This problem of freedom and determinism from every indication is a metaphysical issue. At the same time, it is a moral issue because to deny the freedom of man is to deny responsibility and morality is built on freedom and responsibility. As a result of this, I shall limit my work to the defense of the freedom of man and its relation to morality.</p> <p></p> <p>At this juncture, it is pertinent to clarify certain terms for a better comprehension of the topic and the problem we are about to handle.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1 FREEDOM                                                                                                                     </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>For the man in the street, ‘Freedom’ is the ability to do whatever one desires to do at any point in time.  Philosophically, freedom can be seen as the absence of constriction. Oxford advanced learner’s dictionary defines freedom as “the state of being able to do what you want without anything stopping you”1.  Freedom is the absence of coercion or constraint.  Freedom can also signify that capacity or faculty whereby individuals are left to form their lives through their choices.  This is called self-determination and is often regarded as positive freedom or freedom from… Freedom, however, has so many meanings.</p> <p></p> <p>Generally, the idea of freedom connotes the following; absence of constraint, restraint, impediment, coercion, compulsion or obstacles to the realization of certain willed goal; it connotes also the ability or power to do what a person wills or to avoid what he does not want.  Battista Mondin in his book <i>Philosophical Anthropology</i> defines freedom as:</p> <p>That capacity which man has of choosing to do or not do a thing when all the conditions for action are already present. It is the sovereign control over the situation by which the will holds in its hand the power to make the choice fall in favor of one of various alternative possibilities.2</p> <p></p> <p>This is really the sense of freedom I am set to defend in this work.  Freedom is another title of man’s excellence and nobility.  It distinguishes him from every other created thing.  It is this freedom that enables man to swim through the ocean of possibilities in life.  This freedom is also at the center of moral practices. We praise or reproach persons for their actions because of our awareness of the freedom in man.  This is what makes one a moral being.  It is on this ground that Immanuel Kant held tenaciously to the reality of freedom of the human person.  He located it in the noumenal world (the sphere of <i>the thing- in- itself).</i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p></p> <p>I shall elaborate more on the views of some philosophers concerning this issue as we move along.  Suffice it to say here that freedom is in the nature of man.  Without freedom, the moral law is useless.  What then is determinism?</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2      DETERMINISM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This is a theory, which holds that every event is necessitated.  It means that the rigid laws of nature, the laws of cause and effect govern every thing.  This implies that this rigid law of nature is also governing man, being a part of nature.  By implication therefore there is no question of freedom in man since he cannot help doing what he finds himself doing.  According to the determinists, all our mental states and acts, including choices and decisions, and all our actions are effects necessitated by preceding causes.  Determinism, in general, is the philosophical theory, which maintains that for everything that ever happens there are antecedent conditions such that, given them, nothing else could happen.  Determinists consider belief in self-determination or human freedom as an unscientific illusion.</p> <p></p> <p>These determinists gave their reasons why man is not free.  These then have given rise to different forms of determinism. Let us now consider some of these kinds of determinism.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3            </b><b> KINDS OF DETERMINISM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>There are different kinds of determinism depending on the reasons given why man is not free.  Omoregbe Joseph enumerated five kinds of determinism which include; “ethical determinism, theological determinism physical determinism, psychological determinism and historical determinsn”3. We also have logical determinism.  Let us now consider these kinds of determinism one after the other.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4            </b> <b>PHYSICAL DETERMINISM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Physical determinism holds that all facts in the physical universe and hence also in human history are absolutely dependent upon and conditioned by their causes. This means that all things in nature, men included, behave according to inviolable and unchanging laws of nature, which specify all actions. This hinges on the assumption in physics that there are certain fixed laws that the heavenly bodies and the universe as a whole obey, such as the gravitational law, the law of conservation of energy, the law of relativism, and a host of other natural laws. Human actions and other events are not regarded as guided by moral considerations but rather are determined by the rigid laws of nature.</p> <p></p> <p>In his view, Omoregbe opined that physical determinism denies the freedom of man.  According to him; </p> <p>Physical determinism is the theory that man is not free because he is part of physical law of nature and all his actions are determined by the physical law of nature.4 </p> <p></p> <p>This type of determinism can be easily deduced from the thoughts of some philosophers.  The atomic theory of Democritus is a good example.  According to this theory; “Things were simply a combination of various kinds of atoms…”5This means that everything in nature, including the human person since he is part of nature is a combination of various kinds of atoms.  This theory goes as far as holding that the human soul is made up of atoms of a smoother and finer nature.</p> <p></p> <p>Thomas Hobbes materialism is a good example of a deterministic interpretation of the human nature in the modern period.  He conceived man as completely material and man’s actions as totally controlled [determined] by the physical law of nature.  Unlike Democritus who posited atoms in motion as responsible for all that is, Hobbes posited or held that everything is as a result of matter in motion.  He denied the existence of immaterial substances or spiritual elements in man.  This implies that there is no freedom in man.</p> <p></p> <p>Reacting against this, Omoregbe Joseph posed some questions.  According to him, is it possible to explain the human nature and the activities of man in material terms?  This and other such questions seem to have punctured the arguments of materialists of the ilk of Thomas Hobbes.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5            </b> <b>ETHICAL DETERMINISM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The advocates of ethical determinism hold that men’s actions are determined by what they see as good.  In other words, ethical determinism is a theory that holds that men’s actions are determined by whatever they perceive as good.  Socrates and Plato are regarded as the foremost founders of ethical determinism.  According to them to know the good is to do the good.  Nobody does evil knowingly.  St. Thomas Aquinas who also held this view argued that just as the intellect is made for the truth, and cannot help embracing it whenever it is found, so is the will made for the good and is not free to reject when confronted with it.</p> <p></p> <p>It is important to note here that most of the advocates of ethical determinism did not deny the freedom of man. For instance, St. Thomas Aquinas, in holding that man’s will is determined by the ultimate good which for him is God, maintained that man at the same time exercises his freedom when making choices among particular goods which St. Thomas considered as the means to the ultimate end. Descartes, who opined that man is determined by whatever he perceives as the highest good, added that these, that is, knowing the good and being thereby determined by the good, equally constitute human freedom.  </p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.6            </b><b>  THEOLOGICAL DETERMINISM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Theological determinism holds that since God is omniscient and omnipotent he has pre-determined all that happen in the universe and the choice man has to make.  This has been a problem to Christian thinkers in the medieval era.  They were unable to reconcile God’s foreknowledge of future events and man’s freedom.  Jonathan Edwards, an American Calvinist and theologian, saw human freedom as a contradiction.  For him, there is no question of human freedom since God is the ultimate cause and has foreknowledge of all that happen in the universe.</p> <p></p> <p>It was St. Augustine who first made genuine attempt to the solution of the problem. According to him, God's foreknowledge of future human actions does not in any way determine those future human actions.  It does not deny man’s freedom.  Man still retains his freedom to do or not to do.</p> <p>Another version of theological determinism is the one taught by protestant reformers such as Martin Luther and John Calvin. This version holds that God has predestined some people for salvation while others are destined for eternal damnation.  Those who have been predestined for salvation, God provides with his grace to enable them live a good life.  They are known as the elect.  This version portrays God as being unjust.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.7            </b> <b>PSYCHOLOGICAL DETERMINISM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Psychological determinism is the view that our actions are determined by some psychological factors such as instincts, motives, one’s environment and other factors that are regarded as psychological.  According to them, nobody performs an action without a motive and these motives are effects of prior causes, which are also effects of preceding causes, and so it continues.</p> <p></p> <p>Most philosophers conceive of voluntary action as one that is caused by such inner events as volition, motive, desire, choice or the likes.  John Lock in his view did not suppose that anything within the mind is causally undetermined, nor did he think it necessary to suppose this in order to preserve the belief in human freedom which he thought misleading to label “freedom of the will”. He went further to define liberty or freedom as “a power in any agent to do or forebear any particular action, according to this determination or that of the mind, whereby either of them is preferred to the other.” This means that a human being acts freely provided he is acting according to the preference of his own mind, and this is perfectly consistent with his actions being causally determined.</p> <p></p> <p>For David Hume there is no philosophical problem of free will.  The whole dispute, he opined, has been purely verbal in character involving only confusions in the meanings of word.  In his view free action is that which springs from the free motive of the agent.  He defined freedom as; ‘Being able to act according to the determinations of one’s own will.’6</p> <p></p> <p>This definition points to the fact that human actions are caused.  He went further to argue that all laws are based on rewards and punishments and thus rest on the assumption that men’s motives can be relied upon to have a regular influence on their behaviour.  Following the fundamental point of his philosophy that causation is essentially constant succession, Hume argued that to ask whether human action is caused is to ask whether there are anything they constantly joined to.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.8            </b> <b>LOGICAL DETERMINISM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Logical determinism is the theory, which holds that whatever that is going to happen will happen.  It implies that it is not in the power of man to alter anything in nature for men’s wills are fettered.</p> <p></p> <p>Diodonus Cronus developed this thesis.  His fundamental principle was that it always follows from the fact that something has happened that it was   going to happen and hence, that it was true that it was going to happen by chance and nothing depends on the deliberation and decision of man.</p> <p></p> <p>The stoics thought that the most elementary consideration of logic shows this to be true.  In logic, there is a law known as “the law of the excluded middle”.  This principle holds that either a statement is true or it is false.  There is no middle position, if this is so, then it must hold for statements about the past, the present and the future.  For instance the fact that Nigeria got her political independence in 1960 is true thousands of years ago.  In other words, if somebody had made this assertion that Nigeria will have her independence in 1960 thousands of years ago, the assertion will be true even though it has not yet materialized.</p> <p></p> <p>Before I conclude this chapter, it is also important to mention that there are also other forms of determinism; soft and hard determinisms. Soft determinism is the idea which holds that man is determined at the same time it gives room for some freedom in human actions.  J.S Mill, David Hume and Thomas Hobbes belong to this group.  On the other hand, hard determinism gives no room for freedom in human action.  The materialists advocate this type of determinism. </p> <p></p> <p>Like I mentioned earlier, this problem of freedom and determinism has been there since the beginning of philosophical speculation. In the next chapter, I shall x-ray the opinions of different philosophers on this problem from the ancient to the contemporary period.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>1 S.Wehmeier, (ed<i>), Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary</i>, (New   York ,2000)</p> <p> 2 B.

He set out to revive philosophy, not only of the problem of man but also that of ‘Being’. It is also the view of anthropologists that the study of man be given a central place in existence. They hold that all that exist is directed towards the explanation, understanding and well-being of man.<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p></p> <p>        However, man is far from realizing the plans made for him, when he demotes himself as one of the ‘thrown objects’ of Spinoza. Thus, the conscious realization of man as regards his place in the world will qualify him as not just ‘being-there’ as posited by Heidegger but more of an independent being capable of making choices as well as being responsible for them. It then behooves on man, the need to assert his existence in an authentic form. Having realized his being as one placed in charge of all other things according to Genesis account of creation, he must seek a way of giving meaning to his personal life. This constitutes the main purpose of this work.</p> <p></p> <p>Furthermore, man’s existential struggle and facts of life (grenz-situationen) daily unveil to him the more need to be personally responsible for his life. It is this background acting as the anti-thesis that provides for him the thesis of transcending the ‘crowd mentality’ to the awareness that he is but an individual. As a result, he sought to explain the world from his own person instead of the crowd. Here rests the importance of self-formation, not just for the sake of others but also for one’s personal life. </p> <p></p> <p>It has been said that cultivation of citizens is the fertile ground for that of a nation. A glance at the occasional situations of unrest in our country cannot but reveal the extent of our existential doldrums. The polity, economy, religion, etc are nothing without the existence and activity of man.</p> <p></p> <p>Bearing this in mind, it then means that our problems lie primarily in cultivation of people because as Plato had it, a non-philosopher leader is not worthy of being the leader; a non cultivated leader is nothing but canker-worm to any society.</p> <p></p> <p>Primarily one should be good in himself in other to radiate goodness unto others, for nobody gives what he has not. The same applies to those in the helm of affairs, be that religion, economy, education, etc, they should be cultivated to live as authentic being before they can lead others well. (With this, we Nigerians shall come to the realization of our potentials, extricate ourselves from European colonialization, modernized in form of trade union where they dictate the stand of our products.) Hence, if the ruler and the ruled in Nigeria live genuine and existential life, malaise of any sort will give way to a more responsible life. Then is the aim of this work realized.</p> <p></p> <p>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>It is over-laboring the obvious if one should ask what the problem is. It is experienced right under everybody’s nose. In politics, our leaders do not heed to the basic unwritten law that their private interest should not come in conflict with that of the public. We have experienced series of political crisis, economic malaise, social instability, and even religious upheaval.</p> <p> ‘The fact that every where in the world, Nigerians are generally feared like mad dogs, dreaded like criminals, cautiously approached like dangerous snakes and watchfully avoided like lepers’[1] is a glaring prove of the extent of our problem.</p> <p></p> <p> It was John Stuart Mill who said that ‘it is a crime, punishable by law to bring a child into the world without giving him a necessary education’[2]. If education is left only in the hands of the few, what then becomes the fate of the future generation? Definitely, we shall not meet up with knowledge which Francis Bacon said is power. The widespread ‘okada’ syndrome, conductor and driving profession, increasing number of hawkers, etc, that are mainly taken up by youths who should be in the school and under the guidance of the state, undoubtedly unmask deadly canker worm in the bones of our society.</p> <p>Professor C.B. Okolo underlined ‘squandermania mentality’[3] as the central problem of our country. This he defined as a situation whereby every Tom, Dick and Harry develops a passive consumerism rather than productive attitude to issues. Our leaders, just like their citizens, are mostly preoccupied with the here and now that they fail to see beyond the immediate satisfaction and interest of the moment. As a result, there is no provision for the future and its generation.  An immersion into the world of ‘now’ shows some kind of resistance to pain and discipline needed today for a better tomorrow.</p> <p></p> <p>Another problem that is associated with this is alienation and marginalization of oneself. Authentic life has to do with being oneself and having freedom either to choose or reject something. Because of the absence of this awareness, people do not even recognize what is their right and position in the society. We tend to project our problems as caused by the westerners or others. We alienate ourselves from our resources and the revenue that accrue from them. </p> <p></p> <p>Unemployment has even affected the enlightened class. What then is the stand of uneducated? It is not uncommon to find grown-ups with negative orientation that is dangerous for our society. As a result of the hard situation, one makes up his mind to take the risk of life, which will either see him out of his pitiable situation or face the wrath of infringing the law of the state. The fact that criminals, drug barons, prostitutes, etc, are on the increase is not unconnected with this.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3 METHOD AND SCOPE OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>My task in this project is not to review or reinterpret the work of existentialists or Soren Kierkegaard precisely, but more of a synthesis, sieving, abstraction, mediation on the hinge points of existentialism, with that of Kierkegaard and then juxtaposing it with our country’s predicament. It is in this synthetic work that I will arrive at a more practical ways of curbing these problems.</p> <p></p> <p> Precisely, I am to make use of Soren Kierkegaard’s individual authentic existence in which he not only takes cognizance of the individual but also his genuine relationship with the crowd, search for ultimate good and meaning of life. Morestill, I do not intend going theocentric, rather a search to fill the deep chasm in man by personalizing the objective truth in every individual person. </p> <p></p> <p>It is the thought of Paul Ricoeur and Hans Gadamer that before a background, there must be a foreground, for no one speaks from nowhere. Similarly, this project is set up because of some problems. It begins with the background and the problems that led to the emergence of existentialism. The various thoughts of existentialists are not left out, and then follow Kierkegaard’s works and contributions. A review of Nigerian situation is followed by some restorative measures. Finally comes, the evaluation and conclusion.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] John Okwoeze Odey, <i>The Paradox Of A Nation</i> (Enugu, Snaap Press, 2003) p. 10</p> </div> <div> <p>[2] Ekwutosi C.M, <i>Freedom and determinism</i> (unpublished lecture), 2006</p> </div> <div> <p>[3] B.C Okolo<i>.

(THE PROBLEM OF INDUCTION)    </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>It is one of the fundamental canons of the empiricists, the positivists of all sorts and in fact the entire circle of the inductivists, that the ladder of science can only be climbed through the collection and assembling of our experiences. Put in another way, it is the case that scientific knowledge requires primarily and basically the collection of protocol sentences. The principle of induction can be expressed in the following statement:</p> <p>If a large number of A’s have been observed under a wide variety of conditions, and if all those A’s without exceptions possess the property of B, then all A’s have the property B.1</p> <p>Thus if various forms of metal expanded when heated at various occasions, one can conclude that all metals expand when heated. This is essentially an inductive process, which until the time of Popper was in the eyes of its exponents, a non-optional extra for empirical sciences. This principle of induction, the principle that scientific knowledge grows through the progressive movement from the particular statements (i.e. statements about facts) to the general (universal) statements, which are essentially the form in which, scientific theories appear, is considered of supreme importance for scientific discovery and advancement. Hence, Reichenbach makes bold to assert that the elimination of this principle from the foundational structure of science is tantamount to divesting science of its power to determine the truth or otherwise the falsity of its theories. Science will, therefore, be in want of a veritable means by which the veracity of her theories is established. There is no longer any intellectual difference between the scientific posits and the fanciful, arbitrary inventions of the poetic genius.2</p> <p>Yet, Popper despite the fact that the principle of induction is unreservedly accepted by the whole of science and acquiescing to the possibility of universal error maintained the untenable nature of this inductive procedure. This skeptical view was already found in Hume and Kant, but only as precursors, for there are remarkable differences between these and Popper’s. Popper contended that this principle of induction is a muddle and is superfluous. For him it is destitute of a strong basis as it is torpedoed by confusion and riddled with untold logical inconsistencies.3</p> <p></p> <p>Scientific laws are always cast in the form of what the philosophers term universal statements in the sense that they make reference to all events of a particular kind. The problem emerges in the face of the observation statements, which allegedly provide evidence for the general scientific laws. The former are specific claims about a state of affairs that are recorded at a particular time. They are what philosophers call singular (or basic) statements or protocol sentences. Popper noted that there is no logical justification for inferring the truth of the universal statements from the singular, the numerical strength of the later not withstanding. This is because there is no guarantee that the contrary will not be the case in the future. This is fundamentally an impossible endeavour for any account of experience can primarily and essentially be only a singular statement and not a universal one. General scientific laws invariably go beyond the finite amount of the observable evidence that is available to support them. The corollary is that these evidences can never be established as the efficient progenitors of the general scientific laws. It is impossible to logically deduce the later from the available evidence. Any link, therefore, between singular and the universal statements in which the former serve to authenticate the veracity of the later is an illogical connexion, which impinges on the acceptance of the inductive inference. This is the logical problem of induction and is made more complex by the fact that it is impossible to justify a law by observation or experience as highlighted above since it transcends experience; that science proposes and makes use of laws at every point and time despite the paucity of the observed instances upon which the laws are founded; and by the fact of the principle of empiricism which asserts that in science, only observation and experience may decide upon the acceptance or the rejection of scientific statements including laws and theories.4</p> <p>But what is the raison d’ etre of this sort of inference. The issue raised here demands foremost that a principle of induction be established – a principle which provides “a statement by means of which we should be able to put inductive inferences into a logically accepted form.”5 How is the principle of induction to be vindicated? We have seen that this is impossible logically. What is left is an appeal to experience. Popper observed that any attempt to justify the practice of induction by an appeal to experience must lead to an infinite regress. The principle of induction must be a universal statement. Its justification is based on a number of individual instances of its successful application. Thus, use is made of inductive inference. Hence the justification of induction by an appeal to experience involves assuming what one is trying to prove i.e. begging the question. It is all about justifying induction by appealing to induction and so is totally unsatisfactory.6</p> <p>Hume’s attempt to give a psychological basis of the principle of induction was in Popper’s estimation mistaken. It flies in the face of the principle of transference, for what is false in Logic as we already saw becomes true in psychology. Immediately Hume struck bargain with the psychological justification of induction, he became an exponent of an irrationalist epistemology. Popper was dissatisfied with his psychological explanation of induction in terms custom or habit. If we follow Hume, having established before now that inductive reasoning lacks any force as an argument to assert that this sort of reasoning dominates our cognitive life or our understanding, it means the exaltation of irrationalism for it is obvious then that argument or reason plays only a minor role in our understanding. Our knowledge is therefore not only depicted as being of the nature of belief but also of rationally indefensible belief- of irrational faith.7 It is bizarre, Popper argues to explain our propensity to expect regularities in terms of repetition. Events would continue to be isolated unless man has the categories that connect them. Popper submitted on logical reasons that repetition presupposes a point of view, ‘such as a system of expectations, anticipations, assumptions or interests.’8 It is only within this climate of thought that the questions of infinite regress or irrationalism are given a final blow. This, Popper maintains, depicts the scientific procedure.</p> <p><b>1.2  THE VIENNA CIRCLE’S ATTACK ON METAPHYSICS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The logical positivists in the spirit of inductive tradition held that science is fundamentally based on the accumulation of facts. However they made a dogmatic extrapolation by holding a naïve and naturalistic view of meaning in their verification principle. For them, the genuine character and the meaningfulness of any alleged proposition is determined by its being a truth function of, or its being reducible to, elementary (or atomic) proposition expressing observations or perceptions. Carnap articulates this somewhat lopsided position of the positivists in a fascinating fashion:</p> <p>It is certain that a string of words has meaning only if its derivability relations from protocol sentences (observation sentences) are given…that is to say, if the way to (its) verification… is known.9</p> <p>The meaning of a statement is, thus, the method of its verification they concluded, to use the expressions of Waisman.10 The result of this unacceptable position of the Positivists is that the metaphysical sentences stand revealed, by logical analysis, as pseudo- sentences. The propositions of metaphysics are dismissed by them as non-sensical, and so lack any relevance and force in the ensemble of gnoseological acquisitions. This is indeed a calculated strategy towards a complete destruction of metaphysical principles. They have become <i>ipso facto</i> avowed worshippers in the temple of that Humean ideology in which metaphysics is viewed as ‘nonsensical twaddle, sophistry and illusion,’ requiring to be committed to the flames.11 </p> <p>Popper in his unpublished book entitled <i>Die beiden Grund probleme der Erkenntnisthorie12, </i>gave a fairly detailed criticism of this doctrine of elimination or overthrow (ueberwindung) of metaphysics through meaning-analysis. This anti-current action was done, not from a metaphysical framework, but from the springboard of one whose interest is in science, and its unhampered growth and advancement. Popper observed that this doctrine far from defeating the supposed enemy, brought the keys of the beleaguered city to the beck and call of the alleged enemy.13 The proponents were so much fixated in their determination to oust metaphysics from the circle of all informative discipline that they failed to realize that most of the scientific theories, which they purport to shield, have also fallen on the same scrap heap as the ‘meaningless’ propositions of metaphysics. Should this position of theirs be taken in the least lightly, their efforts towards the radical annihilation of metaphysics would also be an effort towards the eclipse of science as most of the postulations of the later which have metaphysical features would be destroyed simultaneously. It is an established fact that scientific laws and theories, which appear in the form of universal propositions, transcend experience and so are incapable of being logically reduced to the elementary statements of experience. Were we to hold credence to the Positivists’ criterion of meaning and apply such a criterion in a way that is consistent, we shall in the final analysis jettison the natural laws, which are, as Einstein says, the supreme task of the physicist,14 from the sphere of meaningful propositions. They can never be welcome into the community of all genuine or legitimate statements.</p> <p>Since Bacon, the most widely held view was that science was characterized by its observational basis while pseudo-sciences and metaphysics were typified by their speculative method. Popper hardly accepts this view. The modern theories of physics especially Einstein’s theories were highly speculative and abstract. They were very far removed from what might be tagged their observational bases. All attempts to show the contrary were unconvincing, Popper concluded.15 Most scientific theories originate from myths. The Copernican system, for instance, was precipitated from a Neo-Platonic worship of light of the Sun who occupied the pride of place- the center because of his nobility. Copernicus, it must be noted studied in Bologna, under the Platonist Novara.16 Atomisms, corpuscular theory of light among others, are myths that have in no less a measure become vital for physical sciences. It makes no meaning to say, Popper noted, that these theories in one stage of their development were nonsensical expressions while they suddenly become meaningful in another.17 Parmenides of Elea seems to have captured this sequence when he opined that out of non-being comes non-being. No ‘sense’ can ever emerge from ‘non-sense’!</p> <p>Furthermore, it is obvious that a lot of realities which science posits are no more observable than metaphysical entities. Should we have to talk about gravity, and various forms of forces, Newtonian mass points—Popper calls these ‘occult metaphysical substances’18 to depict their non-observable nature. Can we also observe time and space which have among others formed the fundamentals of scientific knowledge? Thus, if following the Positivists, we exclude these from all things meaningful, scientific boat would automatically be rocked and shattered.</p> <p>We have seen that the broom of the anti-metaphysicist sweeps away too much. The anti-metaphysicist’s assertion that metaphysical propositions are sheer gibberish, if a little protracted, throws science into the wilderness of devastation. No wonder Popper had first to expose the antiques of this position with regard to science, for his maps for the growth of science would be irrelevant if the said science has been utterly extinguished.<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.3 POPPER SETS OFF AGENDA FOR THE THEORY-DEPENDENCE OF SCIENCE </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Popper is not in the least undaunted in his conviction that the advance of science can hardly result from the accumulation of perceptual experiences in the course of time. No matter how dogged we are in gathering and sorting them, it is impossible, he thought, for science to emerge out of uninterpreted sense-perceptions. The canon of selection is ever utilized in the scientific observations. Hence, before any meaningful observation can be embarked upon, there is need for a choice of object, definite task—all of which presuppose interests, problems and points of view.19  In the light of this, all observations involve interpretation. Pure, unadulterated observational knowledge ‘would, if at all possible be utterly barren and futile.’20  Chalmers seems to share this view when he asserts:</p> <p>How can we establish significant facts about the world through observation if we do not have some guidance as to what kind of knowledge we are seeking or what problems we are trying to solve?21</p> <p>Observation statements cannot be statements expressing uninterpreted data. They are rather statements of facts in the light of theories. “How odd it is,” Darwin notes, “that anyone should not see that all observation must be for or against some view….”22</p> <p>Nature must be cross-examined on the basis of the experimenter’s theories, his ideas and his inspirations. Kant was after all correct when he says that it behoves on the experimenter to question nature and not wait until it pleases nature to make manifest her secrets.23 It must however be noted that unlike Kant who asserts that our theories are valid <i>a priori</i>, Popper maintains that they are only guesses, doubts, which must be tested empirically. This is an adumbration of what he calls hypotheticism, which is one of the cardinal points of his strategy. Hence he maintains that:</p> <p>Bold ideas, unjustified anticipations and speculative thought are our only means for interpreting nature; our only organon, our only instrument, for grasping her.24</p> <p></p> <div><br/><div> <p>1 See A.

In this regard, Arthur C. Danto affirms that “Neither in common usage, nor in philosophy has there been a univocal concept of ‘person”[1]. </p> <p></p> <p>But basically, the English word ‘person’ is derived from the Latin word, ‘persona,’ which can be traced to the Greek ‘prosopon,’ which in its original sense denotes the ‘mask’ worn by an actor. Later it came to refer to the role played by the actor or the dramatist, and finally to the human being as an actor on the stage of life; as Willaim Shakespeare says: Life is a stage where each person is an actor. Cicero used the term ‘person’ to denote an assumed appearance, a mark of distinction or dignity or a sum total of personal qualities. </p> <p></p> <p>Legally speaking, person denotes a subject of law, a being bound by law. This is evident in the Roman legal system where person designates cives Romani-the Roman citizen, a man who enjoys the citizenship (civitatis) or freedom (libertatis). In this sense, person refers to that being that possesses certain rights and conditions that make him capable of exercising them. </p> <p></p> <p><br/></p> <p>Nevertheless, the advent of the existentialist style of philosophizing brought about a kind of ‘Copernican revolution’ to the understanding of the human person in the history of Western philosophy. Kierkegaard, the “father of modern existentialism and the first European philosopher who bore the existentialist label”[2] paid particular attention to the concept of the human person. Just like Heidegger who pointed out the forgetfulness of ‘Being’ in traditional philosophy occasioned by the influence of science, Kierkegaard reacts against the forgetfulness of the concrete problems of the “thinking subject” in the history of thought. The early Greek philosophers were physicists, who had no direct concern about the human person. It was Socrates who first directed the attention of philosophy to the issues about man himself. After Socrates, the concrete problems of the human person were forgotten again until the dawn of existentialism. </p> <p></p> <p>Existentialism has been described “not as a ‘philosophy’ but rather as ‘a style of philosophizing’”[3]. It is a style that may lead those who adopt it to very divergent convictions about the world and man’s life in it. This diversity is obviously evidenced by a study of the thought of such existentialist thinkers like Kierkegaard, Sartre and Heidegger. Kierkegaard believes in the existence of God, Sartre denies the existence of God, whereas Heidegger neither affirms nor denies the existence of God. However, there are some strings of similarities in their general considerations of the business of philosophy and also in the understanding of the concept of the human person. </p> <p></p> <p>The first significant common feature of the existentialist philosophers is that they </p> <p>begin from man rather than from nature. Existentialism is a philosophical movement concerned with the subject rather than the object. This is unlike idealism, which starts from the subject only as the “thinking subject”. For the existentialists, “the subject is the existent in the whole range of his existing”[4]. He is not only a thinking subject but also an initiator of action and a center of feeling. With regard to this, Sartre says, “Man’s existence precedes his essence.”5 He highlights that “man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world and defines himself afterwards”6. Thus, the existentialists, unlike the traditional Western metaphysicians concentrate on problems that are directly related to human existence rather than on the abstract or speculative issues. </p> <p></p> <p>In relation to the “existing subject”7, the existentialists treat such themes as freedom, decision, responsibility, finitude, guilt, alienation, despair, death, the emotional life of man, problems of language, history, society, and being. Some of these matters, which are of great interest to the existentialists, have hitherto scarcely been regarded as appropriate themes for philosophy at all. However, it is in the exploration and development of these themes, drawn mostly from the affective elements in personal life that the existentialist philosophers have made their most important and characteristic contributions to philosophy. </p> <p></p> <p>The African equally has a well-developed view of the “existing subject”. For the African, the “existing subject’, that is, the human person is not alone in the exercise of his freedom, decision, choice, responsibility and so on. He is a being with-others. He is never an Island in the world of things and persons. Hence, John Mbiti has to say of the African man: “I am because we are; and since we are, therefore I am”8. Africans have a unitary world-view. These imply that while Kierkegaard’s individual, the “existing subject,” is highly individualistic, Africans make a further step of considering the individual not just as a selfish existing subject, but more as a subject existing among other subjects. In Heideggerian parlance, the African considers the human person as a “being-with”. It is this rather conflicting notion of the human person in Kierkegaard and the African that forms the crux of this investigation. </p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The notion of the human person has been a matter of serious concern to the existentialist philosophers. But prior to the emergence of this movement, philosophers have neglected the matters concerning the concrete existing man. The pre-Socratic philosophers concentrated on the cosmological aspect of the world. It was Socrates who came and for the first time, directed the attention of philosophy to man. His belief is that all the physical existent exist only in relation to the existing subject. And this is correct. But no sooner had Socrates gone out of sight than the concrete problems of man in his environment were forgotten. Philosophers deviated from the existing individual to the physical sciences. Philosophers over the ages have been philosophizing on abstract principles that have no direct relevance to the existing individual. This led to the depersonalize, dehumanization and objectification of the human person. Man was no more regarded as a dignified being but rather considered in relation to the function he was able to perform. This frightening erosion of human values and the abysmal depreciation of the dignity of the human person reached its apogee at the dawn of the twentieth century technological advancement. To be particular, the absence of the ‘person’ as an existent in the philosophy of Hegel woke Kierkegaard from his ignoble slumber and brought forth the birth of existentialism. </p> <p></p> <p>Hence, it was kierkegaard’s rebellion against Hegel’s dissolute pantheistic contempt for the individual that became the ‘point de depart’ of contemporary existentialism. Thus, Kierkegaard insists on “studying man in his radical singularity and individuality, a man who is constantly faced with making momentous decisions that spell the difference between authentic and inauthentic existence”9. He considers the individual’s lived experience in its unrepeatable uniqueness. Existentialism therefore abhors any attempt at objectification or universalization of that which eminently is singular and belongs to the individual. </p> <p></p> <p>Now, there is a relevant question to be asked: Does the Kierkegaardian existentialism have any room for the other individuals? Or, does every individual have to face his world of existence alone? The attempts to answer the questions will definitely brings us face to face with either the convergence or divergence between kierkegaardian and the African notions of the human person. How to solve this problem is the basic problem we are posed to grapple with. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2             </b><b>PURPOSE OF STUDY </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The purpose of this study is a comparative analysis between kierkegaardian view of the human person and the African view. This, when done, will hopefully go a long way in helping us know what an authentic person should be. The work attempts an integration of the Western view of the human person represented by Kierkegaard, and the African conception. Hence, rejecting the depersonalization, objectification and dehumanization of man, we come to know really what the existing individual actually is. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3       SCOPE OF STUDY </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This work is not going to exhaust all that Kierkegaard treated on the existing individual. But as space allows, his major view of the individual as a free human agent who is able to choose his actions and take responsibility for his choices and decisions will be considered. This will be juxtaposed with the African notion of freedom, choice and decision of the existing individual. </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3             </b><b>METHODOLOGY OF THE WORK </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The problem before us is not a metaphysical one, but an existential one. Therefore, I will apply the method of existential and comparative critical analysis of what the authentic self should be-drawing from Kierkegaardian and African conceptions. Man will be considered not only as a thinking subject, but also as an existing subject. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5       DIVISION OF WORK </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This work is divided into five chapters. The first chapter tries to give the general introduction to the work. Herein, the problem to be tackled, the purpose, scope, methodology and the division of the work are given. In the second chapter, we shall attempt the review of literature on the notion of the human person from the inception of critical philosophy in Ancient Greece till the contemporary age. An exposé of Kierkegaardian notion of the human person is given in chapter three, whereas the African concept of the individual in highlighted in chapter four. In chapter five, we shall attempt the juxtaposition of the Kierkegaardian and the African person. This will be an evaluation of both views and finally, a conclusion on what the authentic self should be from the perspective of the researcher. </p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] A.C.       Danto, “Person” in P.Edwards (ed.), <i>The Enclycopeadia of Philosophy</i>, Vol. 6, (London: Collier Macmillan Pub., 1967), p. 110.</p> </div> <div> <p>[2] J.

However, all these things make more meaning only when shared with others. Therefore, friends are “<i>sine qua non</i>” to human existence. It is on this ground that Aristotle would say, “for man is a social being, and designed by nature to live with others”.1 Every human being needs the other to live a fulfilled life. No man is an Island. No man can boast of living well in a place alone, he needs the other person.</p> <p></p> <p>As regards friendship, there are different conceptions as there are scholars who philosophize on that. Each expresses his or her own notion of friendship. Though there are different notions among scholars about friendship, most of the differences perhaps are as a result of cultural differences and background.</p> <p></p> <p>It is an obvious fact that not all types of friendship seek to the development of both the individual and the entire society. This, I believe is the major fact why friendship as a term has been misconstrued and misconceived. Sequel to this, some regard friendship as a thing to be avoided because of the negative connotations that often go with it.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.1                      </b><b>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY.</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Over the years, people (including philosophers) have looked at the concept of friendship from various perspectives. Such people include Plato, Cicero, Epicureans, Thomas Aquinas, St. Augustine, Aristotle, etc., each of these philosophers has his view of friendship.</p> <p></p> <p>However, the purpose of this work is to discuss how modern day people understand friendship using Aristotle’s conception of friendship as a paradigm. This work will investigate why people make friends. In the same vein, it has as its purpose to find out whether friendship is intrinsically good or bad.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>1.2                      <b>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b>.</p> <p>In spite of the fact that friendship is a <i>“sine qua non</i>” to human existence, it has over the years passed through different hardships. Even the early Greeks and Romans were victims of this. Thus Aristotle laments over the failure of friendship with, “O my friend, there is no friend”.2 Empedocles on his side, contrasts friendship with strife. This motivated Aristotle to exalt friendship in his ‘Nicomacheaan Ethics’.</p> <p></p> <p>The Stoics and Cynics place friendship upon the most complete “abundance” and generosity of spirit. For the Christian writers, friendship is synonymous with love. This love must be grounded in God and thus spurs one to channel the same love to another person.</p> <p></p> <p>On the other hand, the decline of friendship to its lowest level came in the modern day. Among the modern people, there is too much exultation of romantic love as friendship. Others see friendship as a business where one sees profit making as the primary aim.</p> <p>With this in mind, friendship, like a rolling stone that carries a lot of dust, carries to itself many negative connotations. This makes people to regard friendship as something to be avoided. They see it as something that is intrinsically bad.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3                      </b><b>METHOD OF RESEARCH.</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The method applied in this research is mainly expository. It is expository because it shows in great detail what friendship was in the olden days. Also it exposes what is obtainable now as friendship with its benefits, problems and possible solutions.</p> <p></p> <p>1.4                      <b>SCOPE OF THE WORK</b>.</p> <p>Since time immemorial, one of the problems of human beings is how to relate well with people around him. There  is an innate derive in human beings that pulls them together. Each of them has his or her unique way of behaviour. But the problem remains, how can people of different behaviour, culture, belief, etc., relate? It is to tackle this problem that motivated several scholars and leaders of thought to have various speculations on friendship. Among these scholars is a Greek philosopher, Aristotle.</p> <p></p> <p>Aristotle’s conception of friendship seems to be more famous than that of other philosophers. Therefore, the limitation of this work will be on how the modern people conceive friendship, bearing Aristotle’s conception in mind. This is whether or not the modern day conception of friendship is in line with that of Aristotle.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5                      </b><b>DIVISION OF WORK</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This work is divided into five chapters for easy grasping. Chapter one is the general introduction, purpose of study, statement of problem, method of research, scope of the work and division of work. In chapter two, the researcher gives an overview of some philosophers’ view on friendship. Chapter three is the heart of the work. It treats both the Aristotelian conception and modern day conception of friendship. Chapter four handles the importance of friendship, the problems of friendship and possible solution to the problems of friendship.

How is one to act when faced with a moral decisive situation? Life presents us with situations where decisions are not so clear-cut. Saying yes to one perceived good often means saying no to another. The question “what ought I to do” in a given situation raises conflict for us. Making decisions is a part of man’s life. Man tries to make the right decisions always because a wrong decision taken can be detrimental to both an individual and the community. Hence, B. O. Eboh observes that, “It is often difficult to take a moral decision in a given situation because of the many other facts which may surround such a situation”[1]. The point is that there are many realities to be taken into consideration in moral decision-making. </p> <p>At this point, one may ask: “what moral decision am I to take in a moral situation?”</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1       APPROACHES TO DECISION MAKING</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>There are three main alternative routes or approaches to follow in making moral decisions. They are: (1) the legalistic approach, (2) the antinormian approach, the extreme opposites i.e. a lawless or unprincipled approach; and (3) the situational approach. All these three have played their part in the history of Western morals. </p> <p> </p> <p><b>(A)     LEGALISM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Legalism is the most common and persistent approach to decision making. It triumphed among the Jews after the exile and has dominated Christianity constantly from very early days. There exist a series of well-defined and absolute laws (secular, cultural and religious) that the individual must implement in every situation. Legalism sees moral rules and principles not as guides but absolute norms that must be obeyed at all costs and in all situations. With this approach, one enters into every decision-making situation armed with already-made rules and regulations. Fletcher affirms that, “legalism looks at the letter of the law and insists on its observance while ignoring the spirit of the law”.[2] However, questions arise as to whether in a particular case the law truly applies or as to which of several more or less conflicting laws is to be followed. In this case, the legalist applies casuistry.</p> <p></p> <p>According to Joseph Fletcher, legalism in the Christian tradition has taken two forms: In the catholic line of thought, it has been a matter of legalistic reason, based on nature or natural law. Hence he says:</p> <p>These moralists have tended to adumbuarate their ethical rules by applying human reason to the facts of nature, both human and sub-human and to the lessons of historical experience. By this procedure they claim to have adduced universally agreed and therefore valid natural moral laws.[3]</p> <p></p> <p>In the protestant line of thought, it has also followed the same deductive catholic tactics. From this perspective, Fletcher observes:</p> <p>They have taken scripture and done with it what the, Catholics do with nature. Their scriptural moral law is, they argue, based on the words and saying of the law and the prophets, the evangelist and apostles of the bible.[4] </p> <p></p> <p>As such, for him it is a matter of legalistic revelation in the protestant line of thought. However, both the catholic line of thought and the protestant line of thought are legalistic. Not even the fact that the catholic moralists deal also with revealed law and the protestant also have tried to use reason in interpreting the saying of the bible, Fletcher still maintains that both of them, by and large, have been committed to the doctrine of law ethics, which is legalism. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>(B)   ANTINORMIANISM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This is the approach with which one enters into the decision-making situation armed with no principles or maxims whatsoever. Literally, the term antinomianism means ‘against law’. Here, each individual enters the decision making process with no laws, guiding principles or maxims, believing that they will make the right decisions spontaneously in the moment, and base on the unique situation. Some antinormianists believe this ‘right decision’ information comes to them from an outside source such as the Holy Spirit or the combined wisdom of the ages under the guise of intuition. Antinormianism is a lawless and principleless approach to moral decision-making. It rejects all moral laws and principles and insist that man is free to take any decision he deems fit in any situation. </p> <p></p> <p>Among the Hellenistic Jew-Christians, antinormianism took the form of libertinism. They believe that by grace, by the new life in Christ and salvation by faith, laws or rules no longer apply to Christians. Their ultimate happy faith was now assured and it no longer mattered what they did. The negative result of this form of antinormianism led to an increase of legalism. Another form of antinormianism was a Gnostic claim to special knowledge so that neither principles nor rules were needed any longer even as guidelines and direction pointers. Those who go by it, claimed that they will just know what was right when thy needed to know. As such, their moral decisions are random and unpredictable. Making moral decisions is a matter of spontaneity.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>(C)   SITUATIONISM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The third approach to decision making is situationism. If legalism and antinormianism are the two ends of the spectrum, situationism falls between them. Here, each individual has an understanding of the general rules and guiding principles of his or her culture and theology, and uses the information to evaluate the situation and then adopts or rejects the ‘rule’ so that love or highest good can be served in the situation. Situationism accepts that there are universal moral principles but it sees them only as guides in ones decision-making. The situationist enters into every decision-making situation fully armed with the ethical maxims of his community and its heritage, and he treats them with respect as illuminators of his problems. Just the same way, he is prepared in any situation to compromise them or set them aside in the situation if love seems better served by doing so.  Joseph Omoregbe observes that for the Situationists, “moral principles are not directives or absolute laws which must be obeyed at all costs.”[5] Situation ethics goes path of the way with natural law, by accepting reason as the instrument of moral judgement while rejecting the notion that the good is given in the nature of things. It also goes path of the way with scriptural law by accepting revelation as the source of the norms while rejecting all revealed laws or norms except the command to love. The decisions taken by a situationist are hypothetical and not categorical. Only the command to love is categorically good. Thus, Fletcher says, “Situation ethics aims at a contextual appropriateness- not the ‘good’ nor the ‘right’ but the fitting.”[6]</p> <p>There are various names for this approach: Situationism, contextualism, occasionlism, circumstantialism or actualism. These labels indicate of course, that the core of the ethics they describe is a healthy and primary awareness that circumstances alter cases. Situationism places emphases on the situation more than anything else in determining which action is right or wrong in any given situation. </p> <p></p> <p>Having seen the three different approaches to decision making, it is important to point out at this early stage that there is no one of these approaches that has the absolute answer to the issue of making a moral decision. The words of Eboh explained this point better:</p> <p>What needs to be highlighted is that in moral spheres, there is always a blending of colours. It is never one colour, it is always a mixture of colours each colour is a shade of human factors in moral decision making.[7]</p> <p></p> <p>What is being stressed here is that there is need for prudence while making any moral decision, and not to follow one of these approaches fanatically.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] B.

Today “Machiavellism” is used to describe a political situation characterized by tyranny, despotism, deception and violence. This is because of Machiavelli’s approach and guidelines towardsachieving stability in the state<b>.</b> Machiavelli crafts a perspective that aligns politics with warfare, and justifies the deployment of force, the exercise of cruelties, the practice of deceit and the manipulation of appearances in the service of government. He was greatly influenced by the political disarray in Florence of his time. Moreover Machiavelli presented virtue as vice and vice versa. For him the politician or ruler should not be a moral agent. He should be less concerned with the morality of actions in as much as he maintains power.</p> <p></p> <p>The Machiavellian principle in its nature considers the end of actions and not the means used. This poses a state of the survival of the fittest. This situation to a great extent negates the principle of democracy and scuttles its growth. Democracy as we know is praised for its space for freedom, equality, justice and fairness. For any democratic institution to flourish all traces of Machiavellism should be eschewed. This is my major concern in this work. I shall verify how the Machiavellian principle is in play in the Nigeria’s politics. Has it helped matters or does it bring anarchy? This is the question we shall attempt in this discourse. </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2 Purpose of Study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The aim of this work is to critically analyze the principles of Machiavelli. This will take the form of stating and describing the whole content of his principles as well as pointing out its implications. Also I shall ‘x-ray’ the principle of democracy tracing its origin and the conditions for its practice. This verification will be done within the Nigerian situation. However, the sole issue here is to relate the principle of Machiavelli to the situation of democracy in Nigeria. We shall discuss and inquire on what relevance Machiavellism is to democracy in Nigeria and the various forms through which Machiavellism has penetrated the ambience of politics in Nigeria and other dimensions of life dating back from our independence days to the present day. </p> <p></p> <p>In addition, to reject the existence of this Machiavellian principle is being unrealistic and insincere to the whole assignment. This principle due to its tyrannical and immoral nature has attracted the criticisms of many political thinkers and philosophers. Some spoke against its immoral nature. Marx and Engel in criticizing Machiavellism maintained “the true exponents of Machiavellian policy are those who attempt to paralyze democratic energies at periods of revolutionary charge”[1]. The dangers of this principle compose a threat to the moral foundation of political life in general and Nigeria in particular. It has influenced Nigeria and her leaders and restructured the leadership system. Machiavelli in his advice to the prince opined that the ruler is the one who is only interested in his maintenance of power and achieving whatever he wishes regardless of the means employed, thus the end justifies the means. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3 Statement Of The Problem</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Man in his nature is a political, social and religious being. These three aspects of man plays a very important function in making man what he ought to be. These aspects are complementary in the sense that none supersedes the other in the various endeavours of man. Religion acts as a shield to human conduct and as such promotes morality. This morality is further expressed in the form of virtues. Virtue guides our actions including our socio-political life. Morality has been a thing of concern for many political thinkers and philosophers. Some understand morality as a <i>sine qua non</i> for life. Ekwutosi Cosmas, in his definition of morality states that it is “the rightness and wrongness of the human action”[2].</p> <p></p> <p>The problem of morality constitutes a major part in Machiavelli’s political philosophy. From the ancient times, philosophers had always associated politics with morality. They identified politics in moral tenets. The case of Machiavelli was that of a radical contrast. To this Joseph Omoregbe states, “he writes to remove morality if they want to be successful politicians or rulers”. There is no space and consideration for morality. Machiavelli from the start disposed his readers that “straightforward efforts to master and apply the tenets of traditional rules will not produce an effective ruler. Politics must have its own rules”[3]. A look on the views of other philosophers will show the place they assign to morality in political life. For Socrates human actions are associated with morality. Thus, he opines, “to know the good is to do the good. Knowledge is virtue[4]”. He equated knowledge with virtue and maintained that to have the knowledge of a virtue is to have virtue. Plato in his moral philosophy states, “Virtue means knowledge, a true knowledge of the true consequences of all acts”[5]. Plato follows Socrates in maintaining that the goal of human life is happiness and that the only road that leads to it is through a virtuous life.</p> <p></p> <p>In addition, Aristotle’s theory of morality centers on his belief that people, as everything else in nature has a distinctive ‘end’ to achieve. He begins his Nicomachean Ethics by saying that “every art and every inquiry and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good. If this is so the question for ethics is, what is the good at which human behaviour aims?”[6] Happiness is the end that is sought for its own sake. For St. Augustine once morality is taken away from government it ceases to exist. Justice is essential to any government. Hence he states, “Without concord there is no city; but without justice there is no concord. Consequently justice is the first condition required for the existence of the city”[7].  The basic problem in Machiavellian principle is the rejection of morality. There was no place for justice, peace and fairness. Machiavelli’s popular maxim that ‘the end justifies the means’ is an attack on ethical principles. Where will morality be if we glory in the end that we make possible through fair and foul means? If we accept this, then on which ground shall we stand to condemn some immoral acts perpetrated by people? What shall we say about leaders and politicians who ascend leadership positions through questionable ways and yet succeed in improving the standard of living in their countries? There are people who have followed this path, the likes of Jerry Rawlings of Ghana who assassinated the past leaders in order to bring sanity into the political arena of Ghana. What of Nigeria whose present condition has been a deplorable one? It does seem that there is little or no morally approved means of survival for the common man. </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4    Methodology</b></p> <p>The method of my research will be highly critical and expository which will aim at analyzing the principles of Machiavelli and the principle of democracy. I will juxtapose Machiavellian principles with the practice of democracy in Nigeria. I will limit my research on democracy in Nigeria running through the three republics it has witnessed. Also a cursory look at democracy and the factors that hinder its workability in Nigeria will be taken.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5 Literature Review</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Here a review of the theories of some other political thinkers will be made. We shall examine all the periods.</p> <p></p> <p>In the ancient period, Plato’s theory of the state is an idealist theory. For him the polis[8], the state should reflect the ideally ordered polity which exists in the mind or in the world of ideas. The ideal state must be a just state. The state originates because the individual is not self-sufficient and has many needs. In order to satisfy these needs the state is formed. </p> <p></p> <p>For Aristotle, “the state is the highest form of association, most sovereign, embracing all others and therefore aims at the most sovereign of all good. It is political ‘<i>he koinonia politike’</i> - the communion of life in the form of state”[9]. The state is the summit of all human associations and activities providing for all man’s needs. Therefore, the states exists by nature since man being a political animal can best secure the good of life and fulfil his needs together with other men in the state. The virtue of justice is a feature of a state; because justice is the arrangement of the political association. Distributive justice promotes political obligation, unity between citizens and the state.</p> <p></p> <p>Thus it “involves treating equals equally”[10]. Aristotle in discussing the components of the state defends slavery. The ideal form of government for him is Aristocracy. For Cicero, “the state belongs to the people, a people being association of a good number of persons based on justice and partnership to secure common good”[11]. He advocates that the natural law of reason is the basis of all other laws and that its source is Divine Wisdom and Reason, which directs the entire universe. All other rules draw their power and inspiration from the authority of God who directs all things. He sees justice as a necessity for order in the state. </p> <p></p> <p>The medieval period witnessed many political theorists who propounded their theories on what constitutes the state and how the state is to be administered. Augustine in his doctrine of the two cities presents the ‘city of God’-the heavenly kingdom against the earthly kingdom, which the Roman Empire represents. For him, “the ‘city of God’ is the true society, a universal commonwealth ordained by God at the creation of man”[12]. It transcends all races, class and other kinds of boundaries. The supreme good can only be realized if there is justice in the state.</p> <p> </p> <p>For Thomas Aquinas, the civil society exists by nature. It comes from the nature of man as a social animal. His theory could be analyzed from his treatise on law. Justice holds an important place in his theory. It means for him, “rendering to each one his right[13]”. There are two distinctions of justice, namely particular and general justice. Thomas More advocated for communism and bought platonic idea of the philosopher king. The best and ideal state should “aim at happiness or the pleasure of the entire people and not only that of a few privileged citizens”[14]. He rejected the use of capital punishment. Religion is important in the state and those that are not religious should not be given leadership ranks. Thus he says, “but those who denied God’s existence and providence, the immortality of the soul and sanctions in the future would be deprived the capacity to hold public office and accounted as less than men.”[15] He associated morality with politics.</p> <p></p> <p>Another theorist, Jean Bodin opines “the state is a secondary or derived society, in the sense that it is a lawful government of several households and of their common possessions with sovereign power; but it is a different kind of society”[16]. The natural social unit from which the state arises is the family. Political order must be observed because it is the supreme need of man. The supreme power of the state is vested on the absolute sovereign. He has no right to disregard the divine authority or the natural law. Thus “the sovereign is unrestrained by law and he cannot limit his sovereignty by law, so long as he remains sovereign, for law is the creation of the sovereign”[17]. The sovereign is the supreme creator of the law and has ultimate and full control over legislation. </p> <p></p> <p>It was in the renaissance period that Machiavelli flourished. With his works, the Prince and the Discourses, he became the first political theorist to present the state as a political structure to be described on its own. In his political theory, “Machiavelli deviates from the medieval teachings on the end of man by contending that the end of man is solely earthly and not heavenly”[18].For him there is no divine law. </p> <p></p> <p>The modern period theorists also contributed immensely to the development of politics. Thomas Hobbes holds that man originally existed in “a condition of natural warfare-a state of <i>homo homini lupus</i>, a condition in which man is a wolf to man”[19]. In the state of nature there is no morality, no law, no right or wrong. People then enter into bond or contract to establish peace and overcome the condition of the survival of the fittest. The social contract or commonwealth is the state where the people give up their right of self-government and establish a ‘unity’. John Locke holds the same view. The state of nature is the state of perfect freedom and equality. Men enter into social contract in order to form a political society to avoid the inconveniences that characterize the state of nature. Here through labor one acquires private property. Thus “he hath mixed his labor with (nature) and joined to it something that is his own”[20].</p> <p>                                            </p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] Q.

In the whole world man is the only being that is condemned by its nature to be free as well as to be religious. So by nature man is endowed with the power of the will just as he is equally endowed with religious tendency.</p> <p></p> <p>Freewill in the simplest term means the freedom to make choice. Moreover, man in his own very nature cannot extricate himself from the bondage of making choice. In the same vein man is equally held bound by religious tie, so man cannot but be religious. For man to choose otherwise, is already a choice of its own and a religion of its own. That is why I maintain that man is condemned to be free and equally religious. No wonder Jean Paul Sartre asserts. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I am condemned to be free. This means no limit to my freedom can be found except freedom itself, or if you prefer, that we are not free to cease being free. 2</p> <p></p> <p>It seems unthinkable to imagine a world without freewill, that type of world should be devoid of punishment and reward. This is because in such a deterministic world, what ought to be will come to be, at the time it was destined to be, and through the agent it was destined to come through.  </p> <p></p> <p>However this freedom man enjoys is not unconnected to the very fact that man is the only being endowed with a conscious thinking faculty. Ekwutosi has this to say: \"that human act is the result of a complex process in which the decisive point is the will after a deliberation of the intellect…….. Specifically human action possesses the following constitutive qualities knowledge, voluntary/freedom. 3</p> <p>This question of freewill is ontological to man. To talk of man without freewill, is to create a different kind of being which cannot occupy the “status quo” of man. So it is a <i>contradictio in</i> <i>terminis </i>to talk of man without freewill. No wonder the issue of freedom was given a prime position in the constitution of United States of America. In the first ten amendments known together as the bill of rights, it clearly stipulates such basic rights as the freedom of speech, of religion and of press. Deleuze said that: The doom of Europe is predicted because with the death of God and religion from their life and culture, a period of instability, aimlessness, emptiness and darkness sets in4.This goes to underscore the importance and inevitable role of religion in human life. No wonder Omoregbe asserts that:  </p> <p>religion is such a sticking and interesting phenomena to human life that it cannot be ignored even by sceptics, agnostics or the atheists. There is no phenomenon which moulds and controls man’s life as much as religion does. Men have given up not only their life but even their possessions for their religious beliefs- -- -- thus religion has such a powerful grip on man that it cannot be ignored in human society5</p> <p></p> <p>Here we are not going to give a detailed account of freewill and religion, but will do so in subsequent chapters. So let us have an insight into William James view.   </p> <p></p> <p>William James was a New York born pragmatic philosopher. He started from physiology to psychology and finally to philosophy. However, just like other philosophers did not philosophize in isolation; his contemporaries include: Charles Sanders Pierce and John Dewey. They are known as classical pragmatists. Moreover, we may not be able to understand William James unless we are at home with his pragmatic theory, which serves as a gate way to all other of his philosophy. </p> <p></p> <p>This word <i>pragmatism</i> has a rich evolution; Pierce derived the word from Kant’s usage of German word “pragmatisch”. He then applied it to an empirical condition which was founded by three American philosophers Charles Sanders Pierce, William James and John Dewey. Three of them fought to save philosophy from metaphysical idealism, and equally save religious and moral ideals from empiricist, positivist scepticism. However, the three classical pragmatists had very different philosophical concerns, though they still share one foundation, and that is pragmatism. This their pragmatic theory manifested in every of their philosophical endeavour, that is why James who was more interested in religion said  that a belief in God is at least practically verified if it provides comfort to the believer, the satisfactory  consequence of holding the belief as well as of the proposition believed are to constitute verification6</p> <p></p> <p>Pragmatism concerns itself with purposeful action and the interplay of theory and practice. It stresses on what James called <i>cash value</i> <i>of beliefs.</i> In all, pragmatism can be defined as: a philosophy that attempts to apply the methods of science to philosophy, its central idea is that the meaning and truth of an idea are determined by the idea’s effect in practice and conduct.7</p> <p></p> <p>Having gathered some indebt knowledge to what I am going to examine, let me then stipulate the pattern the long essay will take. This work is composed of four major chapters. The chapter one includes the following; Introduction, statement of problem, purpose of studies, scope of study and methodology. Chapter two will be applied in exposing the nature and notion of religion and freewill, their origin, their characteristic features and their functions. The third chapter will be a critical analysis of the religious experience, Mystical experience as a base for belief about God, problem of religious experience, William James pragmatic religious experience, and William James pragmatic verdict. Having gone thus far, the chapter four will be a critical evaluation and conclusion.     </p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>I have come to find out through history that almost all the wars and rancor that ravage the world have either economic or religious motive. Casting a look back to the Roman Empire, we will observe that most of the wars they fought had a religious motive. The last straw that broke the Camel’s back was; </p> <p>The fall of Roman Empire in 476 ushered in a period of intellectual darkness. The barbarians who destroyed the political might of Rome also shattered the institutions of culture in Western Europe. Learning came almost to a halt.8</p> <p></p> <p>The Romans’ and the Barbarians were of different antagonistic religious background. So In the medieval period the Barbarians ravaged Rome and made away with almost the whole body of ancient literature. The Barbarians signifies the Muslim world while Europe signifies the Christian world. Even the September, 11th 2001 suicide bombing that destroyed the world Trade Centre has evidences of religious bigotry. Thus Bush in his speech after the attack said that the enemy tries to hide behind a peaceful faith.9</p> <p></p> <p>Narrowing it down to Nigerian experience, Nigeria has Muslim and Christian religions. The country has experienced series of rancours, some times it is described as tribal wars. But a critical observer will understand that it has a lot of religious sentiments attached to it. This is because churches will always be burnt at each squabble. This tussle is not just among different religions but it is equally present among different denominations of one religion. As a result of this many families are put asunder. It seems absurd that it is in the name of this same religion, which is meant to be an avenue of peace that human beings kill one another. One race bracing up to wipe another from the face of earth.</p> <p>Having said this, the problematic and perplexing question remains: how free is one to practice his religious beliefs without undue molestations from other religious sects? Is there any need for religious tolerance? The onerous task of this research is to proffer a lasting panacea to the problems raised above. In the course of this analysis we shall have recourse to the thought of William James as a guide.</p> <p></p> <p><b>PURPOSE OF STUDIES </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>What beats my imagination is that man is a being that enjoys freedom of choice, yet this same man will like to coerce  his fellow man to do something contrary to his own will . This particular problem rears its head most in the religious circle. This problem amounts to some of the religions regarding others as different warring camp, so they are opponents and not brothers thus they relate to them as such. In this long essay there is equally a complete x-ray on that which motivates people to glory in turning religion which suppose to be an avenue of family, nation and even world peace to a channel of war and turmoil. However I am not trying to advocate that people should adopt a private and diverse believing attitude, within and in the same religious matter and of the same religious sect. Rather I am trying to justify the right and freedom of different religious sects to adopt a private believing attitude in their religious matters. Not withstanding that our merely logical intellect may not have been coerced. </p> <p></p> <p>At the end, I hope I will be able to stipulate the code that will help people of different religions to understand each other better. Thereby eliminating all the unnecessary antagonism operating among people of different religions. In order for them to see each other as children of the same father heading towards a particular destiny. Though William James theory on freewill and religion will serve as a guide as I make this analysis. <b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>SCOPE OF STUDY </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>There is no doubt that the field of religion and freewill is a very vast one. However I am concerned with the exposition of the contribution of William James on the issue of religion and freewill. But I will borrow relevant ideas from philosophers whose works are within the confines of religion and freewill. After which I will make my analysis by a way of evaluation and conclusion. </p> <p></p> <p><b>METHODOLOGY </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The approach I am employing in this long essay is that of critical exposition, and evaluation. Moreover, the deep attitude of thinking and rational scrutiny employed in carrying out this task, will make itself evident in the assessment of religion and freewill.

It is rather remarkable at this time there seem to be little incentive for patriotic concerns since the state had neglected to play its part on the unwritten social contract with its citizens. Achebe captures the scene very aptly, “when two Nigerians meet, their conversation will sooner or later slide into a litany of our national deficiencies.”[1]</p> <p></p> <p>These national woes range from the alarming state of governmental maladministration to the executive mismanagement of the supreme powers of the state. Its effects include incessant nation-wide confusion, political instability, and social unrests seriously endangering life and property. The irony however is that these social evils that are man-made are perceived by some people to be Divine ordinances or as an aspect of man’s essence which cannot be ameliorated.</p> <p>The root cause of this general prevailing decadence in our society is the poverty of ideology. The prevalent ideology is reflected in the untoward practices of the leadership, which has filtered into the entire sphere of society’s life. Thus, our moral sensibilities have been inverted.</p> <p></p> <p>The tall order facing us if we mean to regenerate our fatherland is “to evolve a new political culture,”[2] through re-examining the alien ideology “imposed on us as a super structure by the colonial whites”[3] with our indigenous ideology to form a social matrix, what Zik calls Neo-welfarism. I see this event as a historical necessity. So that we recover from our state of complete inertia, when confronted with issues threatening our corporate existence and destiny. </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Nigeria is a country blessed with enough material and human wealth to satisfy its citizenry. However due to inadequate ideological orientation, she is nowhere near the echelon of developed states. Though independent, she still moans under the burden of under development. Politically, she is the bedrock of instability as leaders want to perpetuate themselves in office. Economically, she is not better off as occasioned by the low standard of living of its citizens. In the technological circle, she could best be described as rich abroad while poor at home. </p> <p></p> <p>These and many more tend to undermine the image of the Nigerian personality globally. As no human society can thrive without an ideology of its own rooted in its culture and past, Nigeria must look inwards. There is an urgent need for a socio-economic system rooted in Nigerian culture and manifesting Nigerian qualities which are “democratic according to her institutions, welfarist in her economical background, altruistic in sociological life and religiously animistic.”[4]The socio-economic system that encompasses these qualities should be adopted to alleviate the basic problems facing Nigeria. These positive visions will be considered in the light of Zik’s Neo-welfarism.  </p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.3     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Men in various epochs have devised different socio-economic systems to attain the ideal, and actualize the objectives of the state, which is the material and social well being of the individual. These systems are adopted depending on their suitability and adaptability to the particular people and environment.                                   </p> <p>In this light, we shall turn our searchlight on the system that will be best adapted to the Nigerian situation. This system as it were will proffer solutions to the perennial problems of Nigeria that have defied logic with a view to restoring human dignity. This is paramount for we need more than just the nebulous idea called democracy. To get to the El dorado, “we must go beyond democracy and define in ideological terms the new society we envision and which our people are daily craving for.” [5] Neo-welfarism will take us there.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The significance of the research is to establish the fact that Zik’s neo-welfarism is an invaluable contribution towards the development of an enduring political culture, good governance, and socio-economic enhancement of Nigeria. It is most pertinent at this period Nigeria is at the crossroads, groping for political stability, national unity, economic reconstruction for a new social order, to heed the advice of Ibrahim Babangida, Nigeria’s former President  to social scientists. He admonished them to devote more time to the study of the input of great Nigerians like Zik, describing him as a scholar, a states man and a “beacon to serve as reference point from which we take off in our search for a durable political and economic system.”[6]</p> <p></p> <p>Furthermore, the research shows that his theory of neo-welfarism is the product of a combination of his ingenuity in harmonizing opposites, with the environmental circumstances and the socio-political climate of his life and time. This is in accord with the views of the famous British Philosopher, Bethrand Russell;</p> <p>Philosophers are both effects and causes: effects of their social circumstances and of the politics and institutions of their time; causes,( if they are fortunate) of beliefs  which mould the politics and institutions of later age.[7]</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5     SCOPE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The research does not over labour itself with discussing various socio-economic systems obtainable in all countries, to locate the best option for Nigeria. It is rather focused on Neo-welfarism with little insights into Capitalism, Socialism and Welfarism. This insight will take a form of critique.</p> <p></p> <p>The work will critically analyze these above-mentioned socio-economic systems giving their merits and demerits and, stating why each is not suitable for Nigeria when taken alone. Neo-welfaism will be equally analyzed bringing out its basic features and the reasons why it is the most viable option for the Nigerian state.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.6      METHOD OF THE RESEARCH</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Due to the nature of the work, which is historical as it is explorative, it becomes paramount to employ the methods of exposition, analysis and critique. The expository method will help us know the nature, origin, and history of the three major socio-economic systems: capitalism, socialism and welfarism. That of analysis will tell us the difference among these economic systems not excluding their merits and short comings, whereas critical appraisal will help us re-assess the various political systems to locate the most suitable one for Nigeria to aid her socio-economic enhancement.</p> <p>The key concept here is neo-welfarism. This concept is not merely abstract, but has a place in the practical human society. Neo-welfarism has much relevance in the socio- political and economic life of man. By this fact, effort will be made to practically apply the principles of neo-welfarism for the growth and development of our Nigerian society.</p> <p></p> <p>With the above background therefore, the work is divided into five chapters. Chapter one is introduction. Chapter two is the literature review where the independent struggles in Africa together with the three major socio-economic systems of capitalism; socialism and welfarism will be discussed, exposing their strong and weak points. This launches us into chapter three which out lines the intellectual and cultural foundations that made Zik opt for neo-wlfarism, since no one speaks from nowhere. Chapter four will see us vividly describing the socio-economic system of neo-welfarism as a veritable Nigerian ideology, giving the reasons for this postulation. While chapter five, is the critical evaluation and conclusion.        </p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] C. Achebe, <b>The Trouble with Nigeria</b> (Enugu: Fourth Dimension Publishing Co.

As a result, one starts to hear, see and touch things about God very early in life. In the market, on the road, even in drinking houses you see and hear people talk about God. Even when you are in your house a loud speaker is at your window telling you about God. </p> <p>          As a child, and a Christian, you look at a corner of your sitting room and see an altar set up by your parents for the worship of God. Every morning you are disturbed from an early morning dose of sleep in order to say the morning prayers. In the school, before you settle for studies, you are confronted with a session of prayers.</p> <p>          These are what we call religious encounters, the conscious assimilation of which becomes our experience – religious experience. We start having these experiences very early in life, and as we grow up we internalize the one that appealed to us. This will be our religious affiliation. But the question rests on the possibility and texture or quality of this experience. Its all about whether these encounters are necessarily qualified to be called an experience and how we can come to that. Is religious experience possible? How do we encounter God? Can we encounter God directly with or without the religious experiences? What is the nature of the Nigerian religious experience? Is it possible to encounter God in the country’s religious atmosphere? What are the factors that underlie the Nigerians’ religious attitude? These questions summarize what we shall discuss in this essay.</p> <p>          Andre Godin, in his book, <i>The Psychological Dynamics Of Religious Experience</i>, gave a psychological insight to these issues. He pointed out the different aspects and dynamics of religious experience. In a very profound manner, he tried to show how they could lead one to or away from the profound reality of the individual which he referred to as the experience of God.</p> <p>          Mine is a philosophical exposition of this view, in relation to the religious experience in Nigeria (particularly Christian). Bringing out its relevance to Christians here in Nigeria, I will then make a leap, in a way of remark, to the way forward - from functional religion to the experience of God.</p> <p>          The first chapter is the introduction. The second chapter examines the notion and dynamics of religious experience, as was posited by Andre Godin. Chapter three is devoted to a philosophical analysis of the Nigerian religious experience (Christian perspective), in relation to the ideas of Andre Godin. Chapter four is an effort to reconcile the experience of God with the end of religion. In this chapter also we shall evaluate the whole essay.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.1     Statement Of The Problem</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>          The word “experience” is very diversified. Often times we hear people talk about their religious experiences. And as each day passes we encounter people with one or more experiences, which can qualify to be called religious.</p> <p>          From the sharing in the public transports, market places, to the activities at the revival and crusade grounds, people have stories to tell about their experiences. Most times, these issues are made more confusing and complicated by the outward signs and changes (both physical and psychological) the persons exhibit. A “rough” man who had been a drunkard and a smoker now appears more sober and responsible. A girl who had been reckless and wayward suddenly becomes more modest and “religious”.</p> <p>          Consequently, one begins to wonder what these changes are all about. The questions now would be, “what brought about these changes?” what are they for? What motivated these people or what still motivates them?</p> <p>          It may be a motivation born out of a desire to see a wish fulfilled (functional religion), or a longing to meet, to encounter the otherness of God (experience of God). Then what could be said of the Nigerian Christian community with regards to this?</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2     Purpose Of The Study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>          The fact of the existence of religion is so obvious that any rational being can hardly ignore it. Its effects in the society are so conspicuous that it becomes odd and irrational to question its pervading presence. History is replete with the impact of religion in the life of people and the society at large. This fact is reiterated by Omoregbe when he affirmed that, “there is no other phenomenon which moulds and controls man’s life as much as religion does.”[2] It has both sociological and psychological implications such that religious belief can have such a firm grip on people’s life as to impart a permanent change on them.</p> <p>          This is what Godin took up and explored. In his book <i>The Dynamics Of Religious Experience</i>, he tried to bring out clearly, from a psychological point of view, the motive behind those impacts and changes, which religion could have on people’s lives. </p> <p>The concern of this study is to examine the dynamics of religious experience as posited by Andre Godin. Then we take a look at the nature of the Nigerian Christian religious experience so as to see how it can enhance the worship of God by Christians in Nigeria.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3     Scope Of The Study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>          Having said already that the concern of this essay is an examination of the Nigerian religious experience in relation to Andre Godin’s ideas on religiousExperience, it is pertinent, therefore, that we limit ourselves to Andre Godin’s view of religious experience and some other related, relevant themes. Other authors will be introduced when necessary. </p> <p></p> <p>Method</p> <p>The first and major method we shall adopt in this work is expository. In the second chapter, we shall use it to explore Godin’s view on religious experience. This will help in a comprehensive understanding of his argument. Then again, we shall as well employ it in the third chapter to view the dynamics and nature of the Nigerian Christian religious experience.</p> <p>Secondly, we shall adopt the method of critical analysis. This we shall use in the last chapter to make a philosophical evaluation and justification of the ideas presented in the course of the work.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] A.

Parents in larger proportion owe to the society and indeed to mankind, the duty of raising up their children properly, because members of society work mutually to promote its progress and so safeguard the common good.1  Proper raising up of children is a way of maintaining the continued existence or preservation of human species.  As a result of this, proper attention should be paid towards it, lest humankind is extinct. </p> <p></p> <p>The task of raising children in my own view is the greatest responsibility on earth, and therefore, should not be left for the parents alone.  It should be a joint project that includes every person. In Igbo culture, child is referred to as ‘Our child’ – ‘Nwa anyi’, ‘Nwa ora’, and meaning community child.  Therefore, child up bringing is neither the sole responsibility of the parents, the maids, nannies, nor the school teachers.  Rather, it is a collective affair, since the child is: ‘Nwa ora’ – community child”2. In Igbo society, as well as in African communities, the birth of a child brings joy and celebration to the community.  This celebration is community-based, not family-based.  This shows that not only the immediate family of a child that thinks good of the child, the community as well thinks.  Community, together with the parents preserves itself from extinction through importing good moral values, cultures and ethos into the child who will in turn do same to his/her on-coming progeny. </p> <p></p> <p>In searching deep into the dimensions of this topic, we shall do so under five chapters. Chapter one will treat the statement of the problem, the scope of the study, the purpose of the study and the significance of this research.  Chapter two will concentrate on raising up children in the Igbo traditional society; then chapter three treats puberty rites and formal training of a child in the traditional Igbo society. In chapter four, we deal with raising up children in the contemporary society.  Chapter five takes care of all the deliberations arrived at, in the chapter two, three and four, in the form of juxtaposition.  Then, we summarize and conclude.</p> <p></p> <p>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </p> <p>People are identified through their culture, likewise any nation or people that compromises its culture or ways of life runs the risk of being misplaced with other nationalities.  It is on this line of thought that the researcher envisages the future of some African tribes and nationalities, whose cultures had been adulterated, and cannot be distinctly distinguished from others.  This has been as a result of the contact with the Western-American culture and civilization.</p> <p></p> <p>Frankly speaking, going through Igbo cultures, one would testify to the fact that many of these Igbo cultures are far better than those of the foreign.  At least a review of Igbo traditional way of raising up children will say it all.  But the Igbo people, after many years of colonialism and absorption of the foreign cultures, hook, line and sinker, now arrived at a conclusion with the whites that their ways of life are crude, barbaric and devilish.  They (the Igbos) take the white’s cultures as superior, and oblivious of the truism that as environment and climate differ, so also do people and their culture differ.  The culture one people cherishes, may not be cherished by the other.  Both the Igbo traditional way of raising up children and the contemporary forms are good, but there should be a boundary where the influence of each on the other will stop.</p> <p> </p> <p>1.3     SCOPE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>This research will cover all Igbo speaking regions, the people who share a common language known as ‘Igbo’ and a common culture known as ‘omenala’.  These two features distinguish the Igbos from any other ethnic group in Nigeria.  The Igbos, occupy an area of some 15, 800 square miles and are found between latitudes 5 to 7 degrees north and longitudes 6 to 8 degrees east.  They lie in the tropics and as such have a tropical type of climate3</p> <p></p> <p>In 1982, the population of Igbo people was about 10.13 million people and they occupy the heart of southeast Nigeria, though some can also be found in the south like in Rivers, Etche, Asaba and Agbor.  In this study, we shall approximately articulate the views of all these people on child upbringing in Igbo traditional way, and compare them with those of the present society.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>1.4     THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>The emergence of Western cum American cultures had brought a great change in the cultures of the Africans especially the Igbos.  These Western and American ways of life have permeated all the nooks and crannies of Igbo culture and ways of life.  The Igbos are now ‘copy cats’.  In this project therefore, we are using the method of raising up children as a case study.  Through this, we will be able to evaluate the Igbo traditional method and the contemporary. </p> <p></p> <p>The culture of the Igbo is in the crossroad.  They (Igbo) take themselves as inferiors to the white in all things.  They now dress, laugh, speak, and train their children like the whites do.  The women neither breast-feed their children, carry them on their back, sleep with their children nor inculcate in their children those ethoses which Igbos are known for.  These corrosion and erosion of Igbo culture and tradition have made it completely difficult to distinguish Igbo culture from the White culture.  The Igbos have lost their culture and are in a social mess.  They are not truly Igbos; they are not truly Whites. In this regard therefore, something must be done and quickly too, to revive the bastardized old Igbo culture and the tradition of the Igbo nation, especially as they pertain raising up children. </p> <p></p> <p>1.5     THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>The findings of this study will go a long way into enhancing the life of mankind as it involves imbibing other people’s cultures, just as the Africans especifically the Igbo people had done.  This will make the Igbos to cherish with jealousy, their traditional culture and thereby stop imitating the White in all areas.</p> <p></p> <p>The government in its policy and adjustment to foreign cultures will then consider the culture of the individual nations under its jurisdiction, and this will open the eyes of the government concerning the positive sides of the peoples’ traditional culture.  The church in her campaign for ecumenism will equally know how to mediate with peoples’ ways of life and the Church teachings.  It will equally juxtapose and strike a balance between Igbo traditional culture and the contemporary from the stand point of raising up children. </p> <div><br/><div> <p>1   S.C.

Not only did it witness the emergence of many vigorous thinkers, but it also shifted the attention of philosophy from the cosmos (ancient period) and God (medieval period) to the appreciation of man as both the terminus a quo and the terminus ad quem of all reality. In a splendid way, the philosophies of the German idealist, Hegel and the materialist, Feuerbach respectively contributed to the shaping of the philosophical views of another great thinker, the founder of Historical Materialism, Karl Marx.</p> <p></p> <p>Hegel formulated the main principle, law and categories of dialectics, showing that ideas develop progressively from lower to higher form and that in the course of such development, there is a transformation of quantity into quality and internal contradiction are the source of development. This view in a special way depicts Marx’s methodology in exclusion of idealism, in place of the cognition and revolutionary transformation of the existing world. In the same vein, Feuerbach’s materialism, which portrayed that philosophy, should study nature and man as a product of protracted development of nature purged out of its metaphysical and contemplative approach, in place of socio-political sphere of human life. Hence, Marx puts man as </p> <p>First of all a natural being…. and a living natural being, who is endowed on one hand with natural powers… these powers exist in him as aptitudes and instincts, on the other hand as an object, natural, physical, dependent and limited being… that is the object of his instincts exists outside him, independent of him, but as for the object of his need, indispensable and essential for the realization and confirmation of his substantial powers[1]. </p> <p></p> <p>                 It is this natural power and its instinctive manifestation in man that explain historical movement in Karl Marx. But a pertinent question arises at this juncture: who is Karl Marx?</p> <p></p> <p>Karl Marx, son of a famous German lawyer of Jewish descent, was born in 1818 in Trier, Germany. Although a Lutheran, he was educated in Catholic schools and at the university of Berlin, where at twenty, he wrote his doctorate thesis on Democritus and Epicurus, under the influence of Hegelian thought. However, the Hegelian triadic or dialectical method suddenly captured his interest and he conceived history as a process of overcoming opposition and at the same time being reconciled to it, incorporating it within its being. He lost focus in Hegelian idealism and opted for a more materialistic and economic interpretation of man and history with the same dialectical method.</p> <p></p> <p>In 1842, he became a journalist for the liberal Rheinische Zeitung and distinguished himself as an erudite and vibrant thinker. Thus, he was described as follows: “he combines the deepest philosophical seriousness with the most biting wit. Imagine Rousseau, Voltaire, Holbach, Lessing, Heine and Hegel fused into one person—I say fused, not juxtaposed—and you have Dr. Marx”2. Marx was married to Jenny Von Westphalen, and later became radically involved in politics, which underlines his emigration to London, where he came in contact with the French socialists Friedrich Engel (1820-1895) who later became his lifelong friend. “Through Engel, Marx gained insight into British economic theory and the economic and social conditions of Britain,”3 which contributed much in his philosophical works. His principal works are “Economic and Philosophical manuscripts” of 1844, “The communist manifesto” (with Friedrich Engels, 1848) and “De Capital”, 3 vols., 1867, 1885,1895. Marx died in 1883.</p> <p></p> <p>In the manuscripts of 1844, he critically observed that under capitalism, the workers (proletariats) are wage-slaves (not free), exploited by the capitalists and as such are alienated beings. This has always been manifested in the relationship between the capitalists and the workers everywhere in Nigeria. Moreso, the researcher wishes to discuss the issue of alienation of labour in Nigeria with inspirations from the Marxian notion of alienation of labour.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.1</b> <b>Statement of Problem</b></p> <p>The philosophy of Karl Marx revolves around one fact this is that matter is the basis of reality. In connection with the economy and thought, Marx posits “economy is based on labour, which specifically is the human activity that puts us in touch with reality”. Therefore, when human being is alienated from labour, the necessary implications include extinction of life, nature, self, relationship and the conception of human being as tool, which in every extent remain unjust and unnatural.</p> <p>It is incontestable that the foregoing situations abound in the existential world. In Nigeria, the situation is heart-rending. The relationship between the Capitalists and the Labourers is anything but cordial. There is no or at most very low appreciation of labour. This view is substantiated by the ill-treatment of workers, poor payment of salaries or total non-payment, inadequate remuneration, et cetera. Taken the other way round, we see dehumanization of workers in Nigeria both in the private and public sector through the lenses of egoism occasioned by capitalism. The effect of such egoism is not far-fetched.</p> <p></p> <p>Just consider the cases of unemployment! Is it not infuriating to see millions of Nigerians, graduates and trained citizens, of course, denied employment opportunities? Why? Because, those already in office want more fat salaries and better treatment. Hence, there is no need to bring in more workers. The worst of it all is that such selfish individuals do not contribute anything substantial to the growth of the economy. The situation is serious really.</p> <p></p> <p>Ideologically, money takes priority, and man serves labour instead of labour serving man. The value system of both private and government entrepreneur gives no hope at all. Things have fallen apart and the center of the Nigerian economy cannot hold anymore. But what remedy could one proffer to ameliorate this problem? This is the aim of this work. </p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.2 Aim of Study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Having exposed the problems in Nigeria, especially in relation to labour and capital, the researcher wants to exploit the contents of the Marxian theory of the alienation of labour in redressing the situation. Marx anxiously sought for a balance in the economic benefits of the capitalists and the labourers. Hopefull, this equilibrium will be realized in the Nigerian situation.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.3 Scope of Study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The Marxian historical materialism “assigned to the substructure, to the material order, the supreme significance in the dialectic process of history”4. As such the researcher, thereby, restricts himself to the relationship between the labour and capital. This relationship is not one of cordiality. It is rather a relation of alienation, the alienation of labour. He will also extend his research to the meaning of work, obligations of the workers and the implications of the alienation of labour in the Nigerian context. There will be a cursory look into the existing classes, its cause and attendant effects on the economy, then followed by a suggestion of a seemingly workable solution to the situation of workers in Nigeria. </p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4 Methodology</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Method is next nature of any research work. Hence, this work combines expository, deductive, review and evaluative methods. The researcher employs exclusive constructions and use of words that are peculiar to Marx, such as cost value, exchange value, surplus value, et cetera, which describe the relationship between the labour, the wage and the alienation.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.5 Division of Work</b></p> <p>In order to justify the aim and scope of study, this work is divided into five chapters. Chapter one deals with the introductory details of the work    while chapter two describes alienation, its forms and the theory of surplus value. In chapter three, the researcher clearly exposes the situation of Nigerian workers. The significance of alienation of labour in Nigeria context forms the subject of chapter four. Lastly, chapter five critically reviews the Marxian theory of alienation of labour, its merits and demerits and the possible solution to the situation of Nigerian workers. After this comes the conclusion</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.6 LITERATURE REVIEW</b></p> <p>It is a common belief in nature that every existing situation or event has an organic link to something that existed earlier. Hence, there is always a background to any subject under study. </p> <p></p> <p>History has it that Karl Marx, though very famous and influential in his time, could not be identified with a particular philosophical system. Instead, what later emerged, as his philosophical thought was the synthesis of his predecessors’ philosophical thoughts. Perusing through his method, the Hegelian categories of dialectics as detected by scholars was purged out of its idealism. Likewise, Feuerbach’s materialism lost its metaphysics and contemplative approach in place of socio-political struggle and in refutation of idealism and religion.</p> <p></p> <p>This specifically brought the idea of materialism in Karl Marx. Thus,    </p> <p>Marx’s achievement in social and political thought              was based on a transformation and synthesis of two   traditions: German idealism as exemplified in the work of Hegel, and philosophical radicalism as expressed in the materialism of Feuerbach5.</p> <p></p> <p> Nonetheless, such philosophers like Heraclitus, Democritus, Epicurus, Kant, Francis Bacon, Machiavelli, and his father, as a lawyer and intellectual with strong rational inclinations, and of Ludwig Von Westphalia, a distinguished Prussian government official, all had influences on Marx.</p> <p></p> <p>From F. Bacon, Marx was able to see knowledge from the practical perspective, and from Machiavelli; he saw that, “the end justifies the means”. Kant’s ethics, which admonishes that one, should always act in a way that one’s action could be universalized and that human beings should not be used as a means to an end also caught the sight and interest of Marx. From these different philosophical thoughts, Marx was exposed into the psychological and social humps of alienation in labour, which accounts for the historical change.</p> <p>Tracing the historical process of formation in economic factors, according to Karl Marx which have gone through the economic stages, ranging from “primitive communal, slave society, feudal society, and capitalism”, one could assert that Marx’s study of this process of formation of economic factor in various pre-existed epochs that necessitated his view of the classless society (communism) as forthcoming, enormously contributed in the make-up of Marx philosophical thought. Hence, the researcher wishes to view the aspects of the above-mentioned epochs that outstandingly seem very influential in Karl Marx.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.6.1 The Primitive Communal</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This could be described as the first society of men and women, where they convoked as a result of social needs. Here, the factors of production were not sophisticated, but were communally owned. Marx saw this society as next to the communism, though it is too local and primitive.</p> <p></p> <p>The gradual sophistication of means of production and the corresponding surplus product of labour led to the following consequences: </p> <p></p> <p>                    First there appeared a chance to accumulate that product, to stockpile different kinds of material wealth and to re-distribute it. This produced an economic basis for inequality…Secondly, exploitation, that is, the appropriation of products of one man’s labour by another becomes also possible.6</p> <p></p> <p>So, with the accumulation of wealth and exploitation, struggle became possible, leading to another stage—slave society.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.6.2 Slave Society</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>During wars, the conquest kills their enemies and captives. As time went on, captives were no longer killed but subjected to slave labour, by their warlords. This eventually gave rise to private ownership of property. This is because slaves enriched their owners through their labour. This led to the ever greater material inequality, to the extent that the rich tribal lords eventually began turning into slaves, both prisoners of war and impoverished fellow tribesmen and women taken to debt servitude. This was done for material acquisition.</p> <p></p> <p>With every epoch containing the seed of its own destruction, the slave society crumbled as a result of slaves not being allowed to own properties. This made them develop little or no zeal for work, and as a result of this, there arose conflict of interests between the slaves and the slave-owners. This led to a more progressive system—Feudalism or Feudal system.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.6.3 The Feudal System</b></p> <p>Here, the feudal lords receive land from the kings and Tzars in return for various services rendered. Sequel to this, other member servants, depended on the feudal lords, (semi-military commanders) for their own survival. But here, there was little division of labour, and the feudal lords having direct power over other servants (peasants), had to force them to work for themselves. As a result of this, there came a conflict between them, leading the historical movement to the next stage—the Capitalist society.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.6.4 The Capitalist Society</b></p> <p>The capitalist society was more progressive when compared to the previous societies. This epoch of history was characterized by invention of machines and population migration from their local homes to large industrial cities to search for work.</p> <p></p> <p>Here, workers are distinguished from owners of the means of production. For workers to exist, they sell their labour power for wages. Men and women are no longer associated with their produce. The product of their labour goes to the owners of the means of production. Consequently, workers are alienated from themselves and their labour, because what they produce no longer belong to them, but belong to the owners of the means of production, which amasses wealth for the sake of amassing wealth.</p> <p></p> <p>As a result of these, the society is sharply divided into the rich owners, and the poor workers, and Marx describe them as the “bourgeoisie” and the “proletariats” respectively. Here, the war and class struggle intensified, more than the previous societies. Marx, who saw contradictions in the society, envisaged the abolition of capitalism. For him, capitalism will give way to more progressive, liberal stage—communism or classless society.</p> <p></p> <p>Following Marx’s view, one tends to question the extent his parlances on the condition of labour in the capitalist state could be helpful to the contemporary labourers, especially as it concerns the present situation of the Nigerian workers.</p> <p></p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] P.

They have varied opinions as regards the solution to this problem. The conventionalists and contractualists hold that the state originated out of convention or contract between individuals or groups.  </p> <p></p> <p> However, Aristotle a master in ancient philosophical thought, whose influence has always rocked the philosophical defense of his contemporaries and successors, has it that the state is natural to man. Also, his refutation of the conventionalist’s notion of the state led him to redefine the state as an association of communities made up of citizens with the aim of achieving the highest common good.  Having defined the state thus, he sets himself the task of investigating the activities of the state in order to find out its end and goal; to find out who and who are qualified to be citizens of the state; and if all the members of the state are qualified to enjoy the basic individual rights in the state.</p> <p></p> <p>It is in this context that he brought in the issue of justice as the central point on which the activities of the state revolves.  Hence, I found it appropriate to treat as my project topic “Justice and its primacy in the political philosophy of Aristotle.”  As the political philosophy of Aristotle is concerned mainly with the governmental order of the state, we shall be using the word ‘state’ more frequent in this work.</p> <p></p> <p>Furthermore, this work shall be divided into four chapters.  Chapter one will deal with the meaning and notion of state and justice respectively, with special reference to Aristotle.  Chapter two will deal with the application of justice in the state.  Since man is naturally born in the state, there is the necessity for harmonious relationship between members of the state.  This harmonious co-existence can only be achieved through the application of justice in the state.</p> <p></p> <p>However, in different political organization, there are different constitutions applied.   Nevertheless, the application of justice lies in the governing principles of the constitution of that particular state.  Justice therefore always implies “Justice for whom.”  Here Aristotle seems to make justice relative.  However, he holds that though justice is often determined by a particular circumstance, there is on the whole a particular justice which other relative justice of different constitutions must square up to.  This is the absolute justice; that which justifies any constitution.  But since it aims towards the common good, it is guided by law and morality. Chapter three will concern itself with justice vis-à-vis revolution in the state.  Here we shall look into the consequence of the absence of justice in the state.  And if justice is necessary for the stability of any political organization, how do we restore it?  Moreover, since the problem of political stability depends on good rulership, it follows that present and future leaders must be educated and trained on the acquisition and practice of justice.  Hence the relevance of education and political awareness towards upholding justice and stability of government in the state. Finally, we shall end the work with chapter four which will deal with evaluation and conclusion of all that has been said.</p> <p></p> <p></p>\n\nJUSTICE AND ITS PRIMACY IN THE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF ARISTOTLE <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " JUSTICE AND ITS PRIMACY IN THE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF ARISTOTLE ", "id": 85}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><b>THE MORAL DECADENCE IN NIETZSCHE’S </b><b>PHILOSOPHICAL WRITINGS</b></p> <p></p> <p><b>(</b><b>A Critical Approach</b><b>)</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>THE NOTION OF MORALITY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1     The Exact Definition of Morality</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>In making moral choices, the morality of one’s actions does not depend entirely on the sincerity of the intention or the evaluation of the motives, but it must be determined according to objective criteria drawn from the nature of the person and his acts. – Pope John Paul II to a medical-Moral Workshop, January 20, 1990.</p> <p></p> <p>Morality in the strictest sense of the word, deals with that which is innately regarded as right or wrong. This notion of morality is a known system of principles and judgements shared by cultural, religious, and philosophical concepts and beliefs, by which humans’ subjectivity determines whether a given actions are right or wrong. Through these concepts and beliefs, the society or group guides its members and regulate their behaviours. It can be descriptively refer to a code of conduct put forward by a society, or some other group, such as a religion, or accepted by an individual for her own behaviour. Normatively, it refers to a code of conduct that would be put forward by all rational persons under specified conditions.</p> <p></p> <p>There are certain actions which all of us would condemn as morally wrong and ought not to be done by anybody. For example, armed robbery, embezzlement of public funds, bribery and corruption, neglect of one’s duties, dishonesty, and so on. In the other way, there are also certain actions, which are fidelity to one’s duties, respect for human life, hospitality, kindness, helping those in need, honesty and so on.</p> <p></p> <p>Though according to Frederich Nietzsche, it is not good to refer some of the above listed virtues as right or good rather they are evil and could be seen among the inferior people. He said so in his explanation of master morality and slave morality. Equally, there are other kinds of actions above which opinions differ. Some say it is wrong while others consider it as right. For instance, such actions like abortion, contraception, euthanasia, masturbation and so on. The question of abortion is being morally permissible is a current issue in United States. There are many questions for all of us, why do we consider certain actions as right, and others as wrong? How do we decide which actions are right and which actions are wrong? What is the criterion or standard for making such judgements? What do we even mean when we say that a certain action is morally wrong? Is it for the individual to decide for himself which actions he is to consider as wrong or right? Is it true that “there is nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so, or is certain things good or bad irrespective of our thinking? What are the fundamental principles of morality and how do we come to know them? These and similar questions are what we shall discuss here and equally ask ourselves.</p> <p></p> <p>The definition of morality plays a crucial, although often unacknowledged role in formulating ethical theories. According to R. M. Hare: “The function of moral principles is to guide conduct”1. But to take “morality” to refer to an actually existing code of conduct is quite to lead to some form of relativism. </p> <p>That is, to claim that there is no code of conduct that, under any plausible specified conditions, would be put forward by all rational persons.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2            </b><b>An Overview of Morality</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Morality applies to different fields of studies and in which the choices made by individuals express an interior relative to other individuals (even non-members of the society). It varied greatly from society to society, culture to culture. There is this academic debate, which states whether morality can exist only in the society or in a hypothetical individual without any relationships with others. Also, does morality based only on religion, such that no person without religion can practice morality? The efficacy of a morality depends on the social position and political representatives of the group that espouse it and the way it touches the norms of the related society. Also, a person without religion can still practice morality. Though “some theologians claimed that morality is inseparable from religion”.2 But a lot of moral values came from religion.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3    WHAT MAKES A PERSON TO BE MORAL OR IMMORAL</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.3.1  A choice for Life: </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The decision to be selfish or unselfish is not just a choice of the moment but is a fundamental part of character, as it is one of the first, if not the first, value that is formed by the developing mind of a baby. This is so, because nature delivers the infant with an incomplete set of values along with the ability to request succour. Existence precedes essence, says Sartre. By this he means that man was not created with any fixed essence or nature according to which he must live. On the contrary, human mind is not tabla rasa that is why a child begins to succour when no one teaches him. Therefore, the above infantile demands could be developed towards good or evil depending on his relationship with others. This is because Man is not a finished product, but a self-creating, a being that is continually making himself and giving himself an essence. Example: A mother who makes every other thing secondary to feed her infant is helping to create a selfish monster in the child who will latter assume himself of more paramount importance than any other person, while the mother who enforces a program of feeding that is convenient to the household, is achieving the opposite effect.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3.2 Baby’s Demand Hard To Resist</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Nevertheless, it is not easy to resist the demands of babies, because nature has made adults sensitive to the appearance and sound of infants. Many women have a strong desire to pamper babies, and children enjoy the ready affections; but it is the unrestrained application of such feelings that create immoral humans or selfish people. For unless a baby discovers the need for patience and endurance, the subsequent adult will never accept the need for self-sacrifice, or moral restraint.</p> <p><b>1.3.3   Inevitable Results of Undisciplined Upbringing.</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>These come as a result of parents’ total concern or basic desire to pamper children more than required.</p> <p></p> <p>-                     <b>My feelings are all important:</b> The youthful students can only learn that his feeling is very necessary and the parents will always respond creditably. As a result, they cry and adult’s leap into action to relieve the distress, regardless of the reason for the tears. When they smile, adult smile.</p> <p>-                     <b>How to fool parents:</b> When a child get this trick, a controlling force, then he fakes tears and smiles in order to get the adults reactions to their demands.</p> <p>-                     <b>Disrespect for Authority:</b> When this goes on throughout childhood, the resultant effect is that the child overlooks the authority with its restrictions and laws, as nothing but hot air that can be safely flouted by emotional appeal.</p> <p>-                     <b>Truth is Unimportant: </b>When we allow children to prevent laws and do whatever they like, because we feel so much concern for them. The lesson must be that truth (what actually happened) is unimportant compared to the subsequent emotional reaction of others.<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p>Having seen all these, the decision to be moral or immoral is resolved starting from early childhood even before awareness has properly developed. So, unless unselfishness is removed during infancy by enforcing a code of discipline, the subsequent adults must become selfish, and thus immoral.</p> <p></p> <p>Also, fathers exercise better control than mothers, they invoke fear and enforce discipline in the child and are more difficult to be manipulated through emotional appeal.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4    kinds of Morality </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.4.1 Rational Morality:</b> </p> <p>This is the idea of morality as innate or self-evident, based on reason. Thus, morality is necessarily one of self-interest and looks at man’s nature and the reason; he needs values known as a moral code that must be practiced to reach those values. Rational morality asserts that all other “views” of morality are subjective and require some sort of sacrifice, either to the supernatural (i.e. God) or collective motive, where as proper morality is self-evident and in the interest of the individual’s happiness and self-evident.</p> <p>However, this has been criticized; Churian objectivists are one group that opposes the idea of rational morality. They believed in the fact that without objective standard morality, rationality is simply personal opinion. The human choice to do “right” is guided by values, but the determination of value, an objectivist would argue that it cannot come from reason alone.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4.2 Morality in Judicial Systems </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The government of South Africa is attempting to create a moral Regeneration movement. Part of this is a proposed Bill of morals that will bring biblical based ‘moral code’ into the realm of law. Though this move by nominally secular democracy has attracted relatively little criticism. In judicial systems, the word morality concretely means a requirement for the assessment of certain charges or careers, or for the obtaining of certain licenses or concessions, and generally consists of the absence of previous records, for instance, crimes, political or commercial irregularities.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4.3       </b><b>Morality and Darwinism</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Some evolutionary psychologists have argued that human morality originated from evolutionary processes. As this could be experienced in their innate tendency to develop a sense of right and wrong in a species with complex social interactions, and doctrines. Selected behaviours, seen in abstraction as moral codes are seen to be common to all human cultures, and it reflects in their development and similarities to natural selection. These aspects of morality can be seen as the basis of some religious doctrine. From this, some also argue that there may be a simple Darwinian explanation for the existence of religion. Such that regardless of the validity of religious beliefs, religion tends to encourage behaviour beneficial to the species, as a code of morality tends to encourage communality, and communality tends to assist survival.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4.4       </b><b>Nietzsche’s Morality:</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>He derived the notion that there is a universal and absolute system of morality that everybody must obey. To say this is to disregard the uniqueness of individuals. There are, says Nietzsche a “Twofold early history of good and evil”3, which shows the development of two primary types of morality, namely master morality and slave morality. Nietzsche totally rejects the negative values or virtues of the “slave morality”, as virtues that turn men into weaklings. In other ways, they are evil or morally bad for Nietzsche rather pride, violence, ruthless struggle, ambition, display of power, strength, vitality, egoism, and so on, are the virtues and what is morally good for “master morality”.</p> <p></p> <p>Nietzsche rejects such Christian virtues, which he calls slave morality like humility, meekness, self-denial, prudence, patience, and so on. and this is the point of similarity between him and Machiavellians. He was influenced by Darwin’s evolution theory according to which all living beings have to struggle for existence. </p> <p></p> <p>Finally, morality can be defined in two fold manner; descriptive and Normative. In the descriptive sense; it refers to that code of conduct that is put forward by a society. Though for anthropologists, it does not simply mean that always. In a normative sense, “It is a science that gives rules for acting, especially if these norms have to do with a person’s inner goodness and perfection rather than with making of external objects”4. The only feature that the descriptive and normative senses of “morality” have in common is that they guide our behaviours.</p> <p></p> <p> </p> <div> <p>__________________</p> <p>5. C.

In a situation where freedom and free will are not involved, we do not have a human act but only an act of man or woman. It is easy enough to agree that the act of murder is bad, but just how guilty the murderer is before God is difficult to answer. The objective goodness or badness of an act is one thing; the subjective accountability of the actor is another. </p> <p></p> <p>There are seven particular conditions which may lessen or remove moral responsibility entirely: ignorance, fear, concupiscence, violence, habit, temperament, and nervous mental disorders. Let us examine some of them:</p> <p><b>Ignorance: </b>This is lack of knowledge in a person capable of knowing. We are responsible in some cases for knowledge; in other cases, we are not. There are different types of ignorance;</p> <p></p> <p><b>Vincible Ignorance:</b> is that which can and should be dispelled. It implies culpable negligence, meaning that the person could know and ought to know. There are three main types of vincible ignorance: simple vincible ignorance, affected or studied vincible ignorance and crass vincible ignorance. </p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>Simple Vincible Ignorance:</b> is present when one makes some effort, but not a sufficient effort, to dispel the ignorance. A nurse who is unsure of what dosage of medicine to give to a patient refers to the doctor’s order sheet, but is unable to read his writing. Though the doctor is in the office, she does not bother to call him. In guessing at the dosage to give to the patient, the nurse is guilty of simple vincible ignorance.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Affected Vincible Ignorance:</b> is that which is deliberately fostered in order to avoid any obligation that knowledge might bring to light. For example, a person suspects that it is seriously wrong to absent from Mass deliberately on Sunday, but he makes no effort to find out the truth.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Crass Vincible Ignorance:</b> is that which results from total lack of effort to acquire the lacking knowledge due to laziness. A clerk in a convenience store does not know the price of an article brought to the checkout counter. The owner is in the back of the store, but the clerk does not want to bother the owner to find out the price of the product. So he makes up a price and charges the customer that amount.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Invincible Ignorance:</b> is that which cannot be dispelled either because the individual is unable to secure adequate information, even after a reasonable effort, or because he simply does not know that there is any problem. In other word, he is ignorant of this ignorance. The person cannot be expected to take steps to enlighten himself because he is unaware that he is in need of enlightenment. For example, an employee customarily tells lies by way of making excuses for minor faults and feels that, since they harm no one, they are in no way sinful. He is not aware that he needs enlightenment on this matter. Another individual may be confused in mind about a project, but after having made a reasonable effort to dispel his ignorance, and having failed to do so, he may proceed to act since once a reasonable effort to dispel his ignorance, and having failed to do so, he may proceed to act since once a reasonable effort has been made, the ignorance is invincible. </p> <p>          </p> <p>We may sum up the moral principles concerning ignorance by stating that invincible ignorance eliminates responsibility while vincible ignorance lessens responsibility without actually eliminating it.  </p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>Concupiscence:</b> is a tendency of human nature towards evil. Is equally the rebellion of the passions against reason. There are times when we feel strongly drawn to do something that we know would cause nothing but sorrow and regret to all concerned, even to ourselves, and yet we are strongly tempted to do it. Just like St. Paul said, “I cannot understand even my own actions. I do not do what I want to do but what I hate” (Romans 7:15).under here, we may have love, fear, hatred, joy, grief, desire, aversion, hop, despair, and anger.  </p> <p></p> <p><b>Habit:</b> The voluntary nature of human actions is also affected by habit, which is an inclination to perform some particular action. It is usually acquired by repetition and characterized by a decreased power of resistance and an increased facility of performance. A habit is sometimes called “second nature”, meaning it is deeply ingrained in an individual as a result of constant repetition.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.6     Principles for Judging Morality</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>In judging the morality of a specific action, some fundamental principles must be applied. They include;</p> <p>1.     An act is morally good if the act itself, the purpose of the act, and the circumstances of the act are substantially good. We say “substantially” good because an act may have minor shortcomings or defects and still be a truly good act. A person who declined to steal from an employer out of fear of being caught than because stealing is wrong performs a good act, but not for the best of motives.</p> <p>2.     If an act is intrinsically evil, the act is not morally allowable regardless of purpose or circumstances. Murder, abortion, rape, adultery, racism are always evil. They are never allowed as a solution to a problem, no matter how serious the problem.</p> <p>3.     If an act is itself morally good or at least indifferent, its’ morality will be judged by the purpose or the circumstances. For instance, going to the bank is in itself indifferent. If a person is going to the bank to withdraw his money through legal means, he is doing something good. But, if he is going to the bank to steal money, then he is doing something morally evil.</p> <p>4.     The circumstances may create, mitigate or aggravate sin like studying your book in preparation for examination is good thing, but becoming so engrossed in the book that one neglects to take care of a sick person is morally wrong. </p> <p>5.     There are three moral elements (the act itself, the purpose, and the circumstances) that make an act morally good. If any one element is evil, the act is evil. A child who never does anything wrong except disobeying the teacher, is not a good person.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>1  R. M.

To this, S. U. Togbolo opines, </p> <p>Politics in Nigeria has become an investment where the investors are set to make profit at all cost, as a result, political brutality is pervading the society.[1]</p> <p></p> <p>This is so strong in Nigerian politics to the extent that the godfather is so strong to the extent of having a larger-than-life image in his area of influence. He determines appointments into state executive councils and where necessary, local councils. So this particular posture of the godfather is a new form of business which must attract huge financial returns at the expense of the democratic citizens. This is because the godfathers must be settled from the general coffer. <b><i></i></b></p> <p><b><i></i></b></p><b><i></i></b> <p></p> <p>The relationship that exists between the godfather and godson points to what Aristotle in his Nichomachean ethics on ‘Friendship’ regarded as “unequal friendship.” This type of friendship involves the superiority of one of the parties where each should not expect to receive the same affection as he gives from the other.[2]</p> <p></p> <p>So, this particular relationship of the godfather and the godson requires that whenever the godfather sneezes, the godson catches cold and fever. In fact, the presence of the godfather literally dwarfs the godson. Moreover, to fear him is the beginning of wisdom for the godson.</p> <p></p> <p>Therefore, there must be a guide to check the excesses of the godfathers by instituting constitutional and legal checks on electoral and electioneering procedures that involve money, sponsorship and practices that undermine democracy and art of government. This will help to maintain decency in politics and check against the crisis of Godfatherism.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF ARISTOTLE</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Aristotle was born probably in 384BC at Stageira in Thrace. When he was about the age of 17, he went to Athens to enroll in Plato’s academy and remained there for nearly 20 years, until the death of Plato. It was known also that he had the reputation of being the “reader” and the “mind of the school.”[3]</p> <p></p> <p>He latter left the academy and accepted the invitation of Hermeias to come to Assos, near Troy. There, he was able for three years to write, teach and carryout research. While at Hermeias’ court, he married his niece Pythias who bore him a daughter. They later returned to Athens and his wife died. Aristotle then entered into an illegal relationship with Herpyllis from which he got a son, Nichomachus after whom the Nichomachean Ethics was named.[4]</p> <p></p> <p>In 343BC, Aristotle was invited by Philip of Macedonia to become the tutor of his son, Alexander who was then 13 years old. </p> <p></p> <p>Aristotle lived in Athens from 335-323BC during which he founded his school, Lyceum, and wrote most of his books. At the death of Alexander, the Athenians rebelled against his friends including Aristotle. As Socrates, before he was charged with ‘impiety’, but was reported to have said, “Lest the Athenians should sin twice against philosophy,” left the Lyceum and fled to Chalcis, where he died in 322BC of digestive disease of long standing.[5]</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The problem, which this thesis seeks to address centers on the fact that politics in Nigeria has become an investment where the investors are set to make profit at all cost. It is obvious that the more efforts are being made towards positioning Nigeria as a democratic environment, particularly in the areas of thinking and action, the more the threat of relapse into the malaise of long habits of undemocratic practices.[6]</p> <p></p> <p>Politics of sponsorship or godfatherism is now the order of the day in Nigerian society. There is now what we call owners, managers and players of the state. Due to this fact, individuals aspire to be economically and politically players directing the affairs of the state. Politics is now the celebration of personality where the elites create a godfather zone. In this, a few do not go through the proper democratic procedure before becoming leaders in as much as they believe in the godfathers and remain in their place. </p> <p></p> <p>The problem comes in here when the godfatherism becomes a power struggle between the godfather and godson because of their selfish interest. The godfather at this point comes out to be the monopolist of the values of the outcome of governance and in full control of the state. Thus, S.U Togbolo says,</p> <p>However, the godson having successfully clinched the seat with the support of the godfather quietly wants to sideline the political godfather. This may be, because of over lordship by the godfather wanting to dominate the government, giving directives and controlling the administration.[7]</p> <p></p> <p>So at this, there exists a war between the political godfather and his godson as they contend who should control the state. As we can see, political godfatherism is one of the pandemic that endangers our political environment. The power struggle between the godfather and the godson affects both the development of the state and the citizens. The godson either dances to the tune of the godfather or betrays those who gave him mandate or finds the seat too hot and the state ungovernable if the godfather does not succeed in removing him from office. </p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p> The aim of this research work is to unearth the phenomenon of political godfatherism in Nigeria, its activities, its moral implication and possible ways of curbing it to have a better democratic environment.</p> <p></p> <p>Godfatherism is becoming both a political and social problem. Politics of sponsorship is spreading like a wild fire in Nigeria. We see in the relationship that exists between the godfather and the godson. This appears like true friendship until power struggle, which is caused by their selfish interest, comes in. The relationship between the godfather and the godson is a utility friendship. And as we know in Aristotle’s teaching on friendship that in utility friendship, when that which is useful vanishes, the friendship cease to exist. Thus, he writes,</p> <p>Those whose friendship is based on the useful or on the pleasant dissolve it as soon as it ceases to be advantage, since they were friends not of one another but of what was profitable for them.[8]</p> <p></p> <p>At this, the godfather carries war against the godson. Then, the godson will be distracted in his work and that leaves the state undeveloped. It is indeed a big deal that a single individual who claims to be a godfather should hold the whole state to ransom. The treasury of the state through the godson becomes a client to the godfather. </p> <p></p> <p>In a political environment where an aspirant for government power or a job must accept terms from a would-be-godfather in order to receive support from him for a sure access to power is corruption. Furthermore, we know that there must be a bargain so that the godfather will be fully out to support the godson. We now live with the philosophy of “nothing goes for nothing.” Then, this bargain of the godfather and the godson mortgages the interest of the governed whose mandate the godfather bought over for the godson.</p> <p></p> <p>In this thesis, we have to show how this utility friendship or unequal friendship between the godfather and godson has been a thorn in the flesh of the citizens. It aims at the fact that our so-called leaders and their godfather know that the citizens are entitled to their dividends of democracy since they have invested a lot in it. Our cry is for our leaders to know that the mandate of the citizens is the most important. The godfathers will come and go but the citizens will remain. The leaders as such should invest on the citizens rather than on the godfathers.

Our polity is now an investment where the investors multiply as days go by. It is now a matter of necessity that this research work employs the method of explanatory, expository, evaluation and practical.</p> <p></p> <p>On explanatory aspect, I shall explain lucidly the concepts of friendship more especially that of unequal and the concept of godfatherism in Nigerian politics. While on the side of expository, I shall go  a long way to expose the activities of the godfathers, what seem to be the causes of godfatherism and the love that exist between the godfather and the godson which also seemed like true friendship.</p> <p></p> <p>It will be evaluative, since I am going to evaluate the moral implications of godfatherism and its effect on the people. Finally, it will be practical also since the research work is experiential and deals with observable facts in Nigeria democracy or politics.</p> <p></p> <p>On the other hand, this thesis comprises of four chapters which for the sake of clarity will be divided into two parts. The first part will contain the general introduction featuring the biological sketch of Aristotle, statement of problem, purpose of study, methodology and literature review.<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p></p> <p>The second part will be further divided into two dimensions. Chapters one and two will deal with friendship and godfatherism respectively. Here, I will discuss the concept of friendship, its definitions, types, and unequal friendship. Again, I shall also look at the concept of godfatherism, its origin, definition, activities of godfathers and the causes of godfatherism.</p> <p></p> <p>The chapter three treats unequal friendship of Aristotle and godfatherism in Nigerian politics. Here, we shall see the relationship that exists between the godfather and the godson. Finally, the fourth chapter evaluates the moral implication of godfatherism; guides against it and then conclusion.</p> <p></p> <p><b>LITERATURE REVIEW</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The topic of my research is ‘Unequal Friendship in Aristotle’s Nichomachean ethics Vis-à-vis- Godfatherism in Nigerian Politics’. I have conducted researches from diverse areas. I first conducted my researches through the websites like http:www.yahoosearch.com, http:www.googles.com, http:www.msn.com, and http:www.vanguardngr.com. I also laid my hands on several articles that deal on the topic of my research. I searched references cited on them for more studies. Furthermore, through the computer, I got some relevant books for my research. So let me now present my literature review. It will feature two ways: the review of relationship between friendship and godfatherism and the review of godfatherism: an offshoot of political party in Nigeria.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FRIENDSHIP AND GODFATHERISM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Nigerian politics in recent times has been experiencing what we call godfather phenomenon. From the inception of the present administration in 1999, this phenomenon has been a different ball game. I will begin by trying to show how friendship of unequal can become a root to godfatherism because of self-interest relationship existing between the godfather and the godson. In this, many philosophers and thinkers have shown their views right from the ancient period to this contemporary age. While some view friendship from its negative perspective, others upheld the positive aspect of it.</p> <p></p> <p>Moving down the epochs, in the pre-modern era, we have the work of Homer, <i>the Iliad</i>, where he portrayed the friendship of Achilles and the Patrochus as being very exclusive. Here, Achilles did not consider the plight of the people outside his friendship.[10]This exclusive character of friendship as portrayed by Achilles makes friendship selfish.</p> <p></p> <p>Likewise, the school of Hegesias holds the same notion that friendship is nothing except for selfish motives of those who engage in it. This motive may as a matter of fact involve selfishness of purpose. Thus, Theodorus opined that there is non-existence of friendship because of its inanity to both the wise and the unwise.[11]This particular view is because of the utility and pleasure types of friendship where the bond of the love is dissolved as soon as their needs disappear.</p> <p></p> <p>However, in the Nichomachean Ethics, Aristotle on friendship gave a necessary and profound response to the above views of these philosophers by outlining the difference between the inferior and superior or perfect friendship.[12] The friendship of utility and pleasure for him are for self-interest of those who engage in it but that of good or perfect is for those who do not consider their self-interest. While that of the utility and pleasure which dissolve with the disappearance of what is profitable is selfish, that of the good or perfect subsists and is not selfish. </p> <p></p> <p>In the Roman antiquity, it shows how the friends of Tarquinus notably Titus, Tiberius, Marcus, Manius and Lucius worked secretly and anxiously to restore him to power when the people rejected and banished him.[13]They considered their interest not that of the public. This is synonymous with the activities of the godfather and godson who choose the option to betray the state. </p> <p></p> <p>In the modern era, Francis Bacon, following the opposite view of the thinkers in the Roman antiquity, maintained that friendship is worthwhile and that there are certain dividends that those who engage in friendship relation should get from being friends.</p> <p></p> <p>In the same view, Kant was with the opinion that friends should confide in each other and that friendship is what everyone seeks to deserve.[14] R.W. Emerson followed Kant by hitting the nail at the head when he said that man finds whom he can relate with benevolently.[15]In this, there is no measure in reciprocating love or affections as the case may be.</p> <p></p> <p>Our discourse on friendship points to the fact that the love between the godfather and the godson is detrimental to the people because when there is no proportionate return of their contract then there will be war. As in the friendship of Tarquinus and his other friends who did not consider the good of the state but theirs first, so is it  in the case of the godfathers and godsons as we are experiencing in the present dispensation in Nigerian politics. Thus, the state must suffer under-development. Thus S.M Togbolo speaks,<b><i></i></b></p> <p><b><i></i></b></p><b><i></i></b> <p>Governor Mbadinuju made the people of AnambraState to experience demonstration of craze instead of democracy. The education system was a mess, social life and basic amenities were not met for the people of the state.[16]</p> <p></p> <p>To this, Elizabeth Telfer, argues that friendship though being particular to the friends should be for the general welfare.[17]So, this shows that godfatherism is harmful both to the citizens and to the development of the particular state.</p> <p></p> <p>As a matter of fact, one can say that benevolence which is an important quality in friendship is also the root of godfatherism when understood and applied wrongly. Benevolence being the root of godfatherism in politics cannot be done <b><i>ex gratia</i></b> but always with the intention of getting something greater in return. In the effort of Dr Nwachukwu Anakwenze to trace the origin of godfatherism, he says,</p> <p>The concept of “Godfatherism” has its origin in Christainity. Godparents are chosen as surrogates to help biological [or adopted] parents raise a Christian child to become a God-fearing, law-abiding adult.[18] </p> <p></p> <p>In this line, Eddy Odivwri adopted the same idea of godfatherism originating from Christianity. In his effort to trace its origin said that it is as old as humanity itself. Then, it was a sort of being applied selflessly which was seen as a positive practice that benefits the godson and advances the society.[19] Today, godfatherism is another ballgame. The godfather of today becomes the beneficiary and gives favour only if it will advance his selfish interest and ideology.</p> <p></p> <p>The godfather sees the benevolence he renders to the upstart as a business venture where the upstart cannot walk outside the rules laid down by him.</p> <p></p> <p>Let us now see how party politics gave birth to political godfatherism in Nigeria.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>GODFATHERISM: AN OFFSHOOT OF PARTY POLITICS IN NIGERIA</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Before the emergence of the British colonizers in Nigeria, there have been communities, kingdoms, and village republics existing in its primitive state. According to Otite, the variety of links existed between the various states and people because they were related and exposed to each other. It was divided into rulers and the ruled.[20] Oyediran has it that these rulers or recruited elites that can be hereditary or honorary make authority and decision according to the people’s tradition.[21]</p> <p></p> <p>These kingdoms and communities were democratic according to African standard, because each society participates in politics until the Eurocentric devaluation of African culture and the glorification of European way of life set.[22] Then, the African democracy sunk into the limbo of oblivion at the arrival of the British colonizers.</p> <p></p> <p>After the partitioning of Africa in the Berlin conference of 1884-1885 by European powers, the British introduced a western model of democracy that is completely alien to Nigerian culture. In 1900, what is known as Nigeria today was made up of three units (Lagos colony and protectorate and the protectorates of southern and northern Nigeria).[23] The British rule started involving the traditional rulers in preference to the then few educated elites. Therefore, when these elites felt displeased, they started forming political parties as a form of protest against the British rule as to achieve independence.[24] Thus, Awosika says, “Political parties came into existence in Nigeria during the transition from colonialism to self-government.”[25]</p> <p></p> <p>These elites were united in this fight against colonialism but division came after the attainment of independence. The British government in Nigeria led to a complete disruption of traditional system of government, which Lord Lugard proving it in 1903 saw it as dead old treaties. Therefore, they applied an indirect rule where traditional rulers became their delegates.[26] It was at this that the appointment and imposing of people on the majority became institutionalized. Hence, godfatherism set in.</p> <p></p> <p>Nigeria, after the colonial era and independence started fighting themselves especially those in power in their attempt to impose candidates of their choice on the people. Therefore, the three largest tribes in Nigeria started forming their own political parties. Their leaders now became their godfathers in terms of political recruitment. The Hausa and Fulani formed N.P.C.; Northern Peoples Congress, Aminu Kano was their godfather. The Igbo formed N.C.N.C.; National Council of Nigerian Citizens, Nnamdi Azikiwe became their godfather. The Yoruba formed A.G.; Action Group, Obafemi Awolowo was their godfather. Therefore, godfatherism set into Nigerian politics with a better face before it was twisted.</p> <div><br/><div> <p>[1] S.U.

I contend that in arguing that truth is nothing but mere opinion, Wiredu fails in denying truth of its objective characters. I also submit that Wiredu fail in making truth subjective. This is inspite of his avowed attempts at clarifying the senses in which he uses such concepts as “Truth” and ‘opinion’.</p> <p>  Consequently, this essay has been divided into four chapters in order that I will be better placed to understand the background to Wiredu’s position and also his main thesis.</p> <p>          In chapter one, I shall discuss generally the notion of truth in traditional western epistemology. In this chapter, I shall try to briefly analyze the basic proposition of the main objectivistic theories of truth, that is the semantic and the correspondence theories of truth and also examine the two non objectivistic theories of truth namely, the coherence and the pragmatic theories of truth. And as we shall discover Wiredu’s position is neither wholly pragmatic nor wholly coherent. He simply affirms both theories to some extent. As we shall see in this chapter that Wiredu believe that truth is coherence, also following Deweyian pragmatic principles Wiredu asserts that truth is “Warranted assertibility “.</p> <p>          In chapter two, I shall discuss in detail Wiredu’s thesis on trut h to the effect that to be true is simply to be opined. Prior to this would be consideration of his formal critique of the correspondence theory of truth, which is the most forceful representation of all objectivistic theories of truth. I shall discuss also his general thesis, which states that  “To be is to be known”.</p> <p>          In the third chapter, I shall begin by presenting the critique that have been  levelled against Wiredu’s position by three  contemporary  African  philosophers, Joseph Omoregbe, P.O Bodunrin, and Abdu Ghaniyi Bello, I shall then  consider Wiredu’s replies to some of the critics.</p> <p> In evaluating this essay, I will, in chapter four, point out and critically analyze the flaws which I believe in Wiredu’s system, and then proceed to show my own conviction s on how truth is to be conceived and treated.</p> <p><strong>1.1     THE NATURE AND TRADITIONAL THEORIES OF TRUTH</strong></p> <p>          The word “Truth” has its equivalence on the Greek word “Alenthia” and the Latin word “Veritas”, meaning in general some kind of agreement between thought and its objects, between knowledge and that which is known.</p> <p>          In its most simple form truth means the accordance of conformity between what is asserted and what is. According to Aristotle Truth is primary in judgment. A true judgment is true when it attributes a predicate to or denies it of a subject according to what reality it demands.1</p> <p>          A true account of the nature of truth can be given in terms of the condition under which a statement is said to be true or false. However, the same cannot be done for persons: truth in this case is a derivative sense of truth. Moreover, truth and false hood are not proper candidates for sentences as such, in other words, until a statement is used to state that something is or not the case it is not a candidate for truth. Thus, it is to statements that truth and falsity are attributable, and invariably to beliefs of which these statements may be the expression2.</p> <p>          Given that a statement is true. The following questions, at least, can be raised: what do we mean we say that a statement is true? Are we attributing a property?  What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for its truth, that is, it is true if and only if what? These questions are the ones that may be raised concerning any statement whatever, are all possible candidates for what is meant by the general question “What is truth”?</p> <p>          Truth can be rightly viewed as a consequential property of statement. That is to say that it might be a property that statements in virtue of the fact that other posses in virtue of the fact that other things are true of them3. In that’s case, the philosophy of truth should decide what these other things are, that are necessary concerning a statement if it is to be true.</p> <p>All this has some sort of bearing with the correspondence theory of truth.</p> <p>          However, apart from this theory other various theories have been advocated. The absolute idealist put forward a coherence theory of truth in which the only absolute truth is “The whole” and anything less than the whole can only aspire to degrees of truth. Here knowledge is confirmed by validation procedures4.</p> <p>          Williams James argued for a “pragmatic theory of truth” according to which the problem of truth is one of the welfare economic, for a true assertion is one proves the best in the long.</p> <p>          Tarski attempted to avoid the problems of self – references by claiming that truth can only be defined in a meta language, there by bringing into being the “Semantic theory of truth”.</p> <p>          F.P Ramsey thought that he had dissolved the problem truth by pointing out that ‘P’ and  'P' is true means the same thing and therefore, that is true” is redundant; hence the redundancy theory of truth for now”, the main objectivistic theory of truth, mainly the semantic and correspondence theories shall be discussed in detail.</p> <p><strong>1.2     THE SEMANTIC THEORY OF TRUTH</strong></p> <p>          This theory is re presented in the vigorous works of Alfred Tarski on the problem of truth.  Going by this theory, a syntactical system ‘L’ becomes a semantical system when the rules are given in its meta language ‘M’ which determines the necessary and sufficient truth condition for every sentence of the system.</p> <p>          These rules, often embodied in a recursive definition, lead to a definition of truth. And a condition of adequacy for such a definition is expressed by means of what Tarski calls the “Material Criterion”. The schema gives this criterion: X is true if and only if P cover P stand, for any sentences of the given language and X for the name of that sentences.5</p> <p>          Also, Tarski is quick to point out that the definition of truth must not only be materially adequate but also formally correct, that is, it must not lead to contradiction.</p> <p>          Using Tarski’s own example, if P is taken to stand for show is white, then the equivalence schema “T’ while d is true. “The sentence show is white is true if and only if snow is white”. 6</p> <p>In Tarski’s View, however the schema is not taken as providing a complete definition of truth. Tarski conceives of it as a given necessary condition of a truth7</p> <p>          Viewed in this perspective, one is inclined to that Tarski semantic theory of truth is another version of the correspondence   of truth. It gives truth as objective character, pointing out that truth is an objective standard against which any sentence or statement is judge to be or not to be the case. Hence, the many criticisms that have been leveled on Tarski’s theory centre  “correspondence with fact”. Ideals, common to all objectivistic theories of truth, yet as proper observes Tarski’s theories has “Rehabilitated the correspondence theory of absolute or objective”. 8</p> <p>          Similarly, though Tarski tried no cover all his theory with the clock of a meta – language, thereby arguing that truth cannot be adequ0ately defined in natural language, it is true as Donald Davidson observers that Tarski theory applies to English.</p> <p>          Generally then, then, the semantic theory have come to be regarded as ‘Objectivistics’ and taken to be a version of the correspondence theory of truth.</p> <p><strong>1.3.THE CORRESPONDENCE THEORY  OF TRUTH</strong></p> <p>Wiredu attempts to establish his thesis that truth is opinion comes by way of story rejection of the objectivistic theory of truth. According to this theory in make sense to say that a man’s opinion may change but it is meaningless nonsense to say that the truth it self may. Once a preposition is true, it is true in itself and forever. Truth in other words is timeless, eternal9 Wiredu see the objectivistic theory of truth as  “An intellectualized submission of the primitive passions of the soul”. As he puts it:</p> <p><em>“I must confess that the objectivist conception of truth of ten strives are as a intellectual submission of some what more primitive passions of the human soul10.</em></p> <p>          The term “ Correspondence” circulates among modern writers and this is largely through the influence of Bertrend Russell some forming of correspondence between belief and fact11. This is as against the absolute idealist, who holds that truth consist in coherence. The correspondence theory is an objectivist theory in that is holds that truth of a statement is independent our opinion and “Consist in a relation, according to behaviour, which holds between statements’12. For a better understanding of our subject a brief historical survey would be necessary to better.   Show how different people have understood the theory at different times.</p> <p>          The origin of the word “Correspondence “used to denote the relating between though and reality in which the truth of though consists appears to be medical. Aquinas used the word in this sense when be asserted that   ‘Truth is the adequation of things and the intellect”. 13</p> <p>          Other scholastics sometimes said that a preposition is true when, and only when the thing is as signified. This is the nerve of the correspondence theory of truth.14</p> <p>          The main recommendation of this theory, according to him, lies in the fact that it does take of aid does not conflict with many millions of the most obvious fact of truth. One such obvious fact, for instance, is that the belief by my friend that I have gone away on holidays certainly will be true, if and only if, I actually have gone away. Hence, the necessary and sufficient condition for a belief to be true is imply this: “That is should correspond to fact”.15 This is truth  in the  secondary sense . Moore is quick to point out that it is propositions rather than acts of belief which are true of false in the primary sense.16 take often say that belief are truth of false, but this is only because the word “Belief” is often used not for an act of believing but for what is believed.</p> <p>          There is also a Russialian Version of the correspondence theory of truth. Starting with the notion of belief Russell argues that the truth or falsity of a belief always depend upon something which lies outsides the believe itself. And this leads us to adopt the view that “truth consists in some form of correspondence between belief and fact”. 17</p> <p>The problem, however inherent in this theory is that if truth consists in a correspondence of thought with something outside thought then thought can never know when truth is attained.</p> <p>          This apparent difficulty led to concerted efforts among some philosophers to attempt and find some definition of truth, which shall not, consists in relation to something wholly outside belief. The most important attempt at a definition of this sort if the theory that truth consists in ‘coherence’. But Russell makes it a critique of this theory and settles down to defend the correspondence theory.</p> <p>          According to Ressell, there is a great difficulty in the view of coherence. There is no reason to suppose that only one coherent body of belief is possible. Hence, we are driven back to correspondence with fact as constituting the nature of truth.</p> <p>          Russell opines that we have to seek a theory of truth which allows truth to have an opposite, namely, false hood, makes a property of beliefs but s a property wholly dependent upon the relation of the beliefs to outside things.</p> <p>          In every act of belief, there is a mind, which believes, and then is forms concerning which is believes. Whenever a relation holds between two or more for ms, the mind unites the terms into a complex whole. Now, a belief in Russell view is true when it corresponds to a certain associated complex, and false when it does not.  The condition of the truth or a belief in something not involving beliefs or, in generals, any mind at all but only the objects of the belief. </p> <p>          A mind, which believes, believes truly involving the mind. Buts only its objects this correspondence ensures truth and wits absence entails false hood.</p> <p><strong>1.4.THE COHERENCE THEORY OF TRUTH</strong></p> <p>          Wiredu believes that truth is coherence.18 According to Wiredu, “a statement is true if it coheres with our system of beliefs”.19 In other words, the truth of a statement depends on the degree of it’s harmoniously with a given and accepted system of beliefs. He wonder then that Wiredu is continuously echoing the coherence theorist insistence that statements are compared with other statements and not with experience the world or an independent realm of reality”. Consequently Kwasi Wiredu’s regards any attempt at such a comparison as “mysterious, metaphysical and so meaningless”.20</p> <p>          The coherence theory of truth, which is characteristics  of the great rationalist system  building metaphysicians like Leibniz, spinoza, Hegal and Bradlly, further holds that a statement usually called a judgement is  considered true or false to the extent that it coheres or fails to cohere with a system of other statement that it is a member  of a system whose elements are related to each other by ties of logical implication as the elements in a system of pure mathematics are related. For instance, in mathematics, the truth  of falsity  of a theorem in Geometry will be dependent on its consistency  with  the anxious of the  particular system in use.21</p> <p>          They argue  that this view of truth, more than anything should not be viewed as making truth relative  to the individual perception. Rather, it continuously emphasized that truth must be constructed relative to the systems in which the Item of knowledge is perceived.22</p> <p>          Many proponents of this theory of coherence  hold that each member of a system implies every other member. Hence, to test whether a statement is true is to test it for coherence with a system of other statements.</p> <p>          According to the logical positivist who supports this theory, the system with which ALL TRUE statement  must cohere of the contemporary culture. The metaphysical supporters of coherence  on the other hand, insist  that a    statement cannot be properly   called  true unless it falls into the one comprehensive account of the universe  which , it self  forms a coherent system.</p> <p>          In the   exact and reputable  science of pure mathematics and  related science, the  logical text for  truth, according to the  coherent epistemology, is a statement  cohering with some other propositions, and ultimately with the anxious of  its  own system.  In this   text which is not merely  practical one,  for a proposition  to cohere  with other  proposition is for it’s to be  logically  deducible from them. And this  coherence  is what calling a proposition true means. For instance, the metaphysical supporter  of this theory argue that we would not even understand, much less  known the truth or falsity of a  statement about something blue, if blue were divorced in our thought  from all  the colours in the spectrum to which it is related by likeness and difference, all the shades within its own  range and all  the definition it possess in virtue of being  thought of as quality rather    than as  substances or a relation.23</p> <p>          Further not only would we know the truth of such a statement, but it also cannot be properly said to have its meaning of t4ruth value independently of its relation to other statement.</p> <p>          Still within the framework of the coherence theory of the truth, we have the notion  of the doctrine of degree of truth”. The  doctrine  states  that  if  the truth of any d given  statement    is bound up with and can only be seen with the truth of all the statement of the system, and this is bound up with  the whole system, then individual statement as such, are only partly false and only the whole system is  wholly true. Hence, Braddly asserts: truth must exhibit the  mark of expansion and all inconclusiveness.24</p> <p>          Although no conclusive evaluation of this theory is intended, I shall now proceed and attempt   to final out the amount of compatibility that obtains between this theory of   truth and that of Wiredu and then proceed to point out the  basic theory.</p> <p>          Given  the fact  that we are not involving in any sort  of extensive evaluation here, it will now begin  to appear that thought Wiredu  may  not be rightly conceived  as an absolute  coherent ,  his  theory to a great  extent is sympathetic to most  of the tenets inherent in the  coherence   epistemology. The  problem I shall involve myself is now would be  to point  out  the basic flows  which inhere in this  theory.</p> <p>          The fatal defect of the coherence  theory  of truth according to Reuben Abel, is that “There is no way to locate a coherent  system d of proposition  to reality”25 Astrology   constitute s a coherent system, so  the  delusions of the psychotic, so does geometry, yet we do not take them to be true.  Moreover, the growth  of science often shatters existing  coherent system.</p> <p>          Newton’s geo centricism, kepler’s helio centricism, Darwinian evolution, Eintainmean relatively, all  over threw established  systems.</p> <p>          Hence, the vary  idea  of  a completely coherent system begins to appear absurd and need d a radical modification. thus, although we take coherence  as a  requirement for truth, it does  not suffice  as a  definition for truth. This is because of the simple reason according to Bertrand  Russell,  that there  appears  to be  competing reason to believe that only one coherent body of belief is possible.26 as Ayer succinctly puts it: there  may be any  number of systems of statements, each of which is  internally consistent, but any two of which are  incompatible with one another”.27</p> <p><strong>1.5.THE PRAGMATICS THEORY OF TRUTH</strong></p> <p>          In pragmatic epistemology, truth is regarded not as absolute but relative. It is never in a perfect state. Immutable or eternal. Rather, it can change from one generation to another. According to Wiredu…” Truth there is  necessarily bind to point of view, on better truth is view from some point and there are as many truth as there are points of view”.28</p> <p>          According to pragmatists, prominent among whom are scanders pierce, Williams James and John Dewey, man should concern himself with the things or events that can be perceived by the senses and not with the abstract and the speculation.</p> <p>          Hence the criterion of truth must be traceable to experience. According to Williams James:</p> <p><em>Truth in our idea and beliefs means that ideas (which themselves are but party of our experience) become true is so far as they helped us to get into satisfactorily relation with other parts of our experience…Any idea that will carry us prosperously from one part of our experience linking things satisfactorily, working securely simpling saving labor: true for just so much, true in so far  truth instrumentally.29</em></p> <p>This quota from James Terminate in a term which embodied the instrument essence of pragmatism and which brings some philosophers to assign the designation, instrumentalism to the general pagmatic philosophy. According  to James, the function of thought is not to copy or image reality but to form idea in order to satisfy the individual interest. Thus on   pragmatic principles, if the hypothesis, for instance, of God satisfactorily in the widest sense of the world, it is true. However, it is in dewey  that we should be most interested, for Wiredu feels the strong affinity with his theory of truth.</p> <p>          For Dewey, ideas become true when their ”draft upon existence’ is honor by the verifying facts they promise. The notion that truth some how exists antecedent to and separate from inquiry in meaningless in Dewey’s thought for  him truth is notable. “Truth happens to be an idea” when it becomes verified or a warranted assertion.</p> <p>          Dewey considers truth from the point of view of verification and places it out the end of all enquiries.  Hence, following Dewey, Wiredu’s  tense formulation of the  Deweyian posistion is that’s truth is warranted assertibility.30</p> <p>Precisely this portion emphasizes that truth is what rational inquiry warrants us to assert. Instead of being a prior postulate, truth is here viewed an end product din practice. In “Dewey words”.</p> <p>          That which guides truly is true…</p> <p><em>“the hypothesis that works is the true one and  truth is an abstract applied to the  collection of cases, actual, foreseen, and desired, that receive confirmation in their consequencys”.31</em></p> <p>Consequences fore the pragmatists, then go into the very essence of meaning and truth.</p> <p>          In this “Essay in experimental logic”, Dewey suggests, that the term pragmatic only mean the rule of all thinking all reflective consideration to “Consequences:” for final meaning and text.</p> <p>          In brief formulation the pragmatist approach to truth can be stated thus: A thought is true, not because it agrees with some experimental reality as most traditionalists hold, but because it works all right. That is, it has valid consequences it is applied to some specific situations. It is false not because it misrepresents reality, bust because when it is used it fails to work out right. Truth, then consist in the usefulness of an idea in practice. And a preposition is verified or falsified by proving usable or non-usable in action.</p> <p>          By way of general critique of pragmatism it is true, as Bernard Russell   and Arthur Lukejor, among others, point out that the notion of truth as what work is unclear since the concept of “Workability” is ambiguous. A brief cans work in two different senses at the same time. Also in stating that the only common characteristics of all our true beliefs are that they “pay”. Williams seems to suggest that the consequences   of  entertaining such belief are better than those of rejecting them.</p> <p>          But also Russell point out, it is enormously difficult to know a priori the consequences of holding any belief. How are we to determine, for instance weather the effects of believing in Islamic religion are on the whole good or bad?</p> <p>          Also common to all pragmatic is the view that nothing  should be considered true, except that which is experienciable and emperically verifiable. However, it is  also true that to say, for instance that S is P becomes true does not mean that S is P become  verified. It can only mean that S become P.</p>\n\nA CRITIQUE OF WIREDU’S CONCEPT OF TRUTH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITIQUE OF WIREDU’S CONCEPT OF TRUTH", "id": 88}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>WOMEN EMPOWERMENT: A PHILOSOPHICAL APPRAISAL </p> <div> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1. INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>        Women empowerment is human right that lies at the heart of development and achievement of millennium development goals. There is sample historical evidence to indicate that, there is discrimination against women all over the world and this is due to common belief that women are inferior to men. Evidence abound in philosophical circle about derogatory perception of women scholars such as Aristotle, Nietzsche, hegel and Descartes. Most women are discriminated against in performance of some duties not because of their inability to carry out the action but because of their sex.</p> <p>        This work is set to expose and appraise the sub-ordinate position of women in our society. In this chapter, we shall see what is empowerment, discrimination and the different aspects to women discrimination, such as the physiological and psychological aspects of discrimination against women.</p> <p>        In chapter two, we shall discuss the place of women in the society, such places like family, labour market and education, and we shall also address the question that often comes to mind “Are men and women equal?.</p> <p>        In chapter three, we shall discuss the implications of women’s discrimination to the well being of the society and the significance of women’s empowerment in our society.</p> <p>        The summary, conclusion and suggestion shall be finally articulated in chapter four. This work will help us to asses the value of women and the benefits of their empowerment to the development of the society.</p> <p><strong>1.2 CONCEPT CLARIFICATION</strong></p> <p><strong>1. Empowerment</strong></p> <p>        According to BBC English dictionary “empowerment is when someone is empowered to do something or given authority or power to do something”. Again is defined as to give somebody the power or authority to act. It is having more control over their life or more power to do something. It also means to give authority or power to authorize, give strength and confidence to. It is the legal roght to do something. Empowerment is having authority, confidence and the strength to do something.</p> <p>        Empowerments in relation to women is the ability of women to control and direct things which affect them. It is the provision of adequate opportunity to women to development potential and contribute to the development of the nations in particular and to the world in general. It is the provision of conducive environment and the opportunities to women to contribute their quota to the social, political and economic development of a nation it is the capacity to mobilize resources to produce beneficial social changes. Women empowerment therefore authority and power to act as their male counter parts do.</p> <p><strong>2. Discrimination</strong></p> <p>        Oxford English Dictionary defines discrimination “as a recognize distinction between people and things or treat one person or group worse or better than others.”2 It is unfair treatment people because of their religion, race or other personal feature. It is the practical of treating one person or group of people less family or less well than other people or group. It also means a recognition and understanding of the difference between one thing and another or good judgment or taste. Discrimination is a sociological term of referring to the treatment taken toward or against a person of a certain group in consideration based solely on class or category. Discrimination is the actual behaviour towards another group from opportunities that are available to other group. It involves excluding and restriction on members of one group or rejection. It is the ability or power to see or make fine distinction, discernment. It is a treatments or consideration based on class or category rather than individual merit. It  refers to any instance of treating someone in a less favourable manner on the basis of that person’s characteristics.</p> <p>        Discrimination is not only one sided thing women discriminate against women, men against men, women against men, men against women.</p> <p>        In the course of this work, wish to discuss discrimination against women. Women has been discriminated against in so many ways, almost  in every aspect of their lives. Though there skill exist discrimination among women, women discriminate themselves. There are some instances that it is the women tat does not want to give way to her fellow woman. Some stereotyped women believe that their place is I the kitchen and not the public sector. But  we are going to discuss discrimination against women by their male counter part, at the level of culture, politics religion, economic and education.</p> <p>        Sex discrimination refers to the deferential treatment of women and men on the basis of their categorical membership, gender without consideration of individual differences in terms of ability competence, inclination and commitment. Women occupy the inferior positions and regarded as the weaker sex. They are the ones who receive the lesser (or no) are of the valued societal good. Aristotle as a philosopher saw women as naturally weak and licentious. To him women are “unfinished men.”3 from early childhood women learn that the world of individual achievement is closed to them and that their primary vocation is to please and serve men. In our society men are allowed, encouraged, to be daring to reach out and accomplish a project. Men are supposed to be rational, inventive and creative, but less is expected of women.</p> <p>        Women are always under the control of men, either directly or indirectly. Their discrimination starts from the family. They are expected to be dependent on the male folks and do as they are commanded or ordered to do so this they called “ the act of been submissive”. They are regarded as the second class citizens. Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women defines discrimination “as they distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or mulling the recognition, enjoyment or exercise? Women are discriminated through the following ways.</p> <p><strong>A) Culture</strong></p> <p>        Culturally speaking, women have been discriminated against. Men are considered naturally more analytic, aggressive and interested in success while women are considered as nurturing, compassionate better at child bearing and care worse at exciting decision making. In our culture women are treated as the second sex. Men behave as if they are the subjects, treating women as the objects, thus disproving them of the responsibility for their own life for example the T.V cultural in Nigeria  permits men to offer their wives as entertains to their visitors. According to Dobkin “natural derived women choice and make them to attend the interest of others, husbands, parents and lads in place of their own”.4 culture demands women to marry  on time, otherwise, she would find it hard to get married at a later data. I came to a conclusion that culturally or otherwise girls are considered as milk once split, it cannot be picked up. They are not expected to choose their mate. Culturally women are considered desirably by men or sex and child bearing.</p> <p><strong>B) Religion</strong></p> <p>        Most religions either directly or indirectly discriminates against women or support their discrimination. Christianity and some other  religions believe that women should be submissive to men. In Gen 3:16b 1 quote “----- and they desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall over thee”.5 women are excluded from the position of priesthood in the Christendom, as well as the Muslims. Women are more in number yet most discriminated against. In water town church Rev. D. Timothy Labouf dismissed Mary Lambert as a Sunday school teacher for an adult class after she’s  been on the job for over 50 years, making reference to 2timothy 2:11 and 12.</p> <p>        Women are expected to learn in quietness and full submission. Woman are not expected to each or have authority over a man, she must be silent. According to Aristotle women are unfinished men.</p> <p><strong>c) Political</strong></p> <p>        Women have skill, potentials, intelligent, brilliant, smart but why is t that up till now they are not fully given, if at all, women are expected to go to minor position and not major ones like the position of president and the vice-president. They are seen as inferior to men and regarded as second class citizen and should be subordinate to men. They should nor seek for tops in political level because they would not even be considered. They are alleged that thus has to do with patriarchal hierarchies in society. Politically women are sublime in budgetary consideration and participation in matters of self interest.</p> <p>        In united states of American, only three women have served as their governors. And in Nigeria a women was made Governor for three months. None has become the presidents or the vice- president. They are excluded to some extent from political offices.</p> <p><strong>D) Economic</strong></p> <p>        Most women are now educated not like the ancient times where women were not regarded as people who should be educated. But skill educated women are advised and convinced to stay in their place because they are expected to work in women’s jobs and one wonders if really men and women always do different works. But what causes job segregation today? Is it that women are not seen as men capable in doing the jobs regarded as men’s job?.</p> <p>        At working place, women are sexually harassed. An organization arose to fight against all forms of discriminating acts, with the aim to liberate women from the stereotyped roles which they have been wicked into and prevents their development for example the CEDAW (convention on the elimination of all forms of disc rumination against women. Economically women are poor; through women have also contributed indirectly to increase in productivity and long run economic growth through unpaid work, both at home raising children and in their communities. Women are not given greater economic opportunities. Women are regarded as not economically capable to produce goods. More so, they lack capital. This is evident in the men’s domination of virtually every sector of the country’s economy like the import and export, industrial, transport, agricultural and commercial sector. The effect is that women participation in public affairs is drastically reduced because they do not possesses the material base for political and socio-economic self-assertiveness6.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Different Aspect to Women Discrimination</strong>   </p> <p><strong>1. Physiology</strong></p> <p>            Women has been discriminated against because of their physical nature. They are regarded as been physically weaker than men, women’s destiny is said to be rooted in their physical nature or can be traced to biology. The characteristics of women is used  against her for example in Oragite in Anambra  state, where i come from, a woman is not allow to climb a pal or tree because of her bodily features or characteristics. Women’s physical nature makes them to look less perfect in the eyes of their male counter parts. According to Aristotle, he believed that women are colder than men and thus less perfect and therefore like infertile men. Women are regarded to be in virtue of a particular inability.</p> <p>2) <strong>Psychology</strong></p> <p>        Women are discriminated physiologically. The mental characteristics or attitude of a women is said to be irrational.</p> <p>        According to Aristotle; woman is more compassionate than man.

He has since the evolution of societies been preoccupied with how to effect changes in the society to maximize his well-being, man therefore, has never at any point abdicated the pressing responsibility of searching for, or evolving models of governance that would make for a better understanding and organization of the society, and one of the reasons for this conviction is to foster a blissful life for humanity devoid of rancor, violence, crisis and conflict. Thomas Hobbes insists that men decided to live under a civil society for their self-preservation and contented life such that the unfortunate and miserable situation of anarchy and conflicts would be ameliorated if not completely eliminated. The philosopher also points out that the fear of uncertainty and insecurity of lives and property prompted the formation of civil society. Jean-Jacques Rousseau also talks of preservation whereby the human race must necessarily change its nature of existence if it must continue to live and avoid violence. It is against this backdrop of social progress that Hannah Arendt points out that the glorification of violence is not restricted to small minority and eternity.        </p> <p><strong>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY                      </strong></p> <p>In Nigeria basically violence has taken the central field in the democracy which involves the untimely death of wanton of her citizens in the pursuit of political power. We imbibe the ideas of  Georges Sorel  in his Reflections on Violence, he believed that power had to be shifted from the deteriorated middle class to the working class, and that power must be acquired through only a general strike that, to be effective, must be violence[1]. Political conflict is an endemic feature of most of the world’s political systems. This is particularly true of the developing countries, including Nigeria, where political conflict, crises and even violence, became essential characteristics of the political process, especially after independence. It was perhaps Nigeria’s pride that she achieved her independence with a minimum of social disturbance and violence. Nigeria stumbled from crisis to crisis and near disintegration, as the country witnessed a marked increase in the bitterness of party, ethnic and region.</p> <p>Consequently, Violence or the threat of violence is a universal phenomenon. Writing in the same vein, Charles Tilly remarks that Collective violence has flowed regularly from the political process… Men seeking to size, hold, or realign power the lever of power have continually engaged in collective violence as part of their struggle. Nigeria affords a good case for both the theoretical and empirical study of political violence. We believe that the sources and dynamics of violence in Nigeria are fundamentally comparable to those of civil violence in the other parts of the world. Nigeria rioters share with their counterparts throughout the world certain psychological characteristics; most of them feel frustrated in their pursuit of their political and economic goals and in seeking redress for grievances. In Nigeria, those who had power had no respect for the establish channels of political action, that is, the rules of the game, and political power in this country through violence leads to economic prowess and marginalization of citizens. As Arendt posited that: Power and violence are opposites, where the one rules absolutely, the order is absent. Violence appears where the power is in jeopardy, but left to its cause it ends in power’s disappearance[2]. Political violence has become a central part of political competition across much of Nigeria and it takes forms from assassination to armed clashes between gangs employed by rival politicians. This violence is most often carried out by gangs whose members are openly recruited and paid by politicians and party leaders to attack their sponsors’ rivals, intimidate members of the public, rig elections, and protect their patrons from similar attacks[3].</p> <p>The 2011 general election marked another ugly milestone of political violence in the political history and culture in Nigeria. Comparatively, it is rather difficult to determine which the most violence afflicted general elections were since the return to civil rule in mid-1999.The 1999 general election was violent prone; so also was the 2003 and 2007 general elections and what was also apparent was that each general election took place under different dimension and circumstances with progression of record of casualties. The continually deteriorating economic conditions also continue to throw up new dynamics and nuances alter the pattern of political violence.</p> <p>Hannah Arendt as a child experienced war and violence during her life as she wrote: these reflections were provoked by the events and debates of the last few century, which has become indeed, as Lenin predicted, a century of wars and resolutions, hence a century of that violence...[4] This currently believed to be their common denominator. There is, however, another factor in the present situation which, though predicted by nobody, is of at least equal importance. The technical development of implements of violence has now reached the point where no political goal should conceivably correspond to their destructive potential or justify their annual use in armed conflict. Hence, warfare since times immemorial the final merciless arbiter in international disputes has lost much of its effectiveness and nearly all of its glamour. The apocalyptic chess game between the superpower that is between those that move on the highest plane of civilization is being played according to the rule; if neither wins; it is the end of both.[5]</p> <p><strong>1.2       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This trend in Nigeria politics poses some interesting questions for political inquiry. Nigeria affords a good case for both the theoretical and empirical study of political violence. We believe that the sources and dynamics of violence in Nigeria are fundamentally comparable to those of civil violence in other parts of the world. Though the ability to compromise by different actors in the Nigerian political system was very remarkable, especially after independence ,it was during this period that violence  or its potential use moved to the center of political action a weapon in the hands of the both the state and individual.</p> <p>Therefore, the relevance of this study is seen as avenue to the political situation of Nigeria which has anchored on violence rising from shedding of bloods of her citizens and thereby by advocating for non-violence as a means in a achieving a positive political quest with the shedding of  blood or rioting which is paramount in the Nigeria political arena. Non-violence is without not a new idea in the existence of man, however, Nigerian political elites should be schooled on the use of non-violence as a track to contest for any political office of their choice rather than using violence to deduce the game of politicking thereby defranchaising some due to fear of injuries at the various electoral centers Hence, with the death of violence and by applying peaceful methods in the Nigeria electoral system and synthesizing the political ideologies of Nigeria, I think Nigeria  democracy shall be sustained and she will become a model looked upon and emulated by others.</p> <p><strong>1.3       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Political class continue to arm the youths, employ them to commit heinous crimes, shed blood at every critical pint of life especially during election period; water the streets with blood of the youths themselves, innocent by-stands passersby. Politicians themselves are assassinated in broad day and in  cold; bodies, souls and destines are wantonly destroyed in the Manichean quest for political power even the conferences held to pontificate on the negative of political violence wee unfruitful due to lack of tangible deliberations and implementation to harness the menace. The political systems of Nigeria are caught in a spider web of violence and death.</p> <p>Also, in definition of Marx Weber’s idea of a state C.W Mills succinctly defined politics as a struggle for power and the ultimate form of power is violence.[6] This closeness between power and violence seems to be in consonance the earlier ideology and postulations of the Chinese dictator Mao Tse-tung who believed that power grows from the emanation of barrel of gun.[7] The necessary consideration given to the relationship, these differences between power ad violence was thrown into light when the existential philosopher J. P Sartre whilst writing the preface to Fanon’s Wretched of the Earth glorified violence, believing that it is only violence that pays.[8] The name which Nigeria accrued due to her growth in different diverges of economy is a paradox. The catalogues of mismanagement, which led to this paradox, constitute as it were, the afflictions under which Nigeria is going through. Since her independence in 1960, Nigeria is menaced with much problems ranging from political, economic, cultural, social and otherwise. The superstructure is in fact in dilemma .This sometimes makes wonder the authenticity and the real autonomy of the country some even led to the conclusion that we are not independent.[9]  The incessant wars against our fellow country men and women in the quest for political appointments through violence can only undermine our collective development as a people. With the ideologies of different philosophers aforementioned earlier and some individuals whose interest and specialty on political violence would be of valued help in analyzing the notion of violence and its relationship to political power will generate an enormous questions; what is the necessity of violence in the existence and maintenance of political power or can there be any political power without violence?.</p> <p>The aforementioned questions are very prevalent in this our modern world with the contemporary penchant of world wars and revolutions in which violence is ultimately is the rising common denominator[10].With the advancement in technology man’s inhumanity to fellow man through violence by production of weapons of mass destruction has persistently been in outstanding pedigree has rendered man powerless and technological modernization which should serve as a helper to man has become his own instrument of destruction. However, violence has gathered an outstanding impetus when it comes to politics and politicking. Therefore, the quest for political power in this contemporary age is now full of violent actions thereby sending down morality to oblivion and enchanting the glories of violence to its apex level through the acceptance of Machiavellian principle of the end justifies the means.</p> <p>Taken cognizance of Nigeria situation with facts born out of experience and genuinely vindicated by history that the quest for political power through violence is very much prevalent in Nigeria. Violence has persistently being attuned into the Nigeria system of politics in the garb of thuggery, riots, ethnic crisis, assassination, kidnapping, defranchizing people their electioneering rights which will eventually leads to untimely death of innocent people. It is our view that when political violence is used in conditions in which no other form of protest is permissible, and then it would wrong be to call it terrorism. Miller argues that violence may be permissible in dictatorships and other repressive regimes when it used to defend human rights, provoke liberal reforms, and achieve other desirable objective[11].A journey down to Nigeria’s political activities indicates that politics which is supposed the natural activities of man taking cognizance of Aristotelian definition as a political animal. Nigeria idea of politics is a game of do or die affair and what can be known as survival of the fittest. I should think that the aim of political power in every government as Arendt asserts is to enable men to live together, to promote happiness or to realize a classless society[12]. This meaning is no longer obtainable nowadays instead people have understood political power as the best avenue to make money hence resorting to all forms of violence in order to acquire it.</p> <p>In this write-up, I am going to philosophically expose this quest for political power through violence especially in our country Nigeria toeing the foot step of Hannah Arendt to prove that power and violence are incompatible and that violence can destroy power but not create it[13]. Most Nigerian politicians see violence both as an offensive weapon and as a component of personal security as a necessary part of political campaign; they believed that they must maintain some capacity to unleash violence as a measure of self-defense.</p> <p><strong>1.4       PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Nigeria is a country where no particular system of politics can be said to be consistently practiced. It is a country where they might sets the pace for politicking[14] .As hitherto mentioned above; man is by nature a political animal. Hence politics is not restricted to special type of people neither is it a dirty game. Instead, it is those who indulge in it that are could be seen as dirty. Politics in Nigeria is what the leaders call it. Nigeria can therefore, not be said to have a system of politics other than inconsistence which culminates into a pyramid of corruption.[15] What we have in Nigeria as politics is a facilitation of imbroglios and camps of civilian armies; we have politicians a panoply of hotchpotch of individuals with contradicting interest ready to satisfy their individual characters through destructive manners[16].Therefore, the purpose of studying this topic titled the quest for political power through violence is to redress the above mentioned status quo in which politics is seen as a game of do or die.  To achieve this, the youths who are veritable tools of violence have to be re-orientated for they are gradually imbibing this method as the best option for survival.</p> <p>Again, I wish to use this write-up to appeal to the consciences of those whose hands are not yet soiled in politics to keep it up. This destructive malady had been extenuated that there must be venomous activities as feature of Nigeria politics. Hence, for to be a successful” in Nigeria, one must be abysmally violent[17]. The fact that violence is seen as the order of the day in Nigerian politics should not make them to join them when they cannot beat them for violence has always been part and parcel of Nigeria political process which has lead credence to the people’s loss of lives and property.</p> <p><strong>1.5       SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>      In this long easy, I want to pay much attention mainly on the ideas of Hannah Arendt’s violence to Nigerian situation even though they were not propounded for that. Of all the political works of Hannah Arendt, I am going to concentrate mainly on her major work on violence and other text/materials written by her and other scholars relevant to the purpose of this work.</p> <p><strong>1.6       RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES</strong></p> <p>The use of scientific method in any philosophical inquiry is so indispensible. Method is so crucial that it helps to validate our philosophical conviction. Of the different methods habitually used in scientific works, a combination of an expository-critical procedure was found most suitable as it enables us to faithfully explore the relevant themes in Hannah Arendt's thoughts and by basing on different emerging opinions of other authors as a way of deepening, supporting or even positive questioning. It allows us to arrive implicitly and explicitly at personal judgment about the author’s view. It will be a work of library and internet researches. The system I shall follow in quoting and more especially in deriving the detailed entries in every written source is mainly that of footnoting. Arendt’s ideas on violence are compared with the Nigerian situation, to sieve out what can serve as a better political worldview for Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.7       EXPLICATIONS OF TERMS.</strong></p> <p><strong>Definition of violence</strong></p> <p>Violence has become so strife in the world today that little or no attention is attracted wherever it transpires. Every aspect of human life in this world is affected by this canker worm such that, for some people, it has become an impasse. It becomes an ulcerous cancer to the society in both cultural, religious, economical, social, psychological, and more especially, political spheres that peaceful and harmonious co-existence among men seems to be an illusion for some people. Violence just like time is not easy concept to define. For Arendt, “violence is by nature instrumental; like all means, it always stands in need of guidance and justification through the end it pursues”[18].From the Latin word<em> violentia</em>meaning “impetuosity” is the term violence derived. It denotes excessive force or constraint. According to Oxford Advance Learner’s Dictionary, violence is……a behavior intended to hurt or kill; strong feeling that is uncontrolled.[19]Arendt advocated that violence can be justifiable, but it never will be legitimate. Its justification loses in plausibility the farther it intended and recedes into the future.[20]In other words, violence makes a beast of the perpetrator and a thing of the persecuted.</p> <p> <strong>Various Forms of Violence</strong></p> <p> Generally speaking, violence can be classified into two broad forms: internal (covert) and external (overt) violence.</p> <p>Internal violence refers to the disharmony or peacelessness which one suffers in his interior self. It is this type of violence that St. Paul succinctly alluded to in his turmoil and thus cried thus: the good things I want to do, I never do; the evil thing which I do not want-that is what I do.[21] This kind of violence is most observed in confused individuals and showcased externally in their relationship with their fellow man in the society. In the same vein, external violence refers to every kind of conflict or disharmony which apart from happening within the individual goes beyond the internal realm to have an external manifestation in man’s dealings with one another. Analogically, it could be regarded as a kind of volcanic eruption which after burning beneath the earth under a very high temperature explodes in the form of molten magma forming a mountain as a lasting impression, mangling whatever it comes in contact with. It is this kind of violence that is regarded as external violence.[22]</p> <p>In reference to these forms of violence, Dom Helder Camara[23], in his book Spiral of violence, talks on three forms of violence which converge to form what he called the spiral of violence that gave his book its title. According to him, the first in this spiral of violence is institutional violence[24]. It refers to violent rules and policies institutions societies impose on their citizens which subjugate them to subhuman slavery condition. Hence, they are unjustly treated, humiliated and restricted such that all hope seems to be lost. It is this institutional violence, according to him, that prompts counter-violence[25], another form of violence. It manifests itself in the form of riots, terrorism, revolutions etc, to the subservience that institutional violence inflicts. Any attempt to respond to the heavy wind of this counter-violence gives rise to the third form of violence which he called repressive violence. It is usually a reaction against counter-violence by the perpetrators of institutional violence as a solution to counter violence through their agents such as thugs, police, ’EFCC’, or even another institutional violence such that the spiral continues. This third type of violence is the most awful because in bid to repress whatever constitutes a threat to their power, the powerful use any repressive means at the reach to achieve their aim. In this vicious progression of violence from covert (injustice) to overt (revolt) and then to tyrannical (repression), one sees the vicious rotation of violence to be endless, hence, rendering shattered a harmonious and peaceful co-existence[26].</p> <p><strong>Causes of Violence</strong></p> <p>Several factors can be said to be the causes of violence. Speaking about the causes of violence, Arendt opines:</p> <p>To speak about the causes of violence in these terms must appear presumptuous at a moment when floods of foundation money are channeled into the various research projects of social scientists, when deluge of books on the subject has already appeared, when eminent natural scientists-biologists, psychologists, ethologists, and zoologists have joined in an all-out effort to solve the riddle of “aggressiveness” in human behavior, and even a brand new science, called “polemology”, has emerged. [27]</p> <p>Despite the above, certain factors are still considered as being the primordial causes of violence. They include: egoism, injustice, aggression, racism, terrorism etc. we shall examine some of them in this write-up.</p> <p><strong>EGOISM</strong></p> <p>Egoism is seen as an exhibition of selfishness. This is the attitude of one considering his self interest as more important than the others. Indeed it is an undeniable fact that most violence we experience around the globe are caused by egoism. This is because as W.A Wallace says, “egoism creates in man a wall of exclusiveness to others. By this exclusiveness he becomes full of himself such that at times he looks at the other as an enemy who should even be eliminated. This phenomenon underscores the social conflicts and intolerance among people, hence violence is the result.”</p>\n\nTHE QUEST FOR POLITICAL POWER THROUGH VIOLENCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE QUEST FOR POLITICAL POWER THROUGH VIOLENCE", "id": 90}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p><strong>MACHIAVELLISM IN OBASANJO’S POLITICAL DISPENSATION: A PHILOSOPHICAL EVALUATION</strong></p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>Title Page -</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>i</p> <p>Approval Page</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>ii</p> <p>Certification</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>iii</p> <p>Acknowledgements</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>iv</p> <p>Dedication</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>v</p> <p>Table of Contents</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>vi</p> <p>Abstract  -</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>ix</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1</p> <p>Background of Study</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>1</p> <p>1.2</p> <p>Statement of Problem</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>4</p> <p>1.3</p> <p>Purpose of Study</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>6</p> <p>1.4</p> <p>Scope of Study -</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>7</p> <p>1.5</p> <p>Significance of Study-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>7</p> <p>1.6</p> <p>Methodology</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>8</p> <p>1.7</p> <p>Definition of Terms</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>8</p> <p>References</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>12</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p>Literature Review</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>14</p> <p>7</p> </div> <div> <p>References           -          -         -          -          -          -          -          41</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE: MACHIAVELLI’S POLITICAL THEORY</strong></p> <p>3.1</p> <p>Life and Times of Machiavelli</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>44</p> <p>3.2</p> <p>Machiavelli’s Political Ideology</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>47</p> <p>3.3</p> <p>Machiavelli on State -</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p> </div>\n\nMACHIAVELLISM IN OBASANJO’S POLITICAL DISPENSATION: A PHILOSOPHICAL EVALUATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MACHIAVELLISM IN OBASANJO’S POLITICAL DISPENSATION: A PHILOSOPHICAL EVALUATION", "id": 91}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p> <strong>Feminism In The Philosophy Of Simone De Beauvoir A Critical Analysis</strong> </p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Feminism is one of the philosophical concepts that has raised a lot of controversies in all human societies. Nike AIR Max 2017 Goedkoop It is a theory, ideology and a humanistic philosophy that incorporate men and women for the upliftment and development of the society. Air Max Tailwind 8 Goedkoop To this end, Simone De Beauvoir, a French existentialist philosopher, applied existentialists’ ideas to the situation of the contemporary women. Nike Air Max 90 Bloemen Dame For ages, the woman is seen as a second class citizen, the “other”, an object who is lost and is losing her way, as such, this has doomed her to immanence since her transcendence has been overshadowed and forever transcended by another ego. Nike Air Max 90 Honeycomb Dame To her, a woman is a free and autonomous being like all human creatures who finds herself living in a world where men compel her to the status of the “other”.

For this reason he advocates that the three powers of the organs of government-the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary should be manned by different persons and their functions properly co-coordinated such that liberty is achieved without any of the powers subsumed in the other. They must maintain their autonomy to achieve their purpose. But the exercise of delegated authority seems to forestall the total implementation of Montesquieu’s theory of separation of powers in modern government operations. The act of law-making, which is the sole function of the legislature, is also exercised by the executive organ of government, which is responsible for the implementation of the laws made by the legislature. this is carried out in the form of Bye-Laws, Statutory Instruments and Provisional orders. Through a philosophical evaluation, it has become the case that there has to be a fusion of function among the organs if state objectives must be achieved. It is therefore the case that a true, water-tight separation of powers is not possible if liberty, progress, peace, tranquility, order, is to be achieved in modern governments.</p> <p>2</p> </div> <div> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>Title page</p> <p>Approval Page</p> <p>Certification</p> <p>Acknowledgements</p> <p>Dedication</p> <p>Table of Contents</p> <p>Abstract</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1         Background of the study</p> <p>1.2         Statement of problem</p> <p>1.3         Purpose of study</p> <p>1.4         Significance of the study</p> <p>1.5         Scope of the study</p> <p>1.6         Methodology</p> <p>1.7         Definition of terms References</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p>References</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p><strong>MONTESQUIEU’S THEORY OF SEPARATION OF POWERS</strong></p> <p>3.1 An exposition of Montesquieu’s Theory of separation of powers</p> <p>3.2The Composition and Functions of the Legislative organ of Government</p> </div> <div> <p>3</p> </div> <div> <p>3.3The Composition and Functions of the executive organ of Government.</p> <p>3.4  The Composition and Functions of the Judicial Organ of Government</p> <p>References</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p><strong>DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY</strong></p> <p>4.1       Delegation of Authority by the Legislative Organ of Government to The Executive Organ of Government References</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p><strong>EVALUATION AND CONCLUSION</strong></p> <p><strong>5.1</strong><strong>Evaluation</strong></p> <p><strong>5.2 </strong><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>References Bibliography</p> </div> <div> <p>4</p> </div> <div> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.0       <strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The basic reasons for the separation of powers is to ensure</p> <p>freedom and liberty in a society; for if powers should be consolidated in the hands of one person as in a monarchy or a group of persons as in an oligarchy, such people are likely to run the government for their own selfish interests at the expense of the interests of the society and tyranny and oppression will be the order of the day and this can drag a state or nation into a disastrous situation due to its own selfish ambition.</p> <p>Lack of separation of powers will lead to lack of freedom. Political philosophers maintain that it has become the nature of human beings to accumulate power upon power simply because human beings are always power hungry. Awolowo, in his political theory explains thus:</p> <p>5</p> </div> <div> <p>Now it would appear that all political philosophers are agreed that of all human desires the desire for power is the strongest. In other words, of all the ten manifestations of the instinct of self, the most powerful is acquisition –acquisition of power.1</p> <p>It was Lord Anton who once commented that “all power tends to</p> <p>corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely” 2.</p> <p>From the foregoing, it means that it is the natural tendency of human beings in power to expand their power and that after they might have expanded and consolidated such power they make arbitrary use of such at the detriment of the others.</p> <p>The doctrine of separation of powers connotes that when there is separation of power there is likely to be liberty and freedom. Some political thinkers have maintained that one of the advantages of the doctrine is specialization of labour. This means that separation of powers allows for specialization in public administration. The legislature specializes in law making; the executive specialize in the work of administration; while the judiciary specializes in the work of adjudication. This actually makes for efficiency and orderliness in government functions. Inefficiency in public administration naturally</p> </div> <div> <p>6</p> </div> <div> <p>leads to the break down of law and order; and in such a situation, the society finds it difficult to make any progress and its interest cannot be realized, whereas, efficient public administration makes for rapid progress and full realization of the society’s interests. Also, the encroachment of an organ in another’s function further cripples the smooth working of the government.</p> <p>1.1       <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The idea of delegated authority mars the reality of the theory of</p> <p>separation of powers. For instance, the legislature, which is the sole law-making organ, delegates authority to the executive to make laws – delegated legislation; the judiciary also delegate authority to</p> <p>administrative tribunals to adjudicate. 3</p> <p>The different organs of government interact in some areas which make it virtually impossible for there to be absolute separation of powers. For instance, it is the Judiciary that swear-in the executive into</p> </div> <div> <p>7</p> </div> <div> <p>office; it is the executive that appoint the judiciary; the executive</p> <p>prepare the budget and it is approved by the legislature. 4</p> <p>With the above mentioned areas of encroachment and interaction, it becomes impossible for there to be a complete separation</p> <p>of powers. 5</p> <p>To what extent is the legislative, the executive and the Judicial powers of modern government combined and separated? Is it possible for there to be complete separation of powers such that each organ is completely independent of the other such that each performs its functions without any encroachment on the functions of the other? Is it possible for the judiciary to be elected just as the executive is elected and for it to be independent of the other two organs of government in respect of their term of office and not to be appointed and remunerated</p> <p>by them?6 Is it possible for the legislature to make laws that will help regulate the activities of government in all its departments and Parastatals and Local Government Councils in the light of the complex nature of government business?</p> </div>\n\nPHILOSOPHICAL EVALUATION OF CHARLES DE MONTESQUIEU’S THEORY OF SEPARATION OF POWERS VIS- A- VIS THE PRACTICE OF DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PHILOSOPHICAL EVALUATION OF CHARLES DE MONTESQUIEU’S THEORY OF SEPARATION OF POWERS VIS- A- VIS THE PRACTICE OF DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY", "id": 94}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>WESTERN CULTURE AND YORUBA ETHICS: A PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>YOURBA AND WESTERN ETHICS</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1. ETHICS</strong></p> <p>There are many actions which we will condemn as morally wrong and ought not to be done by anybody, for example, stealing, murder, bribery aimed robbery and corruption e.t.c there are also certain actions which everybody considers as morally good e.g kindness, honesty, respect for elders, hospitality e.t.c. Now, why do we say that certain actions are good or right and we see others as bad or wrong­­? How do we determine the badness or wrongness and goodness or rightness of certain actions?.</p> <p>To answer these questions and the likes, we need a science, which deals with human conduct. The science which deals with human conduct is regarded as ethics1. Ethics is therefore a yardstick used for measuring the goodness or rightness and wrongness or badness of certain actions or conducts.</p> <p><strong>1.2. ETHICAL UNIVERSALISM</strong></p> <p>Ethical universalism states that ethical judgment no matter the degree ought to be universalisable. Thus ethical universalism states that one single ethical standard of judgment ought to be held throughout the world.</p> <p>        With ethical Universalist, all actions are to be taken as common to all. This theory or concept claims that for example, an action which is judged “right” or “wrong” “good” or “bad”, “praise worthy” or “blame worthy” in Western countries, ought to be able to accept the same claim among the Yoruba people here in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3   ETHICAL RELATIVISIM</strong></p> <p>        “ Ethical relativism shows diversity or variation of a group or an individual morality. Judgment on mortality in this case depends on individual human conduct”2. However, it is important to know that ethical relativism is contingent on some other basic factors. These include cultural historical and class distinction of an individual or a society. Ethical universalism claims that one single ethical or moral standard of judgment ought to be upheld throughout the universe, while ethical relativism claims, that on the other hand, that whatever action is judged to be praise worthy or blame worthy is relative to individual or a society in a period of time or circumstance.</p> <p><strong>1.4 CULTURAL UNIVERSALISM.</strong></p> <p>The term cultural has been defined in various ways, for example, culture has been defined as; ‘’Every broad general principle of selectivity and ordering --- “highest common factor” ---- in terms of patterns of and for and about behaviour in every various areas of culture content are reducible to parsimonious generalization’’3.</p> <p>From the above definition, its quiet clear that culture can emerge not only from tradition and customs of a given society. It could also be acquired and incorporated into ones existing culture in many other different ways. These other ways include the process by which a person acquires from or a group of persons acquire from contact with other person or group of persons. Like ethical universalism, this theory says that all cultures must be universalizable. What cultural universalism emphasizes is, that if a country ‘’A’’ claims that it is justified to practice culture ‘’Y’. Then if country ‘’A’’s or society ‘’A’’s claim were consistent, it must be agreed upon that other societies or countries ‘’A1’, ‘’A2’’, ‘’A3’’,  ----, ‘’An; would be similarly justified to practice culture ‘’Y’’ in situation ‘’R’’. To do otherwise, would be to make an odd claim.</p> <p><strong>1.5 CULTURAL RELATIVISM</strong></p> <p>Cultural relativism affirms that all values are a functions or product of their culture and reflect the interest of their society and culture. It is a fact of human experience as conditioned by culture.</p> <p>When we study society that is different from one another. For example, in some of the Eskimos group, they think that it is better to take their aged people to waste lands to be left to die rather than keeping them alive in their old age to suffer.</p> <p>This is parricide, others are abortion, euthanasia, human –sacrifice and cannibalism. These examples so given shows that, the rightness or wrongness of human actions means different things to different societies or even between individuals. That is, there can be no set of moral codes or ethical codes. Everyone ought to accept as universally valid or individual.</p> <p><strong>1.6 A BRIEF GENEOLOGY OF THE YORUBAS</strong></p> <p>The Yoruba society or kingdom covers the present day Oyo, Ondo, Ekiti, Osun, Ogun and some other parts of kwara – state and Lagos- state and also extends to the present day republic of Benin. Yoruba society is usually taken together as one entity because of the homogenous traces in their language. Despite it’s many dialects, this language provides the main evidence of a common origin and cultural heritage.  </p> <p>   A second point to a common origin of the Yoruba society is the existence over the whole country of a cycle of myths and its people and the foundations at ‘’Ile-Ife, the worlds center of the first kingdom.</p> <p><strong>1.7 THE YORUBA POLITICAL CULTURE.</strong></p> <p>The key political unit on which government was based in all Yoruba kingdoms was the ‘’Town’’, ‘’Ilu’’ Each kingdom is consisted of many towns, but that did not mean that there were many independent governments in each town or kingdom’’4. The government of the capital served as the central government of the kingdoms, while those of the subordinate towns served as the local government units. Both at the central or local levels, the system of government were monarchical, that, it was headed by an Oba (king) who was entitled to wear a crown.</p> <p>The Oba was divined and was the political and religious head of his town. As head of the government, the Oba was regarded as a divine king, and in theory he had absolute powers of life and death over his people. His attribute was ‘’Oba, alase, ekeji Orisa’’ --- king the ruler and companion of the gods. He was also addressed as ‘’kabiyesi’’ an expression which is said to be contracted from of the sentence ‘’ki-a-bi-o-ko-si’’. That is, there is no question of anyone challenging or querying your authority.</p> <p>In a nutshell, the Oba, in theory, had the power of life and death over his subjects and was as, a divine king not accountable to them for any of his deeds.</p> <p>When the Westerners came, the whole old Yoruba political ethics changed and was viewed in different was. Some people believed that the powers of these divine kings were withdrawn bit by bit under the pretence of indifferent rule system, and that the king’s powers were eroded completely after the western Europeans granted the Yoruba people independence by the politicians who took over the chair of leadership from them.</p> <p>The former role of Obas and chiefs were alternated and decline loyalty of all sorts. The moral or ethical implication of this was obvious and still felt in the present political rulers and Obas relationship among the contemporary Yoruba society. Other observers saw these changes not as obstructive or a complete distortion in the old system but as a sort of political re-organization which still revered the old system and placed the Obas in post which they, by tradition ought to occupy.</p> <p>After all, they said, Obas throughout the Yoruba land are still recognized as the chief priest in all religious and ritual ceremonies.</p> <p><strong>1.8 RELIGIOUS CULTURE</strong></p> <p>        The western missionaries did not bring the idea of God to Yoruba people. They believed in the existence of one ‘’Great God’’ as an integral member of the society as distinct from the western Christian conception of God staying a loof in heaven, in the community of good Angels.</p> <p>     The Yoruba people believed in the existence and power of Deities (spirit) headed by an omnipotent God. Where ever you find a Yoruba man, there also is his religion. Although Yoruba religion is not written down like the sacred’’ Bible’’ of the western Christians, yet all the chapter of the Yoruba religions are written everywhere in the life of the Yoruba people. Among the Yoruba, there are no irreligious people.</p> <p>According to professor John Mbiti, for a Yoruba man to be without religion or not to live a religious life amounts to a self-communication from the entire life of the societ,’’5 and Yoruba people do not know how to exist without religion.’ to the Yoruba’s, man’s character is of supreme importance vand it is this which Oludumare (God) judges.6n, Man’s well-being here  on earth depends upon his character, so also his place in the afterlife is determined by Oludumare. The ethics of the Yoruba’s is a transcendental ethics. This is so because it is ultimately but on an objective transcendental moral order.  Order which is beyond man and is not within his power to alter</p> <p>        Although, Yoruba religion is not written down like the sacred ‘’Bible’’, yet unlike the westerners, Yoruba peoples belief is that, it is not enough to embrace a faith which is confined to church building which is locked up six days and opened only once or twice a week.</p> <p>        Through education the western missionaries were able to produce catechists, pastors, teachers, priests, church- wardens and converts. As a result, Yoruba traditional religion was particularly looked up with disfavour as the missionaries associated it with ‘’idol’’-worship and considered it as hindrance to Christian evangelism and conversion without any consideration for moral values the people attached to it.</p> <p>        This is according to some Yoruba people was the beginning of moral laxity among the contemporary Yoruba’s. Yet others give western religion a positive took, as the big hammer that destroyed immoral practices like human sacrifices killing of twins, euthanasia, cannibalism e.t.c which culminated Yoruba traditional religion and ethics without or with little consideration for ethical relativism.</p> <p>      Furthermore, some see western religion as a tool used to re-integrate the Yoruba youths, which fell prey to social destabilization and eventually became socially designated as a result of rural-urban flux. Finally, the universal moral attitude of western religion has so much transcendental moral or ethical values over and above the Yoruba tradition in such a way that it creates and maintains social solidarity among the Yoruba’s.</p>\n\nWESTERN CULTURE AND YORUBA ETHICS: A PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " WESTERN CULTURE AND YORUBA ETHICS: A PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS", "id": 95}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Robert Nozick (1938-2002) was American philosopher, best known for his rigorous defense of libertarianism in his first major work, <em>Anarchy, State,</em> <em>and Utopia</em> (1974). During his high school and college years, Nozick was a member of the student new left and an enthusiastic socialist. At Columbia, he helped to found a campus branch of the league for industrial democracy, a precursor of the students for a democratic society. While in graduate school he read works by libertarian thinkers such as F. A. Hayak and Ludwig Von Mises, and his political views began to change.

It appeared in the course of the eighteen century in Europe and advanced in England as philosophers grouped together such fields as poetry, sculpture, music, and dance. They classified all the arts into one category and called them les beaux arts or the fine arts. (Severyn)<br/>Philosophers argued that reason on its own fail to explain beauty in that beauty may have some rational properties, such as “order, symmetry, and proportion,” but it is really an experience not explained by reason alone. It is understood through intuition and experienced with human feeling and emotion. An aesthetic experience could include a mixture of feeling, such as pleasure, rage, grief, suffering, and joy. (Severyn)<br/>However, Immanuel Kant construed aesthetics as a field giving main concern to form over function. He then said that beauty was independent of any particular figure with which it was attached. A horse might be beautiful apart from whether it raced well. He proclaimed that knowledge is not something that is created merely by outside institutions but also by our natural constitution. The seat of judgement now moved from medieval reasoning toward the idea that human intuition could be a source of knowing. And aesthetics began to develop as a university discipline. (Severyn)<br/>From many critics today aesthetics does not belong as a university discipline. Art historians have claimed that there is no such thing as art, there are only artists. And postmodernists question whether aesthetics should exist as a university subject, whether it is a legitimate inquiry. On the other hand, some critics repudiate that any universal criteria exist for judging art in all cultures and historical epochs. (Severyn)</p> <p>Given that art historians had argued that there is no such thing as art, therefore definition of art is controversial in contemporary philosophy. Even though art can be defined has also been a matter of controversy, the philosophical usefulness of a definition of art has also been debated. Coming to contemporary definitions they are of two main sorts.</p> <ul><li>One distinctively modern, conventionalist, sort of definition focuses on art’s institutional features, emphasizing the way art changes over time, modern works that appear to break radically with all traditional art, and the relational properties of artworks that depend on works’ relations to art history, art genres, etc.</li> <li>The less conventionalist sort of contemporary definition makes use of a broader, more traditional concept of aesthetic properties that includes more than art-relational ones, and focuses on art’s pan-cultural and trans-historical characteristics.</li> </ul> <p>However, any definition of art has to square with the following uncontroversial facts:</p> <ul><li>entities (artifacts or performances) intentionally endowed by their makers with a significant degree of aesthetic interest, often surpassing that of most everyday objects, exist in virtually every known human culture;</li> <li>such entities, and traditions devoted to them, might be produced by non-human species, and might exist in other possible worlds;</li> <li>such entities sometimes have non-aesthetic ceremonial or religious or propagandistic functions, and sometimes do not;</li> <li>traditionally, artworks are intentionally endowed by their makers with properties, usually perceptual, having a significant degree of aesthetic interest, often surpassing that of most everyday objects;</li> <li>art, so understood, has a complicated history: new genres and art-forms develop, standards of taste evolve, understandings of aesthetic properties and aesthetic experience change;</li> <li>there are institutions in some but not all cultures which involve a focus on artifacts and performances having a high degree of aesthetic interest and lacking any practical, ceremonial, or religious use;</li> <li>such institutions sometimes classify entities apparently lacking aesthetic interest with entities having a high degree of aesthetic interest;</li> <li>many things other than artworks for example, natural entities (sunsets, landscapes, flowers, shadows), human beings, and abstract entities (theories, proofs) are routinely described as having aesthetic properties.</li> </ul> <p>By these very facts, those having to do with art’s cultural and historical topographies are accentuated by some definitions of art. Other definitions of art give main concern to explaining those facts that mirror art’s universality and continuity with other aesthetic phenomena.</p> <p>Traditionally, at least as generally described in contemporary discussions of the definition of art, take artworks to be characterized by a single type of property. The standard candidates are representational properties, expressive properties, and formal properties. So there are representational or mimetic definitions, expressive definitions, and formalist definitions, which hold that artworks are characterized by their possession of, respectively, representational, expressive, and formal properties. (Severyn)</p> <p>It is however not difficult to find fault with these simple definitions. For example, possessing representational, expressive, and formal properties cannot be sufficient conditions, since, obviously, instructional manuals are representations, but not typically artworks, human faces and gestures have expressive properties without being works of art, and both natural objects and artifacts produced for the homeliest utilitarian purposes have formal properties but are not artworks. (Severyn)</p> <p>Disbelief about the likelihood and value of a definition of art has been an important part of the discussion in aesthetics since the 1950s on, and though its influence has subsided, uneasiness about the definitional project persists. ( Kivy 1997, and Walton 2007).</p> <p>Nonetheless a common domestic of arguments, enthused by Wittgenstein’s famous remarks about games (Wittgenstein, 1968), has it that the phenomena of art are, by their nature, too diverse to admit of the unification that a satisfactory definition strives for, or that a definition of art, were there to be such a thing, would exert a stifling influence on artistic creativity. One expression of this impulse is Weitz’s Open Concept Argument: any concept is open if a case can be imagined which would call for some sort of decision on our part to extend the use of the concept to cover it, or to close the concept and invent a new one to deal with the new case; all open concepts are indefinable; and there are cases calling for a decision about whether to extend or close the concept of art. Therefore art is indefinable (Weitz, 1956). Against this it is claimed that change does not, in general, rule out the preservation of identity over time, that decisions about concept-expansion may be principled rather than capricious, and that nothing bars a definition of art from incorporating a novelty requirement.</p> <p>Notably, it is however self-evident that nothing concerning art is self-evident anymore, not its inner life, not its relation to the world, not its right to exist and given to that the penalty of what could be done spontaneously or unproblematically has not been compensated for by the open infinitude of new possibilities that reflection confronts.</p> <p>In numerous respects, development shows up as withdrawal. The depths of the in earlier times inconceivable, on which around 1910 revolutionary art movements set out, did not bestow the promised happiness of adventure. As an alternative, the process that was unchecked consumed the categories in the name of that for which it were undertaken. More was relentlessly hauled into the maelstrom of the newly taboo; everywhere artists rejoiced less over the newly won realm of freedom than that they immediately sought once again after ostensible yet scarcely adequate order.</p> <p>For unconditional freedom in art, constantly limited to a particular, comes into illogicality with the perennial unfree-dom of the whole. Alternatively art became uncertain and therefore the independence it achieved after having freed itself from cultic function and its images was nourished by the idea of humanity.  Thus, as society became ever less a human one, this autonomy was shattered.  Therefore as drawn from the ideal of humanity, art’s constituent elements withered by art’s own law of movement, yet art’s independence remains irrevocable and all efforts to restore art by giving it a social function of which art is itself uncertain and by which it expresses its own uncertainty are doomed.</p> <p>Actually, art’s independence shows signs of blindness. Blindness was ever an aspect of art; in the age of art’s emancipation; however, this blindness has begun to pre-dominate in spite of, if not because of, art’s lost ingenuousness, which, as Hegel already perceived, art cannot undo. This binds art to a naiveté of a second order: the ambiguity over what purpose it serves.</p> <p>On the turn over page, it is uncertain whether art is still possible; whether, with its complete emancipation, it did not sever its own preconditions. This question is kindled by art’s own past. However, artworks detach themselves from the empirical world and bring forth another world, one opposed to the empirical world as if this other world too were an autonomous entity. Therefore, though tragic they appear, artworks tend a priori toward affirmation.</p> <p>Theoretically, the concept of art is situated in a historically changing group of elements; it refuses definition. Its essence cannot be deduced from its origin as if the first work were a foundation on which everything that followed were constructed and would collapse if shaken. The belief that the first artworks are the highest and purest is warmed-over romanticism; with no less justification it could be claimed that the earliest artistic works are dull and impure in that they are not yet separated from magic, historical documentation, and such pragmatic aims as communicating over great distances by means of calls or horn sounds; the classical conception of art gladly made use of such arguments. In bluntly historical terms, the facts blur.2</p> <p>Therefore the effort to incorporate the historical genesis of art ontologically under an ultimate motif would necessarily flounder in such disparate material that the theory would emerge empty-handed except for the obviously relevant insight that the arts will not fit into any gapless concept of art.</p> <p>Moreover in those studies dedicated to the aesthetic, positivistic sampling of material and such speculation as is other-wise disdained by the sciences flourish wildly alongside each other; Bachofen is the best example of this. If, all the same, one wanted in the usual philosophical fashion categorically to distinguish the so-called question of origin as that of art’s essence from the question of art’s historical origin, that would amount only to turning the concept of origin arbitrarily against the usual sense of the word. The order, and therefore it is not substantial in art either. That explains the inconsistency of aesthetic construction. Construction is equally able to codify the resignation of the weakened subject and to make absolute alienation the sole concern of art which once wanted the opposite as it is able to anticipate a reconciled condition that would itself be situated beyond static and dynamic.</p> <p>Furthermore, the numerous interrelations with technocracy give reason to suspect that the principle of construction remains aesthetically obedient to the administered world; but it may terminate in a yet un-known aesthetic form, whose rational organization might point to the abolition of all categories of administration along with their reflexes in art.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Aestheticians have wandered more and more from the usual ground of aesthetic theory into the philosophies of specific arts, such as music, film, dance, or literature.  The philosophies of the arts provide an invigorating role for philosophers.  By focusing on particular arts, philosophers have been able to speak usefully to art historians, musicologists, and literary critics and answer questions in their disciplines:   the nature of our comprehension of film narrative, pictorial perception, moral education in the novel, or composition versus performance-based standards in music, to name only a few.</p> <p>The study view, however, is that aesthetics has not yet faced one the most troubling features of aesthetic life:   the very difficult of knowing our aesthetic experience and the consequent confusion and unreliability of what we take as our taste. This problem could be referred to as aesthetic unreliability which returns us to the very foundations of aesthetics and raises questions about the authority of individuals’ assessments of their aesthetic experience and all that follows from those assessments.</p> <p>On the other hand, aesthetic unreliability requires us to reconsider the individual as both good judge and consumer.  It suggests alternative explanations for some of the more curious features of cultural life, namely, that our taste is often incoherent, the practice of criticism largely arbitrary and creative practices something of a free-for-all.  Aesthetic unreliability supports the view that our inner aesthetic lives are more anarchic, protean, and unknown than we have been willing to admit.</p> <p>It is noted that the philosophical discipline of aesthetics deals with theoretical problems arising out of the critical examination of art and the aesthetic. Monroe Beardsley in his book titled general aesthetics Problems in the Philosophy of Criticism as of 1958, implying that aesthetics is about philosophical concepts that are used repeatedly undiplomatically by critics of the arts, when they say that a work of art such as a painting is beautiful or has aesthetic value, that it represents some subject matter, has a well-composed form, is in a particular style, and expresses some emotion. But aesthetics also deals more broadly with the aesthetics of nature (Budd 1996, Carlson 2000) and gardens (Ross 1998), and with the aesthetic appreciation of objects and activities in everyday life (Dewey 1934). And even when focused on the arts, philosophical aesthetics is concerned with the philosophical problems that arise from the artist’s point of view as well as the critic’s.</p> <p>Consequently creativity, expression, representation, form, and style are problems that can be addressed from the artist’s point of view as well as the spectator’s. Besides, “the philosophy of criticism” does not do justice to the breadth of concerns addressed by philosophical aesthetics today. Some of the thorniest issues in aesthetics relate directly to problems in general philosophy: What is aesthetic value? Do the arts provide knowledge? Is there a special kind of aesthetic experience or aesthetic perception? Most of the questions that come up in theorizing about particular art forms the philosophy of literature, the theory of the visual arts, the philosophy of music, the philosophy of film, environmental arts and so on are general questions having implications for other art forms.</p> <p>Some theorists, on the other hand, think that the individual arts come with their own exceptional sets of philosophical problems (Kivy 1997). The problem of the experience and value of absolute music, for example, does not have a clear parallel in any of the other arts, including the other abstract arts (Kivy 1990). Authenticity is a particular problem in the performing arts such as dance and music. But for the most part, questions in the philosophy of art have general application across the arts. Thus the problem of the nature of fictional characters has usually been taken to be a problem about literature, but representational works of visual art also contain fictional people, objects and events (Walton 1990). Similarly, the question as to why people get emotionally involved with fictional characters may seem to be unique to films and novels (Carroll 1990, Currie 1990, Feagin 1996, Lamarque 1996), but it applies equally to fictions in works of visual art. Again, the question why people enjoy tragedies is not peculiar to tragedies: It is the same kind of question as the question why do people listen to sad music if it makes them feel sad (Davies 1994, Levinson 1990)?</p> <p>This ephemeral overview first discusses the aesthetic in general and then turns to problems peculiar to the arts. It ends with some general remarks about how aesthetics connects to more general questions about knowledge, emotion, and value. Some effort has been made to point out how the most important concepts of aesthetics came to be considered important. The tendency of late-twentieth-century philosophy especially analytic philosophy has been to treat the problems of aesthetics as timeless problems having correct answers that will be true of all art works and aesthetic experiences no matter where or when they occur. For that reason, one should approaches aesthetics with an eye to the historical background from which its characteristic problems emerged and one will however have a better sense not only of what those problems are but also of the different ways they have been conceptualized and why which is one of the ways to solving the problem of the study.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Though countless researchers have printed on paper the theory of arts and aesthetics, a reality to contemporary society in Nigeria, it is significance to note that the theory of arts and aesthetics was brought to light as far back in 18th century. However, as regards the aesthetic principles. These include the expectations that art is to be found principally in objects, that the evaluation of art objects is the major goal of aesthetics, and that in order to evaluate art objects a set of classificatory principles is necessary, so that appropriate objects may be grouped together for comparative judgment. Therefore the study exercise is significant to the extent that one should be able;</p> <ul><li>To know the evolution of the theory of arts and aesthetics.</li> <li>To proffer a lasting solution to the disbelief about the likelihood and value of a definition of art.</li> <li>To re-examine the rights of the principles of the theory of arts and aesthetics.</li> <li>To determine what satisfactory and fair contribution of the theory of arts and aesthetics.</li> <li>To appraise the several statutory influence of the theory of arts and aesthetics related enactments, pointing out their adequacies, shortcomings and making suggestions for way forward.</li> </ul> <p><strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is aimed at assessing the theory of arts and aesthetics, a reality to contemporary society: Katian Approach. On the other hand, the choice of this topic stems from the very fact that though the course is a technical one and many researchers have written on the theory of arts and aesthetics, it is significance to note that the theory of arts and aesthetics was brought to light as far back in 18th century, classificatory principles is necessary, so that appropriate objects may be grouped together for comparative judgment. In view of that, objectives in this work will be to</p> <ul><li>examine the theoretical framework which backed the theory of arts and aesthetics and define definite technical terms</li> <li>assess the katian approach to the theory of arts and aesthetics, a reality to contemporary society.</li> <li>highlight weaknesses and shortcomings in the existing establishment.</li> <li>offer solution to the confusion existing in the theory of arts and aesthetics</li> <li>make certain that propositions are made geared towards ensuring that further improvement can be made to enhance the implementation of the theory of arts and aesthetics over unnecessary issues.</li> <li>reorganize the theory of arts and aesthetics in setting independent argument</li> </ul> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <ul><li>What is an aesthetic experience?</li> <li>How can an aesthetic value be distinguished?</li> <li>What is so important about this experience?</li> <li>Why does an object become beautiful? How do we define beauty?</li> <li>How is art to be judged?</li> <li>How is a judgement the expression of an epoch?</li> <li>Is art independent of politics?</li> <li>How is a work of art produced?</li> </ul> <p><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>The major thoughtfulness of our consideration is the question is aesthetics a legitimate discipline for the university? This is the subject of our examination.  To do this commendably, we will suggest that the answers come slowly as we learn more about our nature and the universe. However, we will look at an appraisal of aesthetics from the standpoint of race, class, and gender. The critique below proposes to eliminate aesthetics as a subject in the university. Therefore, we will also examine how a new aesthetics could be constructed as a university discipline.  Furthermore, we will set forth a basis for its new agenda. The agenda begins with what we call theoretical and general aesthetics. Finally, i will conclude that art is a vital discipline for development in civil society through adequate verification.</p>\n\nTHE THEORY OF ARTS AND AESTHETICS, A REALITY TO CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY: KATIAN APPROACH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE THEORY OF ARTS AND AESTHETICS, A REALITY TO CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY: KATIAN APPROACH", "id": 97}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THEORETICAL FRAME WORK</strong></p> <p><strong>USES AND GRATIFICATION THEORY: </strong>(Lazaisfeld and Stanbon (1944)<br/>Uses and gratification theory has provided a frame work for examining the satisfaction of needs and interests through different forms of communications media (Kartz, Blumler and Gvievitch, 1974). If two media serve similar needs then they can act as functional alternatives. However, if they are designed to serve different needs then they are specialized. One type of medium they be preferred to another if it is better at fulfilling certain needs such as entertainment or socializing (Peise and Courtright, 1993). Uses and gratifications theory has been employed in different forms of social communications because of the goal-directed nature of communications behaviour (Rubin and Rubin, 1985). The motives at play, such as relaxation or the acquisition of information can be quite different depending on the types of communication media used such as the television or the internet (Fergusion and Peise, 2000). Studies also found out that the motives for being using a computer mediated communication (CMC) were different from motives for using face-to-face communication was rated higher that the computer mediated communication (CMC) for all motives, including social ones like inclusion and affection.<br/>Two forms of media may be so different that they alter social uses and social communication. At least in terms of romantic relationships, it has been suggested that interaction on the internet are different from face-to-face interactions. The anonymity afforded by the internet allows relationship to proceed quickly to intimate levels because of the limitations of other aspects of social contact (Merkle and Richardson, 2000). In some studies, individuals have been found to communicate less frequently and closely with internet partners than with non-internet partners. However, the internet is rated as less useful than face-to-face communication for maintaining social relationships.<br/>Past research has employed uses and gratifications theory to examine motives, interest and attitudes behind face-to-face online communication (Ferguson and Persie, 2000). Flahertl et al., 1998)/ the theory suggests that if individuals find face-to-face communication and online communication useful to reach similar goals, then they will use the two media similarly. One should expect similar motives at work in the two forms of communication. If, however the uses of communication over the internet were different form those of face-to-face communication, then one could expect different motives as a factor in the two forms of communication.<br/>High sociability and low shyness have been associated with increased traditional social behaviour (Asendorpf and Wipers, 1998; Bruch et al., 1989). Past research also indicates that high sociability would be associated with increased internet social communication. The greater anonymity provided by the internet suggests that, the motives maybe somewhat different in the two forms of social communication. The internet may also help reduce social anxiety experienced by shy individuals. This effect may led to somewhat different patterns of use in the two media for shy individuals. If this is the case, the motives behind traditional and internet social communication maybe somewhat different.<br/><strong>THEORY OF NEED AFFILIATION: </strong>Mcleiland (1958)<br/>The need for affiliation by David Mccelland (1958) he says. Describes a person’s need to feel a sense of involvement and “belonging” within a social group; according to Murray (1938), people with a high need for affiliation require warm interpersonal relationships and approval from those with whom they have regular contact. People who place high emphasis on affiliation tend to be supportive team members, but may be less effective in leadership positions.<br/>A research done by Schactee (1959) shows that fear that comes form anxiety increases the need for the person to affiliate with others who are going thorough the same situation or that could help them through the stressful event. Individuals are motivated to find and create a specific amount of social interactions. Each individuals desires a different amount of a need for affiliation and they desire an optimal balance of time to their self and time spent with others. This particular need concerns the desire to be associated with specific people and groups, to have a greater sense of belonging and place. It can play a role in a variety of human interactions and in the formation of bonds and friendships.<br/><strong>Theory of social interaction: </strong>Hannah Humphrey<br/>Social interaction theory studies the ways that people engage with one another. Scholars from many disciplines including anthropology, sociology, psychology, and linguistic are interested in social interaction and the patterns that can be found in such interactions. According to Max Weber, social behaviour has two components. The first is the action or the behaviour itself. The second is the meaning that the ctor attaches to is or her behaviour. That meaning Weber refereed to as orientation, is how a person perceives his behaviour in relationship to other people. It is that knowledge of another who is affected that makes an action or interaction social.<br/>Another early contribution to social interaction theory was Geiman- American Kurt Lewin, who developed the concept of group dynamics. Lewin was concerned with the interaction not just between individuals but between individuals and the groups that they belong to. The main contribution of group dynamics to later theories is that human behaviour results from the interaction between a person and his or her environment. Lewing wrote this theory as a mathematical equation, making behaviour equal to the function of individuals and the environment.<br/><strong>Theories of personality </strong><br/><strong>CARL JUNGS THEORY OF INTROVERSION AND EXTROVERSION (1933)</strong><br/>Carl Jung (1933). According to his theory I am introvert is s person whose interest is generally directed inward toward his own feelings and thoughts, in constant to an extravert, who attention is directed towards other people and the outside world. Conversely, Jung explains that a person who is predominantly introverted tends to orient toward the internal or subjective world, while extroversion refers to an outgoing, social, accommodating nature that adapts easily to a given situation, quickly make friends and often venture forth with careless confidence into an unknown situation. He viewed introversion as signifying a hesitating reflective, retering nature that keeps to itself, shrinks from objects, always slightly in the defensive and prefer to hide behind mistrustful scrutingy. (Jung, 1964). Jung explained that although a person may be extraverted at time and introverted at some other times, he cannot be both introverted and extraverted on the same occasion.<br/><strong>Eysenck: Introversion-Extraversion (1967)</strong><br/>Eysenck (1967) formulated a theory, which emphasizes introversion-Extraversion in terms of observed behaviour tendencies and presumed underlying neurological states. At the behaviour level, the typical extrover6t is sociable, needs to have people to talk to and does not like reading or studying by himself (Eysenck and Eysenck, 1968).</p>\n\nINFLUENCE OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL NETWORKING (E.G FACEBOOK) ON PHYSICAL INTERACTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INFLUENCE OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL NETWORKING (E.G FACEBOOK) ON PHYSICAL INTERACTION", "id": 98}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE ROLE OF SEX HORMONES </strong><br/>During childhood, the capacity of sexual response and the experience of sexual pleasure as well as the potential for orgasm exists at least in a proportion of children whether this apparently variable potential among childrenreflects different learning experiences during childhood, different opportunities for realizing the potential or different gentile influences is not known. The importance of gonadal hormones in particular testosterone, in organizing early brain development and function has been discussed earlier. During childhood, gonadal steroid hormones are title in evidence, but from the ages of 9 or 10 years they start to increase as the child approaches puberty from there on we have to consider the activating role of those hormones on sexuality and the impact they have on sexuality, and the impact they have on sexuality, and the impact they have on sexuality during three stages of the life course around puberty and during early adolescence during adulthood until muddle age, and during the later years. <br/>An adult male’s continued interest in sex depends on he’s having a normal level of circulating testosterone. If an otherwise normal male has his testosterone lowered by testicular suppressive drugs, he experiences a decline in sexual interest, which returns when the process is reversed. In case of testicular impairment (primary or secondary hypogonadison). When testosterone level fall below normal range almost all males experience a decline in sexual interest and capacity for ejaculation. This is reversed by testosterone replacement the raphy. This is a robust, predictable finding across a substantial number of placebo-controlled studies. A similar pattern is observed with spontaneous erection during sleep, or nocturnal penile tumescence, which decline and return with testosterone withdrawal and replacement these erections are interesting manifestations of the sexually arousability of the brain uncomplicated by cognitive processes, and this evidence clearly points to the role of testosterone in central sexual arousal mechanism it is important to emphasis, however, that normal levels of testosterone are necessary but not sufficient for normal levels of sexual desire. These are the factors which can inhibit or alter sexual desire in the presence of normal testosterone levels. <br/>The role of testosterone the become less clear as men get older there is a normal, but variable, tendency for tester one levels of decline on men beyond the fifth decade, and this is often accompanied by an age-related decline in sexual interest. This is sometimes referred to inappropriately as the “male menopause” However, there is no clear evidence that that this pattern can be reversed by testosterone replacement. It is possible that there is a decline in responsiveness to testosterone in addition to a fall in the hormone level (Schiavs, 1999). <br/>There is also a common (though variable) age-related decline in erectile responsiveness, such that are men get older erections develop less consistently and are less strong and less well-sustained. The mechanisms for this are not well understood but may be related to change in neuro transmitter responsiveness in erectile tissues (Cerner and Chirst, 2000).<br/><strong>THE SIDE EFFECTS OF DRUGS</strong><br/>Given the complexity of the brain, and its mechanism of control, it is not surprising that anyone mechanism in  involved in a variety of different response patterns. Thus mechanisms relevant to control to sexual response may also be relevant to control of other motivated behaviours such as eating or aggressive behaviour for this season it is difficult to develop drugs which selectively influence specific aspects of brain function. As a consequence, drugs developed for one purpose have other unwanted or unintended side effect. Sexual side effects of drugs aimed at the as are not uncommon although biochemical mechanisms in the CNS are enormously complex, as previously discussed, we can consider drug effects which are likely to be predominantly central and those repdominantly peripheral. We can also consider drugs which have serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaninergic effects. The best examples are modery anticlegressanys which involve inhibition of serotonin re-take (SSRI’S such as flutxcline; Rosen, lane, &amp; menace (2001). Such drug commonly inhibit organism in women or decay ejaculation in men, and are used to treat problems of repaid ejaculation.</p>\n\nTHE BEHAVIORAL TERAOGENIC EFFECT OF CIMETIDINE ON THE OFFSPRINGS OF ALBINO RATS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE BEHAVIORAL TERAOGENIC EFFECT OF CIMETIDINE ON THE OFFSPRINGS OF ALBINO RATS", "id": 99}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p> A CRITIQUE OF DAVID HUME’S EMPIRICISM </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1. BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The search for knowledge that is both absolute and certain has been continuous. However, since at least the time of Aristotle, there has been a strong epistemological tradition based mainly on human experience, which is not directed towards the possibility of achieving absolute knowledge.</p> <p>This tradition is a typical example of the doctrine of empiricism. Empiricists argue that it is unreasonable to set a goal of absolute and all-inclusive knowledge, especially when there is close at hand the power to increase practical knowledge by slower but dependable methods.</p> <p>Empiricist are content in building a system of knowledge that has a high probability of being true even though it’s absolute certainty cannot be guaranteed.</p> <p>David Hume is one of the greatest empiricists in the history of epistemology and metaphysics who has distinguished himself as a consistent and coherent radical empiricist.</p> <p>According to him, the only true knowledge is experimental, and any concept that is not available to sense perception is mere fanciful thinking.</p> <p>The only abstract objects of the abstract science or of demonstration are quantity and number, and all attempts to extend this more perfect species of knowledge beyond these bounds are mere sophistry and illusion.1</p> <p>With an ideological ferocity, he calls for a book-burning campaign of any metaphysical work.</p> <p>He proclaims:</p> <p>When we run over libraries persuaded of these (empirical) principles, what havoc must we make? If we take in our hand any volume: of or school metaphysics, for instance lets ask does it contain any abstract reasoning containing quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter-of-fact and existence? No. Commit to it to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.2</p> <p>Hume’s proposal of vigorous sensism as an alternative to our natural and acquired scientific, metaphysical and socio-cultural deposits, creates more problems than it resolves. It withers all foundation of science and philosophy. It leaves us in make-shift, sandy subjectivism of dry empiricism.</p> <p>David Hume’s empiricism within the context of knowledge is great, but a consistent empirist will end up destroying the very foundation of knowledge. The epistemological, scientific and ontological heritage of humanity is we think more than a series of impressions.3 To reduce them as bundles of impressions. To reduce them as bundles of impressions as Hume would want to believe is myopic.</p> <p>The above as a way of introduction forms the background of our study.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>There are problems in Hume’s theory of empiricism. The major one arises in an attempt to answer the question of how reliable is our senses. Very often, our senses deceive us. This is true when we see a mirage, in the changing size of objects according to our psychological and physiological state, in hallucination and other forms of illusions.</p> <p>The problem is that there is no way of immediately differentiating the real from the unreal in such situations. The mirage for example is an effect caused by hot air in deserts or on roads, that makes you think you can see something, such as water, which is not there.</p> <p>Now the question is, how do we differentiate between a true sense experience from a false or illusory sense experience?</p> <p>Thus, arises the famous arguments from illusion which places doubts on the reliability of sense experience.</p> <p><strong>1.3   PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It has already been pointed out that David Hume maintained a radical stand in his position on knowledge acquisition by maintaining that knowledge comes only from sense experience. He did this by drawing out the problems inherent in reason as a source of knowledge.</p> <p>The purpose of this study is therefore to examine David Hume’s position and also to show that in as much as we agree that human beings acquire knowledge through senses experience, sense experience alone cannot constitute or guarantee knowledge. Just as Jacques Maritain pointed out that every philosophical system contains some truth and tells something about the real, some philosophies however exaggerate their claims and this is where they then run into problems. This is so with David Hume, he ran into this kind of problem and this was because though knowledge can be acquired through sense experience, he exaggerated the position by maintaining that knowledge can only come through sense experience.</p> <p>It therefore becomes part of the purpose of this study to point out some of these problems as we can in order to show that though sense experience leads to knowledge, however knowledge does not stop there after there are some limitations to the senses in epistemological procedure so that whatever information we receive through the senses are subjected to judgment before it is accepted.</p> <p><strong>1.4   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>When this work is completed, it is our hope that it is going to be of importance in the sense that at least we would have succeeded in bringing to light some of the very important aspects of David Hume’s empiricism and at the same time would have also succeeded in pointing out problems inherent in it.</p> <p>The work will equally be of help or assistance to students who will want to do some works in the area of David Hume’s empiricism as it will provide some aid to them by providing them with a kind of insight into the nature of Hume’s empiricism. But we must point out here that this work should not be taken as all there is in Hume’s empiricism. But where however, we could not cover, the references. That appear at the end of the work will therefore be adequate to direct or refer students to where information as regards those areas will be gathered.</p> <p>To people who may not be doing works on David Hume`s Empiricism; to non-philosophers, who may thus be reading for knowledge acquisition or for pleasure, this work will equally be of immense help as the approach that will be adopted here and the choice of works will not be difficult to understand. </p> <p><strong>1.5   SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>We have already shown from the title of this work that this work is concerned with providing a critique of David Hume’s empiricism. However, just as it is done in every critical study, we are not going to rush into the criticism just like that, we therefore will have a guide or focus as regards what to criticize. Hume’s empiricism itself is to provide the guide because, as we are going to criticize it, we will have to present his empiricism so as to point out what it entails. After doing this, we will then know how to anchor our criticism to the problems we will observe, having discovered the nature of Hume’s Empiricism.</p> <p><strong>1.6   METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>The method to be adopted in this work is that of critical study. As the work is on David Hume’s empiricism, the method will therefore be, first of all to present a general overview of empiricism. After this we will then narrow our attention down to Hume’s notion of the subject matter empiricism. It will be after presenting these that we will therefore settle down to criticize.</p> <p>For the purpose of convenience however, our criticism is going to be in two phases.  The first phase will be to provide the attacks which had been leveled against Hume’s empiricism by other people, this is because we are quite aware that Hume’s empiricism has come under attacks over the years.</p> <p>The second phase of the criticism will therefore be our own criticism. We will here point out as will be able, some of those problems Hume’s empiricism are shrouded with due to Hume’s radical position, and based on these, we will therefore draw our criticisms against his empiricism.</p> <p><strong>1.7   LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p>Our aim here is to provide the reader with the knowledge of some of the texts used in this work. But first of all, David Hume’s book constitute primary literature.</p> <p>In his book, “An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding” edited by Eric Steinberg and published by Hacket Publishing Company, Indianapolis in 1977,4 David Hume was bent on demonstrating that an enquiry, the objects of human reason will be discovered to include only relations of ideas and matters of fact. These are only two categories under which any knowledge that is certain can be placed. All issues dealing with numbers are intuitively certain and therefore under “relations of ideas” where anything discoverable by experience is under “matters of fact”.</p> <p>Also, in another book, “David Hume and problem of reason; recovering – the human sciences” (published by Yale University Press in 1990)5, John Danford explained how skepticism concerning the ability of reason to lead to knowledge acquisition led to Hume’s position was to show that when reason is cut loose or severed from experience, it can only generate irresolution and confusion.</p> <p>In the book, A Critical Account of the philosophy of Kant, published by James Maclehose in 1876,6 we see Edward. Caird showing Hume claims about the passivity of the mind in knowledge acquisition on through the ”association of ideas”. Here the mind is shown as not actively dealing with given materials to come up with knowledge but as finding already in the very data of sensation certain natural relations or associative principle by virtue of which one idea calls up another and therefore present a clear picture of something to the mind.</p> <p><strong>END NOTES</strong></p> <ol><li>David Hume, An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, edited by Eric Steinberg, (Indianapolis: Hacket Publishing Co. 1977), p. 112.</li> <li>Ibid pg. 114.</li> <li>Pentaleon Iroegbu, Metaphysics: The Kpim of Philosophy, (Owerri): International Universities Press, 1995), p. 179.</li> <li>Op Cit.</li> <li>John W.

An exponent of totalitarianism for example would want to argue that states authority and powers superceded the liberties and right of the citizens. The totalitarianism would justify a state’s interference on rights and liberties because they usually see the state as a higher organism then the individuals, accordingly to them, if these small organism (individuals) are to actuate their potentials, the state a higher organism of which they are a part, should first actualize it’s potentials before a favourable atmosphere can be created for individuals to achieve theirs.</p> <p>The liberalists on the other hand would want to argue that the rights and liberties of individuals be abundantly unrestricted. They tend to perceive the person in the state individually and they feel he should be given a great amount of freedom to develop his innate potentials to the maximum. The purpose of this essay is to answer the rather vexed question being asked in political philosophy, is there any condition whatsoever in which the state can justifiably, interfere in the rights and liberties of the citizens? Or put differently, is it justifiable for human beings to be born free naturally and yet be put in chains by the artificial organism called the state?</p> <p>For the purpose of actualizing the aim of this essay, an objective position would be maintained without taking into cognizance the position of the totalitarian and the liberalist as exemplified above rather, logical and morally substantive argument would be used to support this essay. Logical in the sense that the state is logically bound to interfere with rights and liberties of individuals on the basis of their definitions and function that could ascribed to individuals on the other. While the moral argument is based on the function the state has perform for the citizens that is functions which are morally good or geared toward moral ends.</p> <p>This essay is also aimed at resolving the famous J.J. Rousseau’s Paradox that “Men are born free but everywhere are in chains”1 This justification will employ the argument that men needs some amount of restraint which men are lacking and ought to be headed, which made them transcends the state of nature to a well organized state. If it is assumed that this need has been consciously realized and people went into a contract which now resembles a contract situation can be justified in behaving in a certain manner to obviate the circumstance the need for which led to the formation of a state.</p> <p>Hegel’s theory of the state, and what he said about the relationship between the state and its citizens could also justify it, according to Hegel there is no other power superior to the sovereign state disputes or conflicts between different individuals in the state are settled by the state through the enacted laws and not through whimes and Caprices.</p> <p> The state according to him is not a human construction freely and deliberately set up by some kind of social contract. Human beings did not decide to form a state to provide their needs, as we are told by philosophers like Thomas Hobbes and John Locke.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE GENERAL PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>A lot of misconceptions have been made about the relations that exist between the state and its citizens especially when it relates to power, authority and rights activism.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will help to unravel the sticking relationship between the state and its citizenry as regards the power of the state and right activism which would in turn help to maintain a cordial relationship between the citizenry and the state power.</p> <ol><li><strong>DEFINITION AND ORIGIN OF THE STATE</strong></li> </ol> <p>1. DEFINITION OF STATE</p> <p>The question of what really is a state has never been an easy one because the state has been conceived of in different ways and varying perspectives. Some people have conceived of the state through its function aims.</p> <p>The state is seen as a people living in a given territory under one law with a single governmental system extending to all of them and to no one else, are the members of a state, but the state as an institution does not embrace all roles in which they are but only political or legal roles.</p> <p>Though this definition is too specific because it makes it categorically clear that the state can only plays political or legal roles and it will not be taken seriously within the ambits of this essay. In any case, to gasp or capture the basic aim of this essay, a brother analysis of the definition of the state is required; hence it becomes necessary to employ the two concepts of a state highlighted above.</p> <p><strong>2.  STATE CONCEIVED OF IN TERMS OF FUNCTION</strong></p> <p>Every state irrespective of its population size and economic potentials strives to promote peaceful relations among its people as well as its outside relationship with other foreign state. Based on that conception of the state, it is agreed that it is the duty of the state to promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. The state is an institution set up to promote social good on the largest possible scale. And in attempting to achieve this purpose, the tendency is for government to make themselves more and more conspicuous especially by the planning of economic life.  The state aims first at ensuring the protection of integrity of the territory from foreign aggression and the personal security of the individuals. To achieve this goal the state defines and punished crimes. Administer justice, maintain the police and fighting forces and conducts of civil disobedience these activities of state are refers to by liberalists as interference.</p> <p>          The state protects the right to private property, together with the right to the free transference of properly to fulfil contracts freely entered into political rights and duties is also another basic function they have to perform, the state determined the political rights and duties of citizens, passes laws to regulate voting and gives directives on other voting procedures.</p> <p>          From the above conceptual analysis of the state, it becomes imperative to note that modern state is a social service state, a positive state as compared to the role of the citizens, to uphold social standards to prevent exploitation and manifest justices to remove the needles hazards of economic struggle and to assure and advance the general interest against carelessness or selfishness of particular groups.</p> <p>          Granting the function of a state and many other which the state still exercises power on. It is also important to consider the state from the conception of characteristics and nature.</p> <p><strong>CHARACTERISTIC OF A STATE</strong></p> <p>According to this view, there are certain basic characteristics that are common to all either jointly or singularly designate them as state, much characteristics and nature includes. :</p> <ol><li><strong>Territory</strong>: - There must be a given territory and this is the basic characteristics, a group of people has to be necessary like within a given territory boundary to be regarded as a state not minding whether the group is homogeneous. The territory must be defined and endorsed with all the resources like air, space, minerals, technology, climate and geography.</li> <li><strong>Population</strong>:- It must have a definable number of population with distinct characteristics features.</li> </ol> <p>iii. <strong>Government</strong>: the state must have a government, a body of people charged with the responsibility of controlling the state machinery of power with all institutions.</p> <p>iv. <strong>Constitution</strong>: - Moreover, a state must here the ability to wield power with absolute jurisdiction within the given territory and these powers are enshrined in the codified laws called constitution. People come together to regulate their progress among themselves and to achieve this goes a constitution is promulgated. A constitution is an agreed fundamental principle written legal or extra on which a particular state operates.</p> <p>v. <strong>Legitimacy</strong>: - With this characteristics, a state makes itself accepted to the people and its polices and decision are binding within that territory. The state both civilian and military tries to legitimate their coming by the ills of the past government.</p> <p><strong>1.2   ORIGIN OF THE STATE.</strong></p> <p>          The origin of the state poses a problem in political philosophy because it lacks the elements of history and anthropological works. Among the first question which political theories raised are. What are the causes that brought the original establishment of modern states?</p> <p>There are various theories concerning the beginning of the state</p> <p>a. The divine right theory</p> <p>b. The force theory</p> <p>c. The evolutionary theory</p> <p>e. The social contract theory</p> <p>          However, for the purpose of actualizing the objectives of this essay, it becomes necessary to discuss the four common theories relevant to the theme. </p> <p><strong>a. Theory of the Divine Origin:-</strong> This is the school of thought that has it that the state came into being as a result of divine creation. It must have been as punishment of mankind. Medical period this theory reigned supreme, they believed that the state has been established by the ordinance of God, its have been established by an ordinance of God, Its rules are divinely appointed; they are accountable to no authority but God. Thus we are told in the bible.</p> <p>Let every soul be subject into the higher powers, for there is no power but God. Whosoever therefore resisted the power resisted the ordinance of God and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation3.</p> <p>From the above biblical extract, it is clear that a king being the head of a state can never be monstrously vicious even if a king is wicked, it means God has sent him as a punishment for people’s sin’s and has laid upon them, granting the above views to be true, it is clear that the actions of the state to the individuals are justify, they are not regarded as interference because of the fact that all the government activities.</p> <p><strong>b. The Force Theory:-</strong> In its simplest form this theory may be stated thus; War begat the king. The state is the result of the subjugation of the weaker by the stronger. It is the belief that the state came into being as a result of conquest or coercion. Hume gave an expression to this similar idea of this theory. That the first ascendant of one man over multitudes began during a state of war, where the superiority of courage and of genius discoveries itself most visibly where the pernicious effects of disorder are most sensibly felt. The long continuance of that state, an incident common among savage tribes, incurred the people to submission4.</p> <p>          A state is founded when a leader with his band of warriors get permanent control of a definite territory of a considerable size.</p> <p>          Historically speaking there is not the slightest difficulty in proving that all political communities of the modern types are their existence to successful warfare5.</p> <p>          Thrasy Machus would support this view, according to him, “Justice is the interest of the stronger”, Rulers makes laws to protect their interest which automatically becomes what is just and right thus justice in every state is the interest of the stronger.</p> <p><strong>c. The Evolutionary Theory: -</strong> This considers the state, neither as a divine institution nor as a deliberate human contrivance, it sees the state coming into existence as a result of natural evolution. The preposition that the state is a result of history means that the state is a gradual and continuous development of human society. Out of a grossly imperfect beginning through crude but improving form of manifestation towards a perfect and universal organization of man.</p> <p>          Political consciousness is spontaneous, natural twin born, with man and the family, Aristotle was simple stating a fact when he said man is by nature a political animal. The needs for order and security is an ever present factors, man knows instinctively that he can develop the best of which he is capable only by some form of political organization. At first, it might be that the political unconsciousness, but just as the forces of nature operated long before the law of gravitation, political organization rested on the comity of mind, unconscious, dimly conscious of fully conscious of certain moral ends presents through out the whole course of development.</p> <p><strong>d. The Social Contract Theory:-</strong> The substances of this theory is that the state is the result of an agreement entered into by men who originally had no government organization, this means that the history of the world is divisible into two clear periods. The periods before the state was instituted and the period after. In the first place, there was no state no human authority to formulate laws, men lived subject to the laws of nature. After some time they parted with their natural liberties and agreed to obey the laws prescribed by the state.</p> <p>          The idea of a social contract could be seen as people suffering from anarchy as illustrated by the proverbial tendency of a large fish swallowing a small one. In his work the crito,6 Socrates is presented as awaiting calmly the execution of his sentence, even though he considered it unjust, because he would not break his covenant with the state by escaping from prison into exile.</p> <p>          There are three notable social contracts theorists; they are John Hocke (1632 – 1704). Thomas Hobbes (1588 – 1679) J.J. Rousseau (1912 – 1978). The contractarians have a common view, they all used the theory of the state of nature as a premise in arriving at the theory of the social contract. They have a common departure which is the state of nature but their point of divergent is the disagreement on how the state of nature. Despite their diverse views the fact remains that the state of nature was not favourable enough to enhance political, social and economic development, hence the social contract. Every person is expected to obey the rules of the state and any individual that disobeyed must be forced to conform or suffer the penalty, every individual must be forced to be free, that is obeying the state.</p> <p><strong>1.3   FUNCTIONS OF THE STATE</strong></p> <p>          Having studies the definitions and origin of the state it become necessary to link up such pervious analysis to the role, they are to perform on behalf of the citizens. The main aim of the state is the good of all in the society. The state Aristotle tells us, originated for the purpose of life. The end of the state is therefore, ethical the state exists for the increase of its population or wealth or for empire or the extension of its influence. It exists for the exercise of the qualities, which make men good citizens, good husband father, neighbors, and good heads of households. The ethic end of the state is subordinated to convenience in Hocke. His concern is not with the “Good” but with the “Convenient”. The great end of men uniting into state is the preservation of their personal rights and liberties.</p> <p>          All state, no matter the nature performs almost the same function such function could be classified into two:</p> <ol><li>The function as a night watchman</li> <li>The paternalistic function</li> </ol> <p>The function of a night watchman: This is the first major function of a state, this function sees the state as playing more as a passive function, for the state facts as a mere overseer. But the state does in fact in some cases perform more active function on good moral grounds than a more overseers, bearing in mind the modern challenges of a state such as economic, education and technological development and a situation where the general welfare of the citizens is used as a surrogate for measuring a good state. Robert Norzick conceives of the state in terms of a minimal function of the night watchman. In this case, the state performs the limited functions of preventing theft, fraud promotion of the enforcement of contracts and agreement guards against the use of force7.</p> <p>The paternalistic functions: By this function the state can make demands of affirmative action or restraint forms its members. The father should be seen to promise a positive role and in the sense of what the law does by prohibition in terms of negative ends. This involves the choice of actions for citizens in bid to promote their welfare and happiness.</p> <p>This paternalistic function is a way of providing the positive aspects of liberties for citizens by way of social services such as school, good roads, hospitals, water, electricity to mention a few. To achieve these aims for example, the state might be seen by haven to impose taxation which might be seen by the people as interference. The paternalistic upon which mind and character may develop them selves. Similarly, the state is to maintain order, peace and security for its citizens, therefore creating a good habitat or environment for them to actualized their potentialities which is the only condition by which Aristotle could regard the state as good. This, the state does by providing for the law enforcement agent to prevent violence that might obviate a peaceful atmosphere.</p> <p>The state through those involvement punishes offenders in order to maintain social equilibrium. In the process rights and liberties are safeguard which is necessary for the well being of all, but at the same time, a violation of the natural tendencies are being put under check.</p> <p>It could be observed that the function of the state is not basically to build individual character but rather the group character, the state is concerned with the general good of all in the society, this is the basic aim of the state and the individual character as member of such a group. This individual character also graduate into group character.</p> <p>With definition and origin of state as a basis, it becomes imperative to progress in the next chapter by explaining the concepts of rights liberties as basis that would logically need the states encroachment.</p> <p><strong>REFERENCES AND NOTES</strong></p> <p>J.J.

It widens the gap between the rich and the poor; hence it is force of inequality which enslave the African nations and it economy. Globalization is not a course in totality but it is relative on the impact it has for each economy, whether developed or underdeveloped since it opens an avenue for each economy to compete in global market without restriction. The research work on globalization and economic development in Nigeria uses analysis, exposition and evaluation as its method of inquiry. It is a burden of this research to suggest a best possible solution on how Nigeria will develop both material and human resources without any resources left unutilized just as the developed nations of the world. At the end, all Nigerians will have equal access to the national resources without robbing the future generation what nature has endowed to all mankind</p><p>   GENERAL INTRODUCTION ON GLOBALIZATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA.  </p> <p>Globalization is the process of making the world economically interconnected in the modern form. Globalization and economic is a twin brother of development . Globalization is a process by which free movement of ideas,capital flow, information and technology are moved across borders and national boundaries which result in the integration of the world economies. Just as Heraditussays  that change is the only permanent thing in the  world, globalization is a phenomenon that was brought by change. And man ever since creation has been craving for change.</p> <p>Nigeria after the formal independence in 1960, the political elites saw that the pursuit of power as the dominant theme for politics, this had left thenation in bad condition. Consequently the ethnics of business has penetrated politics and politics was seen as equivalent warfare. This had added to the fact that Nigeria obtained political independence but not economic independence compounded problems for the young nation. Like in the colonial era, the economy still reacted to the vagaries in the international market. Nigeria incorporate into the international market as capitalist market as a junior partner which started with the supply of continued unaltered with supply of commodities like palm oil,cocoa, groundnut, cotton etc. even crude oil, then she later become the greatest foreign exchange in the nation Nigeria in Africa. But the context of dependence between Nigeria and it formal colonial master did not change with independence, only the context did. The structure  of dependence on western nations and exploitation of peasant producers as well as the expatriate domination of investment opportunities. The indigenous entrepreneur became an intermediary between foreign interest and indigenous polity and economy and they turn to state as a source of capital and contract. The pursuit of power became easy and access to wealth and fame. Politics became a “dirty business”, its practioniers scheming and crafting. Access to resource  including opportunity for profit making, thus require favour of those who control private and public institutions which allocate them.</p> <p>Polities thus affords the “opportunity”  to acquire wealth and prestige to be able to distribute benefits in the form of job, contracts, scholarship and gift of money and so on to the  allies. The difference among region and ethnic group in the power equation, discrimination in favourof  particular groups, where access to office and it spoils is the object of politics. It is on thesecompounded  problem , that research on globalization and economic development in Nigeria is looking forward to suggest the best solution for the national development. And never to depend on dogmatically in the international policies which has utility in the short basis and consequential effect in a long run.</p>\n\nGLOBALIZATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA: A PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " GLOBALIZATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA: A PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS", "id": 102}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT </p> <p>Religion can serve as a strong tool in fostering development in any country, but when not properly managed it can also mar same. In this case, the negative effect comes when   man fails to assert himself existentially but depends absolutely on religion to do everything for him. More often than not, he resorts to seeking for spiritual solution to most of his existential problems in various prayer houses. The consequences of such approach to issues cannot be far- fetched as it leaves the individual’s rational faculty dormant, and such individual cannot positively effect a desired change in himself and his environment. No wonder a country like Nigeria whose religiosity is high is still labeled a third- world country. This work is a wake-up call to all Nigerians who still wallow in religiosity to wake up and take charge of their existence. The work employs the philosophical methods of evaluation and appraisal. However, the work does not condemn the practice of religion in its totality, rather it decries the extreme notion in the minds of most Nigerians as it has a negative implication.</p> <p> 1.1   BACKGROUND OF STUDY </p> <p>John Mbiti (1969) asserted that “religion is the strongest element in traditional background, and exerts probably the greatest influence upon the thinking and living of the people concerned.” [1]  Mbiti also made another observation that “religion is in  the African’s man whole system ofbeing, as such wherever he is , there also  you must see an element of his religion.[2]  Having heard from Mbiti, one cannot but see Africans as highly religious people, but I have come to see that this approach of religiosity by Africans have a negative impact on her. At a point Africa was infected with manna from heaven syndrome, as such he depends on God to do virtually everything for him. To buttress this , I will illustrate with a story,  thus; A certain Nigerian man, sated with his snuff addition, sought to break-off from such. He decide to go for a crusade scheduled for three days, all through his prayer was, “God please take away this snuff box from me”.  On the third day of the crusade the host  pastor overwhelmed by concern asked the man, “sir please where is this snuff box?” Surprising for me , the man answered, “it is in my pocket  pastor.”  It is really ridiculous for such a man to expert God to come from heaven to take away the snuff box from him without him doing it himself and maybe later ask God for the grace to follow up his decision.</p>\n\nRELIGION AND DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA: A PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RELIGION AND DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA: A PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS", "id": 103}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p> IMPACTS OF CHRISTIANITY IN NNEWI ANAMBRA STATE: THE ANGLICANS AS A CASE STUDY </p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p> <p>Christianity as a religion has affected all spheres of life among the people of Nigeria.         A careful study of the religious background of the Nnewi people will show that Christianity has found its way into both the urban and rural areas of the Nnewi society.          This study is aimed at looking into the relevance of Christianity in the development of the Nnewi nation. For better understanding of the project, a brief introduction to the lifestyle of the Nnewi people prior to the advent of Christianity will also be made.         The division of work for this study is as follows:-1         General background study via the aims, methodology and clarification of terms.2       The historical origin and organizational lifestyle of the Nnewi people. 3        The advent and expansion of Christianity looking at the Nnewi traditional setting before Christianity. 4       Contributions of the Christian religion to the Nnewi nation. 5       Evaluations, Recommendations and Conclusions.               <br/><br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER    ONE</strong> </p> <p><strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong> </p> <p><strong>1.1    BACKGROUND</strong></p> <p> Christianity as a religion has been involved in many cities of the world since the emergence of the world. However, with the various denominations in Christianity, I would focus more on Anglicanism.         This project work would therefore encompass the history of Christianity in Nigeria, the spread to Nnewi in Anambra State with the case study of the Anglicans stressing out its impacts. The  history of Christianity in Nigeria especially in Nnewi town which is among the towns in Igboland located in Anambra State in the South eastern part of Nigeria present certain discoveries that are both positive and negative. Discoveries has been made on the people of Nnewi and their culture, they are known to have great cultural value that makes them unique. Religion is part of them and thus they cannot live without it. An adage says :- “Okpukpem bu ndum.                                 Onye nwere Okpukpem                                  Nwere ndum”. This means :-  “My religion is my life.                            Whoever takes away my                            religion takes my life”.1         The Igbo people place so much values and attachment to their religion. With the advent of Christianity in Nigeria, especially in the Igbo land, the traditional religion of the Igbo people began to encounter some challenges. Some of the traditional practices were abandoned when Christianity took a firm ground in Nnewi town.         The first Christian contact in Nigeria occurred in the fifteenth century when the Portuguese introduced Roman Catholicism. However, it was virtually extinguished over the following 200 years until Roman Catholic missionaries returned in the 1800s.Since then, the catholic church has grown and now claims approximately 19 million members and adherents mainly in the south east.         The Anglican church of Nigeria now numbers over 11 million members and adherents. The growth of the church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion) since the end of the slave trade has been a very rapid one. It is interesting to know that within two centuries, Christianity and indeed Anglicanism which started like child’s play in Badagry and Abeokuta has spread like wild fire to all nooks and crannies of our country Nigeria.         Christianity came into Nigeria in the 15th century through the efforts of Augustinian and Capuchin monks from Portugal.However, it was not until 1842 that Henry Townsend of the church missionary society sowed the seed of Anglicanism properly when he landed in Badagry from Freetown, Sierra Leone.2         The background of this study is that Christianity has come to stay in Nigeria and states within the country. Although, Christianity poses a form of threat due to its various denominations which sometimes speak in different voices.         Christianity in Nnewi, Anambra state is what I would research on and expose in this work, I would specialize more on the Anglicans, other things to be considered in this work include the origin of the people of Nnewi, their religion and activities of the missionaries and how they affected the traditional religion of the Nnewi people. </p> <p><strong>1.2  AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong> -</p> <p> This work sets to expose the impacts of Christianity in totality to the Nnewi people but focusing on the Anglicans. - To put away the people’s faith in the powers of idol worshipping and to help them find peace in Christianity. - This work is aimed at looking into the relevance of Christianity in the development of the Nnewi nation. - To expose the relation  of the Anglican church to other denominations and its emergence in Nnewi  nation. - To examine the origin of the Nnewi people and their religion, how peculiar it is to them and also the activities of the Christian missionaries in Nnewi, Anambra state. - To make suggestions/recommendations on how the Anglican church of Nigeria can reflect the life patterns of Nnewi traditional society. </p> <p><strong>1.3    CLARIFICATION OF TERMS AND CONCEPTS</strong>         </p> <p>There are three basic terms  that needs clarification in this work : Christianity, Anglicans and Traditional society. </p> <p><strong>1.3. 1      Christianity</strong>         A monotheistic system of beliefs and practices on the old Testament and the teachings of Jesus as embodied in the New Testament and emphasizing the role of Jesus as savior. The Christian religion was founded on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.3         Christianity is today the world’s most wide spread religion, with more than billion members, mainly divided between the Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Eastern Orthodox churches. It originated among the Jewish followers of Jesus of Nazareth, who believed that he was the promised Messiah (or ‘Christ’) but the Christian church soon became an independent organization, largely through the missionary efforts of St. Paul. In 313 Constantine ended official persecution in the Roman Empire and in Theodosius I recognized it as the state religion. Most Christians believe in one God in three persons (the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit) and that Jesus is the son of God who rose from the dead after being crucified; a Christian hopes to attain eternal life after death through faith in Jesus Christ and tries and try to live by his teachings as recorded in the New Testament. </p> <p><strong>1.3.2     Anglicans</strong>          The name “Anglican” means “of England” but the Anglican church exists worldwide. It began in the sixth century in England, when Pope Gregory the Great sent St. Augustine to Britain to bring a more disciplined Apostolic succession to the celtic Christians. The Anglican Church evolved as part of the Roman Church, but the celtic influence was folded back in the Roman portion of the church in many ways. The Anglican church was spread worldwide first by English colonization and then by English-speaking missionaries. The adherents of these practices are known as ‘The Anglicans’.4         The word “church” has been misused, thus Billy Graham one of the American  evangelist of the twentieth century says :                    The Invisible Church is that larger body of believers who,                    down through the ages, have sincerely trusted Jesus as                    Lord and savior. One becomes a member of the Church                    when he receives Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior. The                                 visible church is the present day universal church, composed                    of the local group of Christian .In it are both the wheat and                    tares….5         The Anglican church is the church of England and its overseas off shoots. Anglicanism is a protestant firm of Christianity. It is sometimes seen as being the middle way, between Roman Catholicism and extreme Protestantism. This is because, in the English Reformation, the English church kept the early catholic ministry of bishops, priests and deacons. The critical point which led to the Anglican church was the outright rejection of the Pope and so of the catholic church as an organization. </p> <p><strong>1.3.3      Traditional Society</strong>           This is the third term I would like to clarify for the progresss of this work.            In sociology, traditional society refers to a society characterized by an orientation to the past, not the future, with a predominant role for custom and habit.6 The term “traditional” refers to those societies that are small scale, are derived from indigenous and often ancient cultural practices. </p> <p><strong>1.4      METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY</strong> </p> <p>The method or research for this study is the radical, practical approach. I would rely on quantitative and quantitative sources of social research such as  surveys, interviews  with some lay and ordained members of the Anglican church of Nigeria, analysis of documents from school libraries, institutes, online research ( E- library), journals, text books and research papers.         This course is illustrated with a wide range of hypothetical and real-life case studies. </p> <p><strong>1.5     SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong> </p> <p>This work would focus on Christianity in Nnewi, Anambra State. An attempt will be made to bring out the methods the Christian missionaries (Anglicans) used that led to the establishment and growth of Christianity in Nnewi.         The scope so indeterminate and the interested parties amongst potential readers almost infinitely varied.7 Limitation to indepth stories/histories from materials.                                                      </p> <p> <strong>ENDNOTES</strong> 1              Paul Todd, “Christianity in Nigeria”. 2              H.

Before we give a through explanation of the entire “essay,” an introduction is being made where the language is going to be linked to philosophy, and not just philosophy, but how also it concerns the linguistic value of our everyday conception of ideas.<br/><br/>In introducing the topic we start by giving an overview of the language, that is philosophy of language, thereafter there will be a cross section of the main topic, that is Ludwig Wittgenstein conception of language. Whereby his language theories would be broken into pieces bit by bit, where we can now talk of his first, and his second theory of language, which he termed the “picture theory of language” and the “language game theory,”respectively. This conception of his two theories is analytic in the sense that his first theory which was the “picture theory” was criticized by his own second theory which he termed ‘the language game theory.’<br/><br/>In the preceding chapters, the connection of his two theories of language to the word at large would be examined and explained since his language theory was as an avenue to answer the metaphysical questions and also questions regarding linguistics. In the concluding chapters, where we must have gotten a full or a vivid insight on Ludwig Wittgenstein’s language theory, thee would be an evaluation of his theories, critically, through the process of analyzing his whole language theory.<br/><br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/><br/>Title Page<br/><br/>Certification <br/><br/>Dedication <br/><br/>Acknowledgement<br/><br/>Abstract <br/><br/>Table of Contents <br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>1.1Background of Study <br/><br/>1.2Statement of Problem <br/><br/>1.3 Scope of Study<br/><br/>1.4 Significance of the Theories<br/><br/>1.5Purpose of Study <br/><br/>1.6 Methodology<br/><br/>1.7 Literature Review<br/><br/>End-Notes<br/><br/>CHAPTER TWO: UNDERSTANDING WITTGENSTEIN INTELLECTUAL AUTOBIOGRAPHY VIA PRECEEDING IDEAS (EARLY WITTGENSTEIN)<br/><br/>2.1 Concept of Language and Meaning In Frege and as Background of Wittgenstein <br/><br/>2.2 Language and Meaning in Frege’s Philosophy<br/><br/>2.3Tractatus- logico- Philosophicus. “{picture theory}<br/><br/>2.4 Sense and Nonsense<br/><br/>Facts and Value<br/><br/>Interpretative Problem<br/><br/>Critique of Wittgenstein as a Prelude to the Philosophical Investigation<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>End-Notes<br/><br/>CHAPTER THREE: ANALYSIS OF THE LATTER WITTGENSTEIN [THE PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATION<br/><br/>3.1 Transition from Meaning as Reference to Use<br/><br/>3.2 Philosophical Investigation 3.3 Language – Game<br/><br/>3.4 Family Resemblance<br/><br/>3.5 Language and Rule Following<br/><br/>3.6 Private Language Argument <br/><br/>3.7 Conclusion<br/><br/>End Note<br/><br/>CHAPTER FOUR: EVALUATION<br/><br/>4.1Critique of Wittgenstein(Evaluation)<br/><br/>4.2Autocritique Of Wittgenstein Critique Of Philosophy<br/><br/>4.3 Continuation Of Philosophy Of Language Wittgenstein<br/><br/>4.4Significance Of Wittgenstein Language theory<br/><br/>Endnotes<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>Background of Study <br/><br/>Two important questions in 20th century analytic philosophy have been asked are” How we are able tom say or mean anything with signs, symbols and sounds?” What exactly is the meaning of these signs, symbols and sounds?.<br/><br/>But why in the word would philosophies become so focused on language and meaning? One reason perhaps is that an enormous range of issues are touched by looking at language and important philosophical insights can be won by doing this. Another reasons is the immense influence a number of philosophers who were interested in language and on everyone else doing philosophy especially in Britain and America1.<br/><br/>Language plays an enormously important role in our interactions with other people and with the world. We employ various words and concepts to talk about objects ( tables and flowers), properties ( colour and shapes) and relations ( the flower is on the table, the pain is in my aim). We express Feelings ask questions, give commands, tells jokes tell stories, song and so on. How is that we re able to do all of these things with language? . How is it that certain signs, symbols and sounds are meaningful and what exactly is their meaning? Is the world “cat” meaningful and what exactly is their meaning? Is the world “cat” meaningful because of what it refers to namely those furry, meowing fleabags some of us have as pets? Further, does the world determine what our concept are to be? That is with language do we simply try to mirror the various kinds of objects, properties, and relations that exists or is he word “gen” to different ways of conceptualizing it? <br/><br/>Such questions as these vexed Wittgenstein. He tried to answer them in his first work, “the Tractatus Logico Philosophicus” he later came to see a number of shortcoming in that work” answer. He expressed his changing ideas in a variety of note books and unfinished manuscripts which were eventually published in the decades after his death. The best known is the philosophical investigation, a book he was preparing for publications at the time of his death in 1951.<br/><br/>The Crux of Wittgenstein argument is that language pictures reality and that the limit of his language is the limit of his world and that most philosophical problems rest on misunderstanding engendered by language.<br/><br/>This project is therefore an attempt to have an insight into Wittgenstein theories of language. This is with a view to separating sense and Nonsense. It is against this background that this project is being carried out.<br/><br/>1.2Statement of Problem <br/><br/>For the analytic philosophies , language issue is always a problematic one, and there are quite some good dose of them here.<br/><br/>In the first place, we shall grapple with the problem of Wittgenstein’s understanding of language . Wittgenstein’s claims that the limit of his language is the limit of his world can not picture reality holistically because reality encompasses language. It is not true that there is one to one correspondence with reality.<br/><br/>Secondly it is very contentious to say that all philosophical problem are linguistic in nature. The inability of analytic philosophers to eliminate metaphysic and ethical problem one and for all shows how problematic this issue is.<br/><br/>Thirdly, it is difficult to test the soundness of Wittgenstein’s case because he does not argued in the conventional sense. He does not set out to defend a thesis, but to reduce our confusion through the clarification of language that is to show the fly the way out of the fly bottle,2 but as Iroegbu Argues , clarification is not the function of philosophy . philosophizing involves analysis , synthesis, clarification, interpretation, comparism, historicism etc to analyse and clarification of language is of great disservice to man.<br/><br/>Finally , wittgenstein’s observation as we are going to see soon, leave a strong sense of doubt that a private language is possible , useful or even conceivable. This runs counter to our everyday experience that one can establish a connection between a word or sign and sensation . one problem that arises from the private nature of his definition is that it is impossible to tell whether one has remembered the connection correctly 3<br/><br/>1.3 Scope of Study<br/><br/>This work in scope, shall be limited to an insight into Wittgenstein’s two language theories and their over all meaning in resolving philosophical puzzles . however insights into other theories of language in their clarification nature shall also be treated or discussed here. This I think shall enable me evaluable objectively Wittgenstein theories.<br/><br/>1.4 Significance of the Theories<br/><br/>This work is significant because it would create an avenue for easy grasping of the concept of language. During the course of study , issues related to language and its usefulness would be treated. It would enable us to understand the fact that every language has its meaning within its own context. Ludwig Wittgenstein in his later philosophy, no longer that meaning of language is fixed as his earlier conception portrays it to be, he now conceived language as part of human life and activity as such, should be examined in that setting with all its complexities of forms and function.4<br/><br/>It would also be of great advantages to the metaphysics, linguistics philosophy and logicians for language has been an unsolvable puzzle before the time of the analytic philosophers.<br/><br/>1.5Purpose of Study <br/><br/>The study of Wittgenstein’s language theory deals with the nature of language and its relations to the world.<br/><br/>The purpose of this study with the help of sources is aimed at achieving thus:<br/><br/>To carry out a careful analysis of Wittgenstein tractatus and also the brain behind his later theory” philosophical investigation : languages. During the study, Wittgenstein’s double theory of language would be analysed, critically his first theory picture entails a state of affairs in relating to language, his later theory “ Language games shortly followed after because it was his own antique to the tractatus because acceding to him the tractatus was unrealistic. In this aspect the purpose of this study is to analytically explore Wittgenstein’s language theory Secondly the purpose of these study is to give an answer to those questions regarding language. “what is meaning “ the objectivity of meaning” the usage of signs and symbols. And also to make a uniform conception of the idea of language, Wittgenstein language critically analysis language in relation to philosophy basically metaphysical language to break down the complexity of metaphysics cum which has been regarded as non sense by logical positions claiming that what cannot be verified it therefore invalid.<br/><br/>These points above has given a brief insight on the purpose of this study , so it would be advisable if the purpose of this study so I would be advisable if the method in which is going to be used for this study is known.<br/><br/>1.6 Methodology<br/><br/>This work adopts the methodology of a conceptual analysis and archival research. The use of conceptual analysis involves a simplification and clarification of Wittgenstein ideas in the tractatus and the philosophical investigation . this method is aimed at breaking down philosophy (Wittgenstein ‘s theory ) into it basic part, to the smallest for easy grasping and explanation each parts in the clearest possible way.<br/><br/>The second method is the archival method, which involves the review of related literature in the library and other visible sauces.<br/><br/>By using these methods, the study seeks t provide a comprehensive understanding of Wittgenstein’s language a philosophy / theory in the light of linguistics analysis.<br/><br/>1.7 Literature Review<br/><br/>The first book to be reviewed is the tractatus logic philosophicus by Ludwig Wittgenstein published in 1979, London, pengun Books by M. Brochhauson {trans] with this book, Wittgenstein gave a new meaning to language, according to this early Wittgenstein meaning of language must picture something in reality for him for a thing to be meaningful it must correspond to an object in reality and this assertion is seen in his pictorial theory of meaning. The Tranctatus reduce the whole of reality of to verifiable object of reality.<br/><br/>The second book to be reviewed <br/><br/>Philosophical investigation by Ludwing Wittgenstein (tracs) G.E.M Anscombe published by oxford : Blackwell publishers Ltd. 195. In this book Wittgenstein takes a practical position on the matter. He propose that language will not longer be seen in the fixed sense of being a representation of reality but in a much more flexible sense and this is precisely . in term of the way it is used by people to carry out different social activities. Consequently , Wittgenstein place the meaning of words in the usage which he claims varies.5<br/><br/>The third book to be reviewed is Gottleb Frege” sense and Non sense” (Translation from the philosophical writing): Peter teach max Black, published in 1966; Oxford. This book, frege explained and gave a brief insight on sense and reference, frege explained how signs and meaning are correlated in relation to language an meaning .<br/><br/>Frege tries to reconsider the two words, meaning and reference according to him, signs and meaning are the basis of language.<br/><br/>The fourth book to reviewed is A simplified History of Western philosophy , Authored by Prof. J.I Omoregbe published by Joja educational research and publishers Ltd. Lagos 1991: in chapter eight of this book he shows us that Wittgenstein has two works and these works contains two different theories of language by Wittgenstein. The first book THE TRACTATUS contains a pictorial reality, but in his second theory, the Philosophical investigation Wittgenstein antiqued and rejected his first theory and proposed another one, this second theory is the “ language game” theory in which each language is seen as a game with its own distinctive rules governing how it is played.6 <br/><br/>The fifth book is authored by Pantalom Osundu Ireogbu, titled: Metaphysical; the kpim of philosophy published by international universities press Ltd, Owerri, 1995.<br/><br/>Towards the ending chapters of part II of this book, analytical philosophers dwelt on the concept of meaningful and meaningfulness of a language and other metaphysical concept through verification. Aj ayer spoke on verification of language, his validity of language depends on the fact that it can be verified; if not; then that language is meaningfulness. Wittgenstein alter came into play through his two theories of languages, he was capable to give a clearer understanding of the concept of language. <br/><br/>The sixth book is edited A. Kenny titled the Oxford History of Western Philosophy by Oxford University Press, Oxford 1994: Kenny in chapter 5 of his book made a clear distinction between first or early philosophy of Wittgenstein and the second or later Wittgenstein. He says that Wittgenstein ins a philosopher is philosopher and his writings can hardly be understood by anyone without the previous acquaintance with the book of his predecessors and contemporaries. His first book the tractaus logico philsophicus is a critique of language designed to reveal the essential structure of thought which is expressed in language and to discuss the structure, the limits of thought. The tractatus started from ideas of frege and russel. Wittgenstein gave up philosophy after the publication of the tratatus,thinking that he had solved all philosophical problems. When the took it up it was in 1929, before he now came up with a different philosophy “Philosophical investigation” in which we have the language game theory. <br/><br/><br/><br/>REFERENCES<br/><br/>G.

Sacrifice is seen in almost all human communities and religion. It definitely will have a role to play in these societies and religion. The igbo traditional society is the community of people who share igbo world views and institutions. This works is to know the significance of sacrificial acts system and society. There are changes in igbo society and traditional practices now more than ever, we need to study the igbo traditional society and the institution and also belief that held the society to get the best of new society in this society to get the best of the two world without completely losing our identity. This is the reason why the role of the sacrifice in igbo traditional religion and society should be studied, to help correct the false impression people have about Igbo sacrifice and learn the significance of sacrifice in the igbo traditional society.<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/><br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/><br/>One of the perenennial concern of human beings is the need for peace, prosperity, and harmony in society, where people can truly fulfil their God-given mission in life. In othe words, there is a human desire for an environment, where lifa can be honestly celebrated in its fullness even while waiting its final consummation. The African traditional believers in his search for the realisation f such a noble aim and desire has often identified sacrifice as a cordinal instrument of societal transformation.<br/><br/>Sacrifice is important to any religion and igbo traditional religion in particular. In every community, sacrifice is used as a means for the individual or society to commune with spiritual beings. In the igbo traditional society, we believe these beings have power to sustain and destroy, a good reciprocal relationship with them is beneficial to man making sacrifice important to the religious and social life of the igbos. Sacrifice is also used to counteract the powers of destruction and evil spirit. To understand the significance of sacrifice, one has to put into consideration the igbo cosmology, sacrificial types, rites, essence, purpose of sacrifice in igbo traditional society compared to other living religions and its future in the modern igbo society.<br/><br/>1.1 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/><br/>Today there are many misceptions about the concept of sacrifice in igbo society even among the igbos. An average igbo youth especially people who live outside the igbo traditional community develop their idea of sacrifice as evil, diabolic and human acts that should be done away with and practiced by evil people.<br/><br/>The igbos are often associated with the evil act of blood money, cannibalism, human sacrifice and osu discrimination. The problem is to know the real native of sacrifice in igbo society and its contribution in sustaining the igbo traditional society. In other to correct the misconception and portray sacrifice not only as an important religious liturgical act but also significant in the individual and the society in almost all spheres of life.<br/><br/>1.2 AIMS OF STUDY<br/><br/>The motive of the study is to give a detailed account of the concept of sacrifice in igbo traditional religion with an analysis of the significance of sacrifice in igbo traditional religion. The study shall also cover the reasons, types and elements, to achieve this aim, one will be faced with challenges that may hinder the production of a perfect writeup<br/><br/>1.3 LIMITATIONS OF STUDY<br/><br/>This study is limited to thorough penusal neither African or igbo concept of sacrifice has received adequate exposition, some authors are biased, use exaggeration, they do not define sacrifice from traditional igbo perspective. The diversity of igbo culture, although they share similarity in structure and culture as one people, sacrifice social rites and system may change within geographical areas.<br/><br/>Finance: In term of transportation cost hindered the development of this research work, the payment in other to get access to library and measures the cost going to different higher institution of learning in the areas of the study to get first hand information from the right source. Also some information demands payments for thei knowledge.<br/><br/>Time limitation: the time constraint makes it impossible to fully observe all the sacrifice and present a detailed work before deadline of submission. Also, some sacrifice in igbo society fixed, others done yearly or when circumstances arise.<br/><br/>Illiteracy: these practitioners finds it difficult to explain their works to the researcher and provide first hand information and analysis because they receive little or no education.<br/><br/>The attitude fo respondent has also been a limitation to this study, not all wants to openly discuss issues like sacrifice or igbo traditional religion, in fear of castigationalist of being called a traditionalist or pegan.<br/><br/>Morreso, the death of current literature in this area of research also constituted a limitation to the study. Irresopective of the aforementioned challenges, i will make the best use of the materials available to me to produce the best possible result.<br/><br/>1.4 SCOPE OF STUDY<br/><br/>The cultural area of study as defined by onwuejiogwu is a geographical area occupied by people whose culture exhibits a significant degree of similarity with each others in belief system, worship, economy, language and social institutions.<br/><br/>The study deals with the igbo society. The igbo are an ethic group of south-eastern Nigeria-they can be found in other African countries like cameroun Equatorial Guinea, as well as outside Africa. The exact population outside Africa is known, but today many African American and Afro Caribbean’s are of igbo descent. The igbo are divided into subgroups such as: Aniom, Aro, Edda, Ekpeye, Etche, Ezza, Ika, Ikwerre, Ikwo, Ishielu, Izzi, Mbiase, Mgbo, Ngwa, Nkalu, Nri-igbo, Ogba, Ohafia, Ohuhu, Omuma, Onitsha, Oratta, Ubani, Ukwani. These areas are distinguishes by apparent cultural feature and system.<br/><br/>1.5 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/><br/>In my choice of research methods, i will make use of personal (individual) interview as well as questionnaire in the collection of data.<br/><br/>Literary works, field studies oral literature and also the dictionary and encyclopaedia used for definition and clarification of terms. Newspapers observations would be used to know the social and public opinions. Also primary instruments like library materials and other documents would be used as research tools.<br/><br/>1.6 CLARIFICATION OF TERMS<br/><br/>The followings concept shall be clarified for proper understanding of this work.<br/><br/>Though all researchers agree on the centrality and importance of sacrifice in the religious life and practices of African traditional peoples. Authors differs when it comes to the definition of sacrifice, though they do not necessarily always conflict each necessarily always conflict each other there we shall consider the different views on the definition of sacrifice.<br/><br/>The encyclopaedia of religion and ethics defines sacrifice as “a rite in the forfeited or destroyed, its object being to establish relations between a source of spiritual strength and one in need of such spiritual strength for the benefit of the latter. Its also seen as a means of establishing and maintaining good relationship between two worlds, the worlds of spiritual strength and spiritual weakness.<br/><br/>James has tried to defined sacrifice in terms of its purpose according to him as quoted by Awolalu, sacrifice involve the destruction of a victim for the purpose of maintaining or restoring a right relationship of man to the sacred order.<br/><br/>For Ted Nelson Adjakpey, writing about the Ghanian-Ewe, sacrifice is the act of offering something to deity as an expression and manifestation of one’s total dependence an that deity (James 1933) regards sacrifice as a means of giving life to have life. E.B. Taylor says sacrifice serves as a means of bribing the gods or paying homage to them the same way men pay homage to overlords.<br/><br/>Westermack sees sacrifice as a means of providing food for the gods to encourage them to be kind to men to bestow blessing and avert danger. This work will view sacrifice from the religious perspective to mean the giving of animate or inanimate object and internal devotion to spiritual being beloved to exist for a particular purpose, essence and forms of expression petition considering the igbo world view in particular which we sacrifice as a form of reciprocal relations with the divine.<br/><br/>SACRIFICE AND RECONCILATION<br/><br/>The centrality of sacrifice and reconciliation is not only peculiar to African traditional religion alone but is observed in other religions. Before we now move to the understanding of reconciliation in African traditional religion, let me quickly note here that sacrifice is closely tied to reconciliation, in fact the two are bed fellows. Reconciliation can therefore be described as a situation in which a person accepts or realise his guilt for an offence against a deity and then undertakes to perform the prescribed rites of propitiating the offended deity as atonement for the sin.<br/><br/>In practical terms reconciliation is viewed in cultural traditions as peace and the return to a share of harmony, manifested in a person’s interior and exterior state of being and devoid of harsh or rough conditions living. In igbo tradition, sacrifices and reconciliation rites are directed towards the deities and in an indirect way, towards God.<br/><br/>SACRIFICES AND OFFERING<br/><br/>The two terms have been used interchangeably, authors have opined that sacrifice is a form of ritual and offerings. Mbiti is of the opinion that sacrifice involves destruction of life to present the victim in part or whole to the spirit offering, on the other hands do not involve killing or destruction rather a form of presentation of valued objects as a token of love and devotion. In this work, sacrifice offering and reconciliation will be used interchangeably to avoid confusion.<br/><br/>1.7 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>They are as follows:<br/><br/>To provide a detailed igbo traditional concept of sacrifice.<br/><br/>To know the role of sacrifice in the society, giving recommendations and unbiased analysis<br/><br/>To distinguish the positive and negative aspect of sacrifice in the society and the individuals.<br/><br/>Also to know the roles of sacrifice to the contemporatly traditional igbo society.<br/><br/>1 M.

It is a means of securing the lives of the individuals. Among all communities in Africa, life is regarded as sacred. Each individual’s life is seen as a gift from God to the community and to the family.<br/><br/>Ihiala Local Government Area which is located in Anambra State is a community of people who hare and believe in African traditional World view and Institutions.<br/><br/>This work is to know African Traditional way of medical health practices, and its application and concept in Ihiala L.G.A of Anambra State. There are many ways of medical health practices now in Africa more than ever before. We need to study African Traditional Medical health practices and its belief and concept in Ihiala as a community. This will help to correct the false impression people have about African traditional way of medical health practices.<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONEGENERAL INTRODUCTION1.1BACKGROUND OF THE STUDYAfrican is a large continent with many countries that have different tribes and cultures. Nigeria is one of the countries in Western part of Africa. In Nigeria, there are thirty-six states among which Anambra is one of them, and Ihiala L.G.A is one of its local government area in Anambra South Senatorial Zone. It is made up of nine (9) autonomous towns.<br/><br/>Practice of medicine is an important part of indigenous religions in Africa. Disease in this part of the world is normally regarded as having some spiritual cause. African traditional medicine is a medicine known and practiced by Africans from time immemorial for the health need of her people. It has an important place in health care delivery among Africans.<br/><br/>In Ihiala L.G.A, according to Obiaofo, it was believed that African traditional way of practising medicine have power to sustain the lives of every individuals in the community, it is used to counteract the powers of destruction and evil spirit. It is beneficial to man and important to the religious and social life of the people.<br/><br/>Practice of medicine is important to any religion especially in the case of African traditional religion. In Ihiala L.G.A, many people seek out diviners on a regular basis. There are generally no prohibitions against the practice. Those who tell fortunes for a living are also sought out for their wisdom as counsellor and for their knowledge of herbal medicine. Practice of African traditional medicine is an important part of their religion. Healers are reputed to have professional knowledge of illness (pathology), surgery and pharmacology (roots, barks, leaves, and herbs). Some of them are also reputed to diagnose and treat mental and psychological problems. The healer advises in all aspects of life including physical, psychological, spiritual, moral and legal matters. They also understand the significance of ancestral spirits and the concepts of witches (hence the colonial term witch-doctor). Ihiala people believed that traditional African medicine is a holistic discipline involving indigenous herbalism and African spirituality, typically involving diviners, midwives and herbalists. Practitioners of traditional African medicine claim to be able to cure various and diverse conditions such as cancer, psychiatric disorders, high blood pressure, cholera, most venereal diseases, epilepsy, asthma, eczema, fever, depression and healing of wounds and burns.<br/><br/>Traditional African medicine with its belief that illness is not derived from chance occurrences, but through spiritual or social imbalance, differs greatly from western medicine which is technically and analystically based. Diagnosis is reached through spiritual means and a treatment is prescribed usually consisting of an herbal remedy that has not only healing abilities, but symbolic and spiritual significance.<br/><br/>1.2STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS <br/><br/>Despite the importance and strong points of African Traditional Medicine, there are some problems associated with it especially as it is practised these days. These problems have almost discredited the very important heritage.<br/><br/>First among these problems affecting African Traditional medical practices today is, there are misconceptions about the concept of African traditional medicine in African countries, even among the people in Ihiala L.G.A. An average Ihiala youth especially people who live outside the community or outside Africa, develop their idea of African traditional medical health practices from films or stories. These films or stories often portray the African traditional medical health practices as evil, diabolic and in human acts that should be done away as practiced by evil and primitive people.<br/><br/>Another problem associated with African traditional medical health practices according to Omonzejele (2003) is when it resort to spiritual explanation for the causation of ill-health which is attributed to many mystical forces. This factor limits African traditional medicine to the extent that it is extremely difficult to provide explanation and evidence in accordance to basic epistemology for the cure of aliment even when the therapy is effective. For instance in Nigeria, everyone knows that orthopaedic cases are best handled by traditional practitioners, but the connection between the broken leg of hen and the treatment of a patient with a broken leg is quiet difficult to explain. In Western medicine, scientific explanations are usually provided on how a particular drug works with body chemistry, in that wise, one cannot expect the west and non-Africans to accept any kind of cure or advances in medicine by Africans without adequate explanation.<br/><br/>Again the fallout of Africa’s economic woes has also contributed to the problems facing African traditional medical practices. There are many traditional medical practitioners, most of them are mere charlants who like the sophists of the ancient times make huge sums of money from the trade. In the past, traditional health practitioners only saw what they did in terms of services to their communities where one cannot really afford to be dubious. The African traditional practitioners of this present day move from the rural to urban areas with the sole purpose to enrich themselves. They are patronised by unsuspecting patients. These mobile practitioners of African traditional medicine sometimes do not know anything about African traditional medicine. They are just merely people who were unable to cope with present economic situation thereby having no other option than to resort to this type of trade. They are in the business perhaps because most Africans somehow have confidence and believe in African traditional medicine.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the methods and procedures of using or the trial of new drug before its application on humans in African traditional medicine is weak. That by using the bark of a particular tree which was effective in animals does not show good and enough reason that the same bark will be effective in treating human beings that has a similar ailment. The African traditional practitioners hardly have knowledge of botanical properties of the drugs they use. They are unable to anticipate the effect the drug would have on humans at the trial stage, which he ought to share with the subject as to enable them make informed consent or refusal. They only hopes that the drug “works” without adverse effects. This kind of act is quiet insufficient because the drug may not only “work” but may be harmful to the subject (patient).<br/><br/>However, in other to correct these problems, misconceptions, the African Traditional Medical Health practices should be studied as it is an important religious liturgical act, and also of great value and significant to every individual and the society as a whole in almost all sphere of life.<br/><br/>1.3AIM OF THE STUDYThe aim of this study is to explore African tradition, with specific interest in her traditional medical health practices. Consequently to delineate the social stance of Ihiala L.G.A in the African Traditional Medical Health Practices.<br/><br/>1.4LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDYThis study has many limitations which include:<br/><br/>The limitation imposed by lack of finance: In this case the researcher did not have enough money with which to carryout the study, and so she has to borrow most of the time.<br/><br/>Limitation imposed by lack of time: This case the researcher did not have enough time to carry out a research of this nature. Lack of time therefore restricted the development of this research work.<br/><br/>Lack of enough materials in the area of study: In this study, the researcher did not get enough materials with which to carry out a study of this type. This is because, the topic is a relatively new one and the literatures on it are very scanty.<br/><br/>Problem of distance: In this case, the researcher had to travel from Benin to Ihiala to see her interviewers.<br/><br/>Unco-operative attitude of some of the respondents: In this case, some of the people interviewed did not give the required response to the researcher during the course of the research work. <br/><br/>1.5SCOPE OF STUDYThis study focused on the concept and belief of African Traditional Medical Health practices in Ihiala L.G.A. Ihiala is one of the L.G.A in Anambra South Senatorial Zone, and it is made up of nine (9) autonomous towns viz: Uli, Ihiala, Okija, Azia, Mbosi, Isekke, Orsumoghu, Uburuisiuzo and Lilu. <br/><br/>1.6RESEARCH METHODOLOGY <br/><br/>A qualitative research designs were adopted in this study using descriptive approach in the analysis.

This essay in its bid to unravel the role of religion in the society, outrightly dwelt on the impart of religion in politics. <br/><br/>In this research, different methods ranging from interviews with political stakeholders and clergies, personal observations, journals, newspapers and other related material to the topic were used. Though the work is limited to Delta State, it findings could be applicable to the entire southern part of Nigeria particularly the areas dominated by Christianity and African Traditional Practices. <br/><br/>While the first chapter of this essay dealt with the method, scope and significance of the study, the second chapter dealt the views of different authors. It also defined the concept of politics and the different religious practices among the different ethnic groups in Delta State. <br/><br/>Chapter three dwelt on the role of religious leaders and traditional rulers in mobilizing the youth in the political system while chapter four largely dwelt on the relationship between the church and the state and also on the role of the church in combating the moral laxity in the political system today. It also talks extensively on the role of religion in the electoral system in Delta State. <br/><br/>Finally, it was concluded that the role of religion in politics is not limited to institutions like the churches and government rather it cut across the individuals such as the traditional rulers, the priests, the youth and the elders who forms the religious congregation and the political actors who are at the center of the political sphere. <br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION <br/><br/>Cultural values and moral integrity are social indicators that guarantees the general acceptance of individual within the society. The control of the government machinery is entrusted to a few individuals, however, the fear of changeable and unreliable nature of man often introduce religious beliefs into the political sphere.1 This is due to the view that belief is a component of moral behavior and at such our beliefs affects our conducts.2 This fact clearly explains why there is hardly any political office holder today, that does not profess religion. <br/><br/>Inspite of the difference which exist between religion and politics which presupposes that religion deals with the realm of conviction and ultimate reality, a view in life sees good and calls it into reality while politics is seen as a realm of compromise in which ultimate purposes clash, interest competes and conflicting claims are adjusted by a process of give and take;3 the ethical views and realities which coexist side by side within our society weave religion deeply into politics particularly in the search for moral integrity in the political domain. <br/><br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/><br/>Religion is an integral part of every society. In recent times, religious activities have been more deeply woven into the fabrics of partisan politics to the extent that religious participation correlates with politics in Delta State. That is, it is difficult to be successful in the political environment without proper alignment with a religious organization within the state. <br/><br/>Throughout the history of Nigeria’s political and social development, civil organizations have always looked up to religious institutions for inspirational leadership. Hence, it is undoubted that religion still have powerful influence in the structuring of the political culture and some policies of the government in Nigeria.4 It is against this background that this essay will be examining the role of religion in the politics of Delta State. Consequently, this research will mainly expose the religio-political affiliations in the daily administration of Delta State, the role of religious institutions in the electoral practices of Delta State as well as the influence of religion on the policies of Delta State. <br/><br/>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/><br/>This research is primarily aimed at revealing the impact of religious institutions in the politics and the civil administration of Delta State. It also aims at considering the relevance of churches to the government and as well examine the role of religious institutions in the moral upliftment of the state even in the face of the moral decadence prevalent in our political system. This research also aim at creating awareness on the need to respect the religious diversity, reject the prejudice against religious and political affiliation and accept the necessity for peaceful coexistence and social cohabitation in Delta State. <br/><br/>Therefore, at the end of this research, we should have more knowledge in the following aspects: <br/><br/>The influence of religion in the policies and decision making in Delta State. <br/><br/>The role of religion in the electoral practices that is, in political campaigns and the daily administration of Delta State. <br/><br/>The position of religious institutions in the crusade against moral decay in Nigeria at large. <br/><br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>The significance of this study is to emphasize the importance of religion in the life of political actors in Delta. The importance of religion in the politics of Delta State whether it be domestic party politics or inter-state relations, cannot be underestimated. It is generally believed among the people that religion is the life energy and at such, tradition can best be explained by the politics of representation. <br/><br/>Unarguably, religion plays a good role in the progress, development, peace and co-existence in the affairs of every government. The government of Delta State has for long initiated religious programmes which are believed to contribute to the unity progress and the development of the state. The government often emphasize the importance of religion in the daily administration of the state. Hence the daily morning prayers of the government house chapel, a long standing tradition in Delta State.5 <br/><br/>Consequently, the significance of this work is to establish the fact that religion stands at the centre of governmental institutions not only in Delta State, but in the entire country. It will also establish the fact that religion wield a lot of influence in the policies and decisions of the government. <br/><br/>Thus, religion is greatly implicated in the shaping and structuring of the socio-political-environment. It could be understood in terms of power relations. <br/><br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>The research was carried out in the vicinity of Delta State. However, due to the constraints of time and finance, two local government areas of Delta State including Ughelli North and Oshimili North shall be the research areas for this work. This work will also cover extensively the various religious practices in this political province. This research will also be limited to the influence of religion in the political practices and in the daily administration of this province. <br/><br/>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/><br/>This research will involve different methods in obtaining detailed information about the structure of religion and politics in Delta State. Primarily, previous works done by scholars on the political and religions affiliations of Delta State and some other areas of common interest will serve as source of information for this research. Therefore, the various libraries in these two chosen local government areas will be primary source of information. The University of Benin Library will also be used as a major base for the acquisition of information. Newspaper publications on religions and politics as well as the use of the internet search machines will also be employed to ensure the success of this research. Also, interviews will be conducted among the people particularly among the clergymen and politicians in Delta State so as to acquire first hand information from stakeholders who are vast in the area of religion and politics within Delta State. <br/><br/>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY <br/><br/>The wide geographical area covered by this research extending to the whole of Delta State seem to be one of the challenges to this work. Out of the 27 local government areas, only two could be effectively used due to financial constraint. <br/><br/>Secondly, the lack of cooperation, particularly from the political class, who always claim to be very busy also stand as a limitation to this research. However, from the co-operation of a few within Delta State the research was a great success</p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF RELIGION IN THE POLITICS OF DELTA STATE <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF RELIGION IN THE POLITICS OF DELTA STATE ", "id": 108}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>OSU IN A CONTEMPORARY IGBO SOCIETY: A CHRISTIAN THEOLOGICAL EVALUATION </strong><br/><br/></p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS <br/><br/>Title Page --------- i<br/><br/>Certification --------- ii<br/><br/>Dedication --------- iii<br/><br/>Acknowledgements -------- iv<br/><br/>Table of Contents -------- v<br/><br/>Abstract --------- vii<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>Background of the Study------ 1<br/><br/>Introduction -------- 1<br/><br/>Aims and Objectives ------- 1<br/><br/>Clarification of Terms ------ 2 <br/><br/>Scope Of Study/Methodology----- 2<br/><br/>Division of Work ------- 2<br/><br/>Endnotes -------- 4<br/><br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/><br/>Background of the Igbos ------ 5<br/><br/>The Historical Origin of the Igbos ----- 5<br/><br/>Political System Of The Igbo Society---- 6<br/><br/>The Economic System Of The Igbo Society--- 8<br/><br/>The Social System Of The Igbo Society---- 8<br/><br/>The Religious Belief In Igbo Society---- 10<br/><br/>Endnotes -------- 14<br/><br/>CHAPTER THREE: The Origin of Osu in Igboland<br/><br/>The Historical Origin of Osu------ 16<br/><br/>The Rights and Privileges of an Osu----- 20<br/><br/>The Marriage of an Osu------ 22<br/><br/>The Funeral of an Osu------ 24<br/><br/>The Social Image of an Osu------ 25<br/><br/>The Relationship Between the Freeborn and Osu--- 26<br/><br/>The Effects of the Belief in Osu----- 29<br/><br/>Endnotes -------- 31<br/><br/>CHAPTER FOUR: Theological Response to the Phenomenon of Osu <br/><br/>4.1Old Testament ------- 33<br/><br/>4.2New Testament------- 34<br/><br/>4.3The Church Position on Osu----- 36<br/><br/>Endnotes -------- 41<br/><br/>CHAPTER FIVE: Recommendation and Conclusion<br/><br/>5.1Recommendations ------- 42<br/><br/>5.2Conclusion -------- 45<br/><br/>Works Cited-------- 47<br/><br/>ABSTRACT <br/><br/>This study examines an agelong social phenomenon Osu Caste system among the Igbos of Eastern Nigeria. It investigates the origin and its persistence. Inspite of the overwhelming presence of Christianity in the area, many Christians pay lip service to the eradication of Osu Caste system. Not until something drastic is done, the phenomenon will persist. This study investigates the matter along Christian theological teachings. Painstaking efforts was taken to get information on this study. <br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/><br/>1.0BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/><br/>1.1INTRODUCTION <br/><br/>In the Igbo society, there exist the slaves and the freeborns. These slaves are seen as outcasts and are called Osu while the freeborns are called dialas. This inferiority and superiority arrangement has generated conflicts. We live in a society where Osu is considered unclean and should be avoided at all costs. Even though the Osu caste system is condemned by many, the attitude still lingers in the heart of the people. This is reflected in the people’s relationship to the Osu’s in the areas of business, politics and social undertakings. This study investigates the phenomenon of Osu in the light of the teaching of the Christian religion which is dominant in the area. <br/><br/>1.2AIMS AND OBJECTIVES <br/><br/>Basically, the aims and objectives of this study are: <br/><br/>To shed light on the Osu caste system in the contemporary Igbo society. <br/><br/>To investigate the myriads of taboos that surrounds an Osu. <br/><br/>To examine the social economic, political and religious impact of Osu caste system in Igbo land. <br/><br/>To proffer solutions to the challenges of the Osu caste system. <br/><br/>To see if the Osu belief has basis in the Christian scriptures. <br/><br/>1.3CLARIFICATION OF TERMS <br/><br/>Osu: Victor C. Uchendu defined Osu as a cult slave, a slave who has been dedicated to the services of the dedicator’s deity, whose descendants are also Osu, be the dedicator, an individual, extended family or lineage.1 <br/><br/>Caste: The Collins Cobuild Advanced Dictionary of English defines caste as “one of the traditional social classes into which people are divided in a society.2 <br/><br/>Freeborn: The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English defines freeborn as “one not born as a slave”.3 <br/><br/>Stigma: The Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary defines stigma as “a mark of disgrace”.4 <br/><br/>1.4SCOPE OF STUDY/METHODOLOGY <br/><br/>The method used in this study is historical and analytic. The study will employ oral interview which is its primary source and books, journals, articles, internet material which will constitute the secondary sources. The study confines itself to Osu caste system as it exists in Ibo society. <br/><br/>1.5DIVISION OF WORK <br/><br/>This work is divided into five chapters, chapter one deals with background to the study, under which we have the Introduction, Aims and Objectives, Clarification of Terms, Scope of Study and Methodology as well as Division of Work. <br/><br/>Chapter two borders on the Historical background of the Igbos which consists of the Origin of the Igbos, the Political, Economic, Social system of the Igbos and the Religious belief of the people. <br/><br/>Chapter three borders on the origin of Osu in Igboland which consists of the Historical origin of the Osu, the Relationship between free born and Osu, the Rights and privileges of an Osu, the Social Image of the Osu. Effects of the belief in Osu, the marriage of an Osu and the Funeral of an Osu. <br/><br/>Chapter four focuses on the Theological Response to the phenomenon of Osu and under this chapter we would examine what the Old and New Testament says about Osu and the position of the church on it. <br/><br/>The entire work climaxes in the fifth chapter.

Religion is fundamental because no society can exist without it as part of their culture, it is also part of human nature. This research attempted to analyze the meaning of religion, its positive and negative aspects in a society and also an attempt was made to analyze its importance in an ideal society. <br/><br/>This research was carried out by first, looking at the background, purpose, significant, purpose of religion. The methods used were historical, expository and critical methods, and analysis. <br/><br/>We examined the various concepts of religion by different scholars, especially Karl Marx’s concept of religion which is the main purpose for this research. We also discussed how a true nature of religion ought to be and finally, a conclusion was drawn. <br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/><br/>INTRODUCTION <br/><br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/><br/>The history of religion can be traced to the ancient world. It can be traced to some religions such as orphism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, African Traditional Religions and so on. Religion, no doubt is a basis of societal order. It is a belief in a supernatural being which can influence one’s behavior. Religion enables us to play some roles in the society which includes shaping the life style of the individual that will make people live in unity. Religion also functions as an account of the wonders or mysteries in nature. Religion is important because it gives the individual that consciousness of living a moral life in the society. Religion is one of the key of morality which teaches us to separate what is right from what is wrong. It is a source of moral obligation which makes people to recommend that: “you must live a moral life because God has commanded you to do so”.1 <br/><br/>Having said that, religion in the era of Karl Marx was a tool of exploitation. At that time, the powerful and rich (bourgeoisie) used religion as a tool to exploit their workers or less privileged (proletariat), hence religion became the tool by which the bourgeoisie satisfied their egoistic desire through the labour of their workers. No wonder Karl Marx defined religion as “an opium of the people”.2 The issue of exploitation started with the origin of religion and not with Karl Marx. <br/><br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/><br/>The issue to be addressed is that of religion. Religion as already said above is a source of moral obligation. But it seems that this definition of religion is different from what Marx defined religion to be. Marx defined religion as a form of social consciousness.3 Religion is used to oppress and subjugate people. He believed that religion exists because of the economic exploitation that exist in the capitalist system. In the capitalist system, the masses who are always the majority (proletariat) are exploited by the minority (bourgeoisie). This leads to the problem of conflicts. This raises questions about the role of religion in suppressing people’s genuine agitations. It is this issue that this research sets out to deal with. The question really is, how can the link between man and God be compromised in order to serve the interest of domination and oppression by the bourgeoisie given the fact that “religion from the theological standpoint can be seen as the link between man and God”.4 <br/><br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>Religion is concerned about the morality of human conduct, and both presuppose human freedom and responsibility. Religion today has become a practice that leaves so much to be desired by people. Speaking from the Christian perspective, it is clear from what the new generational churches of today practice, that there is the problem of some so-called men of God, going about establishing churches with the aim of deceiving and exploiting people to enrich themselves. For this cause, this project is necessary in order to expose any false religious practices that may have informed Karl Marx’s notion of religion. Again, this project is important for the purpose of transforming religion by giving it a sincere concept where morality stands as its basis. <br/><br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/><br/>Religion is such a prominent feature in human society that it cannot be simply ignored.5 So, the significance of this research is to draw attention to the fact that it is only where religion is practiced with sincerity or genuinely that one can talk about the moral life of the individual in a given society: A human being can never be complete without the spiritual wellbeing which is an essential part of his human person. <br/><br/>Again, this research is important because it tends to show that in a particular society where true religion is practiced, morality is held in high esteem unlike in a society where people are treated unjustly. <br/><br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/><br/>Religion is important. But one cannot say for sure that it has all the answers to human predicaments. Fundamentally, this research shall be centred on Karl Marx notion of religion. Marx saw religion as the basis of all social evils.6 <br/><br/>However, the notion of religion by different scholars in different eras shall be discussed also where necessary. <br/><br/>METHOD OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>A method is a particular way of doing something.7 One of the methods to be used in this research is historical analysis. This will help to analyze the development of religion from the historical period to this period. We shall also use expository method. This will help to bring into view man’s notion of religion. Finally, we shall adopt the critical method to enable us x-ray the positive and negative aspect of Marx’s notion of religion. To this end, we shall rely on library and internet for textbooks, journals, articles and relevant class notes. <br/><br/>LITERATURE REVIEW <br/><br/>The first book to be reviewed is The Philosophical Journey: An Interactive Approach,8 written by W. F. Lawhead. In the sixth chapter of this book, both Marx and Hegel said that the dialectics is a historical process in which different opposing forces resolve their tension by bringing into being a new stage of history. <br/><br/>Another book to be reviewed is A Philosophical Look at Religion, written by J. Omoregbe.9 Chapter one of this book discusses different theories of religions such as the views of Sigmund Freud, Emile Durkheim among others. This book will help in discussing a general concept of religion and also in evaluating Marx’s theories of religion and making a critique of it. <br/><br/>Next to be reviewed is the journal article, The Marxist Theory on Revolution and Violence, by A. Schaff in Journal of the History of Ideas.10 Here, A. Schaff stresses the revolutions of the proletarians (workers) saying that the existing social and political system is to be changed by a revolution and that a social revolution is to be identified with an overthrow of that existing social system by violence. <br/><br/>Another book to be reviewed is The Voyage of Discovery, written by W. F. Lawhead.11 In chapter twenty five of this book, the author wrote on the influence of Feuerbach’s notion of religion had on Karl Marx. For Feuerbach, religion is created by humanity through an unconscious process of projection. This will help form a critique on Marx’s notion of religion. <br/><br/>The final book to be reviewed here is “Freud and Marx on Religion and Morals”, by R. Osborn in the Rational Animal.12 In this book, Osborn stressed the contribution of Marxism is to stress the social relevance of morality, the fact that one society is morally better than another to the extent that it provides a milieu in which men can approach their full human stature. It is relevant to my work in that it will help in exposing Marx’s notion of religion and its effects. </p>\n\nA PHILOSOPHICAL CRITIQUE OF KARL MARX’S CONCEPTION OF RELIGION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A PHILOSOPHICAL CRITIQUE OF KARL MARX’S CONCEPTION OF RELIGION", "id": 110}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><br/><strong>THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CHRISTIANITY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF URHOBO NATION</strong><br/><br/></p> <p>TABLE CONTENTS<br/><br/>Title Page---------ii<br/><br/>Certification---------iii<br/><br/>Dedication---------iv<br/><br/>Acknowledgement--------v<br/><br/>Table of Content--------vi<br/><br/>Abstract---------vii<br/><br/>CHAPTR ONE<br/><br/>General Introduction------1<br/><br/>1.1Statement of Problem------1<br/><br/>1.2Clarification of Terms------2<br/><br/>1.2.1Christianity--------2<br/><br/>1.2.2Development-------2<br/><br/>1.3Aims and Objectives------4<br/><br/>1.4Methodology-------4<br/><br/>1.5Scope of Study-------5<br/><br/>1.6Division of Work-------5<br/><br/>Endnotes--------7<br/><br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/><br/>The Historical Background of the Urhobo People--8<br/><br/>2.1The Historical Origin of the Urhobo People ---8<br/><br/>2.2Geographical Location ------12<br/><br/>2.3Religious Organisation------14<br/><br/>2.3.1The Urhobo Traditional Religion ----14<br/><br/>2.3.1.1 Urhobo Concept of God------15<br/><br/>2.3.1.2 The worship of Oghene------19<br/><br/>2.3.1.3 Cult of the Ancestors------22<br/><br/>2.3.2The Igbe Religion-------24<br/><br/>2.3.2.1.

A careful study of the religious background of the urhobo people will show that Christianity has found its way into the both the urban and rural areas of the urhobo society.<br/><br/>This study is aimed at looking into the relevance of Christianity in the development of the urhobo nation. For a better understanding of the project, a brief introduction to the lifestyle of the urhobo people prior to the advent of Christianity will also be made.<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>1.0 GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>1.1 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/><br/>Christianity is a product of the Jewish culture and religion. It is the gift of the Jews to the Roman Empire from where it spread to other parts of the world. Christianity often described as the most widespread religion since its inception has found its way into virtually almost all societies. The case of the spread of the religion can be attributed to the command given to the disciples and apostles of this faith by its founders Jesus Christ (Matt 28:19:20).<br/><br/>This research tries to examine the importance of this Jewish seed-Christianity-to the Urhobo people and nation who are located in the southern part of Nigeria. In recent years, the growth of Christianity in Urhoboland has been very rapid. The cause of this spread and expansion of Christianity in the land will also be treated. The history-political, economic and the social life the Urhobo people and their organizational structure will also be analyzed, as it will help to give a broad and clear and understanding of the task ahead. The lifestyle of the Urhobo people before the advent of Christianity and how Christianity has contributed to their development is not left out.<br/><br/>1.2CLARIFICATION OF TERMS<br/><br/>For a deeper understanding of this study, it is necessary to clarify some key terms and their related concepts. Some of these key terms and concepts are:<br/><br/>1.2.1CHRISTIANITY: Christianity is a religion that is based on or centered around the teachings of Jesus Christ. Christianity is about:<br/><br/>1. A person – Jesus Christ, the founder of Christianity.<br/><br/>2. A people – that God has formed on earth.<br/><br/>3. A way of life – that God had given to his people1.<br/><br/>1.2.2DEVELOPMENT: According to Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, development refers to a gradual growth. It is also a new state of something that is likely to affect what happens in a continuous manner. It involves economic growth and increased standard of living.<br/><br/>Within the context of this study, development refers to the growth of the society in question. Development therefore is the process of improving the quality of all human lives in all aspect.<br/><br/>1.2.3SOCIETY: A society is a particular community of people who share the same customs, laws etc. or a people living together in communities2. Society is also a grouping of individuals which are united by a network of social relations, traditions and may have a distinctive culture and institutions.<br/><br/>1.2.4URHOBO: The Urhobo people are located within the hinterland of the lower reaches of the Niger Delta region in Nigeria, between longitude 50300 and 60 25 East and latitude 60 50 North. They are surrounded by the Bini to the North, the Ijaw to the South, the Ukwani to the East and Itsekiri to the West.3<br/><br/>Urhobo people belong to the Edo speaking people of Delta State. They constitute the major minority group in Nigeria and the seventh largest ethnic group in the country.<br/><br/>1.3AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/><br/>The aims and objectives of this study are as follows:<br/><br/>To expose the impact of Christianity on the Urhobo people and culture and its role in the development of Urhobo nation. <br/><br/>To create awareness, a consciousness of the Urhobo personality and access the place of Christianity within the context of the Urhobo nation. <br/><br/>To invite an engaging conversation on the vital aspect of Urhobo history and culture which according to some scholars are under distress.<br/><br/>1.4METHODOLOGY<br/><br/>The major sources of this research work are from published books and internet materials. Occasional references to the sacred scripture of the religion in question will also be made. Interviews conducted in the course of the research are also included in the work. The primary sources are textbooks while the interviews are to serve as the secondary source.<br/><br/>1.5SCOPE OF STUDY<br/><br/>The work is limited to urhoboland. By urhoboland we mean the twenty two geo-political units or subunits, which make up the Urhobo nation. It is limited to the contacts and relationship between the Urhobo people and the Christian missions-how the religion of the Urhobo people affects Christianity and how Christianity also affected their dependence and interdependence etc though references to other societies and religion will also be made.<br/><br/>1.6DIVISION OF WORK <br/><br/>This work is divided into five chapters. Chapter one provides a general background study via the aims, methodology and clarification of terms. Chapter two discusses the historical origin and organizational lifestyle of the Urhobo nation. Chapter three is centered on the advent and expansion of Christianity while looking at the Urhobo traditional setting before Christianity. Chapter four looks at the contributions of the Christian religion to the Urhobo nation.<br/><br/>Finally, chapter five deals with evaluations, recommendations and conclusion.</p>\n\nTHE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CHRISTIANITY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF URHOBO NATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CHRISTIANITY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF URHOBO NATION", "id": 111}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>A Marxian Critique of Capitalism: A Contemporary Approach</strong><br/><br/></p> <p>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>This project is intended to expose the nature as capitalism as well as its merits and demerits. An exposure of the Marxian critique of the capitalist system and how marx pressed for the replacement of the system with the inauguration of communism through socialism shall then be explicated. It should be noted that according to marx, the only was to attain this goal is through a mass revolt bloody revolution. Hence a critical evaluation of the Marxian critique of the capitalist system as well as his suggestion of a bloody revolution will be done to see how valid these suggestions are when applied to the contemporary era.<br/><br/>Thereafter, a workable alternative solution/recommendation shall then be done in place of Karl Marx’s own solution/suggestion.<br/><br/>Also, while many workers today are indeed better off, many others are met. They are occasional sweat shop conditions even in countries like the United States, and there are many countries where the majority of workers are as relentlessly exploited today as they were during the capitalist era in Karl Marx’s time. Hence the general trend on which Marx had his eyes still prevails: the rich still get richer and more powerful, while the majority of ordinary employees can count themselves lucky if they have steady employment and more or less adequate benefits. In Africa for example, the income gap between the rich and the rest of society has been wealth usually translates into an imbalance of political power and influence as well, many capitalist countries tend to be, for all practical purposes, oligarchies rather than genuine democracies. Although their democratic institutions may be intact and functioning, their policies tend to be determined by wealthy elites much more than by citizens at large.<br/><br/>………………………………<br/><br/>It may have been time in the 19th century that workers had to work under sweatshop conditions, that the workday lasted twelve to fourteen hours, that sometimes children were literally chained to machines to work, that workplace safety did not exist, that workers were deprived of education, and most of all, that wages were so low that workers rarely could afford to buy the things they produced. But all these have since become very different. Capitalist in the 19th century may have been rather brutal, but the system has been reformed. Wages have increased, all sorts of benefits are provided by employers or social security system, and today’s industrial workers sometimes own and consume more material goods than even members of the old political cartoons that showed the capitalists with to[p hats, coat tails, and big guts, while depicting workers and their bedraggled families as emaciated, subdued wrecks, are surely outdated. Today’s workers are not as exported and miserable as marx describes them, and the relation of capital and labour is not so antagonistic and bad as to justify such old concepts as “class struggle” or “class war”.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the above objectives are not pointless due to the long and often ardius struggle of unions, as well as the vastly increased productivity of industrial labour, the economic position of many workers has significantly improved since the days of the Industrious revolution.<br/><br/><br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>1.1.BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/><br/>It has become increasingly common to hear that capitalism with its exploitative nature is dehumanizing and alienating – that is, alienating man from the product of his own labor, from his own self, from the society, as well as from nature. This kind of economic system, because of its exploitative nature of many people by few rich individuals, has led to the situation of man’s inhumanity to man. In this case, profits are made at all cost even at the expense of human life. In this type of economic system of government, few rich individuals amassed wealth at the expense of the majority and as such income is distributed inequitably to the detriment of the common man. Hence, Marx was dissatisfied with the system and called for its replacement with a better and humane one (communism).<br/><br/>Throughout Karl Marx’s life, the central theme of his writings and activities was centered on man and how to liberate him from the slavery that comes from man’s inhumanity to man. The subject of Karl Marx’s worry has been the isolated individual; an individual estranged from other people, from the fruit of his own labor, from nature, and even from his own deepest self and emotion. This doctrine of alienation in Marxism described the condition of the working class in the capitalist system in Karl Marx’s days whereby the workers (proletariats) were exploited and dehumanized by their employers (the capitalists/bourgeoisie). The product of their labor was taken from them. Hence, Marx called it “alienated labor”1 Thus the worker in the capitalist system is dehumanized and instrumentalized; he is no longer treated as a human being, but as an instrument of production in the hands of the bourgeois employers who use him to their own advantage. Hence, Marx proposed a remedy for this deplorable condition of the workers. His solution was the total destruction of the capitalist system with its concomitant evils and the establishment of communism through socialism. This solution, Marx says, can only be achieved through mass revolt/bloody revolution.<br/><br/>Influenced by the philosophy of Heraclitus and the dialectic of Hegel, Marx believed that “conflict is the universal law of progress”2. Both Heraclitus and Hegel considered war as good and necessary for progress. Heraclitus in particular, felt that perpetual peace would be undesirable since it would mean social stagnation and the end of progress. The universe, according to Heraclitus, is a universe of conflicts and clash of opposites, “we must know that war is common to all the strife is justice, and that all things come into being and pass away through strife”3. As for Hegel, harmony and progress are the results of conflicts. In his dialectic, progress or development is the result (the synthesis) of conflict or contradiction between two things (thesis and anti-thesis). The whole universe, according to Hegel, “is a self-projection of the absolute Spirit who develops itself through conflicts and contradictions, through thesis, antithesis and synthesis”4. <br/><br/>Marx therefore gave the philosophies of both Heraclitus and Hegel social interpretation and maintained that social progress can only come about through class conflicts. Hence he advocates for the total destruction of the capitalist system through mass revolt/bloody revolution.<br/><br/>However, the question that seems disturbing is the validity and tenability of Karl Marx’s critique of capitalism. The statement of problem is thus presented below.<br/><br/>1.2STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/><br/>Although we cannot but subscribe to the Marxist condemnation of exploitation of man by man, nevertheless, we cannot go along with his commitment to Machiavellianism. For we do not believe that any means employed to bring about a good end is morally justified. We hold on the contrary that the end does not and cannot justify the means. <br/><br/>Consequently, it is an evil in itself to employ a bad means to bring about a good end. We can therefore not go along with Marxism in encouraging class conflicts, class antagonism and violent revolutions. Nor do we subscribe to the Heraclitan-Hegelian-Marxist dogma that social change and progress can only come about through violent conflicts and bloody revolutions. Nobody wins a war these days; in the long run both sides are the losers. Worst of all, it is generally the poor and the innocent who are sacrificed as victims to the “gods of revolution”. This itself is evil, and an evil means should not be used to bring about a good end.<br/><br/>Moreover, although Marx’s intention was to safeguard the welfare of the people, but by calling for a violent revolution, the welfare of the people which he was trying to safeguard will no longer be safe. This is because the violence that goes along with a revolution is a threat to security of lives and property.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Marx seems not to be concerned with the method but with the ends of the struggle. This is prone to error because goals achieved by proper means are always more lasting and are of permanent duration than those achieved by improper means. Therefore, for a lasting peace and stability, it is not the end that matters but what matters is the method by which these ends are actually achieved.<br/><br/>To push it further, Marxian theory of state is not so sound as prima facie it may appear. His emphasis on armed revolution is rather too much and cannot be justified especially today when nations are thinking more in terms of peaceful co-operation rather than war. Who can deny that violence brings with it hatred and destruction of lives (especially the innocent ones) and property and counter-revolutionary forces will breed more destruction and instability in the society. Settlement of disputes by violent revolution is bound to retard political and social progress. It is therefore beyond all reasonable doubts that the changes brought about by an armed and violent revolution is less durable than the changes brought about by peaceful means and method on the one hand, and persuation on the other hand. As I put it, “persistent, unflinching and patient persuation can break even the strongest resistance”.<br/><br/>Going further, Marx’s method of over-throwing one economic system and its replacement with another is dangerous to the extent that it has never paved way for enduring stability. Instability which this revolution will bring with it, shall always remain alive in the minds of the capitalists who in turn are bound to over-throw the workers regime at the first available opportunity. This will be never-ending struggle which is unwanted both for nation’s economic progress, cultural advancement and political stability. This is not to say that an oppressive economic system should not be confronted and replaced but the confrontation should not be that drastic to the extent that stability would be elusive.<br/><br/>Also, Marx believes that the only way to bring about a change is through bloody revolution. But he forgets that there are peaceful methods also for bringing about changes. Gandhiji brought change in Indian political and social life without any bloody or violent revolution in the Marxian sense of the term but by non-violent means and method.<br/><br/>Arguing further, Marx has not realized that on the collapse of state many other factors and classes might emerge. It should be noted that break-down of capitalism might result not in communism but in anarchy from which there might emerge some dictatorship unrelated in principle to communism.<br/><br/>Finally, it should be noted that the baby should not be thrown away alongside with the bath water. But Marx fell prey into this problem. While pressing for the elimination of capitalism and the inauguration of communism through socialism, Marx inevitably threw away hardwork which leads to invention and innovation, which in turn encourages faster economic and societal development and progress. It is a known fact that capitalism which leads to faster economic growth and societal development is as a result of hardwork. Therefore, while pressing for the elimination of the capitalist system, Marx was inevitably eliminating progress and development from the society.<br/><br/>Having presented the statement of problem, I shall now proceed to the purpose of study.<br/><br/>1.3PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>The purpose of this research work is presented below:<br/><br/>Firstly, it is to critically analyze and evaluate capitalism with its exploitative nature as put forward by Karl Marx.<br/><br/>Secondly, it is to objectively weigh the suggestion of mass revolt/bloody revolution put forward by Karl Marx as a way of destroying the capitalist system to see how valid and tenable this suggestion would be when applied to the contemporary era.<br/><br/>Thirdly, an attempt shall be made to bring out the flaws in Karl Marx’s critique of capitalism as well as his suggestion of communism using the tool of mass revolt/bloody revolution. Thereafter a workable alternative solution/recommendation in place of Karl Marx’s own recommendation of bloody revolution as a way of alleviating the pitiable condition of the working class from the hands of their bourgeois employers shall be proffered.<br/><br/>Having presented the purpose of study, I shall now expose the significance of study.<br/><br/>1.4SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>The significance of this research work is enormous. However few of them shall be exposed below:<br/><br/>Firstly, it will serve as an analytic-cum-critical review of the much esteemed doctrine of Karl Marx criticism of capitalism and his proposal of communism through socialism as an alternative to the capitalist system using the tool of mass revolt/bloody revolution.<br/><br/>Secondly, it will serve as a medium of courage to all those, especially the poor who are victims of the exploitative, alienating and dehumanizing condition in the society in which they find themselves, that there is a workable solution to their problems if only they can unite with one voice, but which must not necessarily result to a bloody revolution as recommended by Karl Marx.<br/><br/>Thirdly, it will serve as a clarion call for all workers of the world to unite, as unity is a basis for a successful protest against an unwanted system of government in the society. In other words, this research work will instill on the minds of the people (the working class) the spirit of unity and co-operation which is a necessary tool for the achievement of their freedom from exploitation and dehumanization in the hands of their employers by enlightening them on the way forward on how to carry out their struggle of freedom from the oppressive nature of the capitalist system. As Karl Marx puts it, “the proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. WORKING MEN OF ALL COUNTLESS, UNITE!”5 <br/><br/>Fourthly, this research work will also serve as a deterrent to the few rich individuals in the society who are agents of marginalization of the poor and less privileged. It will go a long way to tell them that when you so much push someone to the extent that he has gotten to the wall, he may have no other option than to turn and face you for a fight.<br/><br/>Finally, this research work will as well be of great importance to critically evaluate the position of those philosophers and thinkers who sought for solution to such kind of problems (like the ones posed by the capitalist) following the pattern/ideology of Karl Marx’s mass revolt/bloody revolution.<br/><br/>Having exposed the significance of the study, I will now proceed to the scope of study.<br/><br/>1.5SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>This research work shall in scope be limited to the doctrine of capitalism as well as the Marxian notion of capitalism. An attempt shall be made to explain Karl Marx’s critique of the capitalist system and how he pressed for a communist society free from the exploitation of the working class posed by the capitalists. Thereafter a critical evaluation of Karl Marx’s critique of the capitalist system as well as his idea of replacing it with communism through socialism will be made to see how valid and tenable they are. Thereafter a conclusion as well as a recommendation will be made.<br/><br/>Having made known the scope of study, I shall now move to the methodology.<br/><br/>1.6METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>The method of this research work shall be analytic-cum-critical in nature. Analytic in the sense that the issue at stake will be examined in detail. It has to do with a thorough breakdown; a conceptual clarification, a detailed explanation of the issue at stake. And critical in that, it is not a negative appraisal, but rational, impartial, articulate and fair appraisal whether positive or negative. To be “critical” of received ideas is accordingly not the same thing as rejecting them: it consists rather in seriously asking oneself whether the ideas in question should be reformed, modified or conserved, and in applying one’s entire intellectual and imaginative intelligence to the search for an answer.<br/><br/>As a result of the above, materials to prosecute the research work will be gotten from the library as well as other relevant sources.</p>\n\nA MARXIAN CRITIQUE OF CAPITALISM: A CONTEMPORARY APPROACH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A MARXIAN CRITIQUE OF CAPITALISM: A CONTEMPORARY APPROACH", "id": 112}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF JOHN RAWLS’ SECOND PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE</strong><br/><br/></p> <p>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>John Rawls’ “A theory of justice” published in 1971, changed contemporary political theory.

The debate is all about what the concept ‘justice’ means and how it can be attained in a society. Thrasymachus, an ancient Greek philosopher, equated justice with ‘‘might is right’’. According to Christopher Stolleri, ‘’Justice is a concept that is balanced between law and morality’’1. Morality has to do with the rightness or wrongness of an action. Laws are laid down principles that guide a society and they can be used for the good or bad of a nation’s citizens. For Joseph Omoregbe, ‘’the foundation of Justice is the fundamental equality of all men’’2. Justice is applied in a society so that there will be peace and harmony in the society. A society is an aggregate of people living together in a more or less ordered community. <br/><br/>From this, various philosophers gave their various theories of how justice can be attained in the society.<br/><br/>Socrates, a Greek philosopher, felt that justice can be attained in a society when wisdom is employed. For Plato, it is when philosophers are kings in the society. According to Karl Marx, a just society is a classless society which he referred to as communism. John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham are of the view that we arrive at a just society when the society acts to provide ‘’the greatest good for the greatest number’.<br/><br/>John Rawls provided his own theory of justice by criticizing the utilitarian view of justice because it can be abused, leading to the ‘’tyranny of the majority’’ (Nazi Germany’s mistreatment of the Jews and the United States mistreatment of African Americans)3. Rawls’ approach guards against this common source of injustice.<br/><br/>Principles of justice are the principles that rational and free persons that are concerned to further their interests would accept in an initial position of equality as defining fundamentals of the term of their association.4 In his book, ‘A Theory of Justice’, like Plato, Rawls imagines a political society structured on principles of justice, a just society where nobody complains of injustice, a society governed by principles of justice.<br/><br/>From the above, John Rawls came up with his own idea of a just society by providing two principles that can guide a society to attain the state of a just society. He did this by giving a theory of the people in the original position wearing a veil of ignorance that they would not be partial. One of John Rawls’ primary aim was to set forth the appropriate moral conception that was better suited to interpreting the democratic values of freedom and equality than the reigning utilitarian tradition.<br/><br/>It is in the light of this background that my research intends to critically analyze the principles that John Rawls gave to guide us to a just society. In order to achieve this, I shall consider the following: the people of the original position, the veil of ignorance and the principles accepted, mainly focusing on his second principle of justice. <br/><br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/><br/>The second principle states that: social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both (a) to the greatest benefit of all the least advantaged, consistent with the just saving principle, (b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.<br/><br/>Various problems arise, for instance, can there ever really be equal opportunities given the fact that nature itself is not equal? Is it fair for things to be shared equally when people do not give the same quota to the society? How do the individuals gain possession of goods?<br/><br/>Although John Rawls’ principle of justice is an improvement from some other solutions to the problem of justice, the question is, can we say that John Rawls’ second principle of justice is adequate in guiding a society to a state where it can be regarded as a just society? Can it be universally accepted? These questions are the core areas of this study.<br/><br/>1.3SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>This study will focus primarily on John Rawls’ second principle of justice, but before then, I shall view the steps that led to accepting the principle and I shall also give a critique of John Rawls’ second principle of justice.<br/><br/>Although my research will be far and wide, the scope of this study however shall be limited entirely on John Rawls second principle of justice.<br/><br/>1.4PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>This study aims at providing better understanding of John Rawls second principle of justice, by analyzing it. There will also be a critique of John Rawls’ second principle of justice so that the tenability of the principle can be assessed. By understanding John Rawls’ second principle of justice better and viewing the various critiques, we can finally be able to evaluate and pass a judgment if it can really guide a society to becoming a just society.<br/><br/>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/><br/>This study helps to give a full understanding of John Rawls’ second principle of justice, taking note of its positive and negative side without accepting it dogmatically. Rawls argues that his principles of justice should be used to assess the justice of actual social institutions, such as political government that govern human being.<br/><br/>We can decide if John Rawls’ second principle can guide a society into a just society. With this project, after critically analyzing John Rawls’ second principle of justice, we can decide for ourselves if it is the answer to the problem of our present day society or if it is just another theory to be disregarded. <br/><br/>1.6 METHOD OF STUDY<br/><br/>In this project, I shall employ the analytical cum critical method. I shall rely on data collection from text books, articles, journals, the internet and any other source relevant to this project topic. This method will help us to fully understand John Rawls’ second principle of justice and pose some critical question.<br/><br/>1.7 LITERATURE REVIEW<br/><br/>The first book reviewed is authored by John Rawls himself, titled “Theory of Justice’’ published in 1971 by Harvard University Press. I reviewed this book for the obvious reason that it was written by John Rawls himself. This book gave us a firsthand view of John Rawls’ principle of justice.<br/><br/>Another book reviewed is by Samuel Freeman titled “Rawls” published in 2007 by Freeman, projected an understanding of Rawls’ work. He gave attention to every detail and this is as a result of his awareness of the overall structure of the theory and the philosophical significance of Rawls’ grand strategy.<br/><br/>I also reviewed a book by Joseph Omoregbe titled “Social-Political Philosophy and International Relations” published in 2007 Lagos. This book gave an in depth meaning of justice, it also emphasized the idea of distributive justice in which John Rawls second principle of justice can be classified under. From there, Omoregbe breaks down John Rawls’ idea of the principle of justice.<br/><br/>Another book that was reviewed is by Paul Graham titled “Rawls” published in 2007 by One World thinkers. In this book, Paul Graham gave his own interpretation and understanding of John Rawls’ work.<br/><br/>I also reviewed a book by Stumpf and Abel titled “Elements of philosophy” published in 2002 by McGraw-Hill.

It is a means of securing the lives of the individuals. Among all communities in Africa, life is regarded as sacred. Each individual’s life is seen as a gift from God to the community and to the family.<br/><br/>Ihiala Local Government Area which is located in Anambra State is a community of people who hare and believe in African traditional World view and Institutions.<br/><br/>This work is to know African Traditional way of medical health practices, and its application and concept in Ihiala L.G.A of Anambra State. There are many ways of medical health practices now in Africa more than ever before. We need to study African Traditional Medical health practices and its belief and concept in Ihiala as a community. This will help to correct the false impression people have about African traditional way of medical health practices.<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONEGENERAL INTRODUCTION1.1BACKGROUND OF THE STUDYAfrican is a large continent with many countries that have different tribes and cultures. Nigeria is one of the countries in Western part of Africa. In Nigeria, there are thirty-six states among which Anambra is one of them, and Ihiala L.G.A is one of its local government area in Anambra South Senatorial Zone. It is made up of nine (9) autonomous towns.<br/><br/>Practice of medicine is an important part of indigenous religions in Africa. Disease in this part of the world is normally regarded as having some spiritual cause. African traditional medicine is a medicine known and practiced by Africans from time immemorial for the health need of her people. It has an important place in health care delivery among Africans.<br/><br/>In Ihiala L.G.A, according to Obiaofo, it was believed that African traditional way of practising medicine have power to sustain the lives of every individuals in the community, it is used to counteract the powers of destruction and evil spirit. It is beneficial to man and important to the religious and social life of the people.<br/><br/>Practice of medicine is important to any religion especially in the case of African traditional religion. In Ihiala L.G.A, many people seek out diviners on a regular basis. There are generally no prohibitions against the practice. Those who tell fortunes for a living are also sought out for their wisdom as counsellor and for their knowledge of herbal medicine. Practice of African traditional medicine is an important part of their religion. Healers are reputed to have professional knowledge of illness (pathology), surgery and pharmacology (roots, barks, leaves, and herbs). Some of them are also reputed to diagnose and treat mental and psychological problems. The healer advises in all aspects of life including physical, psychological, spiritual, moral and legal matters. They also understand the significance of ancestral spirits and the concepts of witches (hence the colonial term witch-doctor). Ihiala people believed that traditional African medicine is a holistic discipline involving indigenous herbalism and African spirituality, typically involving diviners, midwives and herbalists. Practitioners of traditional African medicine claim to be able to cure various and diverse conditions such as cancer, psychiatric disorders, high blood pressure, cholera, most venereal diseases, epilepsy, asthma, eczema, fever, depression and healing of wounds and burns.<br/><br/>Traditional African medicine with its belief that illness is not derived from chance occurrences, but through spiritual or social imbalance, differs greatly from western medicine which is technically and analystically based. Diagnosis is reached through spiritual means and a treatment is prescribed usually consisting of an herbal remedy that has not only healing abilities, but symbolic and spiritual significance.<br/><br/>1.2STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS <br/><br/>Despite the importance and strong points of African Traditional Medicine, there are some problems associated with it especially as it is practised these days. These problems have almost discredited the very important heritage.<br/><br/>First among these problems affecting African Traditional medical practices today is, there are misconceptions about the concept of African traditional medicine in African countries, even among the people in Ihiala L.G.A. An average Ihiala youth especially people who live outside the community or outside Africa, develop their idea of African traditional medical health practices from films or stories. These films or stories often portray the African traditional medical health practices as evil, diabolic and in human acts that should be done away as practiced by evil and primitive people.<br/><br/>Another problem associated with African traditional medical health practices according to Omonzejele (2003) is when it resort to spiritual explanation for the causation of ill-health which is attributed to many mystical forces. This factor limits African traditional medicine to the extent that it is extremely difficult to provide explanation and evidence in accordance to basic epistemology for the cure of aliment even when the therapy is effective. For instance in Nigeria, everyone knows that orthopaedic cases are best handled by traditional practitioners, but the connection between the broken leg of hen and the treatment of a patient with a broken leg is quiet difficult to explain. In Western medicine, scientific explanations are usually provided on how a particular drug works with body chemistry, in that wise, one cannot expect the west and non-Africans to accept any kind of cure or advances in medicine by Africans without adequate explanation.<br/><br/>Again the fallout of Africa’s economic woes has also contributed to the problems facing African traditional medical practices. There are many traditional medical practitioners, most of them are mere charlants who like the sophists of the ancient times make huge sums of money from the trade. In the past, traditional health practitioners only saw what they did in terms of services to their communities where one cannot really afford to be dubious. The African traditional practitioners of this present day move from the rural to urban areas with the sole purpose to enrich themselves. They are patronised by unsuspecting patients. These mobile practitioners of African traditional medicine sometimes do not know anything about African traditional medicine. They are just merely people who were unable to cope with present economic situation thereby having no other option than to resort to this type of trade. They are in the business perhaps because most Africans somehow have confidence and believe in African traditional medicine.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the methods and procedures of using or the trial of new drug before its application on humans in African traditional medicine is weak. That by using the bark of a particular tree which was effective in animals does not show good and enough reason that the same bark will be effective in treating human beings that has a similar ailment. The African traditional practitioners hardly have knowledge of botanical properties of the drugs they use. They are unable to anticipate the effect the drug would have on humans at the trial stage, which he ought to share with the subject as to enable them make informed consent or refusal. They only hopes that the drug “works” without adverse effects. This kind of act is quiet insufficient because the drug may not only “work” but may be harmful to the subject (patient).<br/><br/>However, in other to correct these problems, misconceptions, the African Traditional Medical Health practices should be studied as it is an important religious liturgical act, and also of great value and significant to every individual and the society as a whole in almost all sphere of life.<br/><br/>1.3AIM OF THE STUDYThe aim of this study is to explore African tradition, with specific interest in her traditional medical health practices. Consequently to delineate the social stance of Ihiala L.G.A in the African Traditional Medical Health Practices.<br/><br/>1.4LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDYThis study has many limitations which include:<br/><br/>The limitation imposed by lack of finance: In this case the researcher did not have enough money with which to carryout the study, and so she has to borrow most of the time.<br/><br/>Limitation imposed by lack of time: This case the researcher did not have enough time to carry out a research of this nature. Lack of time therefore restricted the development of this research work.<br/><br/>Lack of enough materials in the area of study: In this study, the researcher did not get enough materials with which to carry out a study of this type. This is because, the topic is a relatively new one and the literatures on it are very scanty.<br/><br/>Problem of distance: In this case, the researcher had to travel from Benin to Ihiala to see her interviewers.<br/><br/>Unco-operative attitude of some of the respondents: In this case, some of the people interviewed did not give the required response to the researcher during the course of the research work. <br/><br/>1.5SCOPE OF STUDYThis study focused on the concept and belief of African Traditional Medical Health practices in Ihiala L.G.A. Ihiala is one of the L.G.A in Anambra South Senatorial Zone, and it is made up of nine (9) autonomous towns viz: Uli, Ihiala, Okija, Azia, Mbosi, Isekke, Orsumoghu, Uburuisiuzo and Lilu. <br/><br/>1.6RESEARCH METHODOLOGY <br/><br/>A qualitative research designs were adopted in this study using descriptive approach in the analysis. Literary works, field studies like observation, interview, media report and oral literature, were used as research tools.<br/><br/>The data collected from using different research method was analysed and carefully organised to present a clear detailed intellectual concept of African traditional medical health practices, its belief in Ihiala L.G.A. The data provided by this work listed observation and interview as primary instrument, literary material and internet sources copiously used as secondary source of data collection. The dictionary is used for definition and clarification of terms.<br/><br/>1.7CLARIFICATION OF TERMS.Considering the fact that certain terms and concepts used in this write may have more than one meaning, the researcher hereby offers the meanings of such words as they are used here in:<br/><br/>Traditional: This stand as being part of the beliefs, customs or way of life of a particular group of people that have not changed for a long time. Older methods and ideas rather than moderns or different one.<br/><br/>Medical: This is connected with ways of treating illness that do not involve cutting the body.<br/><br/>Health: This is the state of being physically and mentally healthy.<br/><br/>Practice: A way of doing something that is the usual or expected way in a particular organization; habit or a custom.<br/><br/>Belief: Something that you believe, especially as part of your religion. <br/><br/>1.8SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDYThis study is significant for a number of reasons which include:<br/><br/>This study is important because it can influence other researchers in this regard.<br/><br/>Through this study, African traditional medical health practices will be revealed to the entire world and not Africans alone.<br/><br/>Through this study, the belief and concept of African traditional medical health practices in Ihiala L.G.A is also elaborated.<br/><br/>Through this study also, activities of various African traditional medical health practitioners will be revealed and direct their patronisers more to use their discretion. <br/><br/><br/><br/>END NOTESOmonzejele .F.

Being has been a very intriguing issue that has held philosophers spell bound over the years. Philosophers throughout the ages have tried to give it their own interpretation based on the way they have conceived it. Heidegger, in response to the problem of being, arose to develop a largely acceptable interpretation of what he conceives as being. Whether he succeeded would be an issue that would be treated in this project.<br/><br/>TABLE OF CONTENT <br/><br/>Tile Page - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i<br/><br/>Certification - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ii<br/><br/>Dedication - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - iii<br/><br/>Acknowledgements - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - iv<br/><br/>Abstract - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -vi<br/><br/>Table of Contents - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - vii<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE: General Introduction<br/><br/>Background of the study - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1<br/><br/>Statement of problem - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 3<br/><br/>Purpose of study - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 4<br/><br/>Significance of study - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 4<br/><br/>Scope of study - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 5<br/><br/>Methodology - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 6<br/><br/>Literature Review - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 6<br/><br/>Endnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 9 <br/><br/>CHAPTER TWO: Heidegger in Historicity<br/><br/>Life and Work - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 10<br/><br/>Influences - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 12<br/><br/>General concept of Being - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 13<br/><br/>Endnotes--------- 20<br/><br/>CHAPTER THREE: Heidegger on Being<br/><br/>The ontological error of western philosophy--- 22<br/><br/>Heidegger’s fundamental ontology----- 23<br/><br/>Being and beings--------24<br/><br/>Being and Time--------27<br/><br/>Why is there something rather than nothing?----31<br/><br/>The significance of unanswerable question----34<br/><br/>Authentic and Inauthentic life------36<br/><br/>Endnotes---------39<br/><br/>CHAPTER FOUR: Evaluation and Conclusion<br/><br/>The relevance of Being in Heidegger’s thought----41<br/><br/>A critique on Heidegger (Merits and Demerits)--- 44<br/><br/>The proper conception of Being-------46<br/><br/>Evaluation---------47<br/><br/>Conclusions---------48<br/><br/>Endnotes---------49<br/><br/>Bibliography---------50<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/><br/>The central part of metaphysics is ontology; study of Being. The word ontology derives from the Greek word ‘On’ (in the plural ‘onta’), which is the present participle of ‘einai’, the verb ‘to be’. (Kenny 2010:160).<br/><br/>The founder of ontology was Parmenides and he defined it by placing the definite article “to” in front of the participle ‘on’. ‘To on’, literally ‘the being’, on the model of the living; means: All that is .it is customary, argues Kenny (2010:160), to translate the expression into English as (Being) with an initial capital. Without a capital, the English word ‘being’ has in philosophy two senses or uses, one corresponding to the Greek participle and one to Greek infinitive. A being, we can say, using the participle is an individual that is, whereas being (using the verbal noun) is, as it were, what any individual being is engaged in. The totality of individual being makes up being.<br/><br/>For Parmenides ‘Being is, and non-being is not, for Heraclitus Being is becoming, for Plato, Being exist in the world of ‘transcendental form’. For Aristotle, it is the study of anything that is, whether material or immaterial. For Thomas Aquinas, it refers to all that is and their ultimate support (ultimate principle). For some contemporary thinkers, being is abstract and refers to nothing concrete. It is therefore important to point out that the entire metaphysical journey is that of trying to understand being in this effort to explicate being, Heidegger the great German philosopher is not left out.<br/><br/>The problem which Heidegger sets out to investigate is not the problem of man but the problem of Being. He feels passionately that it is necessary to restate this ancient problem which has been neglected.<br/><br/>Do we in our own time have answer to the question of what we really mean by the word ‘being’? Not at all! So it is fitting that we should raise a new question of the meaning being… <br/><br/>Our aim in the following treatise is to work out the question of the meaning of being and to do so correctly (Heidegger: 1962: 80).<br/><br/>Martin Heidegger entered into the metaphysical world with the aim of correcting what he calls the “Ontological error of western philosophy”. According to Ireogbu (1995:214), on reading historically back, however, Heidegger asserts:<br/><br/>That in its historical journey, something has gone wrong with metaphysics. It has missed its way in terms of the primary object of its occupation: Being.<br/><br/>But metaphysics in the process forgot the most fundamental subject of its inquiry. The “Sein, “Ens”, Being”, or “To be”, of the different levels of being. ‘The forgotten Being here is the difference between Being and beings, Otherwise called “Ontological difference”.<br/><br/>Heidegger’s query was that the fundamental ontological question on Being has been forgotten and so he set out on a reformation of being. Firstly, he started by posing the fundamental ontological questions.<br/><br/>What is Being? Why is there being rather than nothing? (Heidegger, 1962:88) whether Heidegger succeeded in his quest is one that we will discover as we progress with this project. This project is therefore a critical attempt to investigate into the “onto-logos” of Being and at the same time to correct the mistakes of his predecessors<br/><br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/><br/>A fact that should be taken into consideration is that Being itself is veiled which makes an accurate difocation of it to be very difficult.<br/><br/>The first problem we shall encounter here is that of articulating the nature of something that is veiled or hidden. This according to Heidegger makes the forgetfulness of being a part of its reality. The second problem is Heidegger’s attempt to derive the notion of Being from the notion of Dasien (Man). Metaphysically the concept of Being is prior to the concept of man. It becomes problematic to attempt to draw the concept of Being from that of man. In fact the concept of man is always dependent on a particular concept of Being. It is the horse that should draw the cart and not the other way round.<br/><br/>The last problem that will face us in this project is that Heidegger’s theory of Being is a metaphysical inversion of religion. Not only is Heidegger consciously silent on the God question, his preponderant use of pre-Socratic text is denounced by Levinas as anti-scripture. (Ireogbu, 1995: 23).<br/><br/>1.3 PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/><br/>Heidegger lashed out at his predecessors and accused them of forgetfulness of Being. Our purpose here is to critically assess the reasons behind Heidegger’s accusation and then see whether he succeeded in reconstructing Being positively.<br/><br/>Further more, the question of Being has been very elusive and difficult to grasp. Much as the history of philosophy is riddled with bad answers that need requestioning. What is Being? Remains a question to be now and again restated in new vocabularies, given new circumstances. It is therefore our intention to re-examine and re-evaluate old questions within the context of contemporary experiences. The contemporary experience seems to be based on concrete issues and questions and not on abstract entities like Being and non-Being.<br/><br/>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/><br/>The significance or relevance or importance of this project cannot be over-emphasized “Being as Ireogbu articulates (1995: 60)” is the primum notum (The first to be known) and the per se notum (The most self-evident) “reality of the human intellect” Heidegger’s giant contribution to the question of Being is unquestionable. His profound analysis of ‘Dasien’ is refreshingly revealing.<br/><br/>The question he postulated “why is there anything instead of nothing”? Is one of the most important questions that face man in the contemporary era? A world where Being is neglected would not be a meaningful world. It is in fact impossible to neglect it as Being speaks for itself. This project is therefore contributing to the knowledge in the senses that we want to ground meaning ultimately, we want to understand Being in the context of past, present and future with a view towards man’s ontological end. If as Heidegger argues that a man is a “Being unto death” and that death brings fulfillment instead of destruction, then it follows that we should seek to understand Being comprehensively.<br/><br/>1.5 SCOPE OF STUDY<br/><br/>This work should be limited in scope to a critical evaluation of Heideggerian concept of Being. The work divides itself into four (4) chapter’s methodology. <br/><br/>Chapter One(1) deals with scientific methodology. Chapter Two (2) examines Heidegger’s historicity. Chapter Three (3) examines Heidegger’s concept of Being. Chapter four (4) which is the last chapter focuses on merits and demerits of Heidegger’s works etc.<br/><br/>1.6 METHODOLOGY<br/><br/>Basically, we would be combining two methods in this thesis. First is the analytic method which will enable us reflect systematically, coherently, consistently, logically and otherwise. If Being is veiled it is only through analyses that its hiddeness shall be unveiled.<br/><br/>Secondly, we shall be employing the critical method. This second method shall enable us to examine the strength and weakness of Being as a concept.<br/><br/>LITERATURE REVIEW<br/><br/>The first book under review here is titled Heidegger: A Beginner’s Guide, authored by Michael Watts, published at Oxon by Hodder and Stroughton press Ltd in 2007. The author’s informative text explores the following.<br/><br/>Heidegger’s background and the times he lived.<br/><br/>The central ideas of Heidegger’s work in simple terms.<br/><br/>Heidegger’s influence on ecology, art and literature and lastly, the continuing importance of Heidegger to philosophy and contemporary thought. The next work to be reviewed here is titled: A Commentary On Heidegger’s Being And Time, written by Michael Gelven, published by Northern: Illinois-university press, 1989. For the author, Heidegger equiperates Being with Time (Zein und Zeit). For him, existence within time refers to our fundamental way of Being which simultaneously spans and is constituted by the three dimensions of time-past, present and future. The third book under review is titled: The Cambridge Companion To Heidegger, edited by Christian Guignon and published by Cambridge university press, 1996. The central theme of this companion is fundamental ontology. By this Heidegger understands the critical or preliminary step of first studying the human being before one then pursues the investigation of the ‘sein’. It is the preliminary analytic of the Dasien which is the sole focus where the Being-question is posed and tackled.<br/><br/>The fourth book to be reviewed here is authored by Pantaleon Iroegbu titled Metaphysics: The Kpim Of Philosophy, published in Owerri in 1995 by international university press Ltd. The author, insist here that Being is the fundamental bedrock of any metaphysics. For Ireogbu, Being is and non-beings is not. Being is englobing and encompassing. It signifies the totality of reality. He especially devoted chapter 17 of this work to explaining, analyzing and evaluating Heidegger ontological difference. For Heidegger, the question of Being has today been forgotten, the challenge therefore, and that is Heidegger’s metaphysical project is that the question of the meaning of Being must be re-formulated,<br/><br/>The next book under review is titled: The Problem Of Metaphysics, authored by Fredrick Sontag, published in Pennsylvania by chandler publishing company in 1970. According to the author, philosophy, in so far as it is, is a search for first principles is the basic assumption implicit in any question in metaphysics. It teaches us a radical form of questioning. In this sense, “Metaphysics is simply basic of philosophy”. The search for and the questioning of first principles. The author insist here that metaphysics deals with problems which themselves involves even more fundamental problems, and the exasperation involves in this difficult enterprise comes from an impartial desire simply to settle a question without first reformulating and criticizing the question itself. One of these basic metaphysical problem is that of the true meaning of Being. Chapter six (6) of this book centers on the problem of being as Heidegger encountered it when he contrasted being with non-being.<br/><br/>The last book under review here is titled Delimitations, Phenomenology And The End Of Metaphysics, authored by John Salles, published by Indiana university press in 1986. Chapter seven of this book is devoted to the origins of Heidegger’s thought and the questions of Being. The author argues that the historical origins of Heidegger’s thoughts in the restricted sense specified are thus constituted by Husserlian phenomenology and Greek ontology. However, the basics question is “How is it that Being is what remains in thought in the appeal to the things themselves? How is it that a radical-phenomenology must become ontology?”<br/><br/>WORKS CITED<br/><br/>Gelven, Michael, (1989), A Commentary On Heidegger’s Being And Time, (Illonis: Nothern Illonis University Press.<br/><br/>Guignon, Christian, (1995), The Cambridge University Companion To Heidegger, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press Ltd.<br/><br/>Iroegbu, Pantaleon, (1995), Metaphysics: The Kpim Of Phylosophy, Owerri International University Press ltd.<br/><br/>Heidegger, Martin, (1962), Being And Time, (trans) by John Macquarrie, Oxford: Blackwell Publishers.<br/><br/>Kenny, Anthony (2010), A New History Of Western Philosophy, Oxford: Clarendon Press.<br/><br/>Salles, John, (1986), Delimitations: Phenomenology And The End Of Metaphysics, Indianapolis: Indiana University Press.<br/><br/>Sontag, Fredrick, (1970), Problems Of Metaphysics, Pensylavania: A Chandler Series.<br/><br/>Watts, Martin, (2007), Heidegger: A Beginner’s guide, Oxon: Hodder and Stoughton Press. </p>\n\nA CRITICAL EVALUATION OF MARTIN HEIDEGGER�S CONCEPT OF BEING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF MARTIN HEIDEGGER�S CONCEPT OF BEING", "id": 115}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT <br/><br/>Inspite of the religious was of the people of Delta State, the question of the role of religion in the politics of Delta State still stand as a major challenge to religious scholars. This essay in its bid to unravel the role of religion in the society, outrightly dwelt on the impart of religion in politics. <br/><br/>In this research, different methods ranging from interviews with political stakeholders and clergies, personal observations, journals, newspapers and other related material to the topic were used. Though the work is limited to Delta State, it findings could be applicable to the entire southern part of Nigeria particularly the areas dominated by Christianity and African Traditional Practices. <br/><br/>While the first chapter of this essay dealt with the method, scope and significance of the study, the second chapter dealt the views of different authors. It also defined the concept of politics and the different religious practices among the different ethnic groups in Delta State. <br/><br/>Chapter three dwelt on the role of religious leaders and traditional rulers in mobilizing the youth in the political system while chapter four largely dwelt on the relationship between the church and the state and also on the role of the church in combating the moral laxity in the political system today. It also talks extensively on the role of religion in the electoral system in Delta State. <br/><br/>Finally, it was concluded that the role of religion in politics is not limited to institutions like the churches and government rather it cut across the individuals such as the traditional rulers, the priests, the youth and the elders who forms the religious congregation and the political actors who are at the center of the political sphere. <br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION <br/><br/>Cultural values and moral integrity are social indicators that guarantees the general acceptance of individual within the society. The control of the government machinery is entrusted to a few individuals, however, the fear of changeable and unreliable nature of man often introduce religious beliefs into the political sphere.1 This is due to the view that belief is a component of moral behavior and at such our beliefs affects our conducts.2 This fact clearly explains why there is hardly any political office holder today, that does not profess religion. <br/><br/>Inspite of the difference which exist between religion and politics which presupposes that religion deals with the realm of conviction and ultimate reality, a view in life sees good and calls it into reality while politics is seen as a realm of compromise in which ultimate purposes clash, interest competes and conflicting claims are adjusted by a process of give and take;3 the ethical views and realities which coexist side by side within our society weave religion deeply into politics particularly in the search for moral integrity in the political domain. <br/><br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/><br/>Religion is an integral part of every society. In recent times, religious activities have been more deeply woven into the fabrics of partisan politics to the extent that religious participation correlates with politics in Delta State. That is, it is difficult to be successful in the political environment without proper alignment with a religious organization within the state. <br/><br/>Throughout the history of Nigeria’s political and social development, civil organizations have always looked up to religious institutions for inspirational leadership. Hence, it is undoubted that religion still have powerful influence in the structuring of the political culture and some policies of the government in Nigeria.4 It is against this background that this essay will be examining the role of religion in the politics of Delta State. Consequently, this research will mainly expose the religio-political affiliations in the daily administration of Delta State, the role of religious institutions in the electoral practices of Delta State as well as the influence of religion on the policies of Delta State. <br/><br/>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/><br/>This research is primarily aimed at revealing the impact of religious institutions in the politics and the civil administration of Delta State. It also aims at considering the relevance of churches to the government and as well examine the role of religious institutions in the moral upliftment of the state even in the face of the moral decadence prevalent in our political system. This research also aim at creating awareness on the need to respect the religious diversity, reject the prejudice against religious and political affiliation and accept the necessity for peaceful coexistence and social cohabitation in Delta State. <br/><br/>Therefore, at the end of this research, we should have more knowledge in the following aspects: <br/><br/>The influence of religion in the policies and decision making in Delta State. <br/><br/>The role of religion in the electoral practices that is, in political campaigns and the daily administration of Delta State. <br/><br/>The position of religious institutions in the crusade against moral decay in Nigeria at large. <br/><br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>The significance of this study is to emphasize the importance of religion in the life of political actors in Delta. The importance of religion in the politics of Delta State whether it be domestic party politics or inter-state relations, cannot be underestimated. It is generally believed among the people that religion is the life energy and at such, tradition can best be explained by the politics of representation. <br/><br/>Unarguably, religion plays a good role in the progress, development, peace and co-existence in the affairs of every government. The government of Delta State has for long initiated religious programmes which are believed to contribute to the unity progress and the development of the state. The government often emphasize the importance of religion in the daily administration of the state. Hence the daily morning prayers of the government house chapel, a long standing tradition in Delta State.5 <br/><br/>Consequently, the significance of this work is to establish the fact that religion stands at the centre of governmental institutions not only in Delta State, but in the entire country. It will also establish the fact that religion wield a lot of influence in the policies and decisions of the government. <br/><br/>Thus, religion is greatly implicated in the shaping and structuring of the socio-political-environment. It could be understood in terms of power relations. <br/><br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>The research was carried out in the vicinity of Delta State. However, due to the constraints of time and finance, two local government areas of Delta State including Ughelli North and Oshimili North shall be the research areas for this work. This work will also cover extensively the various religious practices in this political province. This research will also be limited to the influence of religion in the political practices and in the daily administration of this province. <br/><br/>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/><br/>This research will involve different methods in obtaining detailed information about the structure of religion and politics in Delta State. Primarily, previous works done by scholars on the political and religions affiliations of Delta State and some other areas of common interest will serve as source of information for this research. Therefore, the various libraries in these two chosen local government areas will be primary source of information. The University of Benin Library will also be used as a major base for the acquisition of information. Newspaper publications on religions and politics as well as the use of the internet search machines will also be employed to ensure the success of this research. Also, interviews will be conducted among the people particularly among the clergymen and politicians in Delta State so as to acquire first hand information from stakeholders who are vast in the area of religion and politics within Delta State. <br/><br/>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY <br/><br/>The wide geographical area covered by this research extending to the whole of Delta State seem to be one of the challenges to this work. Out of the 27 local government areas, only two could be effectively used due to financial constraint. <br/><br/>Secondly, the lack of cooperation, particularly from the political class, who always claim to be very busy also stand as a limitation to this research. However, from the co-operation of a few within Delta State the research was a great success. </p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF RELIGION IN THE POLITICS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF RELIGION IN THE POLITICS", "id": 116}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>I intend to expose the indepth meaning of reason and morality using man as the major point on this discussion, due to the higher rational faculty he possess over other creatures.

In this regard, G. Buffen, said that there is an infinite distance between man and animals, and the essential cause of this is that man is one without reason.<br/><br/>In the same vain, Aristotle maintained that reason, which is the highest faculty of the soul, is what sets man apart from sub-human nature. The question now is, why and how is man rational and in what aspects of his life is he different from other animals and what factor is behind these? It has been noticed that man is exclusively marked out from other animals as regard social, cultural and intellectual forms of behaviour. It is only man that has an articulated speech, inventive capability, knowledge of arts, beauty, politics, religion, morality and other forms of knowledge that can be associated with reason.<br/><br/>So man is, as a result of this rationality marked out from other animals, it is not contestable then to associate or attribute the above enumerated characteristics to his rationality. <br/><br/>As this work centers on morality and reason as that which assures us of the best moral life, we shall answer such questions as: has reason any influence or part to play in morality? Or put simply, is reason necessarily required for man to be moral? If yes, should reason be the sole factor for morality? But if no, what then? It is undebatable that man solely has the knowledge of good and evil (morality) and this type of knowledge can be possessed only by rational beings. In fact, God made man rational enough to see that he (man) should do what is right.<br/><br/>Having known that man surpasses all the other animals by the possession of reason, and the only animal that has knowledge of morality, the question now is, is man moral because of reason or because of some other physiological factors? If it is because of the latter, one can rightly pose this question: Why is it that other animals are ignorant of morality or are not moral?<br/><br/>Aquinas, on whom this work is based, has propounded a popular dictum regarding man and reason. It is “Bonum omins est, Secundum rationem esse”, that is, (The good of man in life according to reason). As we shall see, this statement does not rule out the fact that human life can be controlled by other factors like the will, habit, passions, emotion etc, but it affirms that man has a good life according to reason. One outstanding feature about Aquinas moral theory is it’s intellectualism. This will be gradually unfolding as we penetrate into this work.<br/><br/>In this four chapter work, we are going to see how morality should be guided by reason.<br/><br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/><br/>There are certain actions which all of us will individually or collectively condemn as morally wrong and ought not to be done or performed by anybody. For instance, murder, robbery, embezzlement of public funds, bribery and corruption, and so on. On the other hand, there are certain actions like kindness, hospitality, honesty and so on, which are considered as morally good. Again, there are certain kinds of action that do not enjoy universal consensus on their goodness or badness, rightness or wrongness because of difference in opinion, for instance, abortion, contraception euthanasia, nuclear warfare etc.<br/><br/>The need now arises for us to know why in Aquinas philosophy, certain actions are considered good while others are considered bad. What in Aquinas view, is the yardstick for determining good and bad actions and what is the paradigm for measuring such actions. What, within the assumptions of Aquinas, does it ever mean to say that an action is good or bad in itself? Or, is it our thinking that makes any action good or bad?<br/><br/>Some people, like Hume, opined that reason is and ought to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them. They opined that morality is determined by sentiments.<br/><br/>Also, some philosophers like Aquinas, the stoic Duns Scotus and so on, postulated that right reason is the moral standard. Consequently, what ever is in line with right reason is morally wrong. But how does one known whether abortion, euthanasia, contraception etc, conforms to right reason, especially when there are many intelligent and cogent argument for or against the morality of these conditions?<br/><br/>PURPOSE OF STUDY <br/><br/>The main purpose of this research/work study is to critically analyze the various notion of morality and reason, also, see how morality is been guided by reason, in respect to “Thomas Aquinas.” It is also intended towards serving as an impetus for improving the level of understanding of morality and reason by upcoming students of Nigeria University and tertiary institutions alike.<br/><br/>This work-study is also intended to throw more light on reason and moral ideas, principles and benefits.<br/><br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY <br/><br/>One of the significance of this work study is that it exposes the beautification of morality and reason in general. This study will also enable us to critically differentiate between the ancient and modern concepts of morality and reason.<br/><br/>It will be of great benefit, if man observed, and make good use of his rationality and moral values in order to create and dwell in a better society. If this is done, man and his society will enhance thereby checkmating immorality and irrational attitude.<br/><br/>Another significance of this project/work study is that it seeks to expose some of the lapses that are inherent in man’s approach to morality and reason.<br/><br/>SCOPE OF STUDY <br/><br/>Aquinas interpretation of morality vis-à-vis reason, which is in line with the precept of human endeavour and his environment from the basic line of concentration in this research/work study. The different notion of morality and reason will also be given pre-eminence and special attention with a view of critically assessing them.<br/><br/>METHODOLOGY OF STUDY <br/><br/>The methodology of a work determines it’s specialty says Aristotle. The method shows how a thing is done. It is in the light of this fact that i have decided to adopt the massive use of historical and critical methods of philosophical enquiry, other methodologies to be used in this research/work study include the elaborate consultation of other relevant philosophical, religious books, literature, articles and authorities.</p>\n\nMORALITY VIS-A-VIS REASON IN AQUINAS PHILOSOPHY: A CRITICAL ANALYSIS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MORALITY VIS-A-VIS REASON IN AQUINAS PHILOSOPHY: A CRITICAL ANALYSIS", "id": 117}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>KWAME NKRUMAH’S CONSCIENCISM: A PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS</strong><br/><br/></p> <p>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>It is popular knowledge that most counties in Africa were at one time or the other under the control of foreign countries after the Berlin conference that partitioned the continent into various parts and acted as guides for the colonial masters. However, the true sons of the soil who happened to be nationalists like Kwame Nkrumah, Obafemi Awolowo, Kenneth Kaunda and others fought bravely for the independence of these countries and hence came self-governance.<br/><br/>After the granting of independence and the leave of the colonial masters, these educated nationalists went ahead to forge for Africa an ideology that would carry them to the Promised Land. One of these ideologies is the ‘Consciencism’ of Kwame Nkrumah which is to pave way for the economic and political emancipation of the African continent.<br/><br/>In this work, the ideology will be under the spotlight, alongside it will be Kwame Nkrumah himself and finally a critical evaluation will be provided with us supporting either side of the coin, that is, whether or not the ideology is good enough for us in Africa. <br/><br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/><br/>Title page----------------i<br/><br/>Certification----------------ii<br/><br/>Dedication----------------iii<br/><br/>Acknowledgement--------------iv<br/><br/>Abstract----------------v<br/><br/>Table of Content--------------vi<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>Background of The Study----------<br/><br/>Statement of The Problem----------<br/><br/>Purpose of The Study----------<br/><br/>Significance of The Study----------<br/><br/>Scope of The Study------------<br/><br/>Methodology--------------<br/><br/>Literature Review------------<br/><br/>Notes<br/><br/>CHAPTER TWO: LIFE AND WORKS OF KWAME NKRUMAH<br/><br/>2.1Kwame Nkrumah--------------<br/><br/>2.2Influences on Kwame Nkrumah----------<br/><br/>2.3Nkrumah on Neo-Colonialism----------<br/><br/>2.4Nkrumah on the African Personality---- ----<br/><br/>2.5Towards Colonial Freedom-------- ----<br/><br/>Notes<br/><br/>CHAPTER THREE: CONSCIENCISM: AN IDEOLOGY FOR DE-COLONIZATION<br/><br/>3.1Critique of Capitalism as a background to Consciencism--<br/><br/>3.2What is Consciencism?------------<br/><br/>3.3Features of Consciencism------------<br/><br/>Notes<br/><br/>CHAPTER FOUR: SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION<br/><br/>4.1Summary----------------<br/><br/>4.2Critical Overview--------------<br/><br/>4.3Conclusion----------------<br/><br/>Notes<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>1.1: BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>According to African statesmen, the whites even after granting independence to the colonies they were governing left as a parting gift to the Africans the concept of neo-colonialism. Neo-colonialism is a situation whereby the black man feels inferior to the Europeans and derives psychological satisfaction only by associating with them. Even till today, traces of neo-colonialism are still visible. The African never values any product that is of African origin. He prefers the product which has the label “made in China” or “made in America” and other foreign seals.<br/><br/>This predicament was what prompted African thinkers like Kwame Nkrumah, Julius Nyerere, Leopold Senghor, Obafemi Awolowo, Nnamdi Azikiwe and others to embark on the search for the ‘African identity’ and this they expressed in their works.<br/><br/>Kwame Nkrumah, one of the African statesmen, postulated an ideology known as ‘Consciencism’. This ideology is an exercise in anti-colonialism. It advocated for a social revolution which was to be brought about by an intellectual revolution. This was clearly articulated in the first sentence of the first chapter of the book. He noted that “practice without thought is blind; thought without practice is empty”1.<br/><br/>This project work will have as its focal point ‘Consciencism’ as presented by Kwame Nkrumah. It must be noted that Consciencism is a summary of Nkrumah’s ideological viewpoint geared towards the economic and political emancipation of the African. It was marked that Consciencism arrived at a stage of development where the vigorous African search for freedom; unity and identity need to be expressed in the form of philosophical statesments2.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the concept; ‘Consciencism’ has been subjected to some criticisms; hence there is need for an overview of the concept with a view to presenting it in the very spirit of African revolution.<br/><br/>1.2: STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/><br/>Kwame Nkrumah’s ideology which he propounded for the development of the African is based on a foundation of materialism. The minimum assertion of materialism is the absolute and independent existence of matter3. Looking at it singly from this view, it becomes apparent that ‘philosophical consciencism’ as Nkrumah calls it cannot be reconciled with the religious realities found in the African society as the roles of spirits and souls cannot be over-emphasized as far as the African is concerned.<br/><br/>As pointed out by Paulin Houtondji, “consciencism is wrong in treating any political system as interdependent with some specific metaphysical theory”4. For him, if political theories are to need justification, “it must be political justification, belonging to the same level of discourse”5. In other words, there is a problem with bringing metaphysics into the realm of political discourse.<br/><br/>Another problem is that of the realization of Nkrumah’s ideology. Nkrumah himself said that “Colonialism and its attitude are die hard, like the attitudes of slavery, whose hangover still dominates behaviour in certain parts of the western hemisphere”6. For the above reasons, the problem arises as to whether or not philosophical consciencism is not merely a theoretical concept, which will fail in practice.<br/><br/>All these problems are associated with the concept of ‘consciencism’ and its application.<br/><br/>1.3: PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>A key purpose of this project work is to attempt an exposition of Nkrumah’s solution to the African predicament brought about by colonial presence on African soil.<br/><br/>Another important purpose of this work is that it will evaluate Nkrumah’s proposed solution with a view to deciding whether or not it will be useful in the African quest for moving forward in every sense of it.<br/><br/>1.4: SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>The significance of the study is to show that if ‘philosophical consciencism’ is approached in the way Kwame Nkrumah postulated it, then there will be no stopping the growth and development of Africa.<br/><br/>1.5: SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>The work in its scope will be limited to an overview of Nkrumah’s ideology for de-colonization. Nevertheless, in the process of over viewing his ideology, cognizance will be taken of the influences on him, the work “Consciencism” itself, and circumstances surrounding the postulation of the ideology.<br/><br/>1.6: METHODOLOGY<br/><br/>The method we shall adopt in this project work shall be analytical and critical. It shall be analytical in that every concept used shall be broken down into simple words.<br/><br/>1.7: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/><br/>In this work, we shall be making use of textbooks and also information sourced from websites.<br/><br/>The first book under review is one written by Kwame Nkrumah himself and is titled “Consciencism: A Philosophy and Ideology for De-Colonization”, published in London in 1964. In this book, Nkrumah makes a case for a re-structuring of the African society away from colonialism and towards economic and political success. He posits an ideology that is capable of processing the old metropolitan ideologies of capitalism and European socialism and according to him “consciencism is the map in intellectual terms of the disposition of the forces which will enable African society to digest the Western, the Islamic and the Euro-Christian elements in Africa and develop them in such a way that they fit into the African personality”.7<br/><br/>The second book to be reviewed is also by Kwame Nkrumah and is titled “Axioms of Kwame Nkrumah”, published in London in 1967 by Thomas Nelson. The book brings together various quotes of Kwame Nkrumah from various books by him and addresses delivered by him either in his official capacity as president of Ghana or simply as Kwame Nkrumah.<br/><br/>Another book that will be used in this work is by Gideon-Cyrus M. Mutiso and S.W Rohio titled “Readings in African Political Thought”, published in London by Heinemann in 1975. The book as the name suggests contains selected topics from various political thinkers and the writings from Kwame Nkrumah featured prominently in the book. <br/><br/>C. Okadigbo’s book titled “Consciencism in African Political Philosophy”, published in Enugu by Fourth Dimension Publishers in 1985 is also under review. In this book, the author provided a review of contemporary African philosophy with Nkrumah’s ‘consciencism’ under the spotlight and according to him “there is here an evaluation of the solution proposed by the same spirit of the African revolution”8.<br/><br/>Another book here under review is Kwame Nkrumah’s “Towards Colonial Freedom”, published in London by Heinemann Educational Books in 1962. Here the author describes this book as “a rough blueprint of the process which colonial people can establish the realization of their complete and unconditional independence”9.<br/><br/>The sixth book under review is Kwame Nkrumah’s “Africa Must Unite”, published in London by Panaf Books in 1963. Here the author makes a case for Pan-African unity. He also urged the people of African descent in the West Indies and in the United States of America to strive for this unity as it will be a very important factor in the political and economic emancipation of the African.<br/><br/>These mentioned books and others written by Kwame Nkrumah and other authors will be used.</p>\n\nKWAME NKRUMAH’S CONSCIENCISM: A PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " KWAME NKRUMAH’S CONSCIENCISM: A PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS", "id": 118}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THOMAS HOBBES’ CONCEPT OF THE LEVIATHAN</strong><br/><br/></p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/><br/>Title Page<br/><br/>Certification Dedication <br/><br/>Acknowledgements <br/><br/>Table of contents <br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/><br/>INTRODUCTION <br/><br/>Background of the study <br/><br/>The statement of the problem <br/><br/>Purpose of the study <br/><br/>Significance of the study <br/><br/>Scope of the study <br/><br/>Methodology <br/><br/>Literature Review <br/><br/>Notes <br/><br/>CHAPTER TWO <br/><br/>HOBBES: THE BACKGROUND OF HIS POLITICAL THOUGHT.<br/><br/>2.1Hobbes’ Life and Philosophy <br/><br/>2.1.1Thomas Hobbes <br/><br/>2.1.2His works <br/><br/>2.2Influences on Hobbes <br/><br/>2.3Hobbes on Human Nature <br/><br/>2.4The Social Contract Theory <br/><br/>CHAPTER THREE <br/><br/>HOBBES CONCEPTION OF THE LEVIATHAN. <br/><br/>3.1Hobbes’s Leviathan <br/><br/>3.2The Contract and the power of the sovereign<br/><br/>3.3Individualism and liberalism<br/><br/>CHAPTER FOUR <br/><br/>SUMMARY OF HOBBES VIEW OF THE LEVIATHAN <br/><br/>4.1A Critical survey of the Hobbesian analysis of the leviathan <br/><br/>4.2Critical evaluation<br/><br/>4.2.1Positive aspect <br/><br/>4.2.2Negative aspect <br/><br/>Conclusion <br/><br/>Bibliography<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>1.1THE BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/><br/>This study is an attempt to examine the idea of the Leviathan in Thomas Hobbes political philosophy. Before we discuss his philosophy of society we need to know what was happening before he came. <br/><br/>There Was the problem of the excessive use of power in the society.One could rule in as much as he commanded obedience from others by the use of brute power and force. This led to conflict and self-centeredness among humans. <br/><br/>An attempt to escape from the above crisis led Hobbes to postulate a common wealth or the state as a platform for organizing human beings or what he called the Leviathan. The idea of the Leviathan aimed at providing a means by which men can overcome the disorder in the natural state.The people needed the state of nature, to fashion a contract, giving all their power to one man who becomes the sovereign. <br/><br/>From the above, the research question is this; Is the Leviathan construed either as a ruler or a State able to solve the problem of insecurity, self-centeredness and the egoism in the nature of man? Will the absolute power embedded in a Leviathan not lead to tyranny and abuses? These are some of the issues that this study intends to look into critically. <br/><br/>1.2STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/><br/>The problem of this study can be put in question form:<br/><br/>Is the Leviathan immune to the egoistic nature of man which he has been chosen to guard against? Can the chaos and conflict which exists on the state of nature be eliminated with the institution of the common wealth? How does the Leviathan intend to tackle the problem of behaviorism and human nature which is egoistic and self-centered in order to ensure a peaceful human society wherein people will be law abiding? Will the absolute power embedded in the sovereign not lead to tyranny, totalitarianism and abuse? This project work tries to tackle some of these questions. <br/><br/>1.3THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>This work aims at critically analyzing the concept of the Leviathan. It also attempt to proffer solutions to the problems identified in Hobbes theory.This work studies Hobbes notion of the society and how human beings can live together peacefully in a society. We may ask; how can humans evolve a peaceful system where law and order are properly defined?<br/><br/>1.4THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>This study is significant in the sense that it emphasizes the wider breath of Hobbes conception of the leviathan. His intention is to capture all areas of life with an attempt of reconstructing the society into a better one by proffering the Leviathan. Effort will be made to review and apply his concept of the Leviathan in examining the view of human nature as egoistic and individualistic and how we can evolve a stable and viable society from such a human nature. <br/><br/>1.5THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>This project work examines critically the concept of the Leviathan in Hobbes social and political philosophy. It looks into other concepts like the state of nature which led to the postulation of Leviathan. It advances theory and knowledge by expanding the view of other social contractarians in order to give a balanced view of our topic of study. <br/><br/>1.6METHODOLOGY <br/><br/>This research work uses the method of critical analysis to examine the idea of the Leviathan in Hobbes. The research tools to be used are archival materials such as textbooks, encyclopedia and internet sources. By using the critical method this study seeks to provide a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the idea of the Leviathan and the extent to which it can be a viable option for bringing about order, peace and cooperation in the society.<br/><br/>1.7LITERATURE REVIEW <br/><br/>The first book to be reviewed, is Thomas Hobbes Leviathan; by John plamenatz. He argued that The Leviathan was “chosen or instituted when men do agree and covenant every one that to whatsoever man or assembly of men shall be given by the major part the right to present the person of them all, that is to say to be their representative”.2 The Leviathan ensures them living in peace amongst themselves and be protected against other men.<br/><br/>The second book to be reviewed, is Elements of Philosophy by Samuel Enoch Stumpf and Donald C. Abel. Here,the argument is that the civil society created by the social contract must have power to punish those who transgress the agreement. Convinced that fear is the greatest motivator, the state must have sufficient positive power to terrify its citizens into obedience3 <br/><br/>The third book to be reviewed is History of Political Thought by Anthony O. Okoh. Here there is an argument for the provision of an absolute ruler The Leviathan.He believed that it was only an absolute ruler that could tame the wicked tendencies which exhibited in the state of nature4. <br/><br/>The fourth book to be reviewed, is Philosophy Made Simple by Richard H.P.Here it was understood that since sovereignty is created by a covenant or contract, the subject retains all those natural rights that cannot be transferred by covenant5 To put it differently, since the subject has entered into the contract to preserve and protect his life, the subject cannot refuse to obey the sovereign. <br/><br/>The fifth book to be reviewed ,is Ethics: A Systematic and Historical Study by Joseph Omoregbe. Here Hobbes argues that men decided to come together and form an organized society since life was so in secured in the state of nature. They came together, made a social contract, empowered the sovereign to decide what should be done and what should not be done in the society. </p>\n\nA CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THOMAS HOBBES’ CONCEPT OF THE LEVIATHAN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THOMAS HOBBES’ CONCEPT OF THE LEVIATHAN", "id": 119}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Rousseau’s ideas of law and civil state are his efforts to improve the government processes in France during the 18th century enlightenment era. The situation of France at this time was not palatable as there were social injustices and inequalities which characterized the state of nature on ground. Among the three social classes that existed in France at that time, it was the third estate comprising the third class citizens with less land that paid the highest taxes. The first and second estates consisting of the first and second class citizens were exempted from it. This boils down to the state of nature idea of the strong getting stronger and the weak getting weaker. This gave rise to all the evils that people perpetrated on one another in this state. Although Rousseau formulated his theory after reading and analyzing those of Hobbes and Locke, the scope of his project was not significantly different from theirs’. He understood society to be an invention, and he attempted to explain the nature of human beings by stripping them of all of the accidental qualities brought about by socialization. Thus, understanding human nature amounts to understanding what humans are like in a pure state of nature, unlike Aristotle’s classical view which claimed that the state of civil society was the natural human state. Furthermore, Rousseau acknowledged that self-preservation was one principle of motivation for human actions, but not the only principle unlike Hobbes. He concludes that self-preservation or generally self-interest, is only one of the two principles of the human soul. The second principle is pity; it is an innate repugnance to see his fellow suffer. Unlike other creatures Rousseau believes that human beings have reason, although such is not yet developed in the state of nature. It is this faculty that makes the long transition from the state of nature to the civil society possible. In the same vein, a proper application of this Rousseau’s theory of law and civil state can also serve as a conceptual tool for</div> <div>improving on Nigerian democracy.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong></div> <div>The choice of this topic was motivated by the way Nigerian system of government has been run since the return of democratic rule in the country in 1999. Presently, Nigerian system of government lacks the true character which depicts what democracy is all about. This of course is not different from the situation in pre-revolutionary France during the time of Rousseau that contributed to his idea of the state of nature. Suffice to note that during this time in France the state was bankrupted due to mismanagement of the economy. This economic crisis was as a result of the overwhelming costs incurred by fighting two major wars – the seven years’ war and the American Revolutionary war. There was also severe amount of injustice culminating in</div> <div>social inequality in the tax system. Here the third estate with the less land was made to pay the highest tax while the first and second estates that had more lands paid little or none at all. Because of this, there was “an insistent demand” fo r reform of these abuses of privilege, for an equitable means of taxation and for improved government processes.

The basis for this is that Gadamer’s direct appropriation of prejudice and its impact on the transmodern idea of the bio/geo/body-politics of knowledge challenges the idea of universality as it operates in the current Euro-American cosmovision. This challenge is not in favour of subjectivism or relativism, but in favour of ‘intersubjective dialogue’ and ‘pluriversality as a universal project’. Adopting the philosophical tools of exposition, critique and textual analysis the work seeks to demonstrate that a proper appropriation of Gadamer’s conceptualization of prejudice and of the influence it has had on the transmodern project can serves as the basis for a new principle of cross-cultural interaction/evaluation; the ethical-hermeneutic principle of intercultural contact/evaluation which can guarantee ‘a world in which all worlds fit’. In the addition to this, the work also establishes that: i) the transmodern anti-Cartesianism and resistance of provincial universality are strong influences from Gadamer in their philosophy. Hence, their claim of delinking is not totally true; ii) the transmodern project in taking on board the coloniality question within the context of the bio/geo/body-politics of knowledge is a clear extension and application of Gadamer’s prejudicial philosophy; iii) despite the strength of Gadamer and the transmodern case, Gadamer’s postulation is haunted down by the hegemony of the verbal understanding/factual modes of expression, while the transmodern project is wrong in blaming coloniality solely on foreign agency.</em></div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong></div> <div>Given the fall outs from the current world order, a certain strand of contemporary philosophy makes the case for another world. In their estimation, ‘another world is possible.’ 1</div> <div>For some others within this school of thought, the alternative to the current world order should aim at creating ‘a world in which all worlds fit’. 2 Yet for another group, they seek ‘worlds and knowledges otherwise’. 3 For these schools of thought, the current world order is Euro-American and it possesses an exclusivist cosmovision. On this count, the current world order rather than seeking to arrive at a world in which all worlds fit just elevates the ideals of a particular world as a standard for other worlds to follow. In more specific terms, it is the Euro-American vision that has been universalised for all to follow. But the economic crises that greeted the West between 2007 and now places a lot of doubt on the continued efficacy of this cosmovision. The grand narrative which this vision held that “…once situat ed humanity in some continuing stream of</div> <div>meaning has faltered amidst existential doubt or economic and political ruins…” 4 This places before us therefore, the urgent need for an alternative cosmovision. The urgency of this need is one motivation for this research.</div> <p>Bearing in mind the fact that the world in which we live today is a global village, it becomes obvious that any effort at a new cosmovision cannot afford to ignore the demands for ‘a world in which all worlds fit’. Arriving at this world is primarily a practical task. But before this task can be executed in practice, it must redefine itself at a theoretical level or better still as a theoretical endeavour. It is within this context of theoretical redefinition that Gadamer and the transmodern engagement with prejudice is appropriated in this research. </p>\n\nHANS-GEORG GADAMER ON PREJUDICE AND THE TRANSMODERN PROJECT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " HANS-GEORG GADAMER ON PREJUDICE AND THE TRANSMODERN PROJECT", "id": 121}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>George Edward Moore, in his quest to establish a direct realist account of cognition and to refute skepticism and absolute idealism, which is a brand of metaphysical monism, argued that at least some of our beliefs about the world are absolutely certain.

From the cultural perspective (which is of primary concern in this work), we are confronted with some facts. Personal relationships are troubled: divorces are increasing; families are breaking apart; cultural groups clash over conflicting interests and friendships exit under great strains.

In addition, the importance people give to ethics and politics depends on the adequacy with which they grasp the reality of others and the clarity with which they understand their relationship with others. If one does not or cannot experience the presence and personhood of others, then ethical and political thought becomes merely academic. Therefore, if ethics is to discover realizable ideals and to seriously address the contemporary interpersonal situations, an incisive phenomenology of interpersonal experience will be indispensible....</p>\n\nALTERITY AND REVERSIBILITY IN MERLEAU-PONTY: A DISCOURSE ON CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND MINORITY RIGHTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ALTERITY AND REVERSIBILITY IN MERLEAU-PONTY: A DISCOURSE ON CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND MINORITY RIGHTS", "id": 123}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The primary purpose of this essay is to critically examine Locke’s theory of perception. This theory of perception is more like a theory of knowledge in which sense experience is the true source as opposed to reason. It is derived from the branch of philosophy called ‘epistemology’ which originated from the Greek word ‘episteme’ meaning knowledge. Knowledge is expressed in propositions but before we can understand any propositions at all, even false ones, we must first have concepts. To understand the meaning of a word already involves having a concept. How do we then acquire the concepts that we have? It was once thought at least some of our concepts are innate. However, suppose that concepts were innate, and then we would have them without ever experiencing any instances. It seems too obvious that no concept of any sensory property is innate. Some concepts have been believed to be innate: for example, the concept of cause and the concept of God.</p> <p>If the concept of cause is innate, then we would know what the word means, and be in full possession of the concept, without ever having seen causes operating. This seems implausible.</p> <p>Perhaps the God example seems more plausible, since God, if one exists, is not seen or otherwise perceived, and yet we do seem to possess the concept (though this too has been denied). If we cannot perceive God and nevertheless have the concept, how can we come by it? Is it innate?</p> <p>We subscribe to John Locke’s alternative theory which explains that concepts are derived from experience. However, despite its merits it has its own shortcoming which this essay’s objective is to point out. John Locke aimed at clearing the ground a little, and removing some of the rubbish that lies in the way to knowledge. Locke hit upon a bold and original interpretation of how the mind works and from this described the kind and extent of knowledge we can expect from the human mind. ‘The scope of our knowledge, Locke said, is limited to, and by our experience(Stumpf, 1977: 273).’</p> <p>Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes say that knowledge should be built on observation, and to this extent they could be called empiricists. They both accepted that the mind is capable of producing certainty of knowledge about nature provided only that the proper method is used. Similarly, Rene Descartes (1594-1650) assumed that there was no problem that human reason could not solve if the correct method was employed. This was the assumption Locke called into critical question, namely, the assumption that the human mind has capabilities that enable it to discover the true nature of the universe. David Hume pushed this critical point even further and asked whether any secure knowledge at all is possible.</p> <p>Instead of the word ‘concepts’ these philosophers all used the word ‘ideas’ and the problem they undertook to answer was: How do we come by the ideas we have or ever shall have? All the ideas we have or ever shall have, they said come from experience.</p> <p>Some come through the outer senses, such as sight, hearing, and touch, and from these all our concepts involving the physical world are drawn; and some ideas come from the inner senses, such as experiences of pain and pleasure, feelings of love and hate, pride and remorse, experiencing of thinking and willing. All our concepts are derived from these kinds of experience.</p> <p>This is the core of Locke’s empiricism and in the following chapters other issues will require further elucidation and these include his refutation of innate ideas, simple and complex ideas, as well as that of primary and secondary qualities. It is equally important that Locke’s analysis of substance and the degrees of knowledge is treated.</p> <p>However, it is pertinent that we write a brief biography of John Locke, Locke’s empiricism, the meaning of perception and most importantly the problem of perception because it is after the problems have been stated that other chapters will be valuable. We proceed.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>THE MAN LOCKE</strong></p> <p>John Locke was born in 1632 at Wrington, Somerset, and died Seventy-two years later in 1709. He grew up in a puritan home, trained in the virtues of hard work and the love of simplicity. After a thorough training in the classics at the West minister school, Locke became a student at Oxford University where he took the Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees and was appointed Senior Student and later censor of Moral Philosophy. He spent thirty years of his studies of Aristotle’s logic and metaphysics; he was gradually drawn toward the newly developing experimental sciences, being influenced in this direction particularly by Sir Robert Boyle. His scientific interests led him to pursue the study of medicine and in 1674 he obtained his medical degree and was licensed to practices. He also ventured into diplomacy. He actually served in various capacities, eventually becoming the personal physician and confidential adviser to the Earl of Shaftesbury, one of the leading politicians of London. But earlier influences, among them his reading of Descartes’ works while at Oxford, confirmed his desire to devote his creative powers to working out a philosophical understanding of certain problems that perplexed his generation.</p> <p>He wrote on such diverse topics as <strong><em>The Reasonableness of Christianity, An essay Concerning Toleration, and the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and Raising the Value of</em> Money </strong>indicating his active participation in the public affairs of his day. In 1690, when he was fifty seven-years old, Locke published two books, which were to make him famous as a philosopher and a political theorist: <em>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em> and <em>Two Treatises of Civil Government</em>. Although other philosophers before him had written about human knowledge, Locke was the first to produce a full length inquiry into the scope and limits of the human mind. Similarly, others had written important works on political theory, but Locke’s second of the two treatises came at a time when it could shape the thoughts of an era and later affect the course of events. It indicates Locke’s way of combining his practical and theoretical interests and abilities.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>LOCKE’S EMPIRICISM</strong></p> <p>Locke decided that before one could move directly into such a subject as the principles of morality and revealed religion, it was necessary we examined our own abilities, and see what our understandings were, or were not fitted to deal with. From this examination Locke eventually composed his <em>Essay on Human Understanding</em>, which became the foundation of empiricism in Britain.</p> <p>According to Locke, knowledge is restricted to ideas, not platonic ideas or forms, but ideas that are generated by objects we experience thus debunking the claim of the rationalists that reason is the primary source of knowledge (Copleston, 1964: 72).</p> <p>The origin of ideas is experience, and experience takes two forms, sensation and reflection. Without exception, all our ideas come to us through the sense, whereby we experience the world external to us, and through reflection upon these ideas, which is an experience internal to us. He tried to clarify that we cannot experience the world external to us, and through reflection upon these ideas, which is an experience internal to us. He clarifies that we cannot have the experience of reflection until we have had the experience of sensation. For reflection simply means the mind taking notice of its own operations but its operations begin when the mind is provided with ideas, and these ideas come through the senses (Locke, 1985: 182).</p> <p><strong>MEANING OF PERCEPTION</strong></p> <p>Perception is the process by which organisms interpret and organise sensation to produce a meaningful experience of the world. Sensation usually refers to the immediate, relatively unprocessed result of stimulation of sensory receptors in the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, or skin. In practice, sensation and perception are virtually impossible to separate, because they are part of one continuous process (www.wikipedia.com).</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>PROBLEM OF PERCEPTION</strong></p> <p>John Locke in his theory of knowledge laid great emphasis on experience as the primary source of indubitable knowledge. However, Locke failed to take into cognizance the fact that, objects of experience are dynamic and fallible. Heraclitus of Ephesus, an ancient Greek philosopher posits that, ‘Things in this world are in a state of flux, constantly changing (Armstrong, 1977: 23).’</p> <p>Following in this postulation of Heraclitus, how then can our experience or senses grasps reality or true knowledge as the case may be, in a constantly changing world?</p> <p>In the footsteps of Heraclitus, Socrates through his method of dialectics was able to discover that, true knowledge cannot be derived from perception, relegating it as the least reliable and this is aptly captured in his statement that, <em>‘</em>Perception does not give us true knowledge; therefore, knowledge cannot be acquired through perception’ (Armstrong, 1977: 24).</p> <p>Scrutinizing the theory of knowledge by Locke, one will discover that it has a lot of problems to contend with, among whom are, the problems of perception and that of appearance and reality. Though there seems to be a similarity between the former and the latter.</p> <p>The problem of perception can be said to arise as a result of human state of affairs at a material time. Perceiving a green table in a room may give varying impressions, in different thought, depending on their state at that particular time. In other words, a green table might for instance appear yellow in the eyes of a man suffering from jaundice. Also, the amount and type of light focused on the same green table might give an onlooker the cause to refer to it as purple.</p> <p>Similarly, the timing of the perception of the green table may also affect its colour. For instance, if the green table is perceived in the night around 10.00pm with the moonlight, the green table might appear black or brown.</p> <p>Hence, it can be said that, true and infallible knowledge cannot be achieved through this means.</p> <p>On the issue of appearance and reality, it is pertinent to say at this juncture that, appearance is basically different from reality; hence one can safely say that seeing something as it appears is not enough to conclude that, one has the knowledge of that thing.</p> <p>When a straight stick or ruler is inside a bowl of water, it will appear to be bent, thus, giving a wrong impression to the onlooker, but in reality, neither the stick nor the ruler is bent, because after removing them from the bowl of water, they look straight again. Should this situation be accepted as the original state of the object? Is it as it appeared to us outside the bowl of water? Or the way they appeared inside of it?</p> <p>Furthermore, we also experience illusion such as, mirage, where what we see is not real. For instance, when driving on a highway on a sunny afternoon, looking ahead, one will see a pool of water in a distance, and on getting to the spot, the place turns out dry. People are often also victims of hallucinations and they tend to see things which are not actually there. This goes to show the unreliability of senses.</p> <p>All the instances given earlier are inconvertible facts of our experiences. And they have only buttressed the fact that, experiencing or perceiving things as they are, is not enough justification of the knowledge of that thing. And this cannot be farfetched from the fact that, objects often appear differently to different people or observers at the same time or to some other observers at different times, thus, bringing about incoherent conclusions from all the observers as earlier reiterated. Though, this largely depends on state of affairs, light, physiological position, or state of the observer.</p> <p>All that had been said above, can tempt one to conclude that, reality cannot be sensed or perceived, or that, we can never know whether our experience is illusory or not, or that sense experience is not a reliable source of knowledge.</p> <p>Even, we can state here that, issues of knowledge acquisition is in two folds, we have knowledge through experience, and knowledge on the statement of fact, as when one says, ‘all bachelors are unmarried’. But the empiricists reject this on the grounds that, it is not verifiable.</p> <p>Ludwig Wittgenstein opined that,</p> <p>‘Such statements, which cannot be verified and disproved, are meaningless, only statements, which can be verified and proved, should be accepted ‘(Scruton, 1981: 137).</p> <p>By and large, one can see that keen as Locke was on the clarity of knowledge, he did not escape the fatal confounding of sense-knowledge with intellectual knowledge, thereby, making the confusion more confounded, so that one may take not only different, but opposite doctrines, from the premises his theories present. If one follows his work in one set of principles, and develop it to the end, one will find himself in idealism, and if you choose to follow him in another of his thought, you will find yourself in positivism, which it takes reality around us as, the only thing that is, and denies value to the intellect and reason.</p> <p>Locke, in his conception and origin of ideas, based it on the foundation and background of the empiricists; those ideas are derived from sensation. He recognizes the extreme importance of sensation, which could be seen in his second work. He believed that knowledge originates from two sources; sensation and reflection.</p> <p>He also asserts that, knowledge is a process of compounding, repeating, comparing, and uniting sensation. But he ran into a problem, which was indeed great, because, he was unable to keep up his thoroughly atomic theory of mind. It is a theory which makes all relations external, they are, as he would say, super-induced upon facts. This makes it impossible to account for any appearance of unity and convention among ideas. He quietly, and without any consciousness of the contradictions involved, introduces certain inherent relations into the structure of the ideas, thereby, further discussing the objective character of sensation in relation to the object which produces it. Locke distinguished simple and complex ideas because he felt, to discuss about ideas intelligently, it will be convenient to distinguish them, as they are matter in the bodies that cause them (Popkin, 1969: 194).</p> <p>Consequently, one can see that Locke tends to lay down the marks of sensation as passivity and simplicity as the real element in knowledge but Leibniz denies or accepts in a sense different from that of Locke. According to Russell, ‘Reality for Leibniz is not a supernatural yoking of things naturally opposed, and also not a mere accident (Russell, 1971: 82).’</p> <p><strong>REFERENCES</strong></p> <p>1.                                                                                                     Armstrong, A.

At the time it was widely thought that certain ideas and principles were imprinted on human beings from birth and that these were essential to the stability of religion and morality and I think this is one reason why Locke spends so much time debunking the notion of innateness.</p> <p>‘It is an established opinion among some men, that there are in the understanding certain innate principles stamped upon the mind of man, which the soul receives in its very first beginning, and brings into the world with it’(Stumpf, 1997: 275). There is more to it than that Locke believed deeply in humanity.</p> <p>Furthermore, John Locke’s rejection of innate ideas was intimately linked to this project for it is all too easy to claim all sorts of principles as innate in order to maintain the status quo, meaning that people ‘might be more easily governed by, and made useful to some sort of men, who has the skill and office to principle and guide them. Nor is it a small power, it gives one man over another, to have the authority to be the dictator of principles, and teacher of unquestionable truths: and to make a man swallow that for an innate principle which may serve his purpose, who teaches them. ‘If a skillful ruler could convince the people that certain principles are innate, this could take them off from the use of their own reason and judgment, and put them on believing and taking them upon trust without further examination and in this posture of blind credibility, they might be more easily governed’ (Stumpf, 1977: 276).</p> <p><strong>1.2 OTHERS VIEWS ON THE ARGUMENT OF INNATE IDEAS</strong></p> <p>There is a genetic issue concerned with the origin of our ideas: where do our beliefs and ideas come from? The empiricists answer of course, we obtain all our ideas from experience, and the rationalists posited that at least some of our ideas are innate.</p> <p>According to Alvin Goldman, in his paper ‘<em>Innate Knowledge</em>’ he investigates if being innate has any justificatory quality. He comes to the conclusion (within the frame of an existentialist account of justification in terms of a causal connection between the fact that P and the belief that P) that innate principles can indeed be justified just in virtue of being innate. He argues that evolutionary adaptation is a causal connection since being born with a certain belief can be helpful to survive (and the evolutionary process, in his view, would of course favour the true beliefs).</p> <p>However, such an account of justification is highly controversial and most epistemologists instead hold the view that being innate makes beliefs not justified. We can easily imagine that innate beliefs are false.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the rationalists hoped to show that the origin of our innate principles somehow guarantees their truth (e.g. in Descartes, God as the origin of innate ideas is perfectly trustworthy), but this attempt was mistaken (www.niu.edu/philosophers/descartes.html). Two problems with innateness as justification will be listed as follows:</p> <p>(1a) how can we know that an innate belief is really true?</p> <p>(2a) how can we know that a belief is innate, that is, what kind of intuition accompanies innate beliefs? Both questions are not answered in Goldman’s proposal. Even if a highly reliable mechanism (such as God’s imprinting principles) existed, (1b) they were still not justified in concluding the truth as long as it is not justified in believing that there is such a mechanism applied to a specific believe, (2b) we could never be sure that a belief is innate since our intuition is a bad measure of credibility. The latter was objected by Locke, stating that so-called innate ideas are not clearer perceived than others</p> <p>Therefore, it will be appropriate to put aside the epistemological issue completely and adapt Stitch’s view that to characterize a piece of knowledge as a priori (as it was often done by the rationalists) is to say something about origin. The term ‘innate knowledge’ according to Stitch was often replaced by ‘innate belief’ to emphasize that justification is not automatically granted. But we should always keep in mind that ‘innate principles’ were one of the cornerstones of the philosophy of continental rationalism, and it is doubtful if innatism could be separated from rationalism at all.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>1.3    JOHN LOCKE’S ARGUMENT ON REFUTATION OF INNATE IDEAS</strong></p> <p>Various arguments will be considered in this essay and one will be more of a response to Locke’s argument by Leibniz.</p> <p>John Locke considers for example the simple notion that it is not possible for something to both exist and not exist. Locke argues that if such a proposition were innate then every person in every period of history would know and understand this, but this is clearly not the case. If such truths were ‘imprinted’ on us all then we would expect that children and idiots would not only be fully aware of them, but also be able to articulate them. For Locke it makes no sense to imagine both that ideas or knowledge is innate and that we do not know them, thus in his own words: ‘It seems to me a near contradiction to say that there are truths imprinted on the soul, which it perceives or understand not; imprinting if it signify anything, being nothing else but making certain truths to be perceived’ (www.oregonstate.edu/philosophers/locke.html).</p> <p>Moreover, he goes on to take up the suggestion that innate propositions are only perceived under certain circumstances.</p> <p>‘To be in the mind and not to be perceived is the same as, anything is not in the mind(Russell, 1971: 80)’. The above statement can be said to be a reaction against the statement of Locke that, ‘if these are not notions, naturally imported, how can they be innate’ (Locke, 1975: 46)? The crux of his argument is that once we start to think in this way it becomes unclear what is meant by innate ideas at all if we are not all aware of them nor able to perceive them can they really be described as innate? Accepting such a view would make it impossible to distinguish between innate ideas that we discover.</p> <p>HIS SECOND ARGUMENT</p> <p>Locke takes up at some length the claim that innate propositions are discovered when people come to use reason. For Locke, it makes no sense to describe a truth that is discovered through the use of reason as innate and he constructs a careful argument to back this up, investigating and refuting different interpretations of the claim. He did not go into much detail here, but he goes on to reject the claim that there are innate practical moral principles or that we are born with innate ideas of God, identity or impossibility.</p> <p>It is by degrees that we acquire ideas, that we learn the terms which are employed to express them, and that we come to express their true connection. The universal consent of mankind in the first argument to certain truths does not prove that these are innate for nobody knows those truths till he hears them from others. For, if they were innate, an innate and unknown truth is a contradiction in terms.</p> <p>Also, the principles of morals are no more innate than the rest, unless we call the desire for happiness and the aversion to misery, which are, indeed, innate tendencies, but which are not expressions of some truths engraved on the understanding. In this field, universal consent cannot be invoked in any case; for moral ideas vary from nation to nation, from religion to religion. The keeping of contracts, for example, is without dispute one of the most undeniable duties in morality. But,</p> <p><em>If u ask a Christian, who believes in rewards and punishments after this life, why a man should keep his word, he will give this a reason: Because God, who has the power of eternal life and death, requires it of us. But if a Hobbist be asked why: he will answer: Because the public requires it and the Leviathan will punish you if you do not. Finally, a pagan philosopher would have answered that the violation of a promise was dishonest, unworthy of the excellence of man, and contrary to his vocation, which is perfect virtue </em>(Locke and Pattison, 1978:29)<em>.</em></p> <p>Moreover, how can a truth, that is, a proposition, be innate, if the ideas which make up that truth are not? In order that a proposition is innate, certain ideas must be innate: but, ‘excepting perhaps some faint ideas of hunger, warmth and pains, which they may have felt in the mother’s womb, there is not the least appearance that new-born children have any settled ideas’ (Aaron, 1971: 33).</p> <p>Even the idea of God is not innate; besides the individuals who are called atheists and who are really atheists, there are whole nations who have neither notion nor any term to express it. Therefore, this notion varies infinitely from coarse anthropomorphism to the deism of the philosophers. And even if it was universal and everywhere the same, it would not, on that account, be more innate than the idea of fire; for there is no one who has any idea of God who has not also the idea of fire.</p> <p><strong>THE THIRD ARGUMENT</strong></p> <p>On the issue of innate ideas which Locke rejected, the work of Gottfried Leibniz, in his <em>New Essays on Human Understanding</em> will be given consideration. Though, this work of Leibniz was not a critique of Locke’s theory, but rather, is an application of his philosophical conclusions. This argument specifically briefs the position of Leibniz interest on innate ideas. Leibniz was a contemporary philosopher of Locke. Like Locke, Leibniz was very much interested in Descartes’ philosophy. While Locke did not agree with the idea of souls and innate ideas, this is what Leibniz was interested in. Leibniz did not believe in a mechanistic view of the universe.

And how these terms have been able to help epistemological attempt to refute or answer the skeptical challenges that nothing can be known for certain.</p> <p>        Epistemic terms such as knowledge, justification, truth and falsehood, perception, subjectivism, objectivism, reason e.t.c</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>History of philosophy make scant mention of women philosophers prior to the twentieth century, For a long time it was assumed that this was due to lack of influential women philosophers. Scholars such as Mary Ellen Waithe suggested that women have been more important in the history of philosophy than is often mentioned1.       </p> <p>Before now, women have often been excluded from prestigious area of human activity (for example, politics or science), thereby making these activities seem clearly “male”. Such areas in this 21st century can be said to have been more embracing of the “women folk”, due to the feminist clamour for equality and opportunity to be heard, rather than been sidelined and seen as inferior to men.</p> <p>Female or women issues have often been at the topmost at both local and international conferences, feminism can be opposed, rejected, criticized but it cannot be ignored like religion there seems to be some amount of passion, emotion and contradiction involved in its debate. Even those who are male centered (male chauvinist) have come to realize the absurdity of not recognizing the validity of the core questions surrounding the issues of feminism.</p> <p>Feminist theory applied to epistemology has resulted in a wide variety of arguments and claims, but common to all of them is the idea that gender is an important (and historically neglected) consideration for the study, critique and reconstruction of epistemology. For feminist epistemologists, traditional western epistemology is endocentric and male-biased. It fails to take women’s experience and perspectives into account. Due to the existence of male domination, male norms have become dominant norms and been regarded as objective and universal standards for all. As such women’s was of thinking and knowing have been considered as something inferior and invalid2. Due to this fact of traditional Western epistemology been male-centered, feminist epistemologists have share the view that it is inadequate, as knowledge is meant to be seen in a pure, abstract, universal way, detached from gender, social class and other important differences.</p> <p>            Although, among feminist epistemologists there are disagreements on whether there are uniform women’s way of knowing in the global sphere, to what extent traditional Western epistemology is male-biased, and whether some ways of knowing are shared by both genders, but all feminist epistemology is gender-biased and that feminist criticisms of it will significantly contribute to the improvement of theories of knowledge3. As such for them, traditional epistemology is not a true representation of human unbiased epistemology.</p> <p>            It is to critically evaluate the above and their (feminist epistemologists) view on some of the epistemic terms that this project is being carried out and also to acknowledge the contributions of at least some women to the history of philosophy (epistemology).</p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>The issues of feminism are always problematic and sensitive. These issues then becoming more problematic when transferred to the area of knowledge.</p> <p>Looking at the problem of “power control”, where traditional epistemology has been predicated on the ideas of men, and women are gradually rising to question this inequality, which feminist epistemologists are accusing the traditional western epistemology of, because if this patriarchal nature continues, current epistemology will not be complete, but would have been guilty of male chauvinism, making it not a true representation of human knowledge. As such current epistemology is labeled as “Incomplete”. This problem will be considered in this work.</p> <p><strong>1.3       PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>                        The purpose of this study though legion, we shall be looking at two;</p> <p>            First, it is obvious that the fight for equality can sometimes be exaggerated; equality itself is an ambiguous term that should not be interpreted univocally or equivocally but analogically. Men have told a lot of lies of their suppose superiority, women are gradually trying to counter some of these lies with their own lies. As such the search for the truth about the relationship that ought to exist between male and female should constitute the core or essence of feminism.</p> <p>            Lastly, knowledge is central to human awareness. Humanity comprises of both male and female. As such human knowledge should not be male centric. The purpose of this study is therefore to construct knowledge in such a way that women are excluded.</p> <p><strong>1.4       SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This project shall in scope be limited to a critical evaluation of some epistemic perspective on such epistemic terms as knowledge, justice and injustice, belief, pragmatism, empiricism and rationalism e.t.c as in contrast to traditional western epistemology.</p> <p><strong>1.5       METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>Methodology makes a work to be systematic, scientific, coherent and organized. A good project ought to posses the above qualities. The method of research therefore becomes imperative in searching for the solutions to the problems in a given research.</p> <p>The method here shall be both analytic and critical. Analysis involves clarification of concept for easy comprehension, while critical means not to accept assumptions but to question them until the truth stands out clear. We shall not only analyse, but shall seriously and critically evaluate the assumptions of feminist epistemology with hope of finding solutions to the problem raised under the “Statement of Problems”.</p> <p><strong>1.6       LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p>The first book reviewed is titled  <em>The Power of Ideas</em>, (ed) by Brooke Noel Moore and Kenneth Bruder, 5th edition, published in 2002 by the McGraw-Hill Companies, inc. Newyork. Chapter 14 of this book is devoted to feminist philosophers and brings to limelight the work of feminist (women) who have struck out their neck to fight for women’s freedom. Feminist like Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-1797), well known when she published “A vindication of the Rights of Women”. She was also well known for her argument against Rosseau’s view about women in his “Sophic”, when he advocated that women’s education should be designed entirely to make them pleasing to men. As he said;</p> <p><em>            “To please, to be useful to us, to make us love and esteem them,                   to educate us when young and take care of us,                                           when grown up to advise us, to console us,                                         to render our lives easy and agreeable – these are the duties                        of women at all times; and what they should be taught in their         infancy”</em><em>4</em><em>.</em></p> <p>            These words by Rosseau, Wollstonecraft employed several arguments against and also against his allies. Saying that educating women to be the ornaments to, and playthings of men would have bad consequences for the society, that how could women who have been tagged silly, vain creatures ever be expected to do an adequate job of raising a family? They would become “mere propagators of fools”5. This and other arguments she used against Rosseau’s view about women. We also have other great feminist contributors like Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986) and Gloria Steimen (1934) in this chapter.</p> <p>            The Second book here is entitled <em>The Blackwell Companion Co Philosophy</em>, (ed) Nicholas Bunnin and E.P.tsui-James, published in 2001 by Blackwell Ltd, Oxford. Chapter 32 of this book is devoted to Feminism and Philosophy. The author of this chapter Jean Grimshaw examines some main features of contemporary feminist and considers proposals for the future.</p> <p>            The next book reviewed is <em>Feminist epistemology</em> (ed) by Linda Alcoff and Elizabeth Potter, published in 1993 by Routledge, Newyork. The book centers on feminist view on epistemology of feminist way of knowing or “women’s knowledge”. The authors pull together the feminist epistemology which is an uneasy alliance of feminism and philosophy. The authors are concerned with the many problems that have vexed traditional epistemology which are the nature of knowledge itself, epistemic agency, justification, objectivity and whether and how epistemology should be naturalized.</p> <p>            The Fourth book reviewed is titled <em>Introducing Feminism</em>, co-edited by S.A Watkins, M. Rueda and M. Rodriguezi, published at Cambridge by Icon Books Ltd in 1998. The book has the following central issues; (a) Rebelling against all power, structures and convention that keep women service, subordination and second best (b) Women consciously working together for their own rights (c) Equality and the sacred right of property for married and single women (d) The story of changing the subordinate condition of women begins with feminism. The book also cut through the myths surrounding the subject and provides an incisive account of the women’s movement from its surprisingly recent birth in the French revolution to the world wide explosion of women’s liberation in the 1970’s. it looks at the achievements of feminism and the challenges still confronting women throughout the world, even in the 21st century.</p> <p>            The fifth book reviewed is titled <em>Basic issues in the theory of knowledge</em>, written by Ben Eboh, in 1995, published by Fulladu publishing company Nsukka. According to the author, the human mind is insatiable in its desire for deep and more extensive knowledge and so it does not remain satisfied with the obvious and transparent explanation of the universe. This natural urge for a reliable knowledge compels man to raise questions as these; what is common to all the different activities that are involved in knowing? What can we know beyond the information provided by the senses?6. These and allied questions are discussed indepth in this book with a view to determining the foundation, the ultimate grounds and reasons of human knowledge (feminist knowledge).</p> <p>            Next book reviewed is written by TanesiniAllessandra, titled <em>An Introduction to feminist epistemologie</em> published in 1993 by Blackwell publishers, Oxford. This book laid emphasis on feminist epistemology as an outgrowth of both feminist theorizing about gender and traditional epistemology as a concern. The author explains feminist epistemology as a loosely organized approach to epistemology, rather than as a particular school or theory. She sees that what is common to feminist epistemologies is an emphasis on the epistemic salience of gender and the use of gender as an analytic category in discussions, criticism and reconstructions of epistemic practices, norms and ideas. It portrays feminist epistemology as not easily and simply characterized, that feminist approach to epistemology tends to share an emphasis on the ways in which knower’s are particular and concrete, rather than abstract and universalizable. And also, gives insight on some of the tradition in which feminist get their sources to approach epistemology, traditions such as feminist science studies, naturalistic epistemologies, cultural studies of science, Marxist feminism and related work in and about the social sciences7.</p> <p>            The Seventh book reviewed is written by W.F. Lawhead, titled <em>The Philosophical Journey</em>, <em>An interactive Approach</em>, 2nd edition, McGraw-Hill Companies Inc, New York in 2003. The author in chapter 2 (2.7) takes a survey case at feminist epistemology.</p> <p>            He sees feminism has another contemporary movement that questions some of the underlying assumptions of the Western tradition in philosophy and seeks to develop a new modelfor doing philosophy. And that feminism like any living movement that is breaking new ground, have many different and conflicting visions of what the character and agenda of their movement should be and holds that though there is no official creed or set of doctrines that all feminist agree upon, but that their thinking revolves around some common themes, such that feminism is seen as a movement within philosophy and other discipline that;</p> <p>(1) emphasizes the role of gender in shaping how we think and how society is structured (2) focuses on the historical and social forces that have excluded women from full participation in the intellectual and political realms, and (3) strive to produce a society that recognizes women and men as both different and equal8. These three themes illustrate that feminism includes both theoretical understanding of the way things are and an attempt to use their knowledge to transform the status quo.</p> <p>            Next book reviewed is titled <em>Scrutinizing Feminist Epistemology</em>, (ed) by C.L. Pinnick, N. Koertge and R.F, Almeder, published by Rutger University Press, New Brunswick in 2003. This book offers a systematic critique against feminist epistemologists; its aim is to show that the entire enterprise is a failure. The authors level for charges against feminist epistemologists, such as (1) Political correctness- that feminist epistemologists aims at political-correctness, which is an attempt to legitimate the idea that “feminist values should determine what theories are accepted”9. That such politicized inquiry leads to “sham reasoners seeking only to make a case for some foregone conclusions”10. (2) Tribalism- that feminist epistemologists think that all women (or all feminist) do, or should think alike, and that they ought to adopts some common “feminine epistemic style applicable to all fields of inquiry and in serving women’s interest”.     (3) Self- defeating conservatism- that feminist epistemologists defeat their own aims in taking women’s values as an uncriticized given, even when these values underwrite sex and caste oppression11. (4) Cynicism- that feminist epistemologists reject the quest for objectivity and truth as an impossibility, and regard the claim to pursue it is a mask for power play that in practice serves the interests of white heterosexual western men at everyone else’s expenses. All these arguments they used against feminist epistemologists in this book.</p> <p>            The last book reviewed is by Elizabeth Anderson, “How not to criticize feminist Epistemology: A review of scrutinizing Feminist Epistemology”. The author in this book aims at debunking “Scrutinizing Feminist Epistemology” by C.L. Pinnick and Co, with an attempt to show how a critique that purports to decisively undermine an entire field of enquiry be evaluated.</p> <p>            She proposes three major standards that should be followed, such as (1) Accuracy- that the critique must accurately represent the field as it stands today, paying close attention to what its actual proponents say in context (2) Perspectives- to be illuminating, that a critique should not simply deploy its presuppositions against it rivals, but make them explicit, situate them relative it rivals in a field of possibilities, explain why these are the possibilities and why its presuppositions should be accepted rather than its rivals. Lastly, Normative consistency- that a critique should live up to the same normative standards it applies to its object. Using these standards, she argues that the critiques against feminist epistemologists are based on gross misrepresentations of feminist epistemology.</p> <p><strong>ENDNOTES</strong></p> <p>1.         K.I.

Philosophers are very concerned with this problem. The problem of the existence of God has almost become a part of every being and one who his beliefs will tagged an atheist which today connotes a black sheep of the family.</p> <p>Man shares quite a number of characteristic with other living thing but the fact is that man still stands clear that he is very unique. Man has been endowed with certain qualities which other beings cannot boast of which is his rationality, that is the ability to reason, unlike plants and lower animals who, just respond to external stimulation involuntarily man is capable of deciding consciously which stimuli he ought to respond to and which he is to regard.</p> <p>In  the area of religion people   are so firm in their minds that they assume that as with other matters of knowledge like technology, custom and ethics, that there must be away to prove the existence and nature of God. Other believe that it is in some ways unnecessary and even evil to seek rational justification for the existence of God, which they think should be accepted without any attempt to proof its existence.</p> <p>They rationality of man has automatically made him responsible for whatever  action  after conscious evaluation of the fact that behind every action preformed by man, there is a motivating principle.1 It is equally important to know and understand the meaning and purposes of all that exist, despite the serious mystery in which things are strictly bound up. Philosopher can never be satisfied with anything less than good reason for % adopting a belief or any phenomenon at all.2 In matters of religion and in every other area, philosopher search for answers that can be justified by sound arguments.</p> <p>The fact that everything in nature has got some meaning and can be understood to constitute certain meaning towards the realization of certain ends, and having equally grasped it to the extent that all other things as well as the lower forms of life are meant and designed for human purposes and convinces, the word it becomes some what comprehend the meaning purpose and the end for which human existence is meant.</p> <p>God's existence cannot be proved merely, by considering the word \"GOD\" as in the onto logical argument. God's existence cannot be proved just by examining the concept what it is about nature that makes it manifest that it requires God as its original cause. Humans existence has been seen by some pessimist like a walking shadow full of found and   fury signifying nothing.3 That is human existence count for nothing but emptiness and meaning lessness.</p> <p>To other philosophers like St. Augustine, everything is created to fulfill a purpose. St. Augustine assertion is that God is a God of purpose who cannot create anything without a purpose. This is the greatest tragedy in life, it's not death according to his believe but life without a reason, so nit dangerous to be alive and not know why one was given life.4 Since deepest and ultimate craving of the human existence is the search for a sense of significance and relevance to life, thus fundamental questions such as Who I am? Why am I here for, what am I here about? And so forth has continued to puzzle the minds of the deep-thinking men in philosophy. The fact meaning that God's existence can only be proved by his part and purpose in nature as seen as in Thomas Aquinas argument for the existence of God.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PURPOSE</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this essay is to critically examine the argument for the existence of God in relation to the problem of evil. We shall also take a cursory look at st. Thomas Aguinas argument for the existence of God. In order to debunk the logical, evidential, skeptics and the theoretical determinism approach to the problem of evil.</p> <p><strong>THESIS</strong></p> <p>The thesis of this essay is that the realities of evil call into question the phenomenal attributes of God as omnipotent, omniscience, and omnibenevolent. But beyond this our thesis  affirm that all that exists did not just come into being but it is caused by some offer thing than itself.</p> <p>Whatever caused the universe is and all mat exists is greater than the universe and all that exists itself. God is the only being   greater than the universe, therefore God caused the universe and God exist.</p> <p><strong>METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>Our method shall be historical, explanatory and analytical method.</p> <p><strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION</strong></p> <p>The scope of this essay is restricted to the proofs on the existence of God and the existence of evil. With particular reference to Thomas Aquinas argument for the existence of God we shall critically and thoroughly examine the problem of evil in its various expressions.</p> <p><strong>SOURCES</strong></p> <p>In writing this essay we shall make use of relevant academic material (texts books, journal s articles) from the following universities: The library of Olabisi Onabanjo University.</p> <p>University of Ibadan main library</p> <p>The central library, Babcock University Ilisan Remo.</p> <p>The central library, University of Lagos.</p> <p>Information from worldwide website and some other educational centre.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>REFERENCES</strong></p> <p>Jeremy Bentham, An Introduction to the Principle of Moral and legislation (London Claredon press 1977) p. 45.</p> <p>Dale Jacquette, Philosophical Entrees (Columbus: MCGraw Hill 2001) p. 379.</p> <p>Akinyemi Onigbinde, What is Philosophy?

Philosophy seeks to establish standard of evidence, to provide rational methods of resolving conflicts, and to create techniques for evaluating ideas and arguments. It gives one the ability to see the world from the perspective of other inch the perspective of other inch vandals (Plato, Aristotle, Thales, Anaximander, Socrates ect) and other groups and cultures. It enhances our ability to perceive the relationships among the various fields of study, and it deepens one's sense of the meaning and varieties of human experience philosophy is an endless search for knowledge.</p> <p>Philosophy is the only discipline that pursues question in every dimension of human life, and its technique apply to problem in any field of study or endeavor. Other disciplines like religion, psychology, sociology, law, machine, education and other fields of study hold philosophy very important.</p> <p>Philosophy is the mother of all disciplines, it is very unique unlike other field. It has no universally acceptable definition, it is a unique berth in its methods, nature and its application.</p> <p>However, the knowledge of man's existence is not as tasking as that of God but yet, its serves as the topmost miracles in the world. This factual injunction is supported in one of completion's statement that miracles in the world are many and that there is no greater miracles than man1. The search for the true nature of man has generated a lot of philosophical discussion, conflicting views and hypothesis.</p> <p><strong>1.2     CONCEPTIONS OF GOD</strong></p> <p>Xenophanes was the Greek pre-Socratic philosopher who woke the metaphysicians and Theologian from their dogmatic slumber, when he criticize the anthropomorphism of God, even since then, there has been an attempt to understand the nature of God.</p> <p>Various religions thinkers have held that God is different from finite beings that he must be considered essentially a mystery beyond the power of human conception, the philosopher to the God of thoughts.</p> <p>In Judaism, Christianity and Islam God is conceived primarily in term of transcendence, personality Hebrew Scriptures, in which God is presented as creator. In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth1. This God is anthropomorphic. He has finite intelligent and has epistemic unit this is made manifest in his regret over the creation of man.</p> <p>This God is tribalistic as secure in his astounding support for the Jewish race above any other reace. View of malinky keener. He writes:</p> <p>The Hebrew understands of God is frankly authromorphics. He promised and threatened. He could be angry and Attributes were righteousness, justice, mercy truth and Faithfulness. He binds himself by covenant to his people And thus limit himself3</p> <p>Suffice to note that the idea of God in the New Testament and that of the Old Testament varies. They are not exact synonyms. The God of the New Testament popularly called the Christian God is a universal God and all loving God that is essentially omniscience. In as much as this idea is subject to different interpretation, this God is cast in the form of trinity of God the son, God the father and God the Holy Spirit. Christians teach that God is almighty and is in dominion over all that is in heaven and earth, righteous in judgment over good and evil beyond time and space and change, but over all they teach that \"God is love\"4 . He is love personified. The creation of the world out of nothing and the creation of the human race were expression of that love and so was the coming of Christ5. This God is a miracle working God. He is invisible or incorporeal.</p> <p>In Islam, God is seen as one, prefect, uncreated, eternal, omnipotent and creator of the most gracious, the most merciful, the only owner and the only ruling judge of the day of recompense6 monotheistic religions, the charge has often been made that the Christian notion of trinity in particular is at variance with the oneness of God in monotheism. God is seen as the cause and creator of everything, he knows everything and foreseen everything. He is an embouchement of justice. In the words of Gerald Hawting \"this God is one, there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of God\"7</p> <p>In the African Traditional religion especially in the Yoruba socio-cultural Millie, the idea of God is different. God (olodumare) is more akin to the Old Testament. Yahweh in his requirement of honesty and uprightness. God is the creator, He creates both good and the evil. He is the most powerful being. His ways are in comprehensible. J.S MBITI assert the Yoruba consider God to be judge over all. J.A.I BEWAJI says this about Olodumare:</p> <p>There is no doubt that God is the most powerful being Being and he has all the supernatural attribute one can Consider but the Yoruba does not think such a being Cannot do evil or cause evil. It is part of the attribute Of the supreme being to be able to utilize all things.8</p> <p> In a similar vein E.B Idowu Maintains that:</p> <p>He is the most powerful   being the creator, the wise impartial judge who exercises inexorable control over the universe.</p> <p> J.A.I. Bewaji is also of the opinion that:</p> <p>The source of evil are God devised and help to maintain High moral standard the Christian God is ever merciful, Slow to anger but quick to forgive. In fact, he does not Desire the death of the sinners but that he repent and Be saved.  Whereas the Yoruba Olodumare is   morally Upright God who metes out justice here on   earth and not necessarily in the hereafter where we are not sure anybody will witness   and learn from it10.</p> <p>The Nicholas and Cusha see God as an amalgam of good and evil. Process theologian like whitehead conceived and the world as sharing the same process and being dependent on each other for growth and development. God is also considered as dipolar, having one aspect of his being which is dependent of his world and another, which is completely immersed   into the   world process   and suffers   with it. A process   of theology   as implied he explains  the exercise    of evil and   suffering  by extending to every level of creation the freedom to respond or failure to respond to the persuasive law of God.</p> <p>The conception of God from the process philosophy selves two major problems being faced by the Christian philosophers. These problems are; how can an immaterial being or spiritual be the source of matter? To this, the process philosophy explained by trying to remove the duality between God and matter, an integral part of the divine being. The second solution which the concept of God by the process philosophy solved is that of the problem of evil. To this school of thought, God just means that he is not the creator of evil.</p> <p>Sigmund Freud conceive God as a product of illusion. God is an illusion devised to plug the 100pholes of security left by maturity above parental care. These various conceptions show that God is subject to different interpretation.</p> <p><strong>1.3     ARGUMENTS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD.</strong></p> <p>Immanuel cant maintained that the existence of God cannot at all be demonstrated, yet   neither   can his existence be disproved. To kant, God was considered to be an objective issue, one that is irrefutably a matter of interpretation. He says that the idea of God grounds moral beliefs, therefore we can make the practical assumption that God exists to ensure the connection between virtue and happiness.</p> <p>Frederick Nietzsche rejected belief in God as weak and unreliable. Philosophers like Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud tried to explain the personal motives of believes and their origins, pointing out that this is not enough to prove the existence of God. We have different argument for the existence of God propounded by different philosopher’s right from the time of Aristotle to Spinoza, and from one philosophical age to the other.</p> <p>We also have the theistic concept of God. The theists see God to be unlimited with regard to knowledge that is omniscience. Power, he is regarded to be omnipotent, and omnipresent. God is also regarded to be sexless but he is been traditionally referred to with the masculine pronoun.</p> <p>Augustine, Dunscotus, St. Thomas Aquinas sought to find more concrete and solid evidences for the existence of God. To Plato, God is transcendence; that is the highest and most perfect being, and on who uses eternal   forms or archetypes, to fashion a universe   that   is eternal and uncreated. Different philosophers right from the early philosophic thoughts to the modern have tried in a lot of ways to give rational proofs to God's existence. They have tried to explain god's nature in the scheme of things. We shall discuss the following argument to prove the existence of God</p> <p>1.                 cosmological Argument</p> <p>2.                 Argument from Design</p> <p>3.                 Ontological Argument</p> <p><strong>1.</strong><strong>Cosmological Argument: </strong>This argument is usually associated with Thomas Aquinas, he argues that the things which we see around us now are the products of a series of previous causes. Thus, there must be some first cause which was not itself caused by anything else. And that first uncaused caused by God. It could be referred to as the causal argument or first causes. The argument in its simplest from states that:</p> <p>All that exists is caused by something other than Itself, and the universe exists. So the universe is caused by something other than itself, whatever caused the universe is greater than the universe So God caused the universe11.</p> <p>There   are also the experiential   argument, in which   people widen                                                                                               personal religions  experiences of God  argue in support of his existence we have argument by reason and moral MgvffiaerA.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong><strong>Argument from Design: </strong>This argument states that animals, plants and planets show clear signs of being designed for specific ends, therefore there must have been a designer. The argument from designer can also be called the theological argument for the existence of God. Proponents claim that the design or order found in the universe provides evidence for the existence of an intelligent designer usually identified as God.</p> <p>William parley here compared the complexity of living things to the inferior complexity of a watch    that we know to    be designed by an intelligent being. Just as a watch could not exist without a watchmaker. Parley argued that living things could not exist without an intelligent designer.</p> <p>Since watches are the products of intelligent design, and living things are like watches in having complicated me chansons which serve a purpose, living things are probably the products of intelligent design as well.12</p> <p><strong>3.</strong><strong>Ontological Argument: </strong>This argument is called an ontological argument because it points to the existence of God through the type of being. The perfect being conceivable, and anything that is the greatest or most perfect being is something that exists (otherwise it would lack something and fail to be the greatest or most perfect thing conceived ) so God exists because of the notion that God is a perfect being, that he is all knowing, all powerful, and all good. This argument states that everyone except the fool believes in his mind that there is a being greater and prefect, which is God. Therefore, for man to have been able to conceive the idea of a being greater than it, point to the fact that God exists in reality.</p> <p>And certainly that man which nothing greater Than Can be conceived cannot exist merely in The understanding. For instance it exist merely In the understanding, then it can be conceived To exist in reality which is greater.13</p> <p>St. Anselm was the proponent of this theory, he argues that for something to have been conceive in our understanding affirms existence in reality</p> <p><strong>1.4     ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE EXISTENCE OF GOD.</strong></p> <p>Different philosophers at one point or the other have objected to various argument for the existence of God. These argument are given in form of an objection to the various arguments in support of God existence. The school thought or philosophers that argued against the existence of God can be regarded as atheist. We shall explain this from the perspective of pains and evil in the world.</p> <p><strong>1.</strong><strong>PAIN: </strong>In the words of Frederic Nietzsche \"God is dead\". Nietzsche's state went here does not mean that God once existed and now is dead. He made this statement in order to make it clear or to stamp on the minds of the religions that with the presence of pain natural disasters, disharmony and anarchy present in the universe shows that there is nothing as the existence of God. Nietzsche's maintains that:</p> <p>All people with an ounce of intelligence would hove perceive that   there   is    no Intelligent plan to the universe or rational Order unit: they would now understand Happen one way   and not another and that the harmony and order we imagine to exists in the universe is merely pasted by the human mind.14</p> <p>The argument proposes that because God allows pain, disease and natural disaster to exist he cannot be all powerful and also loving and good in the human sense of these words. Nietzsche sees religions people as pathetic governed by the view inculcated by religion, science and philosophy, a view that make s them feeble losers. They view the world as national law governed place and they stick to this slave mentality or morality that praises the man who serve his follows with meekness and self-sacrifice. He proposed an morality which is based on the development of a hard kind of human being. Such a being will accept life in all its face is, including pain and thus being will made living an art.</p> <p>Blase Pascal comments that disharmony and pain in the universe is a major pointer to the non-existence of a divine being:</p> <p>I would remain peacefully in faith. But seeing Too much to deny and too little to be sure, I am in a state to be pitied: wherefore J have a Hundred times wished that if God maintains Nature, he should testify to him unequivocally.15</p> <p>The   argument   from injustices all state that God   is partial in the allocation of destines if he ever did. The argument from multiplicity states that from the on conflicting reports of various   religions about God, affirms that the only one or even none can be right about God.</p> <p>Sigmund Freud is of the opinion that religion or belief in God is an exercise in mass decision and serves mainly to keep people in a state of psychological infantilism. Because of the pain and challenges in life. Man created in his mind the figure of an exalted father, who reassures like our own father did that all will soon come to an end. The fact remains that if he is as powerful as professed things ought to have been solved by now. Freud concludes that human beings would be happier if they retained a modicum of reality in the thinking and cultivated their own gardens.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>REFERENCES</strong></p> <p>Frederick   Copleston, A  <strong>History of Philosophy   vol.1. </strong>(New York: image books 1960) p. 102.</p> <p>The Holy Bible Genesis Chapter Ivsl</p> <p>Malinky Kerner, <strong>God in Philosophical Analysis </strong>(New Delhi: Alhied publishes 1990) p. 54-57.</p> <p>The Holy Bible, John chapter 3 vsl 6.</p> <p>Ibid, John Chapter 3 vsl 4.</p> <p>The Noble Quran, Surat Alfatihah Chapter Ivsl -5.</p> <p>Gerald   Hawting, <strong>Islam </strong>(London: Oxford university press 2002) p. 15</p> <p>J.A.I.Bewaji,<strong> African Religions and Philosophy </strong>(London: Heinemann 1969) p. 36-38.</p> <p>E.B.Idowu,  Olodumare,  <strong>God  in Yoruba  Belief </strong>(London: Longman 1962) p. 76.</p> <p>J.A.I.Bewaji Ibid p.344.</p> <p>Akinyemi    Onigbinde, <strong>What    is Philosophy? </strong>(Ibandan: front   line Resource Limited 1999) p.49.</p> <p>Dale    Jacquette,    <strong>Philosophical</strong> <strong>Entrees </strong>(Columbus: Mc Graw Hill 2001) p. 385-397.</p> <p>Brooke Noel and Kenneth Bruder, <strong>Philosophy: The Power of Ideas</strong> (Columbus: Mc Graw Hill 2001) p. 342.</p> <p>Brooke Noel and Kenneth Bruder, <strong>Philosophy</strong>: <strong>The Power of Ideas</strong> (Columbus: Me Graw Hill 2001) p. 363.</p> <p>Dale   Jacguette,   <strong>Philosophical Entrees   </strong>(Columbus: Mc Graw Hill 2001) p. 427</p>                                                          \n\nTHE EXISTENCE OF GOD AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL A PHILOSOPHICAL EVALUATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EXISTENCE OF GOD AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL A PHILOSOPHICAL EVALUATION", "id": 126}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>In the history of philosophy, it is believed that the ultimate end of man is happiness and the only way that leads to (through which one achieves) such goal is by living a moral or virtuous life. Living a virtuous life implies exhibiting and behaving morally right.</p> <p>Consequently, man employs laws of which its objective is to augment the total happiness of the community as it legislates and protects the people. By the very fact that certain actions and measures inflict suffering and pain, do not make that action to be evil or wrong. There are actions that are not pleasurable yet, are considered morally good and right. Besides, there are yet some other actions that are pleasurable but are evil and wrong.</p> <p>Moreover, as a result of its simplicity and confirmation of the ideology of majority,<em>pleasure and happiness are what everyone desires,</em> the philosophy of utilitarianism has claimed the imaginations of (generations) men than any other way or system of thinking. </p> <p>The search for pleasure becomes thus, the motivating force of all the actions of man.</p> <p>Nonetheless, our concern here is to examine specific ethical theory and its solution to the central question of ethics: what is the yardstick for measuring the moral action of an individual; what is the moral standard of morality? Hitherto, the moral philosophy of John Stuart Mill is an attempt made or proposed as a guide to individual’s actions. His doctrine had influence on the thinking and imagination of men; for it confirmed what most of them already believed as a general thesis. J.S Mill had shared his father’s as well as Bentham’s opposition to William Paley’s theological utilitarianism, ethical intuitionism, moral sense theory of ethics, etc.</p> <p>As we highlighted earlier, each ethical system has its own view on what makes the action of individual right or wrong, good or bad. There is no general agreement as to the content and the standard norm of morality. Mill, however, did not allow any appeal to alleged rational intuition. He emphasized on the consequences of behaviour as the criterion for what is good instead of a dutiful obedience to formal rules of conduct.</p> <p>He maintained that utilitarianism gives these reasons by establishing which rules under given circumstance lead to happiness or pleasure and those that lead to unhappiness and pain. The test of a rule of conduct becomes thus, the extent of its conduciveness to happiness while pleasure and pain, the test of right and wrong actions. Utilitarianism, therefore, as a moral theory claims and proposes that the morality of an act consists essentially of its utility as means for attainment of happiness of man. Hence, an act is good if it is useful in achieving pleasure and diminishing pain. John Stuart Mill sets out to prove that the greatest happiness is the sole and ultimate end of man actions </p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>There have existed lots of conflicts, disagreements and intolerable attitudes in matters of moral issues as individuals tend to resist the concerted actions demanded in a society. Indeed, from the dawn of philosophy, the question concerning the “Summum Bonum” or “the yardstick for measuring the morality of human actions” has been accounted the main problem in speculative thought. It therefore, gave rise to various sects and schools carrying on a vigorous warfare against one another.</p> <p>The utilitarian principle is seen and has been held as the true standard of morality and most reliable measurement for distinguishing good actions from the bad actions. The goodness (right) or badness (wrong) of an action lies in its usefulness as means for attainment of happiness or pleasure and diminishing pain.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the utilitarianism has been unable to deal with certain kinds of moral issues like rights and justice. There are certain actions that utilitarianism regards as morally right yet, they violate people’s right and deny them of justice too. This implies that utilitarianism looks only at how much utility is produced and fails to take into account how that utility is achieved or distributed among members of a society. More still, it becomes difficult too to evaluate the ethical propriety of any decision. It means therefore that utilitarianism seems to ignore certain important aspects of ethics since; it holds the principle that right actions in any situation are the one that will produce the greatest benefit(s). Hence, the end justifies the means but this principle is unacceptable.</p> <p><strong>PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Life itself in a society demands a concerted action. Simply put, people should have the same kind of attitude in moral terrain. We cannot live at least humanly without in some ways guide our lives. There ought to be a justification of the human actions to be executed in view of their end(s) thus- the moral theory among which is Utilitarianism.</p> <p>It is important to note that the subject matter of ethics is human act viewed from moral rightness or wrongness. Consequently, the theory of Utilitarianism posited by J.S Mill serves as a social instrument for controlling, designating, influencing, moulding and redirecting other people’s attitude. The purpose of this principle (utilitarianism) therefore, should be noted without doubt as to enable human beings to live good and moral life.</p> <p>We shall therefore, examine critically the theory of utilitarianism and its proposition with a view to helping individuals to be able to approach moral issues with an open mind thereby building a better society.</p> <p><strong>SCOPE OF RESEARCH</strong></p> <p>This research work centres on the utilitarian principle as highlighted by John Stuart Mill. However, other commentaries and views that appraised the utilitarianism are welcomed.</p> <p><strong>METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>The method of approach in this research work is expository. It also employed analytical and evaluative forms in explaining the doctrine posited by John Stuart Mill for evaluating and justifying the individual actions as good or bad, right or wrong.</p> <p><strong>DIVISION OF WORK</strong></p> <p>This research work is composed of the general introduction with four chapters. The general introduction relays a brief summary of the doctrine of utility and influence of J.S Mill as well as methodological consideration of the entire research work. The chapter one centres on the notion, meaning and forms of utilitarianism while, the second chapter examines some related literature on utilitarianism from the history of philosophy.</p> <p>Chapter three dwells on the brand of utilitarianism developed by J.S Mill as well as inquiring the susceptibility of the theory. The final chapter is the area of critical evaluation and conclusion. It looks further into the implications of Mill’s utilitarian principle and an awareness of the absolute happiness –God. </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>                             NATURE OF UTILITARIANISM</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     PRELIMINARY REMARK</strong></p> <p>The definitions of ‘good’ in the light of theories of ethics raised vexing questions to the commands, dictates, purposes and imperative consist of the principle of utility. Some of the definitions refer to it as:</p> <p>The commands of God, the dictates of reason, the fulfilment of the purposes of human nature, the duty to obey the categorical imperative, etc. Hence, John Locke holds that what has aptness to produce pleasure in us is what we regard as good and what is apt to produce pain in us, we refer to as evil. David Hume, on the other hand explains pleasure as sympathy. Accordingly, sympathy is the pleasure we feel when we consider the pleasure of others.</p> <p>However, Jeremy Bentham asserted that man is by nature a pleasure seeking and pain-avoiding animal. According to him, these two concepts (pleasure and pain) govern us in all we do, say and think. Utilitarianism therefore, is a moral theory that holds the thesis that man’s highest good consists in the optimum realization of the pleasures of which men is capable. It views pleasures and happiness as the end of man. Consequently, utility means happiness and pleasure, of which stands for the determinant of morality. Hence, the utilitarian principle approves or disapproves of every action whatsoever which appears to have the tendency to augment or diminish happiness. It therefore acclaims an action to be good when the aggregate of pleasure is greater than the aggregate of pain.</p> <p><strong>1.2     WHAT IS UTILITARIANISM</strong></p> <p>We cannot appreciate properly the principle of utilitarianism without understanding the values of the concepts of happiness and pleasure. Every writer from Epicurus to Bentham, who had maintained the theory of utility, meant by it not something to be contradistinguished from pleasure but, pleasure itself together with exemption from pain; for utilitarian principle considers effects like pleasure, happiness good, evil and pain as it relates to human actions and behaviour.</p> <p>It must be noted from the outset that those who stand up for utility as the test of right and wrong did not use the term in that restricted and merely colloquial sense in which utility is opposed to pleasure. Utility stands the same thing as happiness and pleasure. Moreover, the world and new generations have built and acquired their sole notion of the meaning of utilitarianism from the perverted use and definition of the term.</p> <p>Utilitarianism most generally is described as the doctrine, which states that “the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined, by the goodness and badness of their consequence. It may be put forward either as a system of normative ethics (i.e. proposal about how we ought to think about conduct) or as a system of descriptive ethics (i.e. an analysis of how we do think about conduct).</p> <p>According to <em>The Concise Routledge Encyclopaedia of Philosophy</em>, utilitarianism is a theory about rightness according to which the only good thing is welfare. For a utilitarian, morality is convertible with utility. As such utilitarianism could be defined as an ethical theory, which holds that morality of an act consists essentially of its utility as means for attainment of happiness of man, which in most cases is considered temporal. Utilitarianism is an ethical theory based on the principle of utility i.e. the principle of the greatest good or happiness. Utility is viewed therefore as the true standard of morality and most reliable measurement for distinguishing good actions from bad actions hence, the yardstick with which good actions are distinguished from bad actions. It implies therefore, that those actions, which produce or tend to produce pleasure, are good while those that tend to produce pain are bad.</p> <p>Utilitarianism implied superiority to frivolity and the mere pleasure of the moment. Of two pleasures, if there is one pleasure (action) to which almost all who have experience of both give a decided preference, irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation, it is regarded as the more desirable pleasure. In his book, <em>Utilitarianism</em>, John Stuart Mill gave his own notion of the term:</p> <p>The creed which accepts as the foundation of morals, or the greatest happiness principle holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness, is intended pleasure and absence of pain; while unhappiness (refers to) pain and privation of pleasure.</p> <p>The Greatest Happiness principle explains the ultimate end of man as an existence exempt as far as possible from pain and as rich as possible in enjoyment both in quality and quantity. In respect to and for the sake of all desirable things. Besides, the theory of life on which this moral theory is grounded is that, pleasure and freedom from pain are the only thing desirable as ends and, that all desirable things are desirable either for the pleasure inherent in themselves or as means to the promotion of pleasure and the prevention of pain. </p> <p>The happiness (pleasure) with which utilitarianism is concerned is not that of egoism. Mill emphasized this point saying that the happiness which forms the Utilitarian standard of what is right in conduct is not the agent’s</p> <p>own happiness but that of all concerned; as between an individual’s own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism requires him to be strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator. He maintained therefore that:</p> <p>For that standard is not the agent’s own greatest happiness but the greatest amount of happiness altogether; and if it may possibly be doubted whether a noble character is always the happier for its nobleness, there can be no doubt that it makes other people happier and that the worlds in general is immensely a gainer by it. </p> <p>Hence people shall always act from the inducement of promoting the general interests of the society. Pertinent to mention here is that the utilitarian morality conversed with the golden rule of Jesus of Nazareth, to do as you would love to be done by others and to love (your neighbour) as you love yourself. This invariably reads the complete spirit of ethics of utility.</p> <p>Utility therefore enjoins as means of making the nearest approach to its objects, that laws and social arrangements should place happiness or interest of every individual in harmony with the interest of the whole.</p> <p> This could be achieved through education as a medium to establish in the mind of every individual an indissoluble association between individual happiness and the good at the society; hence the altruistic nature of utilitarianism.</p> <p>Nonetheless, there is no ethical standard that decides an action to be good or bad, right or wrong since such a judgment is done by a good, amiable, brave and benevolent man or the contrary. Moreover, right action does not necessarily indicate a virtuous character. For instance, to be a good doctor is not the same as being a good person. One could be a good doctor without being a good person. As such, there is a difference between perfection in one’s profession and the activity of the same person as a person. In the long run, however the best proof of a good character remains good actions. Utilitarianism could, therefore, only attain its end by the general cultivation of nobleness of character.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>        TYPES OF UTILITARIANISM</strong></p> <p>Here, we are going to consider five forms of utilitarianism from different perspectives. However each kind of utilitarianism relates to another as such, the knowledge of one serves as a base to understanding and knowledge of the other. They include:</p> <p>i.                   Act Utilitarianism</p> <p>ii.                 Rule Utilitarianism</p> <p>iii.              Individual Utilitarianism</p> <p>iv.              Social Utilitarianism</p> <p>v.                 Egoistic Altruism</p> <p><strong>1.3.1</strong><strong>    ACT-UTILITARIANISM</strong></p> <p>Act utilitarianism is one of the major forms of utilitarianism that holds that the rightness or wrongness of an action should be decided only on the basis of the consequence(s) of the action. This is to say that the “after-effect” or the result of an action determines the morality of the action in question. Hence, those actions that produce good results for the greater numbers of people are considered good while those actions on the other hand that produce evil result, pain and unhappiness, are regarded as bad and wrong. More still, act-utilitarianism claims that an action is right if it achieves maximum utility for a maximum number hence; the morality of an action is determined, according to this principle, on the basis of the consequences of the action.</p> <p>Act-utilitarianism is concerned or focuses on a particular individual’s action as it appeals to the individual. Thus, the consequence of an action of an individual becomes the standard of morality. As such if an action produces the same consequence on a number of individual the particular action is considered morally good, based on the aggregate of pain or pleasure achieved. This principle implies thus that act-utilitarianism does not consider the nature of an action. Instead, it counts on the effect of such action on the individual: to judge whether an action is right or wrong, what counts is the result or the consequences of the action. It means therefore that as long as an action will produce the best possible results for the greatest number of people that particular action should be performed and be carried out as a morally good act. In other words, <strong><em>the end justifies the means</em></strong>.</p> <p><strong>1.3.2           RULE-UTILITARIANISM</strong></p> <p>This is another major form of utilitarianism. Rule-utilitarianism serves as an important and intellectual alternative version of utilitarianism, offered by the utilitarian in response to their critics. The basic strategy of rule-utilitarian is to limit utilitarian analysis to the evaluation of moral rules. What this means is that the supposed determinant of a right (moral) action stems from the question of whether the action is required by the correct moral rules that everybody should follow. Hence, if an action produces pleasure when employed the general rule of conduct it is regarded as morally good and vice versa.</p> <p>According to rule-utilitarian, when trying to determine if a particular action is ethical, one is never supposed to ask whether that particular action will produce the greatest amount of utility. Instead one is supposed to ask whether the action is required by the correct moral rules that everyone should follow. The basic question in this dimension should be <em>what would be the useful consequence of a moral rule if everybody adopts and obeys it? Or what are the correct moral rules? </em>It is such questions as the above that should be our concern. Indeed, the correct moral rules are those rules that would produce the greatest amount of utility if everyone were to follow them thereby maximizing utility. Simply put, rule-utilitarianism is concerned with rules as such the right action here is that which is in consonant with those rules that will maximize utility if accepted by all.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the fact that a certain action would maximize utility on a particular occasion does not show that the action is good and morally right. Instead, we should find out a correct moral rule that should evaluate particular actions involved in the counter-examples in relation to the adopted rules. The moral rules must be based on the principle of utility. By this point therefore, it is only the rules which will produce the best possible result for the greatest number of people if everybody would observe it when adopted, stands out as standard of distinguishing good actions from bad actions. This theory of rule-utilitarianism is summarized thus:</p> <p>a.                 An action is right from an ethical point of view if and only if the action would produce maximum utility when relates to the moral rules that are considered correct.</p> <p>b.                 A moral rule is correct if and only if the sum total of utility produced if everybody were to follow that rule is greater than the sum total of utilities produced if everybody were to follow some alternative rule.</p> <p>Finally, rule-utilitarianism puts into consideration such question as: <em>would useful consequent result from everyone adopting and obeying this rule?</em> If the answer is in the affirmative, then such an act becomes morally good while if on the contrary, it becomes morally wrong.</p> <p><strong>1.3.3  INDIVIDUAL UTILITARIANISM</strong></p> <p>Individual utilitarianism is another form of utilitarianism otherwise known as <strong><em>Egoistic Hedonism</em></strong>. The term obviously explains its concept. This form of utilitarianism claims that the end of each man of which each man ought to seek is his own greatest personal pleasure. Therefore, whatever action that tends to promote and increase per se pleasure of each man are to be regarded as morally right and good while those that produce the reverse of one’s personal pleasure are morally bad and wrong actions.</p> <p>This school of thought agreed also that man’s highest good is human pleasure. Accordingly, Jeremy Bentham maintained that pleasure is the only good desired by all men and; pain the only evil which all men seek to avoid. As such pain and pleasure controls our actions thus:</p> <p>It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do as well as to determine what we shall do. On the one hand, the standard of right and wrong, on the other hand the chain of causes and effects, are fastened to their  throne.  </p>                                                         \n\nUTILITARIANISM IN JOHN STUART MILL (A CRITICAL APPRAISAL)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " UTILITARIANISM IN JOHN STUART MILL (A CRITICAL APPRAISAL)", "id": 127}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>A CRITIQUE OF AFTERLIFE IN HINDUISM<br/>CHAPTER ONE </b><br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>From time immemorial, the fundamental question of whether life ends at death has been a major pre-occupation for both philosophers and religious thinkers., although different quarters of intellectual opinion have acknowledged the inevitability of death in human life as one of the most fateful experience of the human person,1the thought of such a death in a state ofsheer hopelessness of a next life makes even more devastating and renders human life less desirable and meaningless. However, with time, this fundamental question centered on human experienceof death began to receive scholarly attention and eventually led to the rationalization of afterlife. <br/>The belief of afterlife is characterized by different postulations from various philosophers. Philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, St Augustine accepted the concept of afterlife as a reality. Other philosophers such asEpicureus, rejected the notion of afterlife regarding it as an illusion. <br/>However, there is no single view of what the afterlife entails actually among the various cultures and traditions. John Hick makes the point clearer when he stated;<br/>Ideas of an afterlife of one sort or another have been promulgated by all manner of cultures and religions. For ancient peoples, the afterlife was a realm of vastly diminished existence populated by shades, ghostly counterparts of bodies. Ancient Indians and Egyptians before 2000 B.C.E postulated a judgment after death. The Greeks had hades; the Hebrews had Sheol. Far from being a matter of wish fulfillment, an afterlife, as pictured by ancient cultures, was not particularly desirable, just inevitable.2<br/>However, one of the earliest religious traditions which have a rich doctrine of afterlife is Hinduism. The notion of afterlife in Hinduism is paradoxically interesting and perplexing. Hinduism teaches a peculiar notion of afterlife that is quite different from other cultures and religious traditions. Perhaps, unlike other cultures and religious traditions, Hinduism believes that the human person is a composite of body and soul and at death, the body which is the material aspect of the person is laid off while the soul experience rebirth into a different body until the cycles of rebirth is completed before being joined with Braman. The need to critically analyze the intricacies of this doctrine of afterlife in Hinduism and highlight the problems inherent in it is what this essay seeks to achieve.<br/>1.2STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>Hinduism, which is the oldest religion of India presents itself as a rather complex notion of what the afterlife entails. It teaches that after life consist in attaining union with the Ultimate Reality through a series of rebirths3. However, there are serious problems challenging the credibility of this notion of afterlife in Hinduism. The fundamental questions which form the basis of these problems are: why should a bad karma which the body and soul acquired be suffered alone by the soul and in a different body in the afterlife? Is punishing a person with bad karma in lower state of life a matter of divine justice or an act of forgiveness? Furthermore, how can the individual identity and freedom be ascertained and understood since he is always in a wheel of rebirth? How do we differentiate persons or animals suffering from bad karma and those that are not?  These vexed questions which pose a serious challenge to the tenability of the notion of afterlife in Hinduism are what informed the sense of this essay.<br/>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>This essay is poised to primarily analyze the notion of afterlife in Hinduism. Its fundamental aim and objective is to beam intellectual light on what the afterlifeactually constitutes in Hinduism so as to facilitate a clearer and better understanding of it and also determine its inconsistencies. <br/>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY    <br/>This study is hoped to be of immense value to students of philosophy and religious studies, adherents of different religious traditions, academia, researchers in religious studies particularly of Hinduism, and every person who has a natural curiosity in the subject matter of this research work. This essay would enable student evaluate the notion of after life in Hinduism in a more a lightened manner. Since the concept of after life is fundamental concern for every human, this essay will assist people with the knowledge of what afterlife entails in Hinduism.<br/>1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This essay is chiefly limited to an examination of the concept of afterlife in Hinduism. It pays especial attention to those aspectswhere the notion of afterlife is explicitly expressed and taught. However, where necessary, reference will be made to the notion of afterlife in other religious traditions. <br/>1.6 METHODOLOGY<br/>This essay adopts the analytic and expository methods of inquiry which will enable us to plumb the depth of the notion of afterlife in Hinduism. Moreover, this essay is structurally bifurcated into four chapters. Chapter one covers the general introduction which gives us the statement of the problem, the purpose of study, significance of the study, the scope of the study, methodology, definition of concepts and literature review.  Chapter two provides us with the notion of afterlife in Hinduism. In it, we critically examine the intricacies of the concept of afterlife. Chapter three considers some concepts that will aid our understanding of the notion afterlife in Hinduism. And lastly, chapter four presents a synthesis of the three preceding chapters, an assessment of the notion of afterlife in Hinduism and conclusion.<br/>1.7 DEFINITION OF CONCEPTS<br/>The need to define the concepts in our topic is not only necessary to avoid every potential misconception but also expedient to define the object of this essay. For as Schattschneider once said, people who cannot define the object of their studies do not know what they are looking for, and if they do not know what they are looking for, how would they tell when they have found it? 4 In line this thought therefore, we shall consider in what follows, a clarification of the two concepts in our topic, namely afterlife and Hinduism. <br/>1.7.1 Afterlife<br/>The concept of afterlife is not easy to define. This is because the concept lacks a common universally acceptable definition, and each religious tradition and culture views it differently. However, attempt shall be made to look at its meaning in a general sense. Basically, the concept of afterlife literally means a belief in the continuation of life after death. According to the online Collins Advanced English Dictionary, an afterlife means a life that some people believe begins when you die, for example a life in heaven or as another person or animal. 5 Underlining the definition of afterlife is the belief in re-incarnation and rebirth which Anthony Echekwube refers to as the passage from one physical body to another of the same species or in lower beasts or objects. 6<br/>1.7.2 Hinduism<br/>Like the concept of afterlife, Hinduism is very difficult to define. Laurie Patton rightly noted that “Hinduism” and “Hindu” are notoriously difficult to define, and partly because of this ambiguity these terms have been the subject of much controversy in contemporary debates. In the past two decades alone, Hinduism has been variously called a religion, a way of life, and a construction of colonialism.7However, the term Hinduism is believed to be relatively new in the literature. Its usage has been traced to the British Writers of the early 19th Century who used it to refer to a cumulative tradition of texts and practices of the Indian people that probably date back before the 2nd Millennium B. C. E. Another tradition traced the origin of the term Hinduism to the word Hindu which was initially used by Greek and Persian travellers before the 16th Century to refer to the inhabitants of the Indus Valley. Thus, Hindu (Greek: indoi) was gradually employed by residents of India to distinguish themselves from the Turks. The term later became familiar as a designator of religious ideas and practices distinctive to India rather than its initial ethnic, geographic and cultural usage. 8Furthermore, Hinduism has been viewed by Ninian Smart as a tradition or a collection of them by induction which unlike other world religions lacks a single source of origin.9 Joseph Omoregbe also described Hinduism in a broad sense as the philosophy, religion, and culture of the Indian people.10 As a religious tradition, Joseph Gaer explicitly summarized the central belief of Hinduism as the existence of one Universal Spirit, Eternal Essence, without beginning or end, called Brahma which means World Soul. 11<br/> 1.8 LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>In recognition of the importance of Hinduism as a religion which distinguished itself from Western thought, Ninian Smart, a renowned scholar of Hinduism, maintains that the intrinsic interest in Hinduism is underscored by such concepts as karma and reincarnation which differ significantly from Western philosophy. His article, “Hinduism” in  A Companion to Philosophy of Religion, eds. Philip Quinn and Charles published in 1997 in Cambridge by Blackwell Publishers, pp. 7-15, traced the history of Hinduism and also examined the concept of afterlife which helped in our understanding of Hinduism in chapter one and its notion of afterlife in chapter two respectively. Ninian described Hinduism as a tradition or a collection of them by induction which unlike other world religions lacks a single source of origin p. 7. On the other hand, he viewed the notion of afterlife as exhibiting various forms, such as being reborn from human to insect and so on p. 11.<br/>Furthermore, William Rowe, in his work, Philosophy of Religion: An Introduction, (Fourth Edition), published in Australia by Wadsworth in 2007, presented an illuminating account of what the afterlife consists in Hinduism. In his “life after death in Hinduism,” Rowe noted that human immortality in Hinduism is characteristically trapped in the wheel of rebirth p. 147. He further drew a distinction between the conception of afterlife in Western philosophy and in Hinduism, arguing that the Hindu concept of afterlife does not countenance personal identity and immortality. His thoughts offered a great insight for our discussion in chapters two and four of this work.<br/>Another literature of great import which dealt with the concept afterlife in Hinduism in chapters two and three of this work is the work of Satguru Siva, Hinduism’s Contemporary Metaphysics, published in Hawail by Hinalayan Academy in 1994. In chapter twenty of his work p. 173, on “Life After Death,” Siva examined the nitty-gritty of the notion of afterlife in Hinduism by looking at important concepts such as Soul as well as the process and stages of death and reincarnation. Siva argued that the process of reincarnation ceases when Moksha or liberation has been attained p. 175.<br/>Besides the above, another literature which proved relevant in understanding the history of Hinduism in chapter one and the meaning and usage of various Hindu concepts in other chapters of this work is the article authored by E. O. Oyelade, “Introduction to Asian Religions” in Readings in Religion and Philosophy, ed. E. O. Oyelade, Benin City, Teredia Publications, 2006, 89-98. Like other authors, Oyelade viewed Hinduism as the beliefs, practices and socio- religious institutions of the people known as Hindus p. 89.  He noted that Hinduism unlike most world religions has a complex nature, integrating religious, social, economic, literary and artistic aspects of life p. 90. Also, various Hindu concepts such as Moksha, Yoga, Karma and several others were examined. <br/>In trying to pinpoint the development of the concept of afterlife in Hinduism in chapter two of this work, one work remained outstanding. It is the work by Hopkins Thomas, “Hindu Views of Death and Afterlife” in Perspectives of World Religions, ed. Hiroshi Obayashi, 143-155, Westport Greenwood, 1992. Hopkins examined the historical development of the belief in afterlife and argued that the conception of life after death as it believed today was only a later development of the Vedas. He pointed out that in the earliest Vedas, there was no mention of earthly reincarnation as the destiny of a deceased was believed to be in a new home where a new body would be given to itp. 146. This home was considered to be a gift from “devas,” the kingdom of Yama, god of the dead.  <br/>Again, Joseph Gaer, in his work, What The Great Religions Believe, New York: The New American Library, Inc., dealt with the teachings of Hinduism which were captured in the first three chapters of this work. In chapter two of his book, on “Hinduism, A Fellowship of Faiths” pp. 23-36, Gaer examined the central belief of Hinduism and also explained the concept of soul p. 25.  He equally treated the law of karma and noted that on the basis of this law, only good must come from good and evil from evil p. 27.<br/>Thus far, this chapter has introduced us to the notion of afterlife in Hinduism and also highlighted the main thrust of the issue which this essay sets out to analyze.<br/><b>END NOTES</b><br/>1.

The introduction of Christianity to a society where communal  living has had its root engulfed in traditional beliefs, now having Christians at the fore front of their fundamental beliefs raise a lot of questions. <br/>    It has become so widely proclaimed that it has now become a part of the community that one would think it has been in existence over many centuries. <br/>    The proclamation of the gospel and the proliferation of churches having suppressed the traditional activities of the adherents, who had lost their sense of humanity, gave them a new view and perception. <br/>    The positive impact and the positive value to a community ravaged with poverty and illiteracy. <br/>    The obvious clash of ideologies and culture craving its way in the hearts and minds of the Igbodo people brings about a mutual suspicion on both sides, as presented seemingly justifiable as the people live amongst them are identifiable and visibly real. <br/>    The God being introduced seem not to be empirical or having any physical form nor visible to the human eyes here in lies in defining position that justified the suspicion of resentment and resistance of the Igbodo people. In their thinking and culture, reality must be visible and verifiable.2<br/>1.3    SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>    This research is mainly centered on Igbodo community in Ika Local Government Area.<br/>    The research will give an explicit and intrinsic report on the advent of Christianity in Igbodo society.<br/>    The details given in this work will be based on observation,-research findings. It will also give an appraisal on the lasting effect of Christianity. <br/>1.4    CLARIFICATION OF TERMS <br/>    For the convenient purpose of this study there would be a need to clarify some terms.  <br/>Christianity<br/>The Webster’s Universal Dictionary defines Christianity to be a religion based on the teaching of Christ.3<br/>Effect<br/>The Oxford Dictionary defines effect to be a change produced by an action or cause; impression; state of being operative. <br/>Social impact<br/>The concept social impact means, to have a strong effect on a society or community, it could be positive or negative.4<br/>1.5    AIMS AND OBJECTIVE<br/>    The aims and objective of the research are as follows. <br/>To have a knowledge of the arrival of Christian missionaries and advent of Christianity in Igbodo society. <br/>To examine the impact and effect on the community. <br/>To understanding the role played by the missionaries and individuals of community. <br/>1.6    METHODOLOGY<br/>    The methodological approach of this project is historical and observational. <br/>    The method of approach is a collection of data majorly based on oral interview through personal meetings and communication. <br/>    This thesis emerges out of rigorous investigation and interviews of individuals within several age differences in various fields of life. <br/>    As the research progressed, relevant text pertaining to the subject matter, on interpretations of terms and concept were also consulted and more findings made. <br/>    The bottom linelays in the fact that oral interview which has been well scrutinized and subjected to verification forms and makes up the totality of this project.<br/>1.7    PLAN AND CHAPTERS<br/>    This research consists of five chapters to ensure for a better comprehension and assimilation. Chapter one gives a general introduction of the projecttitle<br/> which includes statement of problem, clarification of terms, aims and objective, methodology, plan and chapters, literature review.Chapter two consists on the historical background of the Igbodo community and the arrival of the Christian missionaries. <br/>    Chapter three consists of the social impact and the effect they had on the Igbodo people. <br/>    Chapter four deals with the culture clashes, reactions of the Igbodo people, experiences of the natives<br/>    Chapter five is the evaluation of the work, recommendation, to the positive and negative effect the influence of Christianity has had on the Igbodo people and also a general conclusion. <br/>1.8    LITERATURE REVIEW <br/>    Although this research is majorly based on oral interviews and observations, it is not without exception to the consultation of some texts to ensure detailed information.<br/>    G.I.C. Eluwa in his book, a history of Nigeria traced the arrival of missionaries to Portugal and in West Africa, subsequently Warri.Similar text like Africa and the wider world since 1800 A.D. by Eluwa, A.D. Nzemeke and E.O. Erhagbe in Nigerians people and culture, gave a similar explanation. National Open University, Christianity in Nigeria sharing the same view. Eqwabor Iduwe”. History of the Ika people, also talked about the geographical location of Ika their beliefs and life practice was also used for research as Igbodo is a part of Ika. E. Bolaji Idowu in his book African traditional religions helped understand the application of some terms in this work within the African context. <br/>    Nigerian studies in religious tolerance by Dr. C.S. Momoh volume 1 in one of the chapter 29 page 360,  trace the advent of Christianity to the Niger expedition, the tolerance of the Africans against the influence of foreign religion.<br/>    Essays in History and Religions by Adebayo Adeogun also traced the Arrival of missionaries from Europe to Benin and Warri   and the structure of religion to natives and their perception. <br/>    Gbolade Aderibigbe also traced the arrival of missionaries similar to Adebayo Adeogun. E.I. Ikenga-Metuh in his book comparative studies in Africa tradition religion also helped for the clarification of some terms in describing the African religion which is not quite different from the Igbodo perspective that is in its application and context. <br/>    S.S. Nwachukwuike, in his book Christianity, culture, and colonialism in Africa talks about the negative influence of the Europeans on the Nigerian culture and also the positive effect the cultural clash and reactions, this book helped for the proper structuring of terms and wordsas regards to my thesis, relating to the Igbodo people. <br/>    E.O. Oyelade in his book Readings in religion and philosophy in a chapter written by Dr. W. Ehianu talks about death in Ika as an activity caused by Witches without Igbodo being an exception. <br/>    The oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary, Chambers 21st century dictionary, Geedes and Grosset, websters universal dictionary and thesaurus also defined certain words and terms which is applicable within this context.    <br/> Endnote <br/>S.S.

His philosophy or theory of education was an offshoot of pragmatism which is seen as the underlying social and intellectual philosophy of the American way of life. <br/>    Apart from his theory of education been an offshoot of pragmatism, Dewey’s philosophy of education was also based on instrumentalism which centres around the individual or individualism. <br/>Thus, pragmatism and instrumentalism bring us into prominence, the importance of the individual because it is he (i.e the individual) who is the carrier of creative thoughts, author of action and its application. <br/>    For John Dewey, the individual are real and they possess freedom that is rightly theirs and to exercise. This is in contrast to the traditional educational system which sees the individual as a part of a significant whole. <br/>For Dewey, the individual is important because of his unique experience of his environment. Dewey’s entire effort as an educationist or educational philosopher was an attempt to show that all of man’s experience and actions take on increased meaning when understood naturalistically and when seen as functions for solving his problem and enriching his life and that of others.<br/>    The traditional system of education was highly criticized by John Dewey because its practice was a system whereby the subject matter of education consist of bodies of information and skill that have been worked out in the past, therefore making the main business or aim of an institution, education centre to be transmitting these old and worked out information, ideas or knowledge or skill to the new generation of individuals or knowledge passively. It involves memorization of factual information and historical classes. <br/>Apart from John Dewey who criticized the traditional system of education, Alfred North whitehead also criticized it. For him, when educating a child, or training a child to activity of thought, we should beware or abstain from what he called “inert ideas” – i.e ideas that are merely, received into the mind without being until loosed, tested or thrown into fresh combinations.1     <br/>    The traditional system of education isolated the subject matter (i.e the students) from active life experiences. Thus, this makes education to be conceived as nothing other than impacting information about remote matter and the conveying of learning through verbal signs. <br/>    The old and worked out ideas, information or knowledge that the traditional system of education transmit to the new generation is what Alfred North whitehead refer to as “inter ideas” for him, this “insert ideas” is useless, not only useless but harmful-corruption option, pessima.2 <br/>    In the contemporary society, the traditional  system of education is what is been followed; this have made students and persons that undergo educational  training  not to possess the essence of education which according to John Dewey is the development of humans or students in order to increase their capacity in solving problems around them, through creative thoughts, active life experiences. <br/>    John Dewey believe that the principal objective of education is to in still in students or individuals the attitudes and habits conducive to the development of their capacity to solve problems. Like the argued in Democracy and education, it requires that classroom emphasis be placed not on arrays of factual information or on inherited ideas presented as settled and accepted but on intelligent method by which such factual information or such ideas are discovered and readily established.3 <br/>    The contemporary society still practice the traditional system of education which in turn will not be able to produce individuals that can be able to tackle problems facing them in the society; which shows the essence of education in life of an individual and to give humanity hope of John Dewey’s theory of education in the contemporary society, the essence of education will be seen, individuals will be properly developed in order for them to be able to tackle and solve problems in the contemporary society. <br/>1.2    The Statement Of The Problem <br/>    The statement of the problem of this work can be said to be that the traditional system of education is unable to produce individuals who will be responsible and competent enough to handle and solve problems in the contemporary society, this is as a result of his method of education. This method Alfred North Whitehead refers to as “inert ideas”.<br/>For Dewey Responsibility is an element of an intellectual attitude which is a disposition to consider in advance the probable consequences of any projected step and deliberately to accept them.4. <br/>    Another problem of the traditional system of education is that it places classroom emphasis on arrays of factual information or inherited ideas which do give the individual opportunity to express his/herself through experience or discovery. <br/>Whitehead in support of the individual acquiring knowledge through his experience says; “from the very beginning of his education, the child shoved experience the joy of discovery. The discovery which he has to make is that general ideas that give an understanding of that stream of events which pours through his life which in turn becomes is life.5 <br/>The traditional system lacking this incentive, makes it not to be acceptable as a system of education.<br/>Finally, the traditional system of education has the problem of having a programmed system, a stereotyped way of conceiving education. This is not ideal. For Dewey, education should not just be a way of impacting knowledge but also a way of expressing such knowledge. <br/>    Thus, with these problems, we are compelled to abandon the traditional system of education and forward to accept a more problem-solving realistic practical and individual oriented system of education – John Dewey’s philosophy of education. <br/>1.3    The Scope Of The Study<br/>    The scope of the study of this work will be restricted to John Dewey’s theory or philosophy of education. <br/>This is not to say that John Dewey did not write on any other aspect  of life or philosophy. It is restricted to this theory as a result of the nature and aim of this work. <br/>    As a philosopher, he write on some aspect of philosophy like ethics, epistemology, Metaphysics and even social philosophy. In order to grasp full knowledge, importance and significance of this work and his educational philosophy, we need to throw tight on other aspects of his though. His educational philosophy, was in fact a unique element of philosophy, though and writings. <br/>1.4    Methodology<br/>    In this work, the method that will be used in order to put this work together is that of critical and conceptual analysis. This methodology will help in analyzing critically and conceptually some basic concepts used in John Dewey’s theory as a whole. <br/>    This methodology will only become achievable with the aid of qualitative  research method through the aid of qualitative research method through the use of archival research, library research and consultancy, resource materials and text books on John Dewey’s philosophy of education, book on education that is similar to John Dewey theory of education. <br/>    With this methodology, the writing and compilation of this work will be brought into reality. <br/>1.5    The Purpose Of The Study<br/>    The aim and purpose of this work is to show the pragmatic value and the practicability of sound education which is lacking in the traditional school system and to use education as a tool for dealing with current situations and problems. Dewey’s educational philosophy is also aimed at recognizing the intimate connection between action and thought, experiments and reflection, thereby leading to the growth, direction and progress of the society. <br/>    Thus, the purpose of this work is to show how relevant and effective Dewey’s educational philosophy can be in the contemporary society which have been infected by the traditional educational system. <br/>    This work is also aimed at increasing the level of individual development in order for them to be able to tackle problems facing the contemporary society. <br/>1.6    The Significance Of The Study<br/>    The significance of this study is to give us a better outlook of education by showing to use the value of individual freedom in learning and to what extent an individual can go in enhancing in growth of the society, i.e if given the freedom and opportunity to learn from his experience and to learn by doing. <br/>    The study is also significant because it will be a worthy step in the direction of fashioning a new basics or foundation for education which is based on freedom of learning on the part of the individual. Freedom here means essentially the part played by thinking which is personal, in learning, its means intellectual initiative independence of observation; judicious invention; foresight of consequence.6<br/>    This study is also seen to be significance because it shows the value of an individual experience as a basics for growth and thereby creating a society of responsible and experienced persons who are ready to take challenges and to face them headlong. <br/>    It is also significant because of the relevant role in the contemporary society in the aspect of education. <br/>A sound and balanced system of education should see education as a child-centered activity which recognizes the depth of intelligence and sense of creativity of children.7 <br/>1.7    Literature Review<br/>    In the course of writing this work, some books, materials were consulted in order to meet the aim of this project work. Some of these books were books written by the philosopher of which this work is centered on, while others were related to the subject matter and idea of the philosopher of which the work is centered on. These books or related literatures are going to be reviewed one after the other. some of them (i.e the books) and related literatures are classic while some are contemporary. <br/>    Firstly, a book written by John Dewey – <br/>Democracy and education – it is an attack on the preparation for life view of education. Here, Dewey explains that it is not of course a question whether, education prepare for the future. But if education is growth, it must progressively realized present possibilities and thus make individuals better fitted to cope with latter requirements.8<br/>So, the mistake for future need but in making in the mainspring of present effort. <br/>    Secondly, a book written by Alfred North Whitehead, “The Aims of Education and Other Essays”. In this book, Whitehead is trying to show the purpose of education which is similar to Dewey’s educational theory which is to stimulate and guide their self – development, the effectiveness of teachers, rejection of dead knowledge which according to whitehead he called it “Inert Idea”.9. <br/>    Thirdly, a book written by J.F Dogle – “Educational Judgements, papers in Philosophy of Education”. <br/>In this book, J.F Dogle asserts that education must engender in the individual disposition of personal autonomy responsibility and a  mastery of relevant forms of life, thought and action. <br/>The writer further suggested that educational relevance is on the one hand a matter of cultivating individual interest and potentialities and on the other hand, a matter of preparing people to engage in genuinely  new forms of life, thoughts and actions. <br/>    Another book reviewed in this work is a book written by John Dewey – “Experience and Education”. <br/>In this book, Dewey reformulated his ideas as a result of his intervening experience with the  progressive schools and in the light of the criticisms of his theories. <br/> Endnotes <br/>A.N.

According to Merriam – Webster Dictionary, Humanism is defineas “a doctrine, attitude or ways of life centered on human interests or values, a philosophy that usually rejects supernaturalism and stress an individual’s dignity and worth and capacity for self – realization through reason1.<br/>    Oxford Advance learner’s dictionary define humanism as, “a rationalist outlook or system of thought attaching prime importance to human rather than divine or supernatural matters”2. However, the term is use with reference to a system of education and mode of inquiry that developed in Northern Italy during the 13th and 14th century and later spread through continental Europe and England alternatively known as Renaissance humanism. <br/>Humanism sought to emphasize on the value and dignity of people. This work is base to investigate into the humanism of some philosophers such as Frantz Fanon and extract in-humanism from his theory of humanism. Nevertheless, this work will crystallize the work of Frantz Fanon during his quest for decolonization in Algeria where he explores the role of violence as the perfect revolutionary weapon in which the colonize man liberate himself from the shackle of colonialism. In Fanon’s work “The wretched of the earth”, he argues that the colonized world is “a world divided into compartments, divided into two to cater for two different species”3.<br/>One would argue that this special divide which seeks to establish boundaries were set up in which the “colonized was localized and positioned and essentially made to perform the role of a foreigner, in his or her own country.4Fanon is of a view that a compartmentalized colonial city perpetuates itself even after a successful independence. He was able to understand the pain of the colonized because of his experience as a psychologist, he understood and pointed out all forms of oppression, that the Negro undergoes and draw their justification from a simply biblical source that allows them to rationalize the lack of humanity in whoever is been oppressed. Thus, in chapter six of Fanon’s book, “Black Skin White Mask”, he presents brief deep psycho-analysis of colonized black people and proposes the inability of black people to fit into the norms (social, cultural, racial) established by white society, and that “a normal Negro child having grown up in a normal Negro family will become abnormal on the slightest contact of the white world”5.<br/>Such an extreme psychological responses originate from the unconscious and unnatural training of black people from early childhood to associate “blackness” with “wrongness” while “whiteness” is considered “virtue” and for Negro to liberate himself from this inferiority complexes, it requires violence that Fanon poised as the perfect revolutionary weapon to escape from colonialism. <br/>1.2        STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS<br/>    Various violent activities against humanity is been projected under the canopy of humanism and such dehumanizing actions are attack on the values and dignity of human. Thus, Frantz Fanon in his work “’The Wretched of the Earth” starts out with a dialectical analysis of violence. His primary concern is the decolonization. He understands colonization to be the substitution of one species of human kind for another that he also referred to as racism. Fanon referenced a work by Aime Cesaire, which compares lynching in America, worldwide discrimination against Jews and the legalization of forced labor in Africa to the action of Adolf Hitler to prove his point that oppression is a universal concept that does not vary its intensity whatsoever. <br/>He also contends that particular segment of a society are not more or less responsible for racism when he paraphrases Francis Jeanson’s statement that, “every citizen of a nation is responsible for the actions committed in the name of that nation”6. Fanon also argued that France is a racist country, which was been revealed in their modus operandi in Africa where they made black to feel inferior and see themselves as been superior. Inferiority complexes usually occur within a fraction of a minority population and those majority populations seldom experiences such complexes. However, in Africa such was not the case, the white minority made themselves superior over the majority black. Fanon reminds us in his work:<br/>in Martinique, there are 200 whites who consider themselves superior to 300,000 people of colour, in South Africa there are two million white against almost thirteen million native people and it have never occurred to a single black to consider himself superior to a number of the white minority.7<br/>    Fanon insists that there is a correlation between the feelings of inferiority experienced by people of colour and the feelings of superiority espoused by whites that in fact “it is the racist who creates his inferior”8. Here, the oppressed individual must either develop feelings of inferiority or remain dependent on the colonizers with all his oppression suffered by the black man. Fanon dream was to rid-off this inferiority complex not by remaining in the place of dependent but by becoming aware of the source of his subconscious conflict and choosing action against its structure or else remaining passive. <br/>    However, Fanon suggested violence as the ultimate weapon for decolonization and for the colonized to liberate himself from the shackles of racism, but this work is to remind Fanon that his advocacy of violence goes against the value and dignity of human and such should not be projected under humanism. <br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>    This work will analyze the condition of the colonial reality and critically analyze an overwhelming numbers of issues drawing from racial formation, identity, decolonization, liberation struggles, language nationalism and violence and the various ways in which it shapes and alters the relationship between the colonizers and the colonized. Thus, crystallizing Frantz Fanon theory of violence, which was his fundamental premise in the quest for decolonization in Africa, Juxtaposing it with the universal theory of humanism and debunking this theory as dehumanizing as it affect humanity.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>    Humanism is a system of thought attaching fundamental importance on human rather than other supernatural matters. It is problematic to describe humanity as purity of thought and rationality as thinking according to absolute rules of inference and then “locate human existence exclusively with in Europe”9. This however runs a “risk of confining and condemning non-Europeans to irrationality or cognitive underdevelopment”10.<br/>    This therefore is a rethinking of humanity in a critical way. Critical humanism entails the rethinking of the problematic of being or existence outside the confines of metaphysics of ‘presencing’ in the Globe. Reflecting on Fanon, it is believe that “each generation must out of relative obscurity discover its mission, fulfill it or betray it”11. As a generation of a disbanded revolution in our underdeveloped countries, this work emphasize the need to continuously question, challenge and resist the neo-liberal technocrat thinking and the legacy of colonialism and also help on the “maturing of the struggle of our lifetime”12.<br/>1.5    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>    The scope of this study is limited to the critical analysis of Frantz Fanon humanism theory. It will also cover Frantz Fanon’s life, works influences and his philosophical belief. <br/>1.6    METHDOLOGY<br/>    The method adopted in the study is a critical analysis of Frantz Fanon’s humanism. Critical analyses here means to “breakdown” Frantz Fanon’s humanism and properly examine his theory of violence carefully in order to extract those actions that are dehumanizing toward humanity in general. To start first, chapter one centers on the general introduction, where we will be looking at the background of the study, the statement of problems, purpose of the study, significance of study, scope of the study, methodology, Clarification of concepts and lastly the literature review. <br/>    The chapter two will center on the background of the theory of humanism, nevertheless we will be looking at the origin and meaning of humanism, nature and importance of humanism, types of humanism, humanist beliefs and tradition, humanist manifestoes and lastly other philosophers view on humanism. <br/>    The chapter three will focus on the critical analysis of Frantz Fanon humanism, his historical background and influence, his concept and types of humanism, the necessity of violence in decolonization and lastly the critique of humanism in the light of Gandhi and Martin Luther King’s non-violence theory. Lastly, chapter four centerson evaluation and conclusion.<br/>1.7    CLARIFICATION OF CONCEPTS<br/>    At this point some words that will be used regularly needs clarification so that there would be no confusion of meaning as the words might have other meaning elsewhere, but in this study, we would tie them to one meaning in respect of this study. We have words like violence, Negro, state, black, white inferiority complex and chauvinism. <br/>1.7.1    Violence <br/>According to Oxford Advance Learner’s Dictionary 8th edition, violence is define as “a behavior involving physical force intended to hurt, damage or kill someone or something”13.This could also mean the unlawful exercise of physical force or introduction by the exhibition of such force. An example of this concept can be point out in Fanon’s work “The wretched of the earth” in the first chapter where he analyzes anti-colonial violence. For him, it was an act of rebirth “the veritable creation of new man”14. Fanon also use the concept of violence also in the first chapter of this same book, where he articulates that “Violence is a cleansing force it frees the native from his inferiority complex and from his despair and inaction, it makes him fearless and restores himself respect”.15<br/>1.7.2    Negro<br/>According to Merriam – Webster Dictionary Negro Means, “a member of a race of human kind native of Africa and classified according to physical features as dark skin pigmentation.16Also, Oxford Advance Learner’s Dictionary defines it as “a member of a dark skinned group of people originally native to Africa South of the Sahara”. The word Negro was first adopt from the mid-16th century from Spanish and Portuguese. It remains the standard term throughout the 17th – 19th centuries and was use by prominent black American campaigner such as W.EB Dubois and Booker T. Washington in the early 20th century. An example of this concept can be crystallize in Fanon’s work “Black Skin White Masks” on the first chapter where he pointed out that, “the negro will become whiter – become more human as he masters the white man’s language”.17<br/>1.7.3    State<br/>According to Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, it is refers to a, “a nation or territory considered as an organized political community under one government”.18<br/>1.7.4    Black<br/>Black in this context refers to the man of black skin i.e. the African man of colour. An example of this concept can be crystallize in the first chapter of Fanon’s work “Black skin white masks” where he affirms that, “The black man is a reaction and since the Negro is appraised in term of the extent of his assimilation, it is also understandable why the newcomer expresses himself only in French.19<br/>1.7.5    White<br/> White in this context refers to the Europeans with white skin i.e. the non-African man. An example this in this context can  be crystallize in the first chapter seven of Fanon’s work ‘Black skin white masks” where he affirms that, “A white man addressing a Negro behaves exactly like an adult with a child and start smirking, whispering, patronizing, cozening.20<br/>1.7.6    Inferiority Complex<br/> According to Oxford Advanced Leaner’s Dictionary. It is refer to ‘’an unrealistic feeling of general inadequacy caused by actual or supposed inferiority in one sphere, sometimes marked by aggressive behavior in compensation’’. This term can also be pointed out in the chapter four of Fanon’s work “Black skin, white masks” where he described the lack of subjectivity displayed by Mannoni, which he believed is responsible for the scholar assumption that; the inferiority complex is something that antidote colonization or put more simply that inferiority complexes are someone inherent to priorities uncivilized people.21<br/>1.8    LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>    Lewis R. Gordon in his “Essay on philosophy and human science’’, manages to revive the importance of Fanon’s existential phenomenology which many critics of both Marxist and post-structuralist persuasion had come to see as an embarrassment. It also represents an extension of Gordon’s earlier work, which revived the Sartrean concept of “bad faith” as a way to talk about anti-black racism. However, it also goes further placing fanon alongside Husserl’s description of the crisis of the human sciences in Europe. In his final chapter, “Fanon’s continued relevance”. Gordon advanced a convincing argument that Fanon’s relentless attack on the murderous nature of European humanism should be read as an attempt not to dispose of humanism “per se”. Rather to bring into existence a new humanism, Gordon argues earlier in his book “man needs to emerge out of the ashes of the fact of his desiccation”21 and concludes that;<br/>Challenge becomes one of radical engagement and attuned relevance he does not mean that the project of constructing or engaging in human science must also be abandon instead in the spirit of Fanon’s call for radicality and originally, the.22<br/>Ato Sekyi – Otu’s ‘‘Fanon’s Dialectic of experience” also breaks new ground by reading Fanon’s text “as though they formed one dramatic dialectical narratives whose principal subject is political experience”.23<br/>    His deployment of this dialectical analysis leads to reading which must strike even those familiar with Fanon’s work as remarkably fresh and exciting. As Sekyi – Otu suggest in his conclusion a careful reading of Fanon’s dramatic ‘’personae” brings us the realization that his texts;<br/>reveals themselves to us not as faithful reports, still less as self-enclosed proposition stamped in each and every occasion with author’s discrete assent and unmistakable imprimatur rather, they are grasped now as enactments of positions assumed stances, staged, claims advanced by typical character in a story of experience .. always as products of the dialectical movement by which the enacted extent or figure is compelled to disclose its incompleteness that fatal short coming of its moral  consequence and thereby made its yield to a vision of suppressed or transgressive possibilities”24.<br/>However, noting a few of Sekyi-Otu’s most significant re-readings of Fanon, motivated by his explicitly Gramscian approach (at one point) he declares that he is “tempted to call Gramsci a precocious Fanonian”25. His brilliant reconsideration of “concerning violence” which as Gordon has pointed out is often cited as a way to reduce Fanon from a complex thinker to a “simplistic prophet of violence”26<br/>It has revealed in the part of this chapter that Fanon’s larger argument about Manicheanism in the colonial situation leaves the colonized in a state, where there is no public or political sphere and no mediation is possible between the rulers and the ruled. In Gramscian terms, a state of pure violence rather than of hegemony fanon is thus suggesting, “with the most classical of political philosophers (Sekyi-Otu cites Aristotle as well as Arendt) that where there is no public space, there is no political relationship, only violence, violence in a state of nature”.27<br/>Equally suggestive is Sekyi – Otu’s interpretation of fanon’s withering attack upon the post-colonial natural bourgeoisie. He recognizes fanon’s position that this bourgeoisie condemns itself to become “a figure of baleful inconsequence” in the post-independenceera. However, reading dialectically he goes on to argue the very fact that Fanon has failed to provide any other candidate for the critical leadership roles in post-colonial society. Stopping to make a persuasive case that fanon is not in fact ready to claim that the peasantry are the most promising revolutionary agents as most readings of “the wretched of the earth” suggested. It revealed fanon to be, “a retrievalist open to the possibility of redeeming role for members of the national bourgeoisie”28.<br/>Stuart Hall in his essay “The After-Life of Frantz Fanon: Why Fanon? Why now? Why black skin white masks? Among others, attempt to put to rest what Hall referred to as the “finding fanon”. Conferenced as the easy and unproductive early or late, young or old, bourgeoisie or revolutionary binary found in most fanon scholarships, insisting that an honest appraisal of his work presents us with; “a radically incomplete fanon who is bound to unsettle us from whichever direction we read him”29.<br/>    Equally significant is Bell Hook’s contribution in ‘’Feminism as a persistent critique of history: What’s love got to do with it? Which takes seriously Fanon’s declaration in  “Black Skin White Masks’’ that ‘today I believe in the possibility of love, that is why I endeavour to trace its imperfecton’30.It offered a searing but ultimately loving critique of fanon for his hemophilia and for the “symbolic matricide’ he commits in “The wretched of the earth”. <br/>    Charles Taylor in his article “The politics of recognition’’, tries to make a case for Fanon as  prophet of the sort of multiculturalism which maintains that, “recognition forges identity and thus the ultimate solution lies in reform of curricular allowing for the inclusion of women, minorities etc”31.But to reduce Fanon’s work to a more request for recognition is to ignore the fact that when Fanon writes about life and death struggle of master and slave, it is real life and real death that are at stake when he protest against the social construction of blackness against racism “Epidermal Schema “. It is with understanding that such construction has the power to kill or at least to sentence certain numbers of society to death. The emphasis on the violent struggles for freedom, the recognition as Gordon put it that, “one cannot give another his freedom, only his liberty”.32<br/>    The statement is central to Fanon’s legacy. The kind of cultural and political works that will continue to be inspire by him needs to maintain this sense of urgency. This brings one to another concern, one that is the flipside of the first that Fanon’s legacy will be reduce to an incitement to violence under all circumstances. <br/>    In Julian J. Samuel’s review of “the fact of blackness”, he suggests that the text has nothing to offer those who wish for a new interpretation of Fanon’s work because it ignores the question of violence while agreeing with this, Samuel points that, “it is impossible to discuss Fanon without discussing the many violence laden Algerians today”. I am not at all certain that Fanon’s central message is violence, it’s the only thing the master listen to nothingelse”33.<br/>    This is one place where Sekyi – Otu’s Gramscian reading is particularly useful. If Fanon’s “concerning violence” addresses a situation where no civil or political sphere exists, where no war of position is possible then indeed violence is the only response. Nevertheless, such a model is hardly transferable to every political situation. For one thing, to use Samuel’s term “The master” are not always the same sets of people. If the reality of too many post-colonial nations has been the same as colonialism. It’s worth noting that the remainder of “The wretched of the earth” is as concerned with the battle that needs to be fought against the emergent national bourgeoisie as it is with the anti-colonial struggle perse. “concerning violence” in other word is meaningless except when read together with “spontaneity” its strength and weakness and “the misadventures of national consciousness”.<br/> End Notes<br/>Merriam – Webster Dictionary 11th Edition (Merriam – Webster Inc. 2003).<br/>p. 1124<br/>Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary<br/>8th Edition of Turnbull and Joanna.(Oxford University Press 2010) p. 539<br/>Frantz Fanon ‘’The Wretched of the Earth’’ (New York: Grove<br/> Weidenfield, 1961)p.30. <br/>Ibid, p. 187. <br/>Frantz Fanon, ‘’Black Skin, White Mask‘’ (New York Grove Press, <br/>1967), p.145. <br/>Ibid, p.91. <br/>Ibid, p.92 - 93.<br/>Ibid, p.93.<br/>Marina Paola, Banchetti – Robino Headly, ‘’Shifting the <br/>Geography of Reason, Gender, Science and Religion‘’ (Cambridge Scholar Publisher 2006), p.7<br/>Ibid, p.8.<br/>Fanon, ‘’The Wretched of the Earth’, p.205. <br/><br/><br/>\n\nIN-HUMANISM OF HUMANISM: A CRITIQUE OF FRANTZ FANON’S HUMANISM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IN-HUMANISM OF HUMANISM: A CRITIQUE OF FRANTZ FANON’S HUMANISM", "id": 131}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>MARXISM AS A HUMANISM : AN EXPOSE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Humanism is any outlook or way of life centred on human need and interest. It is a rational outlook or system of thought attaching prime importance to human (well-being) rather than divine or supernatural matters. It is also a philosophy that usually rejects supernaturalism and stresses on individuals dignity, worth and capacity for self realization through reason. <br/>Marxism is an economic and social system based upon the political and economic theories of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. While it would take veritably volumes to explain the full implications and ramifications of the Marxist social and economic ideology, its also a theory in which class struggle is a central element in the analysis of social change in western societies. Marxism is the antithesis of capitalism. <br/>In as much as Humanism deals with the well-being of the people and because anti-religion usually incorporates the humanist approach, the indication that Marxism is a humanism could be viewed from the fact that Karl Marx in his theory tried to abolish religion as the illusion happiness of the people. For Marx, the purpose of religion is primarily to conceal reality in a veil of decision. Marx exposes the social and political underpinnings of religion which theologians are at pains to conceal. Marx was totally against the using of man as a means to an end (exploitation) which is also an except of what the Humanist approach is against. <br/>What I intend to do, is to evaluatively criticize religion capitalism and other dehumanized economic system because anti-religion usually incorporates humanism and also to discuss or to give an expository account  of Marxism in a humanist approach. The method of approach would be classified as analytical, synthetically and critical in nature. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE: GENERAL INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1    Background of the Study <br/>1.2    Statement of the Problem <br/>1.3    Purpose of the Study <br/>1.4    Significance of the Study <br/>1.5    Scope of the Study <br/>1.6    Method of the Study <br/>1.7    Literature  Review<br/>Endnotes <br/>CHAPTER TWO:HUMANISM <br/>2.1    The Concept of Humanism (The general notion of <br/>    humanism)<br/>2.2    A Historical Analysis of Humanism in Philosophy <br/>2.2.1 Humanism in Ancient Greek Philosophy <br/>2.2.2 Humanism in Medieval Philosophy<br/>2.2.3     Renaissance Humanism <br/>2.2.4     Humanism on the Threshold of Modernity <br/>2.2.5     Humanism and Religion <br/>2.4    Humanism and Terrorism <br/>    Endnotes <br/>CHAPTER THREE: MARXISM AS A HUMANISM: AN EXPOSE<br/>3.1    Karl Marx: Life and Works<br/>3.2    Influences (Karl Marx)<br/>3.2.1     Frederick Engels <br/>3.2.2     Ludwig Von Andreas Feuerbach <br/>3.2.3George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel <br/>3.3    Some major Themes in Marxism<br/>3.3.1     Dialectical Materialism <br/>3.3.2 Historical Materialism <br/>3.3.3 The Class War/Struggle <br/>3.3.4     Surplus value<br/>3.3.5 Alienation <br/>3.4    Marxian Conception of Capitalism as an Anti-Humanistic Concept<br/>3.5    Marxian Conception of religion as an Anti-Humanistic Concept (Socialism against Religion) <br/>3.6    Marxism as a Humanism <br/>    Endnotes <br/>CHAPTER FOUR: A CRITIQUE OF MARXISM AS A HUMANISM<br/>4.1    Effects of the theory of Marxism as a Humanism<br/>4.1.1     A Critique of its Merits <br/>4.1.2     A Critique of its Demerits <br/>4.2    Evaluation <br/>4.3    Conclusion <br/>    Endnotes <br/>Bibliography<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>    Throughout the historical epoch of man’s existence, there has always been a class struggle among men as regards to their engagement in economic activities that are aimed at the maintenance and sustenance of their livelihood. <br/>    Before proceeding on the course of the study, I am compelled to ask: <br/>    Is Marxian – Humanism not just a mere idealism or utopianism? <br/>    Is the true emancipation that comes through communism not another form of exploitation and expropriation of the citizens by the government? Is socialism really unassailable due to the condemnation of capitalism?<br/>    Given (by Marx) that capitalism forces individual to behave in a profit seeking manner, they are in constant conflict with one another and are thus in need of rights to protect themselves. Would the abolishment of capitalism and the embrace of socialism cum communism be realistic or holistically attainable? Can capitalism be totally eradicated? Would the annihilation of capitalism cum religion really solve the problem of mankind? <br/>    Anti-humanist like Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger have the criticism against the humanist concept. <br/>    Nevertheless, the essence of this work centers on Marxism as a humanism. Our focal point would be to give an expose on Marxian- humanism. Humanism is any outlook  or way of life centered on human need, human welfare and interest. This theory attaches prime importance to the wellbeing of humans rather than divine or supernatural matters. This would lead us to posit some crucial questions.<br/>    How did Karl Marx work portray a humanist approach?<br/>    What are the linkage between Marxism and humanism? Can humanism be fused in Marxism? Can they be interwined? <br/>    Marxism is an economic and social system based upon the political and economic theory of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Marx in his humanistic approach clamoured for the annihilation of capitalism in replacement of socialism that would finally synthesize into communism. He was also against the exploitation and expropriation of surplus value of the proletariat. Karl Marx saw capitalism as an ideology and mode of economic system is exploitative, dehumanizing and evil which is rightly an antithesis to the humanist concept. <br/>    Furthermore, one other common goal shared between Marxism and humanism is the kicking against religion. Those who toil and live in want all their lives are taught by religion to be submissive and patient while here on earth and to take comfort in the hope of a heavenly reward.1 Religion justifies the capitalist (Bourgeoisie) of her exploitation and expropriation, giving hope to the working class (proletariat) and selling them at a moderate price ticket to a well-being in heaven. The humanist projected that religion should be independent of the state. If possible people should be atheist but if they still feel out of their volition to embrace religion, it should not be dependent on the state. Religion societies must have no connection with government authority. Everyone must be absolutely free to profess any religion, he pleases or no religion whatever i.e to be an atheist, which every socialist is as a rule. Marx also described religion as the opium of the people.2 <br/>    As a result of these factors serving as impediments against human welfare-well being, Marx proposed what he felt would be a solution to this deplorable condition of the proletariats. One of his solutions was that there should be an annihilation of the capitalist system and an introduction and establishment of a new economic system, he termed communism through socialism. However, he warned that this could only be achieved through a violent and bloody mass revolution. <br/>    In conclusion, from the aforementioned critique on humanism and impediments befalling the concept of humanism by man, our intention would be to point out how Marxism and humanism are intertwined. Also, to evaluatively criticize every policy of the economy that is antithetical to the well being of man-kind. Furthermore, in the course of this research, we would get to know  acquainted if the Marxian – socialism communism is unassailable or his concept is just merely idealistic and utopic in nature.    <br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>    Following the Marxian-humanist approach on the critique of the factors that serve as impediment on the well-being and the welfare of citizens of a given state, we would find out that religion, terrorism, capitalism (class struggle, alienation, surplus value) to mention but a few are part of the factors that infringe on the well being of the people. <br/>    Is it the fact that humanism gives special importance to human concerns, values and dignity, makes this ideology unassailable? That is, it cannot be subjected to questioning?<br/>    Furthermore, another major factor that constitute a setback or an impediment to the well being of people in a state is the presence of capitalism. Capitalism has the vices of alienation, surplus value, exploitation to mention but a few. All these infringes on the welfare of the proletariat (the common man i.e the talakawas), which is rightly against the precept of humanism. Most  of these problems are faced and are evident in the capitalism economies in the world today and also present in a society veiled in the dogma and bigotry of religiosity. <br/>    The questions is: Is Karl Marx corpenican revolution of putting an end to capitalism and making religion independent of the state tenable or actualization, since they are impediments on the well being of the people (citizen)? How certain is it that the government (socialism) would not turn their back against the citizens when power is vested upon them?. Is socialism and communism unassailable? <br/>    Moreover, humanism has been misconstrued over the years. Humanism has been misinterpreted for utilitarianism, utopianism, speciecism, scienticism, naturalism, materialism and physicalism.3 <br/>    However, the situation, plan as I have presented  it expresses itself as the statement of the problem and I shall proceed to the purpose of study. <br/>1.3    THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>    The purpose of this research work is as follows: <br/>    Firstly, it is envisioned to state the features of Marxism in a humanistic approach expositorily.<br/>    Secondly, to write an expose on the impediments of the well being of man. That is, to evaluatively carry out a critique on these impediments and stipulate or propose an ideology that ascribes prime importance to the well being of man-kind. For example; capitalism and religion are part of the major impediments against the well being of man. Also to get a clear-cut picture of how Marx proposed a bloody revolution to eradicated and install communism through socialism. <br/>    Finally, we shall critically analyse Marxim as humanism. If it is deemed fit for what it purports to accomplish. Having thus presented the purpose of the study, I would move on to the next stage of action. <br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>    The significance of this research work, though it seems quite enormous and elaborate, shall be staged out. First of all, it would be used to appraise Marxist ideology over the vast contribution made to mankind in portraying a humanistic approach and also by condemning every infringement on the well-being of man. As well as his proposal for instituting a new economic system to replace capitalism with the aid of socialism and as well for a violent revolution against the dehumanized state of man caused by capitalism, religion and other vices that constitute impediments against the well being of man. <br/>    However, it would also be used as a medium to pinpoint faults involved in the Marxist ideology and his humanist misconception of the potentials embedded in capitalism, religion and other acclaimed/alleged vices. Karl Marx seemed to have had a one-sided view of capitalism and religion which is the negative aspects. What if he had rather than condemn and replace the ideology, sought to have improved it?<br/>    Hence, we shall as well use the medium to give the acclaimed or alleged vice which infringes on the well being of man by man by the Marxian-ideology a ground for self defense and see if it is fit enough to counter the attacks thrown at it by Marx. <br/>1.5    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>    The scope of this essay and research work shall be limited to the humanist outlook of Marxism or Marxian conception of humanism.  Here we shall first give a philosophical  analysis of humanism. Secondly, we shall give serious attention to the concrete analysis and systematic study of10 Karl Marx’s philosophy especially in his appraisal and the clamouring for the well-being of the proletariat against the exploitation and expropriation of the capitalist (Bourgeousie). <br/>    Consequently, we shall look at the factors that contribute to the impediments and infringements on the betterment and well-being of man. <br/>    Furthermore, a conclusion/evaluation, remarks and recommendations shall be made with regards to how tenable or valid Marxian-humanist concept of capitalism religion and other factors that serve as impediment to the well being of man can stand the test of time. <br/>1.6    METHODOLOGY<br/>    As a philosophical study, the methodology for this research work shall be analytical, synthetical and critical in nature. Analytically synthesizing Marxism and Humanism, i.e how they link and correlate with each other. Critically analyzing the impediments infringing on human well being … Eventually, this will bring about a clear understanding of the historical and social analysis of the welfare of man, paying particular attention to Marx’s humanism. <br/>    In as much as these objectives shall have to be accomplished, materials and textbooks to be used for the prosecution of this research work will be obtained from the world wide web, relevant text books, the library, relevant class- notes, as well a s from other obtainable and reliable sources. In so far as there are sufficient and necessary information from them with regards to this research work. <br/>1.7    LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>    The first book reviewed for this research work is “Marx’s concept of man” written by Erich Fromm. In this book, Enrich Fromm analyses Marxism in a humanistic  form. Fromm holds that Marx’s philosophy like much of existentialist thinking, represents a protest against man’s alienation, his loss of himself and his transformation into a thing; it is a movement against the dehumanization of automatization of man inherent in the development of western industrialism.<br/>    The second book reviewed is socialism  and religion. A reproduced text of V.I. Lenin. In this book, Lenin talked about how the present day society is wholly based on the exploitation of the vast masses (the working class) by a tiny minority of the population, the class of the land owners and that of the capitalist. He kicked against capitalism as the economic oppression that engender every kind of political oppression and social  humiliation, the coarsening and darkening of the spiritual and moral life of the masses. <br/>    The third, book reviewed as “The Communist Manifesto” written by Karl Marx, while it was translated by Samuel Moore and Friedrich Engels, exposes Karl Marx’s critique on the dehumanization inflicted on may by the capitalist economy. <br/>    The fourth book reviewed is “socialist humanism” written by Erich Fromm. This book is built primarily upon the early works of Karl Marx, Fromm sought to re-emphasis the idea of freedom, missing from most soviet Marxism and more frequently found in the writings of libertarian socialists and liberal theoreticians.<br/>    The fifth book reviewed as “The radical humanism written by Erich Fromm. A central feature of Fromm’s radical humanism is a rehabilitation of the much abused notion of human nature. Fromm’s work is in a unique position to tease out the revolutionary dimensions of human nature from those deployed in the service of the status quo. <br/>    The sixth book reviewed is “Socrates to Sartoe and beyond”. (A history of philosophy) written by Samuel Enoch Stumpf and James Fieser. They held the view that Karl Marx looked upon ‘history as the product of conflict and relied heavily upon the Hegelian concept of dialectics to explain it.<br/>    The seventh book reviewed is “Marx Engels Marxism’ written by V.I. Lenin. It focuses more on the development of Marxism as a result of the evils of capitalism and how these evils can be remedied by advocating for the introduction of a classes society with equal opportunities and privileges. V.I Lenin, in this book, remarked that capitalism breeds and encourages class distinction which expands the gap between the rich and the poor. <br/>    The eight book reviewed is titled “Economic and philosophic Manuscripts of 1844” written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels and translated by Martin Mulligan . In  this book, Karl Marx pays particular attention to the problem of alienation. According to him, ‘through estrange, alienation labour, the worker produces the relationship to this labour of man alien to labour and standing outside it.<br/>    The ninth book reviewed is “the sane society” written by Erich Fromm. The sane society is continuation  and extension of the brilliant psychiatric concepts Erich Fromm first formulated in Escape from freedom, Fromm examples man’s escape into over conformity and the danger of robotism in contemporary industrial society: modern humanity has, he maintains been alienated from the world of their own creation. Here Fromm offers a complete and systematic exploration of his “humanistic psycho analysis”.    The tenth book reviewed is titled “Dialectics of human nature in Marx’s philosophy” written by Mehmet Tabok. He highlights Marx’s humanism. However, instead of putting Marx’s humanism against materialism, dialectical and historical, this book demonstrates their unity in a novel way. The method employed is exegetical, with an emphasis on Marx’s own dialectic method. <br/>End Notes<br/>1.    V.I.

This project work is expository, scholars have written in favour of the practice of euthanasia, there are also arguments against euthanasia. Discussions on euthanasia usually revolve around medical legal and moral issues geared at determining the extent to which a physician may, feel obliged to acede to the request of the terminally ill patient to bring to a graceful and his/her pain and suffering by assisting the patient to die. In some jurisdictions physicians are statutorily conceded such rights in spite of the Hippocratic Oath. It is discovered that in Africa (Nigeria) appear favourably disposed to the idea of passive euthanasia, active euthanasia. All these are been explained in this work.  <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE: GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>Background of Study                    <br/>Statement of Problem                    <br/>Clarification of Terms                     <br/>Life                                 <br/>Death                             <br/>Euthanasia                         <br/>Physician Assisted Suicide                 <br/>Ordinary Means of Treatment             <br/>Extraordinary Means of Treatment            <br/>1.4    Aims and Objectives                     <br/>1.5      Scope of Study                        <br/>1.6    Literature Review                    <br/>1.7    Methodology                        <br/>1.8    Division of Work                         <br/>Endnotes                              <br/>CHAPTER TWO: GENERAL CONCEPT, ORIGIN AND VARIOUS STRAINS OF EUTHANASIA<br/>2.1    General Concept of Euthanasia             <br/>2.2    Historical Survey of Euthanasia            <br/>2.3    Classification of the different Distinctions within <br/>the concept of Euthanasia                  <br/>2.3.1    The Active/passive distinction of euthanasia     <br/>2.3.2    The Voluntary/involuntary distinction of<br/> euthanasia                              <br/>2.4    The Different Strains of Euthanasia        <br/>2.4.1 Active Voluntary Euthanasia                 <br/>2.4.2 Passive Voluntary Euthanasia            <br/>2.4.3 Active Involuntary Euthanasia             <br/>2.4.4 Passive Involuntary Euthanasia            <br/>Endnotes                             <br/>CHAPTER THREE: THE EUTHANASIA DEBATE<br/>3.1    Arguments for Euthanasia                <br/>3.1.1    The Relief from Extreme Pain             <br/>3.1.2    Human Freewill and Autonomy             <br/>3.1.3    Health care Cost Containment             <br/>3.1.4    The Retention of Human dignity             <br/>3.2    Arguments Against Euthanasia<br/>3.2.1    The Imago Dei Theory (Sanckty of Life)        <br/>3.2.2    The Abuse and Misuse of Euthanasia <br/>(Slippery Slope Argument)                <br/>3.2.3    The Utilitarian Appeal of Society            <br/>3.2.4    The Principles of Beneficence and non-magnificence <br/>of the Physician                        <br/>    Endnotes                             <br/>CHAPTER FOUR: GENERAL AFRICAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE, DEATH AND AFTER-LIFE<br/>4.1    The Meaning and Value of Life among the Africans <br/>4.2    Rites of Passage and Their Importance            <br/>4.3    The African Concept of Death            <br/>4.3.1    The African Conception of a good death            <br/>4.3.2    The African Conception of a Bad Death            <br/>4.4    The Relevance of Good Death                <br/>4.5    The African Conception of After-life             <br/>4.6    Euthanasia and the African Culture             <br/>4.6.1    The Literal Level of (A Good Death)             <br/>4.6.2    The Connotative  Level (Mercy Killing)             <br/>    Endnotes                            <br/>CHAPTER FIVE: EVALUATION, RECOMMENDATION AND CONCLUSION <br/>5.1    Evaluation                            <br/>5.2    Recommendations                     <br/>5.3    Conclusion                         <br/>    Endnotes                             <br/>    Bibliography                         <br/>CHAPTER ONE: GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/>    The concept “Euthanasia” is a not entirely a new one. As Euthanasia has ranged over a long period of time Euthanasia is a “good death” has evoked various questions as relating to the value of human life, the question of the morality of its practice, the legal question of an individuals right to both life and death etc.1 <br/>    These questions are more raised about the issue of euthanasia are not new, yet euthanasia has been debated most fiercely in contemporary times, because of the advances made in the fields of medicine and science. However, this debate has ensued mainly from a western perspective and one or two religions standpoints such as Christianity (e.g the Roman Catholic Church).<br/>    The Africans as any other race of the world have beliefs central to their culture and existence. This is especially so, when it pertains to matters of life and death. As the concept “euthanasia” literally means “Good Death” from its Greek translation, what a “good death” connotes must be sufficiently examined from various worldviews as has been done with the West. More specifically, it must be examined, what the African conceptions of a good death is whether the concept of euthanasia as a “good death” concurs with the African understanding of a “good death”. <br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>    The concept of Euthanasia is known to literally translate as “good death” from the greek words “eu” and “thanasia”. Thus euthanasia has initially been perceived from the western perspective as its earliest recorded origins are like wise western. However, the practice of euthanasia involves human death which cuts across all races of men. Though its debate has began in the west it must not necessarily end there. <br/>    The problem of this study involves appraising the issue of euthanasia from a new light, the African perspective to discover new facts of euthanasia and its ensuring problems. <br/>What does the African conceive as a good death? Is the practice of euthanasia reconcilable with African traditional beliefs? What are the effects of euthanasia in an African society and like wise other societies? These questions basically constitute the problem of this study, euthanasia and African culture, a religions philosophical appraisal. <br/>1.3    CLARIFICATION OF TERMS<br/>    In this study, it is pertinent that certain  terminology be listed and properly explained as they are not only inescapable within the study but quite relevant for better understanding of what is being discussed in the study. <br/>    These distinctive terms include life, death, euthanasia, physician assisted suicide, ordinary means of treatment. Other terminology unique to this study such as the various strains of euthanasia will be duly defined and explained as they appear within this study. <br/>1.3.1    Life<br/>    The Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary of current English defines life as “the ability to breathe, grow, reproduce etc which people, animals and plants have before they die and which objects do not have.2 Clearly life is a form of existence, consciousness or an ability to live. As a form of existence, active existence and passive existence may both be distinguished between. <br/>    Active existence is believed to connote the feature of consciousness which is “the state of being able to use your senses and mental powers to understand what is happening”.3 Passive existence on the other hand is strictly mere existence without notable activity. An example of a passive form of existence in humans is the state of coma one may assume that “life” as referred to in this study is synonymous with “Active Existence”.<br/>    In the case, it remains an accepted fact that humans are capable of exhibiting life.  However, it is necessary that the issue of life not be confused with that of “quality of life”. <br/>1.3.2    Death<br/>    Death is the termination of human physical life.4 It is a natural part of the cycle of life.  However uncertain man may be of his destiny or what life has in store him, he remains certain of one constant and that is death. This unavoidable event death ha several definitions depending upon what perspective it is being discussed from. The question of death’s definition has medical legal, theological and philosophical dimensions.5<br/>    From medical dimensions, physicians initially had a shared option of death. When spontaneous respiration and heartbeat ceased, the person was dead.6 Death was then believed to have occurred. This is now commonly referred to as a clinical definition of death. Due to advances in modern medicine, such a state is now possibly reversible in some cases by resuscitation. There are now more definition of death such as the cardiac – oriented definitions whole brain definition and higher brain oriented definition. <br/>    The more common of these definitions which is the higher brain oriented definition of death states that:   <br/>“Individuals are dead when they have irreversible lost all higher functions of the brain (usually defined as all capacity for consciousness).7<br/>Nevertheless, this is a modern medical definition of death. According to Patricia Mann, author of meanings of death, in different times and different cultures death means different things.<br/>1.3.3    Euthanasia <br/>    Euthanasia is the intentional killing by act or omission of a dependent human being for his or her alleged benefit.8 This definition though common is nevertheless insufficient to explain the various forms, strains and aspect of the act of euthanasia. <br/>    Hence, the definitions of euthanasia are categorized mainly in two ways “euthanasia by consent” and “euthanasia” by means. Euthanasia by consent could be calibrated as voluntary euthanasia and involuntary euthanasia, depending upon the position of the patient. On the other hand, euthanasia by means is calibrated into passive euthanasia or active euthanasia depending upon the role played by the physician. <br/>    When the voluntary involuntary distinction is combined with the active passive distinction four types of euthanasia result. <br/>Active  voluntary euthanasia <br/>Passive voluntary euthanasia <br/>Active involuntary euthanasia <br/>Passive involuntary euthanasia<br/>1.3.4    Physician Assisted Suicide<br/>    Physician assisted suicide is believed to differ from euthanasia among certain people. Thus, the need to state the distinction of physician assisted suicide from euthanasia. In physicians assisted suicide, the physician may provide the patient with the means to end his or her life, but the patient performs the lethal act himself or herself.10 For example, it would be a case of physicians assisted suicide of the patient dies after swallowing an over dose of a lethal drug provided by his/her doctor for the purpose of causing death. <br/>    Physicians assisted suicide need not be distinguished from euthanasia as “the basic issue is still premature patient death, whether physicians assisted or self-inflicted.11<br/>1.3.5    Ordinary Means of Treatment<br/>    Treatment is medical care expected to produce benefits.12 There’s however exists a distinction between what is commonly referred to as an ordinary means of treatment and an extra-ordinary means of treatment. <br/>    Paul Ramsey, a leading theological ethicists says of ordinary means of treatment. <br/>“ordinary means of preserving life are all medicines, treatment and operations, which offer a reasonable hope of benefit for the patient and which can be obtained and used without excessive expense, pain and other inconveniences”.13 <br/>    Over a period of time, the connation of what is referred to as ordinary means of treatment has evolved and thus, been misconstrued. The word “ordinary” seems to have been juxtaposed with words such as ‘common or simple’. This is an incorrect assumption as an uncommon mode of treatment may be conceived as an ordinary means of treatment. Ordinary means of treatment simply mean “morally required (treatment) even if the treatment is very unusual and/or high tech.14 <br/>    Figuring out how complex or simple a treatment is does not help in determining whether is it morally imperative (thus, an ordinary means of treatment).15 What matters then, in determining whether to provide in treatment to an incompetence patient is not a prior determination that this treatment is likely to provide this patient benefits that are sufficient to make it worth-while to endure the burdens that accompany the treatment. <br/>1.3.6    Extraordinary Means of Treatment<br/>    Extraordinary means are all medicines treatments and operations which cannot be obtained or used without excessive expense, pain or other inconvenience, or which if used would not offer a reasonable hope of benefit.17 In other words, this kind of treatment is referred to as extraordinary not because it is special or different rather because it has little or no impact on it’s attempt t alleviate suffering or pain. It however, may prolong the event of death for a limited period of time.18 <br/>    Thus, extraordinary means of treatment connotes,  “morally expendable , even if it is very common and/or technologically simple extraordinary means of treatment are expected to produce benefits that are less than harms or no greater than harms.20<br/>1.4    AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>    The aims and objectives of this study are clear out and precise. They are duly outlined as follows; <br/>To present the concept of euthanasia as both a theory and practice in  a distinctively  clear fashion without bias. <br/>To discover what is the generally accepted African conception of a good death (i.e euthanasia). <br/>Thus, bringing forth the African contribution to this age old yet important debate of euthanasia which globally affects man and his existence. <br/>To critically examine euthanasia as it is modernly perceived with  the back light of African traditional beliefs and cultures <br/>Lastly, to assert, if euthanasia as a practice is reconcilable with African culture and if not proffer reasons behind this impasse while suggesting practicable recommendations. <br/>1.5    SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>    In this study, Euthanasia and African culture, A religious philosophical appraisal” it is imperative to outline what exactly its scope is as the issue of euthanasia is both broad and inexhaustible. Certain areas will therefore be focused upon to prevent this study from being rendered in adequate.<br/>    This study will include a basic appraisal of what is generally conceived as “euthanasia, its generally conceived as “euthanasia, its history practice and implications from diverse dimensions such as the medical legal, religions and socio-economic dimensions. This shall be done following the clarifications of relevant terminology to the study. Most importantly, this study shall further examine euthanasia as the “good death” out from the much needed perspective of the African and their cultural backlight.<br/>    The African concept of a “good death” shall be outlined and properly explained thus putting “euthanasia” in a new light. The African concepts of life, death, afterlife and good death shall be adequately explicated to truly present a philosophical appraisal of euthanasia in relation to African culture. <br/>1.6    LIMITATIONS OF STUDY<br/>    In an effort to present this work from being rendered redundant, its limitations are thus outlined. This study shall not include case studies of instances where euthanasia in any of its forms has been practiced also, in this philosophical appraisal of euthanasia, and existing distinctions between euthanasia and physician assisted suicide, shall be diminished “for purposes of understanding the moral vision and values at stake in the euthanasia debate.21<br/>    In highlighting the African account of related issues to a “good death” such as that of life and death, the general beliefs or opinions shared by Africans shall be divulged. Singular African cultures the common and general features reflected by the majority of African cultures shall be outlined. <br/>1.7    METHODOLOGY<br/>    This study, “euthanasia and African culture, a religion philosophical appraisal” shall employ an electric form of methodology that will consist of the methods of conception clarification, historical analysis and critical analysis. The tools of both archival and internet research shall also be applied. <br/>    Conceptual clarification shall be applied in the definition of relevant terms of the study such as that of life, death physician assisted suicide, euthanasia and its various forms as well as strains (eg active voluntary euthanasia, passive voluntary euthanasia, active involuntary euthanasia and passive involuntary euthanasia). The application of history analysis is particularly apt for the presentation of a historical survey of euthanasia, its origin and evolution through the ages. <br/>    Finally, after presentation of facts of African cultural beliefs as relating to the study euthanasia and its major arguments, both for and against its practice, the method of critical analysis will be engaged to examine and evaluate if there exist any contrast between the western and African conceptions of a “good death” (i.e euthanasia) and if the practice of euthanasia can be reconciled with African culture and their traditional beliefs. <br/>1.8    DIVISION OF WORK <br/>    This study entails five chapters within which specific areas have been set to impact certain knowledge. The first chapter naturally is a general introduction inclusive of a statement of problem, clarification of all relevant terminology, scope and limitation of study, aims and objectives of study and the study methodology. <br/>    The chapter two will be presentation of the shared beliefs of Africans on issues of life, death (i.e a good and bad death), afterlife, rites of passage from birth to death etc. All these shall be duly elaborated upon. <br/>    The concept of euthanasia, its historical origin and evolution over the years, its major distinctions and various strains will be delivered into in the third chapter of this study.  <br/>    Chapter four shall mainly be an outline of the euthanasia debate, arguments that have been put forth both in support and against its practice. These arguments are reflections of medical, legal, religious and socio-economic systems of thought. <br/>    The fifth chapter though the final is in no case the lease relevant of the listed chapters. In essence it shall entail an evaluation of the study, recommendations as well as a conclusion of the study. <br/> ENDNOTES<br/>J.k. Mason, G.T. Laurie and M.

This struggle is the reason for change to come and in its practical approach, it lead to revolution. <br/>Revolution means change in its literary context but more of a system succeeding anther one in Marxist socio-economic system. This expresses how an oppressive system of exploitation in capitalism is transformed to a socialist system through the power of the working class by seizing control of economic power from the capitalist. This approach has been helpful in France and its Paris commune which set the pace of revolutionary reality of Marxist postulation before Russia, Poland, China, Cuba etc. took it. The yearning for more of this is in progress as many still put their faith in Marxism as the hope of common masses. <br/> TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE: GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>Background of Study                        <br/>The Statement of Problem                    <br/>1.3    The Purpose of Study                        <br/>1.4     The Scope of Study                            <br/>1.5    Methodology     <br/>1.6    Conceptual Analysis                        <br/>1.7    Literature Review                            <br/>Endnotes                              <br/>CHAPTER TWO: MARXIM AND THE THEORY OF SOCIAL CHANGE<br/>2.1    Karl Marx and Marxism <br/>2.2    Theory of Social Change in Marxism <br/>2.3    Marx’s Analysis of Capitalism <br/>2.4    Revolution as Historical Necessity <br/>    Endnotes <br/>CHAPTER THREE: CRITICAL AND HISTORICAL ASSESSMENT OF MARXIAN REVOLUTION <br/>3.1    Proleterianism as a vehicle of Change<br/>3.2    Some Marxian Revolution in World History <br/>3.3    Communism and it utopian Stance <br/>3.4    Importance of Existential Marxism above <br/>Structure Marxism <br/>    Endnotes <br/>CHAPTER FOUR: RECOMMENDATION AND CONCLUSION <br/>4.1    Recommendation <br/>4.2    Conclusion<br/>    Bibliography <br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    The Background of Study<br/>    Marxism is a worldview and a method of societal analysis that focuses on class relations and societal conflict, that uses a materialist conception of historical development, and dialectical view of social transformation. Marxist methodology uses economic and sociopolitical inquiry and applies that to the critique and analysis of the development of capitalism and the role of class struggle in systematic economic change. Marxism encompasses an economic theory, a sociological theory, a philosophical method, and a revolutionary view of social change. Marxism builds on a materialist understanding of societal development, taking as its starting point the necessary economic activities requires to satisfy the material needs of human society. <br/>    According to Marxist theory of social change, class conflict within capitalism arises due to intensifying contradictions between highly productive mechanized and socialized production performed by the proletariat, and private ownership and appropriation of the surplus product in form of surplus value (profit) by a small minority of private owners called bourgeoisie. As the contradiction becomes apparent to the proletariat, social unrest between the two antagonistic classes intensifies, culminating in social revolution. The eventual long-term outcome of this revolution would be the establishment of socialism which is empowered by the “dictatorship of the proletariat.1 No wonder Marx explained in “the communist manifesto2 that national differences and antagonism between people are daily more and more vanishing, owing to the development of the bourgeoisie to freedom of commerce, to the world market, to uniformity, in the modern of production and in the condition of life corresponding thereto; the supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish faster. Also in the poverty of philosophy”3, Marx made known this same point that the working class, in the course of development will substitute for the old bourgeoisie society, an association which will preclude classes and their antagonism, and mere will be no more political power proper, since political  power is precisely the official expression of class antagonism in burgher’s  society. Hence socialism is a socioeconomic system based on cooperative ownership of the means of production, distribution based on one’s contribution, and production organized directly for use. <br/>    Karl Marx further hypothesized that, as the productive forces and technology continued to advance, socialism would eventually give way to a communist stage of social development. Communism  would be a classes, stateless, humane society erected on common ownership and the principle of “from each according to his ability to each according to his needs.<br/>1.2    The Statement of Problem<br/>    Although there has been an exposition through the background of study, there is not much awareness concerning what constitutes the theory of social change within the society. Also there is not much consciousness about the role and impact of revolution since the term “revolution” is commonly perceived as violence and destructive, not beneficial for human society. Hence there exist much misconceived notion pertaining  to this study  that needs much enlightenment. It is on this basis that this research work seek to fill the vacuum which is yet to receive the attention of scholar with misconceived notions. <br/>1.3    The Purpose of Study<br/>    The purpose of this research work is simply to vividly express the notion of social change in the society and how the idea of revolution partake within to create a qualitative transition which will lead to an atmosphere of benefits for all the working people. Moreover, this research work seeks to instill senonsness and awareness about the idea of revolution in today’s world which is still filled and consumed  with economic exploitation.<br/>1.4    The Scope of Study<br/>    The study covers majorly on the Marxist theory of social change in relation to revolution. Despite the facts that the work is divided into four chapters, it covers strategic areas. The first chapter gives a brief on how the research work will be achieved together with it purpose. The second chapter delves into Marxism and the theory of social change itself. The third chapter discuss in details the critical and historical assessment of Marxist revolution while the fourth chapter consist of the recommendation and conclusion. <br/>1.5    Methodology <br/>    For the success of this research work, the method of critical  assessment in conjunction with historical appraisal would be adopted. <br/>1.6    Conceptual Analysis<br/>    Dictatorship of the proletariat, this refers to a state in which the proletariat (workers) has control of political power which must be understood within the context of historical materialism . <br/>    Burgher, though an archaic and humorous term, it means a citizens of a town or city, typically, a member of the wealthy bourgeoisie. <br/>1.7     Literature Review<br/>    The first book reviewed for this work is “the communist manifesto” written by Karl Marx and Engel. It was commissioned by the communist league and published in London. It was later recognized as one of the world’s most influential political manuscripts, presenting an analytical approach to the class struggle (history and present) and the problem of capitalism and the capitalist mode of production. It also briefly features their idea on how the capitalist society of the time would eventually be replaced  by socialism and then finally communism through revolution. In this book, Marx exposed the long chain of the development of the human epoch throughout history  and the injuries which the bourgeoisie has inflicted  upon his society. According  to Marx, “the bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil and has reduced the family relation to mere money relation.4 <br/>    The second book reviewed for the study is “state and revolution” written by Vladmir Lenin. It describe the role of the state in society, the necessity of proletariat revolution and theoretic inadequacies  of social democracy in achieving  revolution to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. The book is relevant to this study since it describes the inherent nature of the state as a tool for class oppression, a creation born of a social class desire to control the other social classes of its society when politico- economic disputes cannot otherwise be amicably resolved, if a dictatorship or a democracy, the state remains the social-control means of the ruling class. The ruling class never relinquish political power even in a democratic capitalist republic, hence communist revolution is the sole remedy for such demagogy. Lenin  declared that the task of the revolution is to smash the state in order to undergo an advance condition of decomposition. As he said” the supersession of the bourgeoisie state by the proletarian state is impossible within a violent revolution”.5 <br/>    The third book reviewed is “Das Kapital” written by Karl Marx the book is a critical  analysis of political economy with the aim to reveal the economic pattern underpinning the capitalist mode of production. It unveiled the motivating force of capitalism (which is exploitation of labour) as the employer is able to claim right to profit since he owns the productive capital asset which are legally protected by the capitalist state through property rights. The relevance of this book to this research study is that it reveals the contradiction of capitalist mode of production, how it was the precursor of the socialist mode of production and of the class struggle rooted in the capitalist social relation of production. <br/>    The fourth book reviewed is, “Marx Engels Marxism” written by V.I Lenin it focuses more on the development of Marxism as a result of the evils for capitalism and how these evils can be remedied  by advocating for the introduction of classless  society with equal opportunities and privileges. V.I Lenin, in his book, remarked that capitalism breeds and encourages class distinction which expands the gap between the rich and the poor. According to him, “our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie possess, however, this distinct features, it has simplified the class antagonism. Society as a whole is more and more spitted into two great hostile classes directly facing each other; bourgeoisie and proletariat.6 Hence we can recognize that the author of this book emphasizes that the matter of the conflict arising from the dissatisfaction of the working class is and would remain a major course of the change in history. <br/>    The fifth book reviewed is, “Socrates to Satre  and beyond: a history of philosophy”, written by Samuel Enoch Stumpf, and James Fieser. They held the view that Karl Marx looked upon “history as the product of conflict and relied heavily upon the Hegelian concept of dialectics to explain it.7 hence we can deduce from their point of view that Karl Marx makes use of Hegel’s dialectics to explain the different epochs of history and as well his focus on capitalism, his core problem. <br/>    The sixth  book reviewed is, “philosophy made simple”, written by Richard H. Popkin and Aurum Stroll. In this book, proper attention was made to Karl Marx political philosophy as regards his critique of capitalism. According to them, Marx predicted the coming of classless society and that Marx’s attack upon capitalism is based upon a careful descriptive amount of how capitalist societies have worked”.8 <br/> Endnotes <br/>V.I Lenin, The State and Revolution, (Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1949), p.82.<br/>K.

A Greek philosopher once said, let no one when young delay to study philosophy nor when he is old grow weary of this study for no one can come too early or too late to secure the health of his soul. This statement was made during the social and political upheaval in Greece. The situation is true of C.A.C today when social change is equally rapid and life is no more bearable for most C.A.C families. It is important to think for oneself, examine ones beliefs, tradition and habit to deal with new problems and draw new solutions. Today, if one fails to think for oneself, someone else will think for one. This write-up is out to aid the thinking of C.A.C as touching the issue of the causes and effects of the conflicts within the organization. More so, this write-up is divided into five chapters which recognize an orderly, regular research. To start with first chapter that is based on introduction, statement of problems, objective of the study, clarification of terms, scope and limitation and methodology. The second chapter examines the advent of Christianity in Nigeria, founding of Christ Apostolic Church and the organization of the church. The third chapter deals with the causes of the conflicts within C.A.C: explained and unexplained reasons. Research method, this chapter deals with the method and procedure used in carrying out this study. The fourth chapter involved the effects of the conflict; positive and negative effects, result presentation and analysis. The last chapter suggests the solution and conclusion. Analysis, the researched intend to use simple percentage to analyze the data. This will be used to test the hypotheses. Primarily this research is carried out for the change and betterment of C.A.C. and as a reference point to the coming generations. Conclusively, it is hoped that it will be of great gesture for members and workers and leaders of C.A.C who have the patriotism for Christ Apostolic Church.<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>Divisions, schisms and dissensions have been a characteristic feature of the church right from its infancy. But the fact still remains that Christianity divided is an abnormality. This division contradicts the will Jesus Christ who prayed as follows; “I do not pray for these only, but for those who believe in me through their words, that they might all be one” (Jn. 17:20 RSV.).<br/>The earliest indication of divisive tendency in Christianity dates back to the Apostolic Age. The contention between Paul and Barnabas over acceptance of John Mark for the second missionary journey was the first. This was sequel to the John Mark’s abandonment of the Apostles during the first journey though the parted ways, it was short lived.<br/>The second sign of division took place in the Corinth, Paul was not happy with the divisive tendency in the Corinthians church, hence he wrote to Condemn the stance of some who claimed that they belong to Paul, Apollos and Cephas or Christ’s party. He ended by declaring “surely Christ had not been divided among you” .<br/>Thereafter no more was heard of the quarrel. The above illustration show unmistakably that the apostles did not encourage division among the Christians.<br/>Of great significance to us is the division that lasted to this day as a result of the conflict within Christ Apostolic Church. The Christ Apostolic Church is reputed to be of one Lord, in collaboration with the motto “one fold one shepherd” any other cause other than for which it was intended is an aberration.<br/>It was an attempt to satisfy mordinate ambition of some leaders. The shaltering of the unity of Christ Apostolic Church is a big scandal. Any good member should hide his face in shame for the unfortunate development. Our interest is not that of apportioning blame or pointing accusing finger to any group, but that of putting it clearly and unmistakably terms that division in Christ Apostolic Church was not originally intended. They claim that the conflict has been very useful to the cause of Christianity is to beg the issue.<br/>Division was not originally ordained by Christ otherwise he could not have prayed the highly priestly prayer. “I do not pray for these only but also for those who believe in me through their words, that they may all be one”.<br/>It is unfortunate that inspite of the prayer the church still broken into ministries such as WORD SOUL WINNING EVANGELICAL MINISTRY (WOSEM) e.t.c. It is pertinent to mention here that evangelical revival of late 1970s by Prophet T.O. Obadare resulted into a ministry called WOSEM.<br/> 1.1    STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS <br/>        On the topic-conflict within Christ Apostolic Church, there are papers on conflict within C.A.C. which are written by various scholars and clergymen, I have read some notable papers presented by eminent scholars which treated some issues about the conflict going on within C.A.C. There is a booklet published by C.A.C. information department titled “Beginning of correction in C.A.C. and the likes. But this work focuses on conflict within C.A.C. causes and effects.<br/>        The following questions will serve as sub-problem around which the study will be formulated and serve as guide to the discussion in the later chapters.<br/>What are the people’s views towards conflict? Some approved of it while some view it as evil and barrier to development. Other people felt and saw it as mixed blessings-blessing in disguise. But the question is; Is conflict good or evil?<br/>How far has the conflict within C.A.C. influenced other churches? Has it really influenced them positively or negatively?<br/>Are there problems or evils which the conflict within C.A.C. has posed to the church?<br/>Is conflict within C.A.C not causing disunity and discord among members of the church?<br/>Is there any solution to the causes and effects of the conflict within C.A.C.?<br/>The project in conclusion will suggest ways and proffer solutions on how to  make effective use of conflict within C.A.C. not necessarily apportioning blame on various groups that supported or not in support of conflict within the church. Conflict has its own merits and demerits and cannot relatively and absolutely be condemned, since we are looking at it in an objective view.<br/>1.2    THE OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>        This project is aimed at showing the settling down of the mission founded churches in Nigeria through the effort of missionaries such as the CMS, church missionary society, Roman Catholic Mission, Methodist society, Baptist church e.t.c. it traces the rise of independent churches and the founding of CAC.<br/>        Looking at CAC today, one would wonder where CAC is heading to, CAC is still far from the prayer of our lord Jesus Christ “that they might all be one” having this at the back of my mind, a critical look will be given to the reasons for conflict in CAC but to give a sort of general view of the causes and effects.<br/> 1.3    CLARIFICATION OF TERMS <br/>        For the purpose of this study, there is need to have a working definition, some words needs to be defined, these includes: conflict, Christ, Apostolic and Church.<br/>Conflict: The word conflict as given by various dictionaries seems to be similar in meaning according to their definitions. Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary defines conflict as “struggle, controversy, opposition, differences and clash. Therefore conflict within CAC is concern with serious disagreement in the church through the establishment of some ministries and position consciousness in CAC.<br/>Christ: The Oxford Advance Learner’s Dictionary defines Christ as a name given to Jesus, the founder of Christianity, the anointed one. It is a name emphatically placed on the coming Messiah foretold in the old testament, perhaps the most notable prophecy being in Isaiah 9 vs 11. He was to be of the house of David, justice and righteousness never ending would be established on his coming. This was not universally accepted. There are many unbelievers throughout their lives. The believers accepted him as the son, the second member of the trinity, meaning (the anointed one) the Messiah, the one foretold, Christ Jesus, His complete acceptance of himself as the son of God had it influence in winning many doubters, the incomparable preaching and the power of His preaching influence constantly increasing members of mankind.<br/>The Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary defines apostolic as the apostles or their teaching. The words appears about 80 times in the N.T limited to certain men of the first generation of the church and missionaries of the gospel. The first twelve apostles sent out by Jesus are named in MK. 3:14-19 and elsewhere Paul, James, Barnabas, Mathias and in some grouping Junias, Andronicus and Silvanus, subsequently many claimed the title which the church desire to limit to those who had seen Jesus and had firsthand knowledge called the signs of apostle and were fully committed to the church.<br/>Church: The word church here may be used interchangeably as “denomination” which means religious class or group. The churches which are in plural form can be use to designate denominations.    <br/>The word church as various definitions and usages. In essence it is very ambiguous to define. Nevertheless here are some definitions and usages. The World Book Dictionary defines church as building for public Christian worship or religious services. The World Book Dictionary seem to have given a lay idea of the church. The word church has undergone many changes and therefore has many connotations. The Scottish word “kirk”, the German word “kirche”, the Dutch “kerk” are derived from the Greek word “kryriankan” meaning the Lord’s house, another Greek word “ekklesia” signifies in classical Greek, the assembly of the citizen of a city for legislative or deliberative purposes. The Greek word “ekklesia” has no religious usage. It was adopted LXX to render the Hebrew work, kahal which the Hebrew word “edah” signifies in later Hebrew “the religious assembly of the Israelites”. These two words were adopted for local religious assembly of jews who lived outside Jerusalem. Trace into the New testament, the word first applied to the Ekklesia of Jerusalem which was of all those who believed in Jesus Christ, and this was the legitimate successor of the Israelites assembly of Yahweh. In essence, the church is the body of Christ, not the building, but the people of God, gathered unto God.<br/>1.4    SCOPE AND LIMITATION<br/>        During the course of the study, we will examine how far the church (CAC) has encountered conflict especially in this previous decade. Why has Apostolic Church been conflict in an alarming rate within our days. The essay is not aimed at listing various conflict in CAC but to analyze the causes and effect.      <br/> 1.5    METHODOLOGY <br/>        In carrying out this study, several methods will be adopted. I have consulted various works written on the topic and those written in relationship with the topic.<br/>In addition, field investigation for articles, pamphlets, journals and unpublished materials were made use of from observations we have always inquired people’s opinion on the conflict within CAC. Moreover I have attended prayer meetings that stress on the issue. Conclusively, I have made use of my experiences as a member to gather materials for this research work.<br/><br/><br/>\n\nCHRIST APOSTOLIC CHURCH: THE CAUSES, EFFECTS AND SOLUTIONS TO THE INTERNAL CONFLICT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CHRIST APOSTOLIC CHURCH: THE CAUSES, EFFECTS AND SOLUTIONS TO THE INTERNAL CONFLICT", "id": 135}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>RELIGIOUS CONFLICT AND ITS EFFECT ON EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN OORELOPE LOCAL GOVERNMENT, IGBOHO, OYO STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The study examined the effect of religious conflict in Nigeria in relationship to its impact on educational development of the country, using Oorelope Local Government area as the population sample of the study. The work adopted descriptive research method, making use of questionnaire for data collection. It was discovered from the findings that religious conflict has been prompted out by various factors such as tribalism, resources control, religious and land disputes, Trader related dispute and other factors, which affect the educational development of the country in many ways as discussed in the study. However, in effort to provide an adequate and appropriate solution to the problem, the study recommended that, there should be religious tolerance and mutual unity among the various religious leader should teach and  practice common virtues such as justice, compassion, kindness and respect for the religious tenets or beliefs of other people.<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>Background to the Study<br/>Nigeria is majority populated by the adherents of Islam, Christianity and African traditional religion, however, the adherents of the three religions, especially Muslims and Christian are often engaged in conflict, leading to lost of lives and property. The religious scenario in Nigeria has assumed a violent dimension, leading to suicide, bombing, loss of innocent lives and property. The area that is most affected with terrorists attacks in the defunct northern religion. That is, the north and the area called today “middle belt” of Nigeria. Even if there is seeming peace, the relationship between Christians and Muslims is marked with mutual suspicion and distrust (Amadu, 1989). These religious crises are more frequent in the north and they sometime given birth to reprisal attacks in Eastern part of Nigeria are directed to all the Northerners without distinction of religious affiliation. That is, both Christians and Muslims are victims of such attacks (DZURGBA, 2006). The Northern Christians particularly suffer death casualties at every twist of events. This ugly situation calls for reflection on education as one of the possible measures of preventing religious conflicts and insecurity in Nigeria.<br/> Statement of the Problem<br/>The research work was embarked upon, purposely to examine the concept of religious in Nigeria and it implication on educational development in Nigeria.<br/>Purpose of the Study<br/>The research work is embarked upon to look critically into the concept of religious conflict. What are the factors that contribute to emancipation of religious conflict and the effect of the concept on the development of Nigeria? However, the research work will also try to provide some possible solutions to stop religious conflict in Nigeria.<br/>Research Questions<br/>In order to do justice to this study some questions are raised. The study intends to proffer answers to the questions, they include:<br/>What are the causes of religious conflict?<br/>In what ways does religious conflict affect the development of the education?<br/>What are the possible solutions to the problem of religious conflict? <br/>Significance of the Study<br/>This study will be useful especially for the coming youths of Nigeria to have good knowledge of the concepts of religious conflict and its effect on educational development in Nigeria and also to enable the parents and guidance’s to have this information at their disposal that will assist them in training their children in the way he/she should go, so that when the child is matured, he will not depart from it and parents will know their responsibilities to teach their children on good behaviours at all levels. It will enable the government to carry out its responsibilities accordingly.<br/>        Also, the school as place for educating children and a place of learning will benefit from this study because; it will give room for the educational in secondary schools to put more efforts in teaching/learning of religious studies.<br/>Scope and Limitation of the Study<br/>This study covers selected school students of Oorelope Local Government Area, Oyo State. However, to allow for thorough research work and considering the time duration stipulated for this work, the researcher has limited to Some Selected Secondary Schools in Oorelope local Government.<br/>The Secondary Schools are:<br/>Irepo Grammar School, Igboho.<br/>Ifelodun Grammar School, Igboho<br/>Igbohomore Grammar School, Igboho.<br/>Baptist High School, Igboho.<br/>Comprehensive High School, Igboho. <br/>Definition of Terms<br/>The following terms are defined as follows:<br/>Religion: This is a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe, especially when considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies, usually involving devotional and ritual observances, and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs.<br/>        Also it can be a specific fundamental set of beliefs and practices generally agreed upon by a number of persons or sects.<br/>Conflict: This is to come into collision or disagreement: be contradictory, at variance, or in opposition; clash. Also it can be to fight or contend; do battle.<br/>Effect: This is a change which is a result or consequence of an action or other cause.<br/>Also it can be the lighting, sound, or scenery used in a play. Film or broadcast or personal belongings or cause (something) to happen, bring about.<br/>Education: This is the process of facilitating learning, knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits of a group of people are transferred to other people, through storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, or research. Also education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves in a process called autodidactic learning.<br/>Development: This is a gradual growth of something so that it becomes more advanced, stronger e.t.c.

He prayed in verses 20-23, “I do not ask on behalf of these alone, but for those alsowho believe in Me through their word; that they may all be one; even as You, Father,are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believethat You sent Me. The glory which You have given Me I have given to them, thatthey may be one, just as We are one; I in them and You in Me, that they may beperfected in unity, so that the world may know that You sent Me, and loved them,even as You have loved Me”.<br/>This prayer he madedid not just focus on the eleven remaining disciples but alsoto those who would reach discipleship through their ministry(Britney; 1994). The Bible lets us know that Christ Jesus is crediting his disciples with the numbers that will beproduced. Theprimary concern Jesus expresses at this time of his impending death is the issue ofunity among the disciples as their unity will most definitely be a vital prerequisite fortheir subsequent mission (Jessica; 2004:497).Disunity and division are threatsfound among the members of the Body especially as the Church increases and grows in numbers. As Christ is definitely supplicating theFather with references to God and himself, it is clear the unity herein described ismore transcendent than that of “simply human fellowship or the harmonious interaction of Christians” (Ebere; 1970). The external expression of this unity is to be the evangel of the Church to the world, which attests to the sending of Christ by the Father.<br/>In 1 Corinthians 1:10 he exhorts, “Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment”, here Paul states this directive and takes a hard stand against division and factions in the Church Body, in light of both personal division and in light of doctrine. Unfortunately, Paul himself falls victim to one of these chasms of opinion in his relationship with Barnabas. Paul’s terminology to address doctrinal differences (1 Corinthians 11:19 and Galatians 5:20) is haireseis, denoting a difference of sound doctrine, even to the point of being an unjustified group (Accordance 2010). Just prior to the prayer in John 17 Jesus had established the institution of the Lord’s Supper in light of the Passover celebration, an institution given in great part to exhibit and foster unity with the Godhead, and unity as members of the Body of Christ. Paul affirms in 1 Corinthians 10:16, that the pinnacle of this desired oneness of communion, or church is displayed materially in the act of the Lord’s Supper, as it is a “sharing” in the blood and the Body of Christ. Mounce holds that the term church conveys the idea of fellowship, communion, participation and sharing (Mounce 2006:127, 247). Paul subsequently uses the term only in a religious sense rather than a secular one to denote something greater than a society, to denote a fellowship of a higher level; he as well uses this term to express a “religious fellowship (participation) of the believer in Christ and Christian blessings for the mutual fellowship of believers” (Hauck 1983:804). 1 John 1:3 and 2 Corinthians 13:14 affirm that church is also held with the Father, Son and Holy Spirit in addition to the communion of the saints, it is the Holy Spirit alone however, who brings believers into this fellowship (Prime 2008:105). This evidence of church is an external, physical expression of the spiritual fellowship that is enjoyed by the Body being knit together with the Godhead (Hunsinger 2009:347). Thus, church is the internal religious fellowship or participation of sharing in the benefits of a relationship with Christ, yet manifesting itself at times in a physical expression through the Body of Christ. Schmitz cites homothumadon as being infused with ”togetherness”, such as is evidenced in the visible, inner unity of a group faced by a common duty or danger; it is a unity, or unanimity, not embracing a personal agenda, “but on a cause greater than the individual” (Schmitz 1986:908-909). Hence, descriptive of the early Church, it is used in Acts all but one other time in the New Testament, in an effort to accentuate the internal unity of the group.<br/>Statement of the problem<br/>The Church of Jesus is increasing in division instead of unity. This disunity mostly comes in form of cell division. Churches are splitting, division in church seminars are increasing as reconciliation consultants are succeeding, while division abounds (Raymond; 1996), and denominations continue to growin number due to social division as the causal mechanism.Theoretically, orthodoxy would confess that unity is possiblethrough the giving of Christ’s glory. The Church as a whole is rightly able to proclaim theologicaltruths, but is also expected to evidence them to the world through its witness, asdeclared unity is not merely positional (Carson 1980:201).Christianity todaysuggests a proactive separation may be in order as only a sentimental unity remainsamong major denominations (Christianity Today 2004:23). Bloomberg asserts that indeed this unity is difficult to acknowledge in light of the many splintering factions (Bloomberg 2008:224). As a result, the observed lack of unity in the Body of Christ isa devastating witness to the world.<br/>Objectives of the study <br/>The chief objective of this study is to examine the factors responsible for divisions in the churches.<br/>To know the biblical and theological justification which support divisions of fellowship within the Body of Christ.<br/>To know what tolerances of division are biblically justifiable, or permitted in the scope of Scripture and<br/>To know whether the Church is actually in alignment with Scripture, and how that should affect the behavior of Christians today in their role of glorifying God.<br/>1.4    Research questions<br/>What kind ofbiblical and theological justification exists to support divisions of fellowship within theBody of Christ?<br/>What tolerancesofdivision are biblically justifiable, or permitted in the scope of Scripture?<br/>What needs to be defined is whether the Church is actually inalignment with Scripture, and how that should affect the behavior of Christians todayin their role of glorifying God.<br/>1.5    Research hypotheses<br/>Ho: difference in belief is not the major cause of church division<br/>Hi: difference in belief is the major cause of church division<br/>Ho: the inability of churches to align with scripture does not impact negatively on the behavior of Christian<br/>Hi: the inability of churches to align with scripture impact negatively on the behavior of Christian<br/>1.6    Significance of the study<br/>This study will contribute to the body of knowledge of Christian’s obedience in lightof Scripture in that it seeks to identify and then justify that paradigm of acceptableschisms or, permissible divisions. It then seeks to answer the question, “To whatdegree are Christians in accordance with Scripture in tolerating separations in theBody of Christ?”<br/>The researcher aimed at identifying the implicationsof clearer understanding so that believers who are participating in any acts ofdivision may understand the error or validity of their actions. Division in churchesmustbe clearly defined if it is permitted in the scripture.

As a study in ethics, it is mainly concerned with examining how peoples of Nigeria evaluate the rightness and wrongness of violence. It will further determine if there are socio-cultural, political, ethnic, psychological or religious reasons, the different groups of people in Nigeria use in justifying or rejecting violence. The study employed the use of quantitative and qualitative methods. Specifically the questionnaire and oral sources formed the main primary source for collecting data, while many secondary sources were also used. The research findings reveal that there are some traditional cultural, ethnic, political, psychological and religious roots of violence in Nigeria. Although religion has been blamed to be the major source of violence in Nigeria, some of the problems associated with the phenomenon are not totally religious. If anything, people use religion for their selfish interests. Thus, the manipulators of religion should be checked. Findings have also revealed that violent oriented films influence the attitudes of children towards violence in Nigeria. Some modest recommendations have also been made on how to check the frequency of violence and its consequences in Nigeria.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE  <br/>Introduction<br/>Background of the study<br/>Statement of problem<br/>Purpose of the study<br/>Significance of the study<br/>Research questions<br/>Definition of terms<br/>CHAPTER TWO  <br/> Literature review<br/>CHAPTER THREE         <br/>Methodology<br/>Research design<br/>Administration of questionnaire<br/>Sample<br/>Method of data collection<br/>Reliability and validity of instrument<br/>Method of data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR          <br/>Presentation and analysis of data<br/>Responses made by school heads<br/>Responses made by teachers<br/>CHAPTER FIVE  <br/>Summary of finding<br/>Conclusion<br/>Recommendations<br/>REFERENCES<br/>APPENDIX          <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>Violence is a common feature of social life in all types of societies. The scale, trend and patterns of violence vary across societies and periods (Alemika 2002). The prevalence of violence both locally and internationally has manifested a lot of devastation in human civilization. The acts of violence have in no small measure debilitated advancement in developing countries. Even in the most advanced countries, the phenomenon of violence has continued to be a reoccurring saga and thus poses a need for collaborative efforts in combating its dangers. Violence has consequently affected the behavioural patterns of various social groups and religious adherents. The consequences of violence therefore have continually drawn the attention of various governments, voluntary agencies, religious organizations and the academia towards controlling the spectre of its persistence.<br/>        The Nigerian situation presents a good case for examining the intricate patterns of persistent violent actions. Moreover, there is a complete admixture of the effects of the triad religious faiths, African Traditional Religion, Islam and Christianity. Notably, Islam and Christianity are pitched to be the major rallying forces in escalating the scale of violent actions in Nigeria. It has therefore become necessary to give religion a premium as the basis for all objective analysis because religion transcends all barriers invented or imposed on human social existence. There are various religious faiths with different doctrines and traditions in Nigeria. These variations have also affected the attitudes of various religious adherents and have invariably widened their ethical dimensions towards violent actions. The primordial tendencies of various ethnic groups towards violence have also inevitably aggravated the scale and propensity of violent actions in different forms. The perennial eruption of various ethnic militia in Nigeria and the preponderant religious fundamentalism have in no small measure triggered and widened the scope of violence in various ramifications (Egwu 2001). It has therefore become necessary to find out the sources and various ethical beliefs towards violent actions in which Nigeria is seen as a major purveyor of these actions.<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>The phenomenon of violence is not a new one. Every society whether in the primitive or modern times has demonstrated some elements of violent activities at a particular stage of its development or civilization. The historic account in the Holy Bible has vividly portrayed how Cain brutally killed his brother Abel, (Revised Standard Bible. Gen. 4.8). There were also wars, which led to the conquest of Canaan (Jericho and Ai). Heroes such as Samson among the Judges, Saul and David among the kings are few examples of warlords that depicted the prevalence of violence from the early societies (Revised Standard Bible. Jos. 6 - 8, cf Judg. 14-16, 1 Sam. 11, 1 Sam. 17). History has also clearly shown that from the early Stone Age to the modern times, wars and violence have been the major characteristics of life at this time. Empires attacked and conquered each other right from the early Greek city states up to the modern times (Wesley et al 2001). What is “new” is the scale and widespread nature of violence in the world today. The preponderance of violence globally in forms of war, torture, assassinations, protests, riots, revolutions, ethno-religious conflicts, genocide, nuclear threats, biological warfare and other forms of violence cannot be quantified. A few examples will suffice to suggest the enormity and the wide spread scale of violence in the world today.<br/>        There was violence perpetrated in the Kashmir region. Gunmen and women were seen killing and bombing buses, cars and buildings with the claim of responsibility. This situation has helped in filling the terror camps in Afghanistan posing one of the most dare threats to stability in the region (Newsweek Oct. 2000). In Northern Ireland, Catholic and Protestant clashes are the most recurrent violent clashes. An explosion of violence in Ulster reveals that Northern Ireland was locked in its prison of bitter sectarian hostility (Time Magazine – July 1996). On a more serious note is the “America��s Black September,” of recent global threat of terrorism waged upon the United States of America (U.S.A.), where the World Trade Centre (W.T.C.) in New York and the Pentagon in Washington were attacked destroying thousands of human beings and inestimable property (Tell Magazine – Sept. 2001:44). Consequent to this was the eruption of anthrax posing a threat to the global community (Sunday Punch – Dec. 2000). These situations have also bridled the fragile peace process in progress in the Middle East (M.E.) and have also triggered the already existing violence amongst the Israelites and the Palestinians.<br/>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>One of the objectives of this study is to determine how traditional, colonial, religious and western values bequeathed to Nigerians have influenced their attitudes towards violence. Secondly, consideration shall be given to why there are increasing cases of religious bred violence in contemporary societies, and what has led to the increase in the frequency and the scale of violence inspite of the religious teaching on morality. Thirdly, the study will examine the ethical view points of the major religions (Islam and Christianity) in Nigeria on the issue of violence and determine whether there are similarities of teachings on peaceful co-existence.<br/>Another objective is to determine what moral principles that can be used in justifying the various grounds for violence in contemporary times and to find out whether there can be conditions that can justify the use of violence for resolving misunderstandings and crises. Finally, the study will examine how tele-violence aggravates aggressive tendencies among children.<br/>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>1.     Does different value system steer up ethnic violence in Nigeria?<br/>2.     Does traditional cultural values steer up aggressive behaviour among Nigeria youths?<br/>3.     Does religious value and belief steer up violence in Nigeria?<br/>4.     Does political and economic contestation steer up violence in Nigeria? <br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>The significance of this study is to increase the awareness of the dangers of violence to students in various institutions of learning, Christians, Muslims, the government, private sector, various social and ethnic groups in order to stimulate strategies and ways of combating the re-occurrence of violent actions in Nigeria. This work hopes to enlighten and alert religious adherents in Nigeria on their role in keeping peace and maintaining the virtues of religious tolerance while shunning the tendencies of religious provocation. The researcher intends to make valuable contributions to government, voluntary organizations and various religious groups on the need to create fora for intra and inter-faith dialogue, conferences and workshops on the need for peaceful co-existence in Nigeria. Finally, this study intends to remind the government of the need to find out the fundamental causes of various violent actions in Nigeria with the hope of reducing the tempo of violence and impose appropriate punishment on the culprits.<br/>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>The prevalence of violence has preceded the period of Nigeria��s independence. Even after independence, there have been glaring incidences of political violence and other forms of violent activities that characterized our nationhood. As a way of focus, the researcher intends to cover the period between 1980 - 2002. This period has witnessed incessant eruption of<br/>violent religious actions compared to any other period in the history of Nigeria after independence. There were also incidences of political and communal violence especially from 1980 to 2002. This is further corroborated by Bala Usman in his analysis of violent communal conflicts in the central Nigerian uplands and the Middle Belt Basin; “communal violence in Nigeria has since from 1980 become more frequent, more widespread, more violently destructive of life and property” (Scope Newspaper Feb. 2002:8).<br/>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Below is the clarification of terms relevant to this research work.<br/>Ethics<br/>Like any other concept, ethics has defied a simple and universally accepted definition. In some cases, the definition is so vague and all inclusive that it does not sufficiently delimit ethics from other areas of human endeavour like psychology, law, economics, journalism and so on. In a general sense ethics is seen as a system or code of morals of a particular profession, group or religion (Udor 7).<br/>Morality<br/>Morality comes originally from the Latin “mores”, which simply means customs and usage of people. It has come to mean what is right or wrong in human conduct (Okeke 52). Mozia on the other hand, sees morality from the philosophical point of view which considers the nature of moral obligations and analyses or describes the values, obligations, finality, freedom and good conscience of moral actions of the individual within any given society (2).<br/>Violence<br/>The word violence has no precise or commonly accepted definition. The concept often serves as a catch for every variety of protest, militancy and coercion, destruction or condemnation (Anifowose 1). However, in whichever way violence is defined or<br/>discussed, it will naturally encompass the dictionary meaning, “intention to hurt or kill; very strong feeling that is not controlled”<br/>(Hornby 755). So situations like riots, coups, massacre, wars, pogrom, genocide, revolution, clashes, conflict, jihad and crusades, all fall within the ambit of violence. The etymological survey of the concept violence may help us have a clearer understanding of the word.<br/>Justice<br/>Justice in its Greek original “dikaiosyne” combines the notion of<br/>observing the law, doing the right thing, honesty, respect for other persons property and rights and fair play (equity) (Cited in Ahmadu 131). The Oxford Advanced Learner��s Dictionary defines justice as “the right and fair behaviour or treatment: the quality of being fair or reasonable” (Hornby 645). Okullu is of the opinion that: Justice provides the standard by which the benefits and burdens of being together in society are distributed.<br/><br/>\n\nETHICS OF RELIGIOUS VIOLENCE IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ETHICS OF RELIGIOUS VIOLENCE IN NIGERIA", "id": 138}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THEISM AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL: A CRITICAL STUDY <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The presence of evil in a world said to be created by a “Being” who is not only omnipotent, omniscience and perfectly good is problematic. It is a problem that has perturbed man for ages and coupled with various natural disaster still make the concept problematic one. How can there be a loving God, all-powerful and all-knowing God and still face the problem of evil, if really he is perfectly good and created everything then where does evil originated from? <br/>Atheist or agnostics base their case on the lack of evidence for God existence, however atheist have at least one very powerful positive argument for their position that there cannot be a living, all-loving, all-powerful God because there is so much evil and suffering in the world. Atheist raise questions like this: If you were a parent wouldn’t you do everything in your power to prevent your children from needless suffering? Many innocent children suffer from painful diseases, with this kind of problem how can we affirm for a loving and all-powerful God in the world. <br/>In this study, we are going to look through the lenses of philosopher who talk about the problem of evil and God’s existence. Our main focus on this work is theism and the problem of evil which will be dwell on chapter four of this work. Before going to the main work, we will first look at the problem which is evil, the different types of evil and different explanation (philosophical and religious explanation) of evil. <br/>We will talk more on chapter four that deal with the problem Theism and the problem of Evil. <br/>According to Augustine, evil is not a being, it is a result of privation of good, so it was not and cannot be created, evil cannot exist on it’s own. John Hick on his analysis gave some point why there is evil in the world. On his Greater Good Defence: God himself could not achieve certain result without allowing us to struggle against evil and to endure suffering some evil are necessary in achieving certain good end. The good that is achieved outweighs the evil and the same or a greater amount of good could not have been attained by any means that did not involve the presence of those evils. <br/>  TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE:<br/>1.0    General Introduction <br/>1.1        Statement of the problem <br/>1.2        Purpose of the study <br/>1.3        Significance of the study <br/>1.4        Scope of the study <br/>1.5        Methodology <br/>1.6        Literature Review <br/>1.7        References <br/>  CHAPTER TWO: THE CONCEPT OF THEISM<br/>2.1        Meaning of Theism <br/>2.2        The Idea of God <br/>2.3        The Various Arguments for the Existence of God.

Various arguments have been advanced down the ages by philosophers and theologians on this very problem of Evil and God and there has been no definite answer to this problem. The theist gave reasons why evil persist in the world created by a loving God, who they also believed that he is omnipotent, omniscience and all-merciful. There seems to be conflict between the theist and atheist on this very problem of God and Evil. The atheist used this as a fertile ground to prove that there is no God as claimed by the theist. <br/>John Hick on “Gender Good Defence” is of the view that when God initially created humanity, there was still some work to be done in making us a completed product. However, this remaining work could not be accomplished by God alone, we have to contribute to the process. Using the Greater Good Defence, Hick argues that even God himself could not achieve certain results without allowing us to struggle against evil and to endure suffering. <br/>Furthermore, the first chapter will concentrate on the statement of the problem, theism and the problem of evil. A method of research, purpose and the significant of this work will be discussed. <br/>The second chapter will dwell on the meaning of theism, the idea of God and the various argument for the existence of God (prove of God’s existence). <br/>The third chapter will be on the concept of evil as the problem, the meaning of evil and the different philosophical explanation of evil and finally the different types of evil in the world. <br/>Chapter four will dwell on the problem (Theism and the problem of evil). We will first look and examine evil as the problem and different ways of explanation given by theist concerning this very problem of evil and God. <br/>Finally, chapter five will be the summary of this work, reflecting what has been infer from chapter four then evaluate and conclude the work. <br/> 1.1    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The existence of God and the problem of evil has been a problem for long that men have searched for the reason why evil persist in a world claimed to be created by God who is omnipotent, omniscience and all-merciful. Man has tried to find out the causes of evil, why man created by God involved in bad action or why man carry out bad action on their fellow man and why there is so much evil in the world especially natural evil. <br/>Theist are faced with the problem of evil and this lead to their search of what is evil and causes of it, if it is a thing and also what and who is responsible for evil in the world. Different theists have given different views of evil. The Manicheans claimed to have the answer to the problem of evil, according to them, there are two ultimate principles and all sources of all things namely, Ormued (The Principle of Good) and Ahriman (The Principle of Evil). The Ahriman is the source of evil, darkness and all material things. <br/>Men soul came from Ormuzd (the principle of good) while the body from Ahriman. These two ultimate principle according to them, are eternal and in perpetual conflict with each other and this conflict is reflected in the things that come from them. <br/>Hence light and darkness, spirit and matter, good and evil are also in perpetual conflict. Christian theologians believe that evil is the wrath of God meted out on disobedient children. Augustine hold that evil is the negation or a privation of being. Evil is not a thing according to Augustine and therefore was not and cannot be created. Everything that is created is good and everything that is substance is good, but evil the origin of which I was trying find out is not a substance and was not created, therefore the question or the problem of evil should not arise because it does not make sense to ask about what is not a thing (substance). Evil cannot exist on it’s own but Good can exist on it’s own. <br/> 1.2    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>The purpose of this work is to bring out the work of different theist and their different explanation on the problem of evil and the existence of God and most importantly on how they tried to find solution or answers to this very problem of evil and existence of God. <br/>Before showing why evil persist in this world created by God who is omnipotent, omniscience and all-loving (which is the major aim of this work), if it is a thing or not, then if it is a thing, who created it? What causes it? <br/>Why evil persist in this world created by God who is omnipotent, omniscience and all-loving. And also a critical study of different theist who try to solve or who gave their explanation and meaning to the very problem (Theism and the problem of evil) at hand.<br/> 1.3    SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>The importance of this study is to show why evil exist in the world created by God who is all-loving, omnipotent and omniscience. The important of this work is to bring out the different explanation of the very problem at hand, the different meaning of evil and different ways theist try in solving the problem. Most atheists or agnostics based their case on the lack of evidence for God’s existence, they argue that we cannot claimed to have a loving God, all-powerful and all-merciful and still allow evil in the world, why a loving-God will allow suffering in this world. <br/>The most importance of the study is the explanation by theist why evil persist in the world. Some theist claimed that evil exist because of what is known as Greater Good Defence, it explains that some evil are necessary in achieving certain good end. The good that is achieved out-weighs the evil and the same or a greater amount of good could not have been attained by any means that did not involved the presence of those evils. <br/> 1.4    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The scope of this work is such that it would further strengthen on the fact that evil is opposed to good, which is the integrity or perfection of being. The problem of evil is sometimes abstracted to designate the ill affecting subject. The existence of evil in the world would all times be the greater of all the problems which the mind encounter when it reflects on God and its relation to the world. <br/>The problem of evil does not disprove the existence of God, evil exist, yes, according to some theist, evil exist but because man misuse his free will, according to Telhard De Chardin a Jesuit intellectual, consider the universe as an imperfect mechanism that is undergoing constant changes in terms of development, the universe we inhabit has not yet attain it’s perfect goal which it is gradually moving towards. According to him, the world is still in process of formation, therefore a world or the process of evolution is a world, which suffers labour and sins at every degree of evolution we find evil always and everywhere. <br/> 1.5    METHODOLOGY<br/>As would be expected of a research work of this nature, much of the information for this study shall be gathered from the primary sources such as book and other library materials. This work will be centred on a philosophical exposition of theism and the problem of evil. <br/>This work will be done by analyzing the concept of theism, and the various arguments for the existence of God. And generally proceeds by looking at the concept of evil, the various kind of evil. <br/>In comparism to the nature of evil, different philosophers have taken different views of the problems of evil and our evaluation of this work will be value of the entire work that is theism and the view of evil. <br/> 1.6    LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>Some material used in this study will be summarized as follow: <br/> <br/><br/>\n\n THEISM AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL: A CRITICAL STUDY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  THEISM AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL: A CRITICAL STUDY", "id": 139}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>MORALITY AND REASON IN THOMAS AQUINAS PHILOSOPHY: <br/>A CRITICAL ANALYSIS<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>I intended to expose the indepth meaning of reason and morality.

In this regard G. Buffen said that there is an infinite distance between man and animals, and the essential cause of this is that man is a being with reason and the animal is one without reason. In the same vain, Aristotle maintained that reason, which is the highest faculty of the soul is what sets man apart from sub-human nature. <br/>The question now is why and how is man rational and in what aspects of his life is he different from other animals and what factor is behind these? It has been noticed that man is exclusively marked out from other animals as regard social, cultural and intellectual forms of behaviour. It is only man that has an articulated, speech, inventive capability, knowledge of arts, beauty, politics, religion, morality and other forms of knowledge that can be associated with reason. <br/>So man is, as a result of this rationality marked out from other animals, it is not contestable then to associate or attribute the above enumerated characteristics to his rationality. <br/>As this work centers on morality and reason as that which assures us of the best moral life, we shall answer such questions as: has reason any influence or part to play in morality? Or put simply, is reason necessarily required for man to be moral? If yes, should reason be the sole factor for morality? But if no, what then? It is undebatable that man solely has the knowledge of good and evil (morality) and this type of knowledge can be possessed only by rational beings. In fact, God made man rational enough to see that he (man) should do what is right. <br/>Having known that man surpasses all the other animals by the possession of reason, and the only animal that has knowledge of morality, the question now is, is man moral because of reason or because of some other physiological factors? If it is because of the later, one can rightly pose this question: why is it that other animals are ignorant of morality or are not moral? <br/>St. Thomas Aquinas on whom this work is based, has propounded a popular dictum regarding man and reason. It is “Bonum Omins est, secundum rationem esse”, that is, (The good of man in life according to reason)1. As we shall see, this statement does not rule out the fact that human life can be controlled by other factors like the will, habit, passions, emotion and etc, but it affirms that man has a good life according to reason. One outstanding feature about Aquinas moral theory is its intellectualism. This will be gradually unfolding as we penetrate into this work. <br/>In this four chapter work, we are going to see how morality should be guided by reason. <br/>Chapter one presents us with the background (introduction) and in Chapter two, we shall examine; firstly, life and works of Aquinas, and the meaning of morality by giving its definition and several conceptions of it. In the second part of Chapter two, we shall sketch the nature of morality. Chapter three unfolds a devotion to reason and morality in Thomas Aquinas philosophy, in a bid to give its meaning. In this Chapter also, we shall consider the role of reason as a guide in other aspects of man’s behaviour, then its role as a guide in morality will be taken care of. In Chapter four, we shall discuss life according to reason, prudence and right reason, as St. Thomas would call it, the second part of Chapter four work will be evaluation and conclusion. <br/>    1.9       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>There are certain actions which all of us will individually or collectively condemn as morally wrong and ought not to be done or performed by anybody. For instance, murder, robbery, embezzlement of public fund, bribery and corruption, and so on. On the other hand, there are certain actions like kindness, hospitality, honesty, and so on, which are consider as morally good. Again, there are certain kinds of action that do not enjoy universal consensus on their goodness or badness, rightness or wrongness because of difference in opinion, for instance abortion, contraception, euthanasia, nuclear warfare, etc. <br/>The need now arises for us to know why in Aquinas philosophy certain actions are considered good while other are considered bad. What in Aquinas view, is the yardstick for determining good and bad action? What is the yardstick for determining good and bad actions and what is the paradigm for measuring such actions. What, within the assumptions of Aquinas, does it ever mean to say that an action is good or bad in itself? Or is it our thinking that makes any action good or bad? <br/>Some people, like Hume opine that reasons is and ought to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them. They opined that morality is determined by sentiments. <br/>Also, some philosophers like St. Thomas Aquinas, the Stoic Duns Scotus and so on, hold that right reason is the moral standard. Consequently, whatever is in line with right reason is morally right while what does not conform to right reason is morally wrong. But how does one know whether abortion, euthanasia, contraception etc, conforms to right reasons especially when there are many intelligent and cogent argument for or against the morality of these actions? <br/> 1.10   PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>The main purpose of this research/work study is to critically analyze the various notion of morality and reason, in respect to “Thomas Aquinas”. It is also intended towards serving as an impetus for improving the level of understanding of morality and reason by upcoming students of Nigerian university and tertiary institutions alike. <br/>This workstudy is also intended to throw more light on reason and moral ideas, principles and benefits. <br/>    1.11   SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>One of the significance of this work study is that it exposes the beautification of morality and reason in general. This study will also enable us to critically differentiate between the ancient and modern concepts of morality and reason. <br/>It will be of great benefit, if man observed, and make good use of his rationality and moral values in order to create and dwell in a better society. If this is done, man and his society will enhance thereby checkmating immorality and irrational attitude. <br/>Another significance of this project/work study is that it seeks to expose some of the lapses that are inherent in man’s approach to morality and reason. <br/>1.12   SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>Thomas Aquinas interpretation of morality and reason, which is in line with the precept of human endeavour and his environment will form the basic line of concentration in this research/work study. The different notion of morality and reason will also be given pre-eminence and special attention with a view of critically assessing them. <br/>   1.13   METHODOLOGY<br/>The methodology of a work determines its specialty says Aristotle. The method shows how a thing is done. It is in the light of this fact that I have decide to adopt the massive use of historical and critical methods of philosophical enquiry. Other methodologies to be used in this research/work study include the elaborate consultation of other relevant philosophical, religious books, literatures, articles and authorities. <br/>   1.14   LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>According to A. Fagothey in his book Right and Reason: Ethnics in Theory and Practice, morality means – “The quality in human acts by which we call them right or wrong, good or evil. It is a common term concerning the goodness or badness of a human act without specifying which of the two is meant”.1 <br/>It<br/> <br/> <br/><br/>\n\nMORALITY AND REASON IN THOMAS AQUINAS PHILOSOPHY: A CRITICAL ANALYSIS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MORALITY AND REASON IN THOMAS AQUINAS PHILOSOPHY: A CRITICAL ANALYSIS", "id": 140}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN EVALUATION OF KARL MARX’S IDEA OF CAPITALISM<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>     The history of man shows that people came together at a point in time to form society. The reason for this is for human beings to have a peaceful co-existence, society therefore is a human creation.<br/>      How can a society be adjudged as just? These are question yearning for answers and a great concern for political philosophers. The idea of capitalism has it’s origin in the west and it is highly practiced in the Euro-American world.<br/>       Capitalism as a principle in a society spread like wild fire that today it is practiced all around the world. On the face value capitalism appears to be nonconsequential as it seems to bring about rapid growth and development in society. But Karl Marx, who is regarded as the father of socialism vehemently, rejects capitalism in all its ramification. For him, capitalism can only be described as exploitative. It is in this light that this study shall evaluate Marx’s idea of capitalism with a view to addressing the above question. <br/> TABLE OF CONTENTS                                                          <br/> CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1        Background of Study <br/>1.2        Statement of the Problem <br/>1.3        Scope of the Study<br/>1.4        Purpose of the Study <br/>1.5        Significance of the Study <br/>1.6        Methodology <br/>1.7        Literature Review <br/>Endnotes<br/>CHAPTER TWO:           KARL MARX’S BIOGRAPHY AND CONCEPTUAL CLARIFICATION OF CAPITALISM <br/>2.1.1 Life and Works of Karl Marx <br/>2.1.2 Influence on Karl Marx Political Thought <br/>2.2.1 An Over-View of Capitalism <br/>2.2.2  Fundamental Features of Capitalism<br/>Endnotes<br/>CHAPTER THREE:       KARL MARX CONCEPTION OF CAPITALISM<br/>3.1    Historical Materialism of Karl Marx<br/>3.2    Dialectical Materialism of Karl Marx <br/>3.3    Analysis of Capitalism in Marx’s Political Thought<br/>3.4    Fundamental Bases of Marx’s Critique of Capitalism<br/>3.4.1 Exploitation<br/>3.4.2 Expropriation<br/>3.4.3 Alienation<br/>3.5    Revolution and the Ideal Marxian State<br/>3.6    Substructures and Superstructure<br/>Endnotes<br/>CHAPTER FOUR: CRITICAL EVALUATION <br/>4.1    Critical Evaluation of Marx’s Idea of Capitalism <br/>4.2    Conclusion<br/>Endnotes<br/>Bibliography<br/>  CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.0       BACKGROUND OF STUDY <br/>Capitalism is an advancement of feudalism. Some basic contradiction or flaws in this system of capitalism, is one that generate and depends on social inequality. What makes capitalism unique is not it’s industrial technology but the very way it organizes interpersonal relations in the work organization. <br/>It is note worthy that the system of capitalism has to do basically with exploitation and alienation and in this sense, Marx held that when the worker’s income, wealth, prestige and power are not equal to those of the owner’s of the means of production then the relationship between the workers and owners of means of production becomes one of exploitation. <br/>Alienation is another great tool of capitalism, were Marx argued that the social interaction between worker’s and owner’s in the organization is alienating, workers are dehumanized and the concept refers both to social situation which people find themselves (alienating work situation) and the perceptions of individuals in those situations (a feeling of being less human). <br/> 1.1       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>The problematic of capitalism lies in its exploitative tendency. What is crucial in this regard is to outline the problems raised by Marx about capitalism in an attempt to do away with the system of capitalism. As listed in the background above, exploitation and alienation are basically what capitalism constitute of. However, with these problem of capitalism Marx sought to proffer a salutation through the form of a revolution. <br/>The problematic here is how to achieve a classless society and have the commonwealth in common. This problem posses great challenge especially in the experimentation of socialism and communism. Another problematic is, can socialism truly be a state of classlessness. In other words we are faced with the problem of removing the divide between the have’s and the have not. Another problem to be looked at critically is that of revolution, will it lead to progress or retrogression.      <br/>1.2       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This essay discusses capitalism in reference to Karl Marx, not withstanding it will also discuss this concept from the perspective of general conception of capitalism. However, it shall also applaud as well as criticize Karl Marx concept of capitalism. <br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>The purpose of this study is to highlight the conceptualization of capitalism of Karl Marx with the view of showing that the postulation of socialism may not necessarily bring an end to class distinction. In other words this study aim at showing that socialism and communism could be a worse socio-economic and political agreement compare to capitalism. <br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>In line with the purpose of this study, the significance of the study will show that we can not remove capitalism from socio-economic development and growth. Again it will help economic planners and leaders to decide and initiate economic policy that will lead to the growth of the nation’s economy for the benefit of every individual rather than some. In line with the above, the study will serve as a call for government to regulate the practices of capitalism where it has being adopted such that worker’s right are protected. Lastly, the study will serve as an intellectual contribution to the improvement of capitalist and socialist economy in such a way that a synthesis can be reached. <br/>1.5       METHODOLOGY <br/>This essay adopts both analytical and critical methods. At the initial stage it shall outline in details the position of Karl Marx on the issue of capitalism as well as his profound solution to the annihilation of capitalism. Progressively it shall criticize Karl Marx’s conception of capitalism.  <br/>1.6       LITERATURE REVIEW <br/>The first book to be reviewed here is authorized by R. N. Caron Hunt and it is titled, “The Theory and Practice of Communism” (London: Penguin Books, 1950). In this book, the author gives us a short account of Marxism and it’s consequence in Russia, from a highly critical standpoint.<br/>The author clearly explained that modern Marxian thought is a synthesis in which the basic principles of Karl Marx and Engle’s have been tailored by Lenin and Stalin to fit into the twentieth century.

This essay will elucidate the doctrine of alienation in its origin until the era of Karl Marx. Much attention will be focused on the way Marx conceived alienation, its causes, types and effects. Attempt will be made to use this doctrine to explicate the circumstances of the majority of Nigerians, who are predominantly poor. <br/>The approach will be a theoretical exposition of K. Marx theory of alienation. An attempt will be made to juxtapose the arguments for and against the Marxist doctrine of alienation, and how it tallies with the Nigerian society. This will aim at correcting the defective systems of the Nigerian society. Here it will be explained, whether   the suffering and the inhuman conditions that most Nigerians pass through can be termed, “alienation” following Marx theory. If this doctrine is applied to the Nigerian society, the question will then be; how does the Nigerian system alienates its citizens? <br/>The purpose of this essay, is to show whether there is any connections between the Marxist doctrine of alienation and the condition of the average Nigerian worker. Here, I will examine the solution proffered by Karl Marx. I will also show that though his alienation doctrine seems to elucidate the conditions of many Nigerians, the causes and solution proffered by Marx cannot be adapted to the Nigerian society. To put it precisely, the solution proffered by Karl Marx is not workable nor attainable in the Nigerian system. Finally, I shall propose that alienation can only be mitigated within the context of solidarity. <br/>  CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>It has become increasingly common to hear life in the present age characterized in term of alienation1 The concept of alienation has become an almost obsessive concern in areas of socio-political philosophy, as a condition of man in this modern age. The subject matter has become the isolated individual. The individual is estranged from other people, the fruit of his labour, and his self. The alienating condition of modern man shows that we are confronted by the symptoms of a morbid and acute social sickness. <br/>In this present Nigerian society, there has been lamentations of oppressions exploitation and dehumanization. Nigerians are exploited by fellow Nigerians, hence, M. I. Akimbo exclaimed, “we have done very estimable evil to ourselves in this land”.2 Thus, a lot of thinkers now term Nigerian workers as alienated beings. The question, which seems to be cropping up, is whether some Nigerians are really alienated and marginalized?<br/>        1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The greatest ontological evil that can happen to being in its essence, existence and expression is alienation.3 There has been various attempts to interpret the conditions of the Nigerian workers following the basic tenets of the Marxist doctrine of alienation, over the years. The worst part, is the attempt to proffer solutions to the alienating conditions of Nigerian workers following the pattern of Karl Marx’s-revolution. <br/>The problems created by alienation are multifarious. There is a problem of man’s inhumanity to man dehumanization, as exemplified in the way the rich treat the poor in Nigeria. There is also the estrangement of some Nigerians; from the fruits of their labour, from friends and from family. Added to the above is the exploitation of the resources in the Niger Delta to develop the northern region of Nigeria. This exploitation is in all regions; employers exploiting employees, the rulers exploiting the ruled, the clergy men exploiting their members, some lecturers in the university exploiting their students and so on. How do we reconcile alienation with global call for freedom and human dignity? How can man exercise himself fully in a society that is characterized with all forms of alienation. <br/>  1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The aim of this research among others is to assess the doctrine of alienation and the applications of the solutions proffered with reference to Karl Marx, and why this solutions cannot be applied to the Nigerian society. An attempt will be made to give an elucidation of a workable solution to address the alienating conditions in Nigeria. <br/> 1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The significance of this research work is bipolar, firstly, it will serve as assessment of the much esteemed doctrine of alienation enunciated by Karl Marx, secondly it will serve as awareness to many Nigerians that there is a workable solution to this alienating condition which characterize their society. <br/>It will also create the awareness that the solutions to the problems of alienation in Nigeria cannot be located in the solutions proffered by Karl Marx. <br/>   1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This project shall be limited to the doctrine of alienation and its solutions as enunciated by Karl Marx. This is not to neglect what other theorists have said about the concept of alienation. This work will also attend to alienation of Nigerian workers and the workable solutions to these alienations or estrangement. The role of the labour unions’ strikes will be examined to see if it is justified. The reactions of the Nigerian government to the conditions of the labour class will not be neglected.<br/>Also, the applicability or non-applicability of the solutions proffered by Karl Mark will be examined critically to show how workable it is in the Nigerian context. <br/>   1.6       METHODOLOGY<br/>My approach to this research work will be critical and analytical (a method where the issue at stake will be dissected and evaluated to show its good and had qualities. <br/>To this end, therefore, materials to execute the research will be gotten from the library. This is not to undermine the importance of relevant books gotten from friends, relevant class notes and interviews. <br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nAN ASSESSMENT OF THE MARXIST DOCTRINE OF ALIENATION AND IT'S RELEVANCE TO THE NIGERIAN SOCIETY <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ASSESSMENT OF THE MARXIST DOCTRINE OF ALIENATION AND IT'S RELEVANCE TO THE NIGERIAN SOCIETY ", "id": 142}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>A CRITIQUE OF THE FIVE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF NIGERIAN EDUCATION <br/>IN THE CONTEMPORARY SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL TRENDS IN THE COUNTRY<br/>Abstract</b><br/>According to  Taiwo (1980:75), for sense of national unity , a country where people are different races, and each race tries to emphasize its own importance  and there are social or tribal jealousies, one race fears the domination of another race, it is always very difficult to make for a national system of education. This study is of a critique of the five main objectives of the philosophy of Nigerian Education in the contemporary socio-economic and political trends in Nigeria. The first part of this article is the introduction, which deals with the background information to the study. After the introduction, the said objectives are critically examined one after the other to enable the writer to confirm or fault Taiwo’s claim. The flaws in the objectives and their implications on Nigerian Education are also discussed. This last part of the article is the concluding part. It contains the summary and possible solutions to the factors that militate against the successful implementation of the five main objectives of the philosophy of Nigerian education in the contemporary socio-economic and political trends in Nigeria.<br/>Introduction<br/>        According to Osokoya (1987:19) the findings of different educational commissions in Nigeria, together with the contributions of a number of Nigerian academics and educationists highlighted the weaknesses of the old educational system as being too academic, theoretical, inadequate and unsuitable for providing an overall development of Nigerians. Hence, there was agitation for a re-evaluation of the old system and a desire or dire need for a national policy on education. <br/>        It was an attempt to meet this demand and the 1979 Constitution which brought presidential systems of government that gave birth to 1981 revised edition of the National policy on Education. The five main objectives of the philosophy of Nigerian education, as stated in the policy document (1981:7) revised edition are the building of:<br/>1)                 A free and democratic society;<br/>2)                 A just and egalitarian society;<br/>3)                 A united, strong and self-reliant nation;<br/>4)                 A great and dynamic economy<br/>5)                 A land of bright and full opportunities for all citizens.<br/>The above objectives seem to have symbiotic relationship in the light of contemporary socio-economic and political trends in Nigeria. Let us have a critical examination of these objectives one by one.<br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nA CRITIQUE OF THE FIVE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF NIGERIAN EDUCATION IN THE CONTEMPORARY SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL TRENDS IN THE COUNTRY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITIQUE OF THE FIVE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF NIGERIAN EDUCATION IN THE CONTEMPORARY SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL TRENDS IN THE COUNTRY", "id": 143}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>A CRITIQUE OF DAVID HUME’S EMPIRICISM <br/> ABSTRACT </b><br/>One of the never ending processes in life is the process of knowledge acquisition which to the lay man may not constitute any problem as regards how it is acquired. But to philosophers, from time past this has constituted serious debacles. However, in philosophy, it has become the special concern of epistemology one of it’s branches to analyze how knowledge is acquired. <br/>Epistemology has rationalism and empiricism as its most outstanding schools. These two schools in analyzing how knowledge is acquired have come to be the opposite of each other, because while rationalism hold that knowledge comes through reason,empiricism on the other hand holds that it comes through sense-experience. In this long history of philosophy, however, David Hume has remained the most consistent empiricist and for some reasons, we deemed it necessary to make the aim of this work be the critical analysis of David Hume’s theory of empiricism so that in the end we would have demonstrated whether it exhausts all possible knowledge of reality or not. <br/>Now our problem is what must have led to Hume’s radical position that sense-experience is the only possible guide to the acquisition of knowledge that is certain? We however, discover that it is not unconnected to the fact that the search for knowledge that is certain, which Aristotle shifted to concrete objects through experimentation and which also cut through the time of John Locke and George Berkeley who laid emphasis on perception, influenced Hume to a great extent. Therefore by building on the philosophy of Locke and Berkeley which emphasized sense perception, Hume came to develop his radical position about sense experience as the limit of human knowledge. <br/>In this, Hume categorized the objects of human reason into relations of ideas and matters of facts and he concentrated on the latter which he argued can only be ascertained through sense-experience. He went further to hold that these sense-experiences are acquired as impressions that is at the time of direct contact with an object, and later as ideas when the mind reflects on the impressions. <br/>Analytically one discovers that impressions are however Humes only guarantee for measuring reality, even the ideas in the mind he argued must conform to these impressions so as to be considered as guaranteeing knowledge as real. In short, for something to be considered as real, it must generate impression. <br/>Hume argued, causality can not be real because in reality, only what we experience are the proceeding and succeeding events separately and not any causal relation between the two events. All other metaphysical concepts are not real because they do not generate impressions and therefore cannot be experienced. To demonstrate his utter rejection of metaphysics, Hume campaigned for the burning of every book that contains metaphysics. <br/>In spite of all these, Hume’s rejection of metaphysics was an unsuccessful exercise because Hume used the method of knowledge acquisition through sensation which does not apply to metaphysics. <br/>Then come our wonder, why should sense-experience be the only standard of the measurement of reality for Hume? Are the senses not fallible? Of course, they are. Hardly do two people perceive on thing the same way, what of illusions and hallucinations, all these demonstrates that the senses furnish us most times with appearances and not reality. It therefore amounts to wrong conception of reality as guaranteeing reality. <br/>What the sense furnish us with has to be moderated by human reason before they are considered, qualified as certain knowledge. <br/>  OUT LINE<br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1    Background of  study <br/>1.2    Statement of  problem <br/>1.3    Purpose of study <br/>1.4    Significance of  study <br/>1.5    Scope and Scopmethodology<br/>1.6    Methodology <br/>1.7    Literature Review <br/>        End Notes <br/> CHAPTER TWO: HUME’S LIFE AND THE INTELLECTUAL INFLUENCES ON HIM <br/>2.1    Hume’s life and works <br/>2.2    Intellectual influences on David Hume <br/>2.3    General overview of empiricist philosophy <br/>        End Notes <br/> CHAPTER THREE: HUME’S EMPIRICISM <br/>3.1    Hume’s theory of empiricism <br/>3.2    Contents of the mind and Association of ideas <br/>3.3    Hume’s concept of causality <br/>3.4    Hume’s attack on metaphysics <br/>        End Notes <br/> CHAPTER FOUR:         PROBLEMS AND CRITIQUE OF HUME’S EMPIRICISM <br/>4.2    The limitations of the senses as a source of knowledge <br/>4.2    Wrong conception of reality <br/>4.3    A systematic empiricism leads to idealism <br/>        End Notes<br/>CHAPTER FIVE:PERSONAL REFLECTION<br/>5.1 End notes<br/>5.2 Bibliography <br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>The search for knowledge that is both absolute and certain has been continuous. However, since at least the time of Aristotle, there has been a strong epistemological tradition based mainly on human experience, which is not directed towards the possibility of achieving absolute knowledge. <br/>This tradition is a typical example of the doctrine of empiricism. Empiricists argue that it is unreasonable to set a goal of absolute and all-inclusive knowledge, especially when there is close at hand the power to increase practical knowledge by slower but dependable methods. Empiricist are content in building a system of knowledge that has a high probability of being true even though it’s absolute certainty cannot be guaranteed. David Hume is one of the greatest empiricists in the history of epistemology and metaphysics who has distinguished himself as a consistent and coherent radical empiricist. <br/>According to him, the only true knowledge is experimental, and any concept that is not available to sense perception is mere fanciful thinking. The only abstract objects of the abstract science or of demonstration are quantity and number, and all attempts to extend this more perfect species of knowledge beyond these bounds are mere sophistry and illusion.1 <br/> With an ideological ferocity, he calls for a book-burning campaign of any metaphysical work. <br/>He proclaims: <br/>  When we run over libraries persuaded of these (empirical) principles, what havoc must we make? If we take in our hand any volume: of or school metaphysics, for instance lets ask does it contain any abstract reasoning containing quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter-of-fact and existence? No. Commit to it to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.2<br/> Hume’s proposal of vigorous sensism as an alternative to our natural and acquired scientific, metaphysical and socio-cultural deposits, creates more problems than it resolves. It withers all foundation of science and philosophy. It leaves us in make-shift, sandy subjectivism of dry empiricism. <br/>David Hume’s empiricism within the context of knowledge is great, but a consistent empirist will end up destroying the very foundation of knowledge. The epistemological, scientific and ontological heritage of humanity is we think more than a series of impressions.3 To reduce them as bundles of impressions. To reduce them as bundles of impressions as Hume would want to believe is myopic. <br/>The above as a way of introduction forms the background of our study. <br/> 1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>There are problems in Hume’s theory of empiricism. The major one arises in an attempt to answer the question of how reliable is our senses. Very often, our senses deceive us. This is true when we see a mirage, in the changing size of objects according to our psychological and physiological state, in hallucination and other forms of illusions. <br/>The problem is that there is no way of immediately differentiating the real from the unreal in such situations. The mirage for example is an effect caused by hot air in deserts or on roads, that makes you think you can see something, such as water, which is not there. <br/>Now the question is, how do we differentiate between a true sense experience from a false or illusory sense experience? <br/>Thus, arises the famous arguments from illusion which places doubts on the reliability of sense experience. <br/> 1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>It has already been pointed out that David Hume maintained a radical stand in his position on knowledge acquisition by maintaining that knowledge comes only from sense experience. He did this by drawing out the problems inherent in reason as a source of knowledge. <br/>The purpose of this study is therefore to examine David Hume’s position and also to show that in as much as we agree that human beings acquire knowledge through senses experience, sense experience alone cannot constitute or guarantee knowledge. Just as Jacques Maritain pointed out that every philosophical system contains some truth and tells something about the real, some philosophies however exaggerate their claims and this is where they then run into problems. This is so with David Hume, he ran into this kind of problem and this was because though knowledge can be acquired through sense experience, he exaggerated the position by maintaining that knowledge can only come through sense experience. <br/>It therefore becomes part of the purpose of this study to point out some of these problems as we can in order to show that though sense experience leads to knowledge, however knowledge does not stop there after there are some limitations to the senses in epistemological procedure so that whatever information we receive through the senses are subjected to judgment before it is accepted. <br/> 1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>When this work is completed, it is our hope that it is going to be of importance in the sense that at least we would have succeeded in bringing to light some of the very important aspects of David Hume’s empiricism and at the same time would have also succeeded in pointing out problems inherent in it. <br/>The work will equally be of help or assistance to students who will want to do some works in the area of David Hume’s empiricism as it will provide some aid to them by providing them with a kind of insight into the nature of Hume’s empiricism. But we must point out here that this work should not be taken as all there is in Hume’s empiricism. But where however, we could not cover, the references. That appear at the end of the work will therefore be adequate to direct or refer students to where information as regards those areas will be gathered. <br/>To people who may not be doing works on David Hume`s Empiricism; to non-philosophers, who may thus be reading for knowledge acquisition or for pleasure, this work will equally be of immense help as the approach that will be adopted here and the choice of works will not be difficult to understand.  <br/> 1.5    SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY <br/>We have already shown from the title of this work that this work is concerned with providing a critique of David Hume’s empiricism. However, just as it is done in every critical study, we are not going to rush into the criticism just like that, we therefore will have a guide or focus as regards what to criticize. Hume’s empiricism itself is to provide the guide because, as we are going to criticize it, we will have to present his empiricism so as to point out what it entails. After doing this, we will then know how to anchor our criticism to the problems we will observe, having discovered the nature of Hume’s Empiricism. <br/>1.6    METHODOLOGY <br/>The method to be adopted in this work is that of critical study. As the work is on David Hume’s empiricism, the method will therefore be, first of all to present a general overview of empiricism. After this we will then narrow our attention down to Hume’s notion of the subject matter empiricism. It will be after presenting these that we will therefore settle down to criticize. <br/>For the purpose of convenience however, our criticism is going to be in two phases.  The first phase will be to provide the attacks which had been leveled against Hume’s empiricism by other people, this is because we are quite aware that Hume’s empiricism has come under attacks over the years. <br/>The second phase of the criticism will therefore be our own criticism. We will here point out as will be able, some of those problems Hume’s empiricism are shrouded with due to Hume’s radical position, and based on these, we will therefore draw our criticisms against his empiricism. <br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nA CRITIQUE OF DAVID HUME'S EMPIRICISM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITIQUE OF DAVID HUME'S EMPIRICISM", "id": 144}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF ARISTOTLE’S CONCEPTION OF CAUSALITY<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Causality has been variously defined, and even given an empirical understanding.

This means that whatever happens physically or otherwise has an explanation and this explanation may be spiritual as well as natural.

When certain events happen, we tend to ask ‘why’. This is because such events produce some effects.  In asking the question ‘why’, we are asking for the cause of the event. We seek an explanation that would enable us understand the effect which the event produces. This explains the whole problem and notion of causality. The Ionian philosophers probably the earliest thinkers did not fail to recognize that the world as it is did not come to be without being caused by some other things. <br/>The Ionian philosophers occupied themselves with the cosmological problem; of what substance is the universe composed? This of course was a causal question and Thales of Miletus; the first Greek philosopher posited that the primary stuff of the cosmos was ‘water’1 Anaximander, criticizing the causal theory of his predecessor held the stuff of the universe is an indefinite or boundless realm.2 Anaximenes the third and last Milesian philosopher designated air as the primary substance from which all things come.3  These philosophers certainly did not regard the universe as anything other than an effect which requires a cause in order to be.  Plato equally had his version of causality which was deeply rooted in his philosophy. For Plato, the sensible world is the changing world of appearance.<br/>In a more interesting way, the belief is a strong one among the Africans. The Africans see everything that happens to him or her as an effect of something external to him or her, his or her misfortunes are attributed to the next door neighbour who wished him bad the other day, his or her poor harvest is traceable to the anger of the gods. African thought however explains causality without actually bifurcating the metaphysical from the phenomena. In other words, the African world is one, and every effect or event in the Africa universe is explainable only with reference to a cause. Let us present statement of the problem.<br/> 1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Aristotle in his First Philosophy or Metaphysics formulated the principle of causality through the study of man-made or artificial things and identified four types of causes. In Aristotle’s view, all the four causes (not a single one alone) are needed in order to produce an effect in art as well as in nature. The four causes include the formal cause (the shape or form of a thing) contributes, according to him, the “essence” of a thing. Material cause is the subject of change. Efficient cause is that which initiates activity. (The efficient cause is often known as the propelling cause.), The Final cause is the end (purpose, goal, state of completion) for which the change is produced. From the above, let us provide a problematization by ostention. When we see a rolling stone, we reason that the stone could not have caused its own movement. Then we begin to raise questions on how the stone came to be moved. This is obviously the problem with causal theory. We want to know ‘how’ A is the cause of B, and whether without A, there will not be B. This problem has dominated the discussion on causation. However, Aristotle tied the notion of cause to four factors and then believed that the, ‘Formal cause’ is the unifying force of the causes. The problematic of Aristotle’s idea of causality can be formulated thus;<br/>1)                  How can matter or form bring about change?<br/>2)                  If form contains within itself its own activity, do we still need a first mover (Efficient causation)?<br/>3)                  Does passivity actually lead to change?<br/>Nonetheless, we find that matter except acted upon cannot bring a change in itself, yet Aristotle consider the material cause as justified. The question remains, whether the four causes must be present for change to take place, or for something to come to be. The problem is, are there things that are not observed that can cause observed things? How can we balance the fact that both the material and immaterial can operate both as causes and effects. There are questions that our study of Aristotle needs to provide answers to. Let us present the methodology. <br/> 1.3       METHODOLOGY<br/>The method to be used in this study would be analytical. It means that we shall analyze the concept of causality by simplifying or clarifying the term causality. Here we are interested in the meaning of causality, its history and specifically the Aristotelian conception of it. The actual instruments we wish to use include internet sources, archival materials, source documents, etc. Let us present the scope.<br/> 1.4       SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The scope of this research work shall take into cognizance, the work of Aristotle on causality and some other ideas of causality. We now move to the purpose.<br/> 1.5       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>Our experience of reality both in its generality and in its specificities, confirms the physical theory that nature abhors vacuum. At the causal level, i.e., at the level of the relationship of things as they are products of other things, nature abhors ‘non causality’. The purpose of this project therefore, is to reflect on Aristotelian conception which seems to be radically different from his predecessors. David Hume criticized the traditional conception of causality propounded by Aristotle.  Our Second purpose here therefore is to show that Hume’s critic of Aristotle’s conception does not hold water. Above all, the ‘why’ question is an inevitable one because it seeks all-round and ontological response to the reason, explanation and justification of reality. Not just the way it happened, but the reason why it came to happen that way. It is concerned with ontological ultimacy, the last ground of explanation. The above three points mentioned above constitute the purpose of this project. We now proceed to the significance.<br/> 1.6       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The significant of anything lies in its value or relevance. Theoretically, this work is significant in a number of ways. Firstly, it asserts that there is reason for all things. This goes to show that every effect must have a cause, in Aristotelian terminology, “ex nihilo nihil fit” (from nothing, nothing comes). The significance here lies in the fact that it amounts to standing logic on the head, if we claim that effect are not ontologically linked with a causal principle. The second significant lies in the fact that human reason cannot rest until it finds answers to the curiosities that impinge on his consciousness. According to Aristotle it is the nature of man to know and to ask questions. It is therefore doubly significant first negatively to escape from ignorant and positively to know the causes of things. Lastly Aristotelian conception of causality is significant because it attempts to give an explanation of the totality of reality through inductive and deductive processes. The question of origin is a very serious question. Aristotle in his theory of causes, to a large extent was able to give us a rational foundation of reality in totality. We now move to the literature review.<br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nA CRITICAL EVALUATION OF ARISTOTLE'S CONCEPTION OF CAUSALITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF ARISTOTLE'S CONCEPTION OF CAUSALITY", "id": 145}]
