Samples were examined microscopically and cultured in blood agar and Macckonkey agar. Disk diffusion method was used for antibiotic testing. Of the 60 urine samples 48 yielded significant growth with a prevalence rate of 80%. It was observed that females were more infected than the males with a prevalence rate of 56.70% and 43.30% respectively under the ages of 18-25yrs. <em>Escherichia coli</em> was the most predominant. The isolates were very sensitive to Gentamycin, Nitrofurantoin and Ofloxacin which were the (most sensitive) and the most resistant were Tetracycline, Cortrimozol, Cephalexin and Ampicillin. Therefore, Nitrofurantoin, Gentamycin, Ofloxacin were strongly recommended for the treatment of UTI as indicated in the study.</p>\n\nPREVALENCE AND ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY OF GRAM NEGATIVE BACTERIA IN THE URINE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PREVALENCE AND ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY OF GRAM NEGATIVE BACTERIA IN THE URINE", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p> <p>The susceptibilities of Salmonella typhi and other pathogens to antibiotics and hot aqueous extract of <em>Hibiscus sabdariffa</em> were investigated using agar diffusion and agar well diffusion methods respectively. <em>Salmonella typhi</em> was sensitive to ampicillin, cetriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamycin of ofloxacin and perfloxacin.

It is therefore imperative to note that the use of medicinal plants is recommended to the Government and Industry.</p> <p><em><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></em><br/>Long before mankind discovered the existence of microbes, the idea that plants have some healing potentials, i.e. that they contain what we will currently characterize as antimicrobial principle was well accepted (Doughari, mahmood &amp; Tyoyina, 2011). In whatever manner early man gained his knowledge of the curative powers of plants, one must assume that the was able thereafter to recognize the plant, since the detailed flora available today, were not in existence then (Sofowora, 2008). The use of higher plants and their extracts to treat infectious diseases is an age old practice in traditional African medicine (Onyeagba, ugbogu, Okeke &amp; Iroakasi, 2004). Traditional medicine practice has been known for centuries in many parts of the world (Sofowora, 1984). It is however observed that these practices vary from one country to another (Onyeagba, ugbogu, Okeke &amp; Iroakasi 2004). Nature has been a source of medicinal agents for thousands of years. The use of herbs is the most ancient approach to healing known (Apata, 1979).World Health Organization (WHO) in<br/>1978 defined traditional medicine as the sum total of knowledge or practices whether explicable or inexplicable used in diagnosing and preventing a physical, mental or social disease which may rely exclusively on past experience or observation handed down from generation to generation, verbally or in writings. Since antiquity, man has used plants to treat common infectious diseases and some of these traditional medicines are still included as part of habitual treatment of various maladies (Doughari et al). Numerous plants and herbs are used all over Nigeria as phytomedicine by traditional medicine practioners. Plant extracts are given singly or as concoction for various ailments. The medicine could be either in the form of powders, liquids, liniments and inclusion accoding to Apata. More than 70% of people living in Nigeria depend on these various forms of concoctions and herbal decocotions for the treatment of some diseases (Kimbi-Beyioku, 1996). Many investigators have demonstated the antimicrobial activity of the constituents of some higher plants (Akobundu &amp; Agykara, 1987; Rocio and Rion, 1982; Almagboul et al 1988; Misra et al, 1992; Hablemariam et al; 1993) and quite a number<br/>of chemical compounds of plant origin have been shown to possess antimicrobial activity (Corthout, Piefers &amp; Cleays, 1992). One of such plants is Hibiscus sabdariffa.<br/>Hibiscus sabdariffa (called Roselle in English or Zobo in the northern part of Nigeria) which belongs to mallow family (malvaceae) is native to West Africa. Hibiscus sadariffa is cultivated in loamy, well drained soil mainly in tropical climates and requires rainfall averaging about 10 inches (15 cm) each month throughout the growth season. Hibiscus sabdrriffa is of several use, it is considered to have anti-hypertensive properties. In some places the plant has been used in folk medicine as diuretic, mild laxative and treatment for cardiac and nerve diseases and cancer to mention but a few.<br/>However, the plant (Hibiscus sabdariffa) is rich in anthocyanin. The dried calyces contained flavonoids gossypetin, hibiscentine and sabdaretine. The major flavonoid formerly reported as hibiscin, has been identified as daphniphylline. Small amounts of myrillin (delphinidin 3- monoglucoside), chrysanthenin (cyanide 3- monoglucoside) and delphinidin are also present (Mohammed,<br/>Fernandez, Pineda &amp; Aguilar, 2007). All these gave it the qualities to be regarded as a chemotherapeutic agent against some microorganisms especially some pathogens of man.<br/>Salmonella typhi is an enteric bacterium responsible for causing typhoid fever which has affected mankind since human population became large enough to contaminate the supply of its water. It is a food borne disease contracted by ingestion of bacteria in contaminated food or water (jerry, 2007). The sources of infection could be through infected food, poor kitchen hygiene, and excretions from either sick people or infected but apparently clinically healthy people and animals, polluted surface water standing water and so on. The signs and symptoms of the disease has 4 phases, first week involves the slow rise in temperature, headache, cough, malaise and abdominal pain. In the second week of the infection, high fever in plateau around 40oC (104oF) and bradycardiac (Sphygmothermic dissociation) and delirium is frequent. The patient may be calm but sometimes agitated, thus it gave typhoid fever the nickname called “Nervous fever”. In the third week, intestinal hemorrhage occurs, Encephalitis,<br/>Neuropsychiatric symptoms, metastatic abscesses and endocarditis is seen. The final week (fourth), the patient enters into the typhoid state. The incidence of Salmonella infection may not be perfectly known. This is because the majority of patients are treated as outpatients and therefore hospital based studies will underestimate the true incidence (W.H.O, 2006). However, the incidence of typhoid fever in developing countries is higher compared to other developed countries. The pathogenesis of typhoid fever is a complex process which proceeds through several stages with an asymptomatic incubation period of 7-14days inversely related to the size of the infecting dose during which bacteria invade macrophages spread throughout the reticuloendothelial system. After passing through the pathological stages, necrosis may occur. Salmonella typhi infection can be best prevented by sanitation and hygiene. It can be controlled using a wide variety of methods such as the use of vaccines e.g live oral Ty2la vaccine (sold at Vivotif Berna). Diagnosis is by bone marrow or stool culture and with a widal test i.e (demonstration of Salmonella antibodies against O and H antigens). Treatment is by the use of<br/>antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, sulfomethriazole and ciprofloxacin. Since some plants have been shown to have antimicrobial effect against some pathogenic bacteria, especially antibiotic resistant pathogens, this study is aimed at testing the effect of H. sabdariffa on S. typhi and other pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumonia. The aim of the study is to determine the invitro effect of H. sabdariffa on a clinical isolate of S. typhi and other pathogens. Below are the objectives of this study.</p> <p><strong><em>1.1. Objectives</em></strong><br/> Collection and identification of H. sabdariffa flower<br/> Antibiotic sensitivity testing of the test organism<br/> Antimicrobial screening of H. sabdariffa extract against the test organisms.<br/> Investigation of the susceptibility of S. typhi and other pathogens to hot water extract of H. sabdariffa flower.</p>\n\nSUSCEPTIBILITIES OF SALMONELLA TYPHI AND OTHER BACTERIAL PATHOGENS TO ANTIBIOTICS AND HOT AQUEOUS EXTRACT OF HIBISCUS SABDARIFFA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SUSCEPTIBILITIES OF SALMONELLA TYPHI AND OTHER BACTERIAL PATHOGENS TO ANTIBIOTICS AND HOT AQUEOUS EXTRACT OF HIBISCUS SABDARIFFA", "id": 2}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Stored locust bean samples were purchased from Uselu market and analysed for their fungal load and physicochemical properties such as moisture content, pH value and titratable acidity. Enumeration of the total fungal species was carried out by pour plate technique using appropriate medium, potato dextrose agar (PDA) with antimicrobial agents (streptomycin), incorporated to inhibit bacteria growth. The fungal isolates were identified using cultural and morphological characterization. Moisture content determination was done by drying to constant weight in oven at 103°C, the pH value was determined using a pH meter while titratable acidity was by acid-base reaction using 0.1N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. The total fungi count on potato dextrose agar was 2.0x10-8 from Uselu market. The moisture content was 18.9%, the pH value 6.1 and titratable acidity 0.61ml of 0.1N, NaOH. The species of fungi isolated and identified at the end of the analysis were <em>Fusarium</em> sp, <em>Aspergillus flavus</em>, <em>Penicillium</em> sp, <em>Saccharomyces</em> sp and <em>Aspergillus niger. </em>The identification was based of morpohological characteristics. These fungal colonization and contamination of stored locust bean cause inedibility, reduce market value and depletion of its nutrients. Hence, adequate drying of crops, prevention of moisture re-absorption and the general improvement of storage facilities at all levels of production is recommended as a safe guard against fungi deterioration of locust bean.</p>\n\nMYCOFLORA OF STORED LOCUS BEANS (PARKIA BIGLOBOSA) PURCHASED FROM USELU MARKET<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MYCOFLORA OF STORED LOCUS BEANS (PARKIA BIGLOBOSA) PURCHASED FROM USELU MARKET", "id": 3}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE </p> <p><strong>1.0              </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Crude oils are composed of mixtures of paraffin, alicylic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Microbial communities exposed to hydrocarbons become adapted, exhibiting selective enrichment and genetic changes resulting in increased proportions of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria and bacterial plasmids encoding hydrocarbon catabolic genes (Leahy and Colwell, 2004). Adapted microbial communities have higher proportions of hydrocarbon degraders that can respond to the presence of hydrocarbon pollutants. The measurement of biodegradation rates under favorable laboratory conditions using 14C-labelled hexadecane has led to the estimation that as much as 0.5 – 60 g oil/m3 seawater convert to carbon dioxide, depending on temperature andmineral nutrient conditions. The principal forces limiting the biodegradation of polluting petroleum in the sea are the resistant and toxic components of oil itself, low water temperatures, scarcity of mineral nutrients (especiallynitrogen and phosphorous), the exhaustion of dissolvedoxygen and in previously unpolluted areas, the scarcity ofhydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms (Atlas, 2002).Low winter temperature can limit rates of hydrocarbonbiodegradation increasing resident time of oil pollutant(Bodennec et al., 2007).Bio-degradation is nature's way of recycling wastes, or breaking down organic matter intonutrients that can be used and reused by other organisms.</p> <p>In the microbiological sense,\"bio-degradation\" means that the decaying of all organic materials is carried out by a hugeassortment of life forms comprising mainly bacteria and fungi, and other organisms. This pivotal,natural, biologically mediated process is the one that transforms hazardous toxic chemicals intonon-toxic or less toxic substances. In a very broad sense, in nature, there is no waste becausealmost everything gets recycled. In addition, the secondary metabolites, intermediary moleculesor any ‘waste products’ from one organism become the food/nutrient source(s) for others,providing nourishment and energy while they are further working-on/breaking down the so called waste organic matter. Some organic materials will break down much faster than others, but all will eventually decay.By harnessing microbial communities, the natural “forces” of biodegradation, reduction of wastes and clean up of some types of environmental contaminants can be achieved. There are several reasons for which this process is better than chemical or physical processes. For example, this process directly degrades contaminants rather than merely transforming them from one form to the other, employ metabolic degradation pathways that can terminate with benign terminalproducts like CO2 and water, derive energy directly form the contaminants themselves, and canbe used <em>in situ </em>to minimize the disturbances usually associated with chemical treatment at theclean-up sites. Biological degradation of organic compounds may be considered an economicaltool for remediating hazardous waste-contaminated environments. While some environmentsmay be too severely contaminated for initial <em>in situ </em>treatment to be effective, most contaminatedmedia will use some form of biological degradation in the final treatment phase.</p> <p>Diverse groups of fungi have been isolated from oil contaminated environments and/or  have been shown to degrade hydrocarbons in the laboratory. Microbial degradation is themajor mechanism for the elimination of spilled oil from theenvironment ( Atlas, 2000.). In this study, crude oil-contaminated soil samples areas in delta state were examined with the aimof isolating fungi withhigh crude oil degrading potentials.</p> <p><strong>1.1       Justification of the study     </strong></p> <p>Various  studies have identified some micro-organisms to be able to degrade crude oil. The degrading ability of these micro organisms have been determined using different methods such as gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS), gas chromatography (GC), turbidometry, titrimetry e.t.c. Bio-degredation of crude oil is majorly carried out by bacteria and fungi. This study scientifically justifies the use of fungi to degrade crude oil. This project was therefore carried out to determine the degrading ability of fungi isolated from crude oil-contaminated soil samples using gas chromatography.</p> <p><strong>1.2  </strong><strong>Objective of the study</strong></p> <p>The specific objectives of the study are to :</p> <p>                               I.            Isolate and identify fungi from crude oil-contaminated soil sample.</p> <p>                            II.            Screen the isolates for bio-degradative abilities.</p> <p>                         III.            Assessment of the degrading abilities of the  fungi isolates by gas chromatography</p>\n\nDETERMINATION OF DEGRADINGABILITY OF FUNGI ISOLATED FROM HYDROCARBON POLLUTED SOIL ON CRUDE OIL USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DETERMINATION OF DEGRADINGABILITY OF FUNGI ISOLATED FROM HYDROCARBON POLLUTED SOIL ON CRUDE OIL USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY", "id": 4}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The seed of locust beans (<em>Parkiabiglobosa</em>) plant found growing in the Savannah Africa provides one of the popular seasonings in African diet. The nutritious and delicious food spice is popularly called “ogiri” in Igbo, “iru” in Yoruba and “dawadawa” in Hausa in Nigeria. It is heavily consumed in Nigeria, Ghana, Sierre Leone and Togo (Odunfa, 1985). It serves as source of protein for most of the people whose protein intake is low due to high cost of animal protein sources.</p> <p>The African locust bean tree, <em>Parkiabiglobosa</em>are perennial trees legumes which belongs to the sub-family mimosoideae and family leguminosae (now family fabaceae). They grow in the Savannah region of West Africa up to the southern edge of the Sahel zone 13°N (Campbell-Platte, 1980). The plant occurs in a wide range of Natural Savannah woodlands and ithas the capacity to withstand drought conditions because of its deep tap root system (Nwadiaro<em>et al.,</em> 2015). A matured locust bean tree (20-30years) can bear about a ton and above harvested fruits. From experience, the tree can start to bear fruits from 5-7 years after planting (Musa, 1991). The African locust bean tree grows to about 20m in height and has bark evergreen pinnate leaves. Its fruit is a brown leathery pod of about 10-30cm long and contains gummy pulps of an agreeable sweet taste, in which lie a number of seeds. It is important indigenous multipurpose fruit tree. <em>Parkiabiglobosa</em> tree plays vital ecological roles in recycling of nutrients from deep soil, by holding soil particles to prevent soil erosion with the aid of its roots. It also provides shade where it is found (Campbell-Platte, 1980). This tree is protected by peasant farmers and rural dwellers for its many benefits. Its wood is a source of fuel energy. It helps to enrich the soils nutrient.</p> <p>The most important use of African locust bean is found in its seed which is a legume, although it has other food and non-food uses especially the seeds which serve as a source of useful ingredients for consumption (Campbell-Platte, 1980). It has been reported that the locust bean is rich protein, carbohydrate, soluble sugars and ascorbic acid. The cotyledon is very nutritious, has less fibre and ash content. The oil content is suitable for consumption since it contains very low acid and iodine contents. The oil has very high saponification and hence would be useful in the soap industry (Alabi<em>et al.,</em> 2005). It has also been reported that the husks and pods are good for livestock (Douglass, 1996; Obiazoba, 1998). The locust bean tree is also important in medicinal practices in treatment of aliments such as bronchitis, pneumonia, malaria, diarrhoea and as poison for sore eyes (Farombi, 2003).</p> <p>Although microorganisms of all groups including bacteria, protozoa, algae, viruses, fungi together with insects and rodents play significant role in food deterioration, the most active and more versatile organisms that affect locust bean seeds and its products causing spoilage when stored are species of bacteria and fungi (Omafuvbe<em>et al.,</em> 2000). They can occur on growing crops as well as harvested commodities leading to damage ranging from rancidity, odour and flavour changes and germ layer destruction (Cutler, 1991). In a study to identify the bacterial and fungal flora of deteriorated and maggot infested samples of fermented locust bean seeds, the isolated fungal species were identified as <em>Aspergillusniger, Aspergillusflavus, Penicillium, Rhizopus</em> and <em>Candida</em>species. <em>Parkiabiglobosa</em> seeds are subject to degradation induced by diverse organisms including fungi which are among the most active microorganisms in these processes (Popoola and Akueshi, 1985). Microorganisms associated with fermented locust bean seeds have been widely studied (Odunfa, 1981; Ikenebomeh<em>et al.,</em> 1986; Odunfa and Oyewole, 1986; Ogbadu and Okagbue, 1988). Bacilli and Staphylococci were observed to dominate the fermentation together with a number of fungal species causing deterioration of this especially in storage in Northern Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.1       AIM</strong></p> <ul><li>This study is aimed at DETECTING THE FUNGI SPECIES INVOLVED IN <em>PARKIABIGLOBOSA</em>SPOILAGE.</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.2       SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <ul><li>To isolate and identify fungi associated with locust beans (<em>Parkiabiglobosa</em>).</li> <li>To determine the pH, moisture content and titratable acidity of locust beans.</li> </ul>\n\nDETECTION OF FUNGI SPECIES INVOLVED IN PARKIABIGLOBOSA SPOILAGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DETECTION OF FUNGI SPECIES INVOLVED IN PARKIABIGLOBOSA SPOILAGE", "id": 5}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The transmission of infection via fomites constitutes a major threat to public health especially in the developing countries. This study was carried out to investigate the microbial carriage and antibiotics pattern of bacteria on the door handles of campus shuttle operating in the Federal University of Technology Akure. Samples were randomly collected from a total of one hundred and fifty (150) door handles following standard laboratory techniques. Enumeration of the bacterial counts was carried out using pour plating technique while the bacteria isolates were identified using cultural, morphological and biochemical characteristics.The results show that the drivers’ door handles, front passengers’ door handles and back passengers’ door handles had overall mean aerobic bacterial counts of 195.56 ± 2.05 (x104cfu/ml), 228.08 ± 1.56 (104cfu/ml)and 176.92 ± 2.70 (x104cfu/ml) respectively. Bacteria isolated and identified were <em>Enterobacter aerogenes</em>(17.1%), <em>Escherichia coli </em>(12.4%), <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> (10.1%), <em>Proteus </em>spp. (4.7%), <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </em>(4.7%),  <em>Salmonella enteritidis</em> (2.3%),  <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>(17.1), <em>Staphyloccoccus epidermidis</em> (22.5) and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> (9.3%) while the fungal isolates were <em>Aspergillus fumigatus</em> (29.3%), <em>Aspergillus niger</em> (19.5%), <em>Candida </em>spp. (6.1%), <em>Fusarium </em>spp. (14.6%), <em>Mucor </em>spp. (9%), <em>Penicillium </em>spp. (15.9%), and <em>Rhizopus </em>spp. (3.7%). The antibiotics pattern of the bacteria indicated that all the bacteria isolated were susceptible to pefloxacin (19.25 ± 4.031-26.33 ± 4.041mm) and gentamycin (15.00 ± 2.685-25.00 ± 3.916mm) while all were resistant to amoxicillin (3.67 ± 0.082-13.75 ± 2.217mm) except <em>Enterobacter aerogenes</em>. These campus shuttles aside their usage as a means of transportation could also serve as a means of transmission of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms which pose public health risks. Personal hygiene and sanitation such as hand washing and the use of antimicrobial wipe to clean the hands could serve as a means of reducing the incidence of microbial transmission to drivers and passengers.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 Introduction</strong></p> <p>The spread of infectious disease through hand contact has been an area of major public health concern because of the frequent contact of the hand with fomites which are potential carriers of pathogenic organisms may lead to an alarming rate of outbreaks of infections transmitted by the fomites. Worldwide annually there are 1.7 million deaths from diarrhoeal diseases and 1.5 million deaths from respiratory infections (Pruss-Ustun and Covahan, 2006), these are examples of diseases which could be contracted by humans via fomites. According to (Itah, 2004), Gram positive <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and Gram negative bacteria such as <em>Escherichia coli, Klebsiella </em>species, <em>Pseudomonas </em>species, were found to contaminate various contact surfaces including chairs, tables, windows, door handles and many other common household fixtures. The presence of these pathogenic bacteria on environmental surfaces poses a potential risk to vulnerable, immune-compromised individuals (Pruss-Ustun and Covahan, 2006).</p> <p>It has been shown that hard, non-porous surfaces such as door handles have the highest bacterial transfer rates to hands (Rusin <em>et al</em>., 2002). In recent past, a lot of effort has been invested in emphasized hand hygiene through hand wipes and hand sanitizers (Hota, 2004). Hand wipes with higher ethanol content are more effective in not only antimicrobial activities but also remover of endospores via mechanical action (Stout <em>et al</em>., 2010). Even though people are commonly aware of such practices, the possibility of inaccessibility or lack of use of these practices do exist. According to Hansen and Knochel (2010) up to 60% 0f adults do not wash their hands when appropriate. People believe that microbes are only present in research laboratories, hospitals or clinics and thus they have a misleading feeling of security in other places or while touching other surfaces such as door handles (Stout <em>et al</em>., 2010). Lack of knowledge of the roles of micro-habitat such as door handles in dissemination of microorganisms is a threat to public health. In fact 80% of infections are spread through hand contact with hands or other objects (Reynold and Hurst, 2005).  Reynold and Hurst (2005) used an invisible fluorescent tracer for artificial contamination of public surfaces. They found that contamination from outside surfaces was transferred to 86% of exposed individual’s and 82% tracked the tracer to their home or personal belongings hours later. The viability of Gram positive and Gram negative organism under various environment conditions have been described (Noskin <em>et al</em>., 1995). Some microbes are infectious at very low doses and can survive for hours to weeks on nonporous surfaces, such as countertops, telephone and door handles (Reynold and Hurst, 2005).  <em>Enterococci</em>have been found to survive in dry conditions and on various fabrics utilized in the health care environment. Infectious doses of pathogen may be transferred to the mouth after handling everyday contaminated objects such as the door handles. Door handles are contaminated with various types of microorganisms including varying species of bacteria and fungi and this may be a source of nocosomial infections in hospitals. Scientific information about the occurrence of microorganisms on various objects outside the health care facilities is very little and needs to be enriched in order to educate people on the necessity of improving the habit of hand washing to reduce microbial transmission.</p> <p>In the past 60 years, antibiotics have been critical in achieving a dramatic rise in life expectancy and significant improvements in public health (El-Astal, 2005). However, disease-causing microbes have become increasingly resistant to the antibiotics commonly in use (El-Astal, 2005). It has been clearly shown that the use of antimicrobials leads to selection of resistant strains both in the individual and in the community, and overuse or inappropriate use only increases this risk (Reynold and Hurst, 2005). History suggests that microbes will never run out of ways of developing resistance, but we may run out of effective antimicrobials (Reynold and Hurst, 2005). The Gram negative enteric bacilli are common causes of a wide variety of infections involving diverse anatomic sites in both healthy and compromised hosts (El-Astal, 2005). In general, among adults, the incidence of infection due to these agents increases with age. Thus, as the mean age of the population increases, so will the number of these infections (Reynold and Hurst, 2005). Drug resistance is a serious medical problem. Progressive increase in resistance to commonly used antibiotics with many gram-negative bacilli being multidrug-resistant has been noticed (Reynold and Hurst, 2005). The emergence of antibiotic resistance in the management of infections is a serious public health issue, particularly in the developing world where apart from high level of poverty and ignorance, there is also high prevalence of fake and spurious drugs of questionable quality in circulation (El-Astal, 2005). This has led to a significant increase in morbidity.</p> <p>There also appears to be a significant lack of studies highlighting the susceptibility patterns of locally prevalent microorganisms (El-Astal, 2005).  Knowledge of etiological agents of infections and their sensitivities to available drugs is of immense value to the rational selection and use of antimicrobial agents and to the development of appropriate prescribing policies (El-Astal, 2005). Microbial transmission via several surfaces such as automated teller machines, mobile phones, door handles and currency has been extensively studied but the role of commercial buses door handles in the dissemination of pathogenic microorganisms have not been properly investigated. Therefore this research project will be centered on the role of commercial buses door handle in the transmission of pathogenic microorganism to human via hand contact and the antibiotics pattern of the potential isolates.</p> <p><strong>1.1       The objectives of the study</strong></p> <p>The aim and objectives of this research are to:</p> <p>(a) assess the role of campus shuttle door handles in dissemination of pathogenic microorganisms; and</p> <p>(b) determine the antibiotics susceptibility and resistance pattern of the potential isolates.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Justification</strong></p> <p>Over the years, different researches has been conducted to examine the role of various surfaces, such as tables, computer key boards and mobile phones on the carriage and dissemination of pathogenic infection, but the role of door handles of commercial shuttle buses as a route of microbial transmission has not been reported. Hence the need to assess the carriage and transmission of microorganism by shuttle door handles. The knowledge of this is expected to broaden our understanding of the microbial carriage of the door handles and their antibiotics pattern. This will help the University management to implement public health preventive and control measure to forestall future outbreak of infection that may result from this pathogenic microorganisms associated with the shuttle door handles.</p>\n\nANTIBIOGRAM AND MICROBIAL CARRIAGE OF CAMPUS SHUTTLE DOOR HANDLES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANTIBIOGRAM AND MICROBIAL CARRIAGE OF CAMPUS SHUTTLE DOOR HANDLES", "id": 6}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT<br/>A survey of gastrointestinal parasites of chickens was carried out in Akure, Ondo state, Nigeria between January and July, 2015. A total of three hundred and twenty seven (327) chickens of different breeds were examined for gastrointestinal infections. Faecal samples obtained from these chickens were prepared for microscopy using flotation technique. The results showed that 67 (20.5%) of the 327 chickens examined were infected with various gastrointestinal parasites. It was further observed that the highest prevalence of gastrointestinal infection (36.7%) was recorded among the chickens that were kept in semi-intensive management system while the lowest prevalence was recorded among those kept in intensive management system. Laboratory screening of the faecal samples for parasites revealed three types of protozoa: Eimeria spp. (7.7%), Histomonas meleagridis (0.6%) and Giardia lamblia (0.3%). Five types of nematodes were also observed among the chickens, these included: Ascaridia galli, (7.0%), Heterakis gallinarum (1.8%), Capillaria spp. (0.9%), Syngamus trachea (0.6%) and Trichostrongylus tenuis (1.6%). Of all these parasites, Eimeria spp. was the most prevalent (7.7%) while Gardia lamblia was the least prevalent (0.3%). The average parasite burden per fowl was found to be 2 and majority of the encountered parasites species were those of the subjects’ small intestines.</p>\n\nPREVALENCE OF GASTROINTESTINAL PARASITES OF CHICKENS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PREVALENCE OF GASTROINTESTINAL PARASITES OF CHICKENS", "id": 7}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study was aimed at investigating the microbial load and the quality of indoor air Faith Mediplex Centre, Benin City, to ascertain their contribution to infection rate in the hospital. Air samples were assessed for three (3) months (June-August, 2015) using the settled plate methods. The study sites were divided into five (5) units; male medical ward, female medical ward, treatment room, operating theatre and outside the hospital gate. The result obtained reveal the isolation of six (6) bacterial isolates and four (4) fungal isolates which include <em>Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus </em>spp<em>., Serrantia mercescen, Klebsiella </em>spp<em>., </em>and<em> Micrococcus</em> spp. for the bacterial isolates, while the four (4) fungal isolates include <em>Aspergillus niger</em>, <em>Aspergillus  flavus, Penicillium </em>spp.and<em> Candida albicans. </em>The highest bacterial load and fungal load of 95.5cfu/min and 43.5cfu/min respectively were recorded outside the hospital gate, and the lowest bacterial and fungal load of 45cfu/min and 26.5cfu/mins respectively were recorded in the male medical ward for both bacterial and fungal. The most frequently occurring bacterial and fungal isolates were<em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>and <em>Aspergillus niger</em>respestively, occurring at 100%. All units that were included in the study were contaminated with bacteria and fungi. The bacteria and fungi concentrations of air obtained in this study might be potential risk factors for spread of nosocomial infection in the Hospital hence a high level of hygiene must be practiced by both patients and health care providers.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0     INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>        Air supplies us with oxygen which is essential for our bodies to live. Pure air is a mixture of gases that are invisible, colorless and odorless consisting of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and other gases as well as varying amounts of water vapor (Murray <em>et al</em>., 1995). This pure air can become contaminated in various ways affecting humans, plants and animals. Air pollution is the introduction into the atmosphere of chemicals, particulate matter or biological materials that causes discomfort, disease or death to humans, damage to other living organisms including food crops. Both indoor air and outdoor air can become polluted by pesticides. These pesticides contain active and inert substances such as cyclodiene which is associated with symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, weakness, muscle twitching and nausea (Hays <em>et al</em>., 1995).</p> <p>        Good indoor air quality (IAQ) is important for all of us; most people spend 90 % or more of their time indoors. Most of this time consists of the hours spent at home or at work, while school age children spend 20 % of their time in schools (Clench-Aas <em>et al</em>., 1999). Good IAQ consists of many aspects; it is an interaction of a functioning and efficient ventilation and the lowest achievable amount of chemical, inorganic or organic and microbial compounds which should not evoke symptoms in the occupants (Spengler <em>et al</em>., 2001).</p> <p>       Microorganisms such as bacterial and fungal spores are almost always present in the air. The quality of indoor environment, however, is not easily defined or readily controlled, and can potentially place human occupants at risk (Jaffal, <em>et al</em>., 1997a). Airborne transmission is one of the routes of spreading disease that is responsible for several nosocomial infections (Claudete <em>et al</em>., 2006).</p> <p>        Exposure to bio-aerosols, containing airborne microorganisms and their by-products, can result in respiratory disorders and other adverse health effects such as infections, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and toxic reactions (Gorny <em>et al</em>., 2002; Fracchia <em>et al</em>., 2006).</p> <p>        Indoor air quality is a term which refers to the air quality within and around buildings and structures especially as it relates to the health and comfort of its occupants. Indoor air can be polluted by various compounds such as carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter and microbial contaminants (moulds, bacteria, viruses) and any action that introduces harmful contaminants into the air within the building. The concern for quality indoor air is necessary especially in institutionalized settings that accommodate a large number of people such as hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, schools, family because contaminated air can cause both mild and severely irritating health conditions (Tambeker <em>et al</em>., 2007). The quality of air in hospitals in relation to microbial contamination at a given time period is determined by the quality of air entering into the building, the number of occupants in the building, their physical activities and resultant aerosol generation, human traffic and the efficiency of ventilation (Adebolu and Vhirterhre, 2002).                     </p> <p>        Indoor air quality in hospitals is a concern due to presence of airborne microorganisms that may cause nosocomial infections (Beggs CB, 2003). Few published reports have studied the seasonal fluctuations in microbial loads over time in hospital environment (Augustowska and Dutkiewicz, 2006). While studies in developing countries have documented presence of nosocomially significant bacteria and fungi in indoor air of healthcare facilities (Sudharsanam <em>et al</em>., 2008; Ekhaise <em>et al</em>., 2008), these studies were not performed over extended time periods to ascertain the influence of seasonal changes on airborne microbial loads.</p> <p>        Nosocomial infection also known as hospital acquired infection is an infection acquired in a hospital environment, which was not present in the patient at the time of admission (Beggs, 2003). Hospitals are potentially conducive for antimicrobial resistant and virulent pathogens to proliferate. Large numbers of microorganisms are found in indoor air and it is of great importance to carry out regular survey as a yardstick of determining standard of cleanliness in hospitals (Williams <em>et al</em>., 1956). The sources of hospital airborne infection or contamination could be traced to a variety of factors. These include the patient’s own normal flora, linens, bed sheets, staff clothes, visitors and the materials such as flowers. Activity of patients (sneezing, coughing, talking, yawning) and the number of patients per room may likewise be sources of hospital infection (Jaffal <em>et al</em>., 1997a; Ekhaise <em>et al</em>., 2008; 2010). It has also been reported that microbiological pollutants such as animal droplets, plants, building materials and air conditioning system have played significant role in the spread of airborne microflora. Materials such as files kept close to bedside in surgical wards have been implicated as a viable source (Burge <em>et al</em>., 2000).</p> <p><strong>1.1     AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>        This study was aimed at investigating the microbial load and the quality of indoor air of four difference wards/units and outside the hospital gate of Faith Mediplex Centre, Benin City.</p> <ol><li>To isolate and characterize the airborne micro-flora from hospital environment and to ascertain their contribution to infection rate in the hospital.</li> </ol>\n\nMICROBIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF INDOOR AND OUTDOOR AIR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MICROBIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF INDOOR AND OUTDOOR AIR", "id": 8}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0    INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Water is indispensable and intricately connected to life, without which there is no life. This is the reason for which water must be given the necessary attention at all times. Good drinking water is not a luxury; it is one of the most essential amenities of life itself. The supply of safe drinking water to all has therefore engaged the attention of many individuals, groups, governmental organizations and private organizations. (Adetunde et al. 2010).</p> <p> Drinking water free of pathogenic organisms is fundamental to breaking one of the principal transmission routes of infectious disease. This fact has stimulated worldwide investment in the construction of water systems that are designed to meet stringent water quality standards. (Trevett, 2004).</p> <p> Waterborne pathogens, including a variety of viral, bacterial, algal and protozoan agents, account for much of the estimated 4 billion cases and 2.5 million deaths from endemic diarrheal disease each year. (Kosek et al. 2003).</p> <p> Increase in human population has exerted an enormous pressure on the provision of safe drinking water, especially in developing countries (Umeh et al. 2005). Unsafe water is a global public health threat, placing persons at risk for a host of diarrheal and other disease as well as chemical intoxication (Hughes et al. 2005). Unsanitary water particularly has devastating effects on young children in developing world. Each year, more than 2 million persons, mostly children less than 5 years of age, die of diarrheal disease (Kosek et al. 2003; Parashar et al. 2003).</p> <p> Nearly 90% of diarrheal-related deaths have been attributed to unsafe or inadequate-water supplies and sanitation conditions affecting a large part of the world’s population (Hughes et al. 2005; WHO 2004). An estimated 2.6 billion persons lack access to adequate sanitation (Okonko et al. 2008).</p> <p>The University of Benin, Benin City, has 5 main halls of residence (halls 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). There are also various staff quarters in the school: Junior Staff Quarter, Senior Staff Quarter, Dentistry Quarter and Doctor’s Quarter.

It is one of the most popular fermented milk products in the world and produced commercially at home. (Willey <em>et al., </em>2008). In its commercial production, non fat or low fat milk is pasteurized cooled to 43°c and are inoculated with known cultures of microorganisms referred to as starter cultures. The starter cultures may be a pure culture of a particular species of <em>Lactobacillus </em>or a mixed culture of <em>Streptococcus thermophilus </em>and <em>Lactobacillus bulgaricus </em>in a 1: 1 ratio. The coccus which is the <em>Streptococcus thermophilus </em>grows faster than the Rod which is the <em>Lactobacillus bulgaricus </em>and is primarily responsible for acid production while the rod adds flavor and aroma. The growth of these Microorganisms causes the transformation of milk's sugar, lactose into lactic acid. This process gives yoghurt it's texture. The associative growth of the two organisms results in acid production at a rate greater than that produced by them individually. <br/>Yoghurt is generally made from a standardized mixture containing whole milk, partially defatted milk, condensed skim milk cream and non fat dry milk. Alternatively milk may be partly concentrated by removal of 15- 20% water in a vacuum pan or by heating. While the microorganisms fermenting milk confers on it certain health benefits inadequate pasteurized milk may contain microorganism of special importance to man. (Boor and Murphy, 2002). In which its presence or absence in milk may reflect success or failure of good manufacturing practice (GMP) or cause infection when consumed together with food. This is of economic significance in Africa where the HIV/AIDS and cancer scourge has left the public who consume milk products immune suppressed and prone to bacterial and fungi infection. (Boor,2001). <br/>Health complications associated with consumption of inadequately pasteurized milk products include serious infections that are hard, to treat with antibiotics. This becomes clinically significant if organisms isolated from an assessed sample is resistant to conventional antibiotics. Thus, can confer antibiotic resistance to the infected host while providing no alternative drug (Gould, 1994). Heat treated yoghurt do not contain lactic acid bacteria as these are killed during post fermentation. Yoghurt manufacturing companies mainly market \"heat treat\" yoghurt to prolong it's shelf life (Hove <em>et </em>al, 1999). It is important however to evaluate the microbial gravity of some milk products sold in Nigeria. This project work aims at assessing the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of microorganisms present in yoghurt sold in Enugu.</p>\n\nMICROBIAL CONTAMINATION OF YOUGHURT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION OF YOUGHURT", "id": 10}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <ol><li><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></li> </ol> <p><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong><br/>The number of people with high blood pressure is in the increase and research has shown that this condition is heightened by overweight of the patient. That is to say, the more one increases in weight, the higher the tendency of him or her becoming hypertensive. Mori TA (2007).<br/>In essence, there is a symbolic relationship between being over-weight and being hypertensive or having high blood pressure. It is in the interest of people who are likely to develop high blood pressure (over-weight people) to seek out ways of managing their weight, as this research work will try to bring out the effects of weight on such people with high blood pressure. What seems unresolved here is the extent to which weight affect people suffering from high blood pressure. Many writers’ views will be examined in the cause of this work to help resolve the issue at stake.<br/>Over-weight here will be described or rather defined based on a calculation called “Body mass index” (BMI). According to this formular, one is regarded as over-weight if his BMI is greater than 25. Mancia G. (2007). High  blood pressure on the other hand occurs when one’s blood move through the arteries at a higher speed than normal. It is also known that for now there is no cure for high blood pressure. Papadakis A, Macphere J. (2008).<br/>The seriousness of this adult illness (high blood pressure) is not just that it can lead to more serious illness or complications, raises the risk of stroke, kidney failure, heart disease and heart attack. The matter is made worse with the existence of too much weight or fat in the body as this tends to make the condition severe.<br/>It is the duty of stakeholders in health sectors to keep the adult folk aware of the implication of over-weight by providing them with accurate, timely and up to date information regarding this health condition. It is also the duty of health personnel to warn and educate adults who are more prone to high blood pressure, about the dangers of over-weight in the management of high blood pressure. This awareness is expected to affect the feeding habit of these people, since it has been observed that poor feeding (that is, poor combination of the classes of food, not necessarily the quantity) is one of the causes of over-weight. Sacks F.M (2008).<br/>Statistics have it that between the years 2000 and 2008, there has been about fourty percent (40%) increase in the number of people having high blood pressure. Manson J (2009). Another statistics show that in 2005, sixty percent (60%) of people suffering from high blood pressure were suffering also from kidney failure and heart disease, and that high blood pressure was identified as the remote cause of the disease that later led to the death of a greater percentage of the patients. Manson J. (2009).<br/>It is believed in many quarters that some of the findings above and many more are the reasons for the recent step-up in action in the area of high blood pressure management. Hence, many Nigerians knowing the cost of managing such diseases that tends to originate from high blood pressure hightened by over-weight, seem to have woken to the call on “healthy and fit”.<br/>This research therefore, would not have been more timely than this. As a matter of fact, it is this situation on ground that necessitated this research work.<br/><strong>1.2 AIMS AND OBJECTIVE</strong><br/>-This project work is aimed at investigating whether there is a relationship between weight and blood pressure of patients with high blood pressure.<br/>- To estimate the regression model between the variables based on the sample collected.<br/>-To test the significance of the coefficient of regression.<br/>-To determine the extent and direction of the relationship between the variables; weight and blood pressure.</p> <p><strong>1.3 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This project work is designed to cover the statistical model of effects of weight on thirty (30) patients with high blood pressure in the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital Ituku/Ozalla Enugu State. The data used is a secondary data collected from the laboratory unit of the Hospital.</p> <p><strong>1.4 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The limitations of the project work is mostly the difficulties encountered during data collection some of these difficulties are as follows:-<br/>-The cost of getting project materials, data and the time constrained in carrying out the project work.<br/>-The unwillingness of the offices incharge, to release information and data as expected.<br/>-The data used are secondary data and as such, some errors (generated errors) might have been committed.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This project work will help individuals to predict their blood pressure given their weight and will equally help them to know what to do when their weight is becoming too much.</p> <p><strong>1.6 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>-Weight: This is how heavy somebody or something is which can be measured in, for example kilograms or pounds.<br/>-Height: This is the measurement of how tall a person or thing is.<br/>-High blood pressure: This occurs when one’s blood move through the arteries at a higher pressure than normal.</p> \n\nTHE EFFECT OF WEIGHT ON BLOOD PRESSURE OF HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF WEIGHT ON BLOOD PRESSURE OF HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>This study was conducted to determine the antibiotic resistance profile of Escherichial Coli isolate from apparently healthy domestic livestock viz: cow, goats and chicken from Osun State Nigeria. E. Coli was isolated using Eosin methylene Blue Agar (EMB) and identified by conventional microbiological technique. The isolate were tested against 14 antibiotics using the disc diffusion method. A total of 42 different antibiotics resistance profile were observed with each isolate showing resistance to at least four or more drugs tested. Generally, the E. coli isolates showed resistance rates of 93.8% to Ampicilin; 15.3% to Chloramphenicol, 52.7% to cloxacillin, 74.3% Erythromycin, 20.9% to Gentamicin, 53.8% to Penicillin, 17.7% to Streptomycin, 67.3% to Tetracyclin, 21.1% to Ceftazidine 70.7% to Cefuroxine, 20.5% to Cefixine, 28.8% to Ofloxacine, 58.6% to Augmentin, 27.2% to Nitorfurantion 27.3% to Ciprofloxacin. Statistical analysis showed that average number of resistance phenotypes per isolate was significantly higher for cow compared with poultry. A significant public health concern observed in this study is that multi drug resistant: commensal E.

Also water is a molecule that consist of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, when these atoms are heated to a high temperature they join to for water. It occurs in three natural states solid, liquid and gaseous states. Water and ice covered about 75% of the earth surface and water vapour is an important constituent of the atmosphere (Ababio 1985) It exists under major two types which include:. <br/><strong>Surface Water: </strong>They include the streams, lakes, and shallow wells. The air through which the rain passes may contaminate the water.</p> <p><strong>Ground Water: </strong>They originate from deep well and subterraneous springs. This is virtually free of bacteria due to filtering action of soil deep sand and rock. However, it may be come contaminated when it flows along the channels. <br/>Water in Microbiology can be contaminated when it contains a chemical or biological poison or an infectious agent. These condition also apply to water which is polluted except that the agent or poison is often obvious and water carries an unpleasant taste or appearance. (Encyclopedia America 1988). <br/>Portability refers to the drinkability of water when it is fit for drinking, when unportable it is unfit for consumption due to some contaminant or pollutant (Earnet 1974) other sources of contamination are various types of establishments and agricultural farm etc. Possible sources of microbial contamination of a body of water are soil and agricultural run-off, farm animals, industrial waste, discharges from sewage treatment plants and storm water run-off from urban areas.  <br/>Contamination by sewage or human excrement and pollution by animals causes the greatest danger associated with drinking water in most developing countries. So it is necessary to examine the quality of water before consumption.    <br/>Monitoring and detection of indicator and disease causing microorganisms are a major part of sanitary microbiology. Bacteria from the intestinal tract generally do not survive in the aquatic environment. They are under physiological stress and gradually lose their ability to form colonies on differential and selective media (Prescott 7th Edition).</p>\n\nISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM IN STREAM WATER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF MICROORGANISM IN STREAM WATER", "id": 13}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0                                                       INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>Gases, dust particles, water vapour and air contain microorganisms. There are vegetable cells and spores of bacteria, fungi and algae, viruses and protozoa cysts. Since air is often exposed to sunlight, it has a higher temperature and less moisture. So, if not protected from desiccation. Most of these microbial forms will die. Air serves as transport or dispersal medium for microorganism they occur in relatively small number in air when compared with soil or water. The microflora of air can be studied under two headings outdoor and indoor microflora. <br/><strong>Outdoor Microflora:</strong> - The air in the atmosphere, which is found outside the buildings, is referred to as outside air. The dominant microflora of outside air are fungi. The two common genera of fungi are <em>cladosporiul</em> and <em>sporobolomyces</em>, besides this two general, under general found in air are <em>Aspergillus</em>, <em>Alternaria</em>, <em>Phytophthora</em> and <em>Erysiphe</em>. The outdoor air also contains <em>besidispores, ascopres</em> of yeast, fragments of <em>mycelium</em> and <em>canidia</em> of molds. Among the bacterial genera <em>Bacillus</em> and <em>clostridium,</em> <em>sarcina</em>, <em>mirococcus</em>, <em>corynebacterium</em> and <em>Achromobacter</em> are widely found in the outside air, the number and kind of microorganism may very from place to place, depending upon the human population densities.</p> <p><strong>Indoor Microflora:</strong> - The air found inside the building is referred to as indoor air. The commonest genera of fungi in indoor air are <em>penicillium, Aspergillus</em>, the Commonest genera of bacteria found in indoor air are <em>Staphylococci,</em> <em>Bacillus</em> and <em>Clostridium</em>. In case of occupants being infected, the composition shows slight variations with latitude and to a lesser extent with attitude. The ozone owes its existence in the atmosphere to photosynthesis from oxygen under the influence of solar ultraviolet radiations. (Dr. Shiva, 2009).      <br/>There is no microbes are native to the atmosphere rather they represent allochthonous populations transperted from aquatic and terrestrial habits into the atmosphere. Microbe of air within 300 – 1,000 or more feet of the Earth’s surface are the organisms of soil that have become attached to fragments of dried leaves, strain or dust particles, being blown away by the wind. Species vary greatly in their sensitivity to a given value of relative humidity, temperature and radiation exposure.<br/>More microbes are found in air over land masses than far at sea. Spores of fungi especially <em>Alterneria, Cladosporium, Penicillium</em> and <em>Aspergillus</em> are more numberous than other forms over sea within about 400 miles of land in both polar and tropical air masses at all altitudes up to about 10,000 feet. <br/>Microbes found in air over populated land areas below altitude of 500 feet in clear weather include spores of <em>Becillus</em> and <em>Clostridium</em> <em>ascos</em>-<em>pores</em> of <em>yeasts</em>, <em>fragments</em> of <em>mycelium</em> and <em>spores</em> of <em>molds</em> and <em>streptomycetaceae</em>, <em>pollen</em> <em>pootozoan</em> <em>cysts</em>, <em>algae</em>, <em>micrococcus</em>, <em>corynebacterium</em> etc. <br/>In the dust and air of schools and hospital wards or the rooms of persons suffering from infectious disease, microbe such as <em>tubercle</em> <em>bacilli</em>, <em>streptococci</em>, <em>pneumococci</em> and <em>staphylocci</em> have been demonstrated. These respiratory bacteria are dispersed in air in the droplets of saliva and mucus produced by coughing, sneezing, talking and laughing. <br/>Viruses of respiratory tract and some enteric are also transmitted from the objects contaminated with infectious secretions that after drying become infectiou dust. Droplet are usually formed by sneezing, coughing and talking. Each droplet consists of saliva and mucus and each may contain thousands of microbes. It has been estimated that the number of bacteria in a single sneeze may be between 10,000 and 100,000. Small droplets in a warm dry atmosphere are dry before they reach the floor and thus quickly become droplet nuclei. <br/>Many plant pathogens are also transported from one field to another through air and the spread of many fungal diseases of plants can be predicted by measuring the concentration of airborne fungal spores. Human bacterial pathogen which cause important airborne disease such as <em>diphtheria</em>, <em>meningitis</em>, <em>pneumonia</em>, <em>tuberculosis</em>, and <em>whcoping</em> <em>cough</em> are described in the chapter “Bacterial Disease man” <br/>Air does not have an indigenous and flora, though a number of micro-organism are present in the air. Air is not a natural environment for microorganisms as it doesn’t contain enough moisture and nutrients to support their growth and reproduction. Quite a number of sources have been studied in this connection and almost all of them have been found to be responsible for the air microflora. One of the most common sources of air microflora is the soil. Soil microorganisms when distributed by the wind blow librated into the air and remain suspended therefore along period of time. Man made actions like digging or ploughing the soil may be release soil born microbes into the air. Similarly microorganisms found in water may also be released into the air in the form of water droplets or aerosols, splashing of water by wind action a tidal action may also produce droplets or aerosols?  </p>\n\nISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF AIR MICROFLORA IN MICROBIOLOGY LABORATORY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF AIR MICROFLORA IN MICROBIOLOGY LABORATORY", "id": 14}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Yoghurt is a fermented milk product, produced with a yoghurt starter culture which is a mixed culture of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus in a 1:1 ratio. S thermophilusenjoys a faster growth than L hulgricus.  It adds flavours and aroma to the yoghurt, though both organisms in association produces lactic acid but acetaldehyde and dimethyl propanol, the chief favour component of yoghurt is produced by L bulgaricus.</p><p> <strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong> </p> <p>          Every producer be it private or public more especially profit making has objectives in mind to achieve, some of which are to sue a process/method that is convenient and hygienic for himself, workers and to the final consumer of his product (yoghurt).<br/>Lack of research has landed many producers of yoghurt into confusion on the method and process of producing yoghurt, thereby producing a substandard yoghurt which may not meet the taste of the consumers like “mouth feel and appearance”.  They need to know the various methods and different materials that are used in yoghurt which will improve its general quality.<br/>Moreover whichever method that is chosen must be economical in all aspect, so that the producers will have some profit after calculating the cost and the products retail price will not be too much for the average consumer to afford.</p><p> <strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong> </p> <p>          Many producers of yoghurt are confused on the methods and process of producing yoghurt, consequently, producing substandard yoghurt which may not meet the taste of the consumer.<br/>However, this research work is aimed at developing appropriate process of producing yoghurts. <br/>The research work is also aimed at solving the problems of different methods of processing yoghurt.<br/>Also, it is aimed at assessing the economic aspect of the different methods of producing yoghurt which are economical in terms of the cost.</p><p> <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong> </p> <p>          This project is important to all producers, students and researchers in food based discipline as it studies and assess different methods adopted in yoghurt production.  It will help students and researchers to know the various materials used in the production of yoghurt which will improve its general quality.<br/>This research work will also provide suitable methods for the production of yoghurt, which will be economical (to cover the cost of materials used for production).</p><p> <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong> </p> <p>          Yoghurt production is very expensive and most of its methods are tedious.<br/>Most yoghurt produced, cannot keep for a long time due to the inability of the producers to get the right materials fro the production of yoghurt.<br/>The PH at which yoghurt is produced is also another problem, because if the right PH is not gotten and controlled and if it exceeds that PH level the taste will be too acidic and will not give that sour taste peculiar to yoghurt.  Also PH above four (4) favours the growth of some microorganism such as coliforms, staphylococci, pseudomonas etc.  These microorganisms can contaminate the milk, thereby making unfit for the consumers.  In food processing we have garbage in garbage out which means that if you starts with a pour raw material you are equally coming out with pour finished product.</p><p> <strong>1.5     LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong> </p> <p>This project is limited in scope to the various methods of producing yoghurt;

No one doubts the importance of food in our lives. All active living organisms must have a constant serviced of energy  this  energy may be supplied by materials a cell or organism has stored internally (e.g  our fat  or carbohydrate) or it may come from an external source in the environment food (Nutrition) supplies two major component of life, ENERGY and the chemical  building blood of life, (Bor).</p> <p>Energy is required for the various enzymatic reaction that require an input of energy for the reaction, the catalyze for example the movement of the muscles on our legs during a race or in their intestine as we digest our intest meal on to draw air into lungs for breathing all requires energy.</p> <p>Food  also supplies the structural material required for living organisms to make new macromolecules for repair of damage structure  or for new construction such as the manufacturing of off springs,. Apart from it vital function of substaing life, food is referred to as labours of pathogenic  organisms, if not prepared in a tidy and clean environment. This has been recognized as a problem in some restinants in Enugu, concerned with providing proper food for consumers.</p> <p>Pathogenic organisms  exist in two major categories. INTOXICATIONS –INFECTION. Intoxication is a result of ingesting toxins produced by microbes that have grown on the food prior to it being eaten. Infection is the result of the food serving as a forniute that carries an infection pathogen deep into the juicy recesses of a body where it is able to gain a foot . generally food pathogenic organism results from contamination of food and the subsequent growth of food pathogenic organisms.</p> <p>Food poisoning out breaks are of recognized by the sudden  on set of  illness with a shout period of    time among many individual who have eaten or drunk one or more food (Jollodf rice) in common. Single cases are difficult to identify unless in botulism for example there are distinct symptom. Food pathogenic organism may be one of the most common cause of actuate illness, yet cases and difficult to identify vnlesssas in Botulision for example </p> <p>There are distant Symptom. Food pathogenic organism may be one of the most common causes of acute illness. Yet cases and outbreaks are generally under recognized and under-requited.   The number of bacterial present : food (jolloff rice) may be used to determined whether or not the food (jolloff rice ) has been handled correctly.

The human body which contains about 1013 cells routinely harbors about 1014 bacteria. This bacterial population constitutes the normal microbial flora. The normal microbial flora is relatively stable with specific genera populating various body regions during particular periods in an individual’s life. Tannock (1995). <br/>Microorganisms of the normal flora may aid the host [By competing for micro-environment more effectively than such pathogens <em>Salmonella Spp </em>or by producing nutrients that the host can use. It may harm the host by causing dental caries, abscesses or other infectious diseases or it may exist as commercials by inhabiting the host for long periods without causing detectable harm or benefits. Even though most elements of the normal microbial flora inhabiting the human skin, nails, eyes, genitalia and gastrointestinal tract are harmless in healthy individuals, these organisms frequently cause disease in compromised hosts. <br/>The normal flora in human usually develops in an orderly sequence, after birth leading to the stable populations of bacteria that made up the normal adult flora. The main factor determining the composition of the normal flora in a body region is the nature of the local environment which is determined by pH, temperature, redox potential, oxygen, water and nutrient levels. Other factors such as peristalsis, saliva hysozyme secretion and secretion of immunoglobulin also play roles in flora control. The local environment is like a concern to in which one principal instrument usually dominates. For example, an infact begins to contact organisms as it moves through the birth canal. A gram positive population [<em>Bifido</em> <em>bacteria</em>] predominates in the gastrointestinal tract early in life. If the infant is breast-fed. This bacterial population is reduced and displaced some what by a gram negative flora [<em>Entero</em> <em>bacteriaceae</em>] when the baby is bottle feel. The type of liquid diet provided to the infant is the principal instrument of this flora controls, immunoglobulins and perhaps other element is breast milk may also be important.</p>\n\nBACTERIAL COLONIZATION ON HUMAN SKIN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " BACTERIAL COLONIZATION ON HUMAN SKIN", "id": 17}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER  </strong><strong>1.0                                                       INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p>Fungi are a major group of living things, originally considered plants lacking chlorophyll, leaves, true stems, roots and reproducing by spores, but now treated as the separate kingdom fungi.<br/>They occur in all environments on the planet and include important decomposers and parasites. Parasitic fungi infect animals including human, other animals, birds, and insects with consequences varying from mild itching to death, in general, humans have a high level of inmate immunity to fungi and most of the infections they cause are mild and self limiting (Adeleke, 2006).<br/>Fungi are contacted during our everyday routines, some which are potentially pathogenic to human and other not human could be exposed simply by walking by a construction areas were the oil has been disturbed and scattered into the wind by the machinery, also can be exposed while jogging, hiking, hunting and fishing. The study of fungi as animal and human pathogen is called mycology (Emmons 1979)<br/>Also, they are eukaryotic, unicellular, or multi-cellular organisms that, because they lack chlorophyll, are dependent upon external food sources. They are ubiquitous in all environments and play a vital role in the Earth’s ecology by decomposing organic matter. Familiar fungi includes yeasts, rusts, smuts, mushrooms, puffballs, and bracket fungi. Many species of fungi live as commensal organisms in or on the surfaces of the human body. “Mold” is the common term for multicellular fungi that growths as a material of intertwined microscopic filaments (hyphae).  Exposure of molds and other fungi and their spores is unavoidable except when the most stringent of air filtration, isolation, and environmental sanitation measures are observed, e.g in organ transplant isolation units.</p> <p>Molds and other fungi may adversely affect human health through three processes. (1) allergy (2) infection and (3) toxicity. One can estimate that about 10% of the population has allergic antibodies to fungal antigens. Only half of these, or 5%, would be expected to show clinical illness. Furthermore, outdoor molds are generally more abundant and important in airway allergic disease than indoor molds leaving the latter with an important, but minor over all role in allergic airway disease.</p>\n\nFUNGAL COLONIZATION ON HUMAN BODY SURFACES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FUNGAL COLONIZATION ON HUMAN BODY SURFACES", "id": 18}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> <p>Comparative analysis  of water was  carried out on well water, stream and pipe born water obviated within Emene locality of Enugu state the sample were subjected to some analytical tests final like presumptive tests, comfirmative test final like presumptive tests, comfirmative test, completed test, indole test and plate count for the organism that develop on  the culture, the result show that well water and stream were found to contain pathogenic organism like salmonella, Shigella and staphylococcus  aureus  as well as numerous viable counts, the cloform or the  indicator organisms Escherichia coli the family of enterbactercteriaceae were isolated too form well water the pipe borne water a sample contained staphylococcus  aureus and have lowtotal viable counts. </p> TABLE OF CONTENTS  CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION                                            <p>1.1       Aims and objective                                                                </p> <p>1.2       Statement of problem                                                                        </p> <p>1.3       Hypothesis                                                                 </p> <p>1.4       Significance of study                                                             </p> <p>1.5       Limitations                                                                               </p> <p><strong>2.0              </strong><strong>CHAPTER TWO LITERATURE REVIEW                  </strong></p> <p>2.1              water analysis                                                </p> <p><strong>3.0       CHAPTER THREE: MATERIALS AND METHOD    </strong></p> <p>3.1       Sample collection                                                                               </p> <p>3.2       Preparation of media                                                                          </p> <p>3.3       Sterilization of materials                                                                    </p> <p>3.4       Multiple tubes technique                                                                    </p> <p>3.5       Presumptive test                                                                                 </p> <p>3.6       Confirmed test                                                                                                 </p> <p>3.7       Completed test                                                                                               </p> <p>3.8       Test for indole                                                                                                </p> <p>3.9       Methyl red test                                                                                               </p> <p>3.10 Oxidase test                                                                                           </p> <p>3.1.1 catalse test                                                                                           </p> <p>3.12 plate counts techniques                                                             </p> <p>3.13     preparation of single and double strength media                   </p> <p>3.14 dilution technique in most problem number       `                      </p> <p>3.15 Inoculation of media with water samoltes         </p> <p><strong>GRAM STAIN TECHNIQUE                                                       </strong></p> <p><strong>4.0 CHAPTER FOUR: RESULTS</strong>                                                            </p> <p>4.1 Colony counts                                                                                         </p> <p>4.2 Most problem number (mpn) and pH result.                               </p> <p>5.0              Chapter five.

From time immemorial, man has restorted to the use of this unique commodity for domestic and other purposes.</p> <p>Most of our water supplies are from surface water which include: rivers, streams, lakes, oceans and seas and there water bodies are likely to be polluted with domestic and Industrial as well as agriculture waste, As populations increase, the problem become more serious and as such, water can endanger the health and life of human beings because when polluted by fecal materials it becomes potential carrier of pathogenic organism (Carpenter 1977).</p> <p>Water, is of course, absolutely essential to life, not only human life but all life, animal and vegetable. Most of the biochemical reaction that occur in metabolism and growth of living cells involved water, and all take places in water. (Camp etal,1974).</p> <p>Man uses water not only for drinking purposes but also for bathing, washing, laundering, heating, air conditioning, agriculture, stock raising and gardens, Industrial processes and cooling water power and steam power, fire protection, fishing, swimming and wild life propagation and navigation.</p> <p>Natural water contain not only then natural flora but also micro – organisms from soil and possible from animals or sewage. Surface waters in streams or pools and stored waters in lakes and large ponds vary considerably in microbial content. (frazier 1978) water is broadly divided into three types viz., surface water which include: streams, rivers, lakes  sear, and oceans Kelman et al (1957)</p> <p>The ground water, well borehle, many people have defined the ground water in different ways: ground water is subter water that occurs where all pores in the soil or rock counting materials are saturated (pelezer et al 1992).</p> <p>The atmospheric water, which includes rain, falls. All water bodies consist of a variety of bacterial and other microorganisms like the Algaes fungi, which inhabit these natural water bodies. Some of these micro –organisms are indigenous to thus natural water while others are transient, entering the water from external environment (Pelezar and Reg, 1997).</p> <p>The generality of bacteria are mostly commonly found ordinarily in fresh water some of which include:  pseudomonas, Archacbacter, and vibrio these are gram negative, the gram-positive bacterial which are found in water include: micrococcus Archacbacter and actinomycentes. Gebharal (1975)  Tap water, as one of the water sources is mostly used domestically, it is observed that tap change sometime the water tap will be clear this calls for load, in order to be sure of its portability. Bonde (1977)</p> <p>The increase in drinking water from different sources especially in Enugu state has made necessary to investigate the microbial content of water. Water is a potential carried of pathogenic organisms that can endage human life. Most of drinking water sources are often contaminated with different pollutants like faces, animal and plant wastes, making such water  unfit for drinking if not treated. The pollution of water with pathogenic organisms and other pollutants can only be detected by carrying out microbiological assessment of such water. Most human disease such as typhoid paratyphoid cholera, arnboebiasis, Trichinosis, gastroenteritis, sanonall shigellosis, diphtheria, giadia, dracunculus etc are know to be water borne disease.

This usually begins in week 6 and peaks during week 22 to 24 of pregnancy due to a number of factors including ureteral dilatation, increased bladder Volume and decreased  bladder  tone.  Along with decreased  ureteral tone which contributes to increased urinary stasis and ureterovesical reflux (chaliha et al, 2002). Up to 70% of pregnant women develop glyucosuria, which encouraged bacteria growth in the urine (AI.  Issa, 2009). It may manifest as Asympromatic  bacteriuria (ASB) or symptomic Bacteriuria (SB).  The  prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria UTI has been previously reported to be 2% to 13% in pregnant women (Delzell et al, 2000).  Compared with that of symptomatic Bacteriuria in (UTI) which occur in 1-18% during pregnancy. Urinary tract infection (UTI) during pregnancy may cause complications such as Pyelonephritis, hypertensive disease of pregnancy, anaemia, chronic renal failure premature delivery and foetal mortality.</p> <p>(Dwyer, et al 2002). The incidence of these complications can be decreased by treating promptly Asymptomatic Bacteriuria (ASB) and Symptomatic (SB) during pregnancy due to the potential adverse sequelea of Urinary tract infection in pregnancy. Most  clinic perform routine urinalysis of midstream urine specimen  during one or more antenatal clinic (ANC) visits (Smaill 2007). However, culture and antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing are needed for  surveillar purposes  to guide the clinician on the proper management and prevent empirical  treatment of pregnant women with (ASB) and  (SB).</p> <p> A limited spectrum of organisms cause UTI and these include <em>Escherichia Coli</em>, which accounts  for the majority of uncomplicated urinary tract infection Isolates.  (crupta, et al, 2001). Others are <em>Staphylococcu</em>s <em>Saprophyticus</em>, <em>Klebsiella  Spp, Proteus Spp, Enterococcus  Spp</em> and <em>Enterobacter</em>  Spp (Massinde, , et al  2009).</p> <p>Data  on the current distribution and antimicrobial Isolates from pregnant women in Tanania is limited .</p> <p>Urinary tract infections refer to the presence of microbial pathogen within the urinary tract and it is  usually  classified by the infection site, bladder (Cystitis), kidney (Pyelonephritis or urine (Bacteria) and also can be a Asymptomatic or symptomatic  (UTI) that occur in a normal genitourinary tract with no prior instrumentation are considered as “Uncomplication” whereas “Complicated” Infections are diagnosed in genitourinary tracts  that have  structural or functional abnormalities Urethral catheters, and are  frequently asymptomatic  (3,4)  (kriptke, 2005).</p> <p>It has been estimated    that globally symptomatic  (UTIS) result in as many as 7 millions  visits to out patient  clinic,  1 million visits to emergency departments, and 100,000 hospitalization annually (5) (chin et al 2011).</p> <p>Many different microorganisms can cause  urinary  tract infection (UTIS),  though the most  common pathogens  causing the  simple ones in the community are E<em>sherichia</em>  <em>Coli</em> and other E<em>nterobacteriacae</em>, which accounts approximately 75% of the isolates (Kebira et al, 2009).</p> <p>In complicated Urinary tract infections and hospitalized patients,  organisms  such as <em>Enterococcuss Faecalis  </em>and Highly resistant, gram-ve rods including Pseudomoinas Spp.  are comparatively more  common.  The relative frequency of the pathogens varies depending upon age, sex, catheterization and hospitalization.</p> <p>Urinary tract infection cases is often started empirically an therapy is based on information determined from the antimicrobial resistance pattern of the urinary pathogen. However, a large proportion of uncontrolled antibiotic  usage has  contributed to the emergency of resistant bacterial Infections (7-10). As a result, the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among urinary track has been increasing world wide. (Biadglegene. et al, 2009).</p> <p>Associated resistance i.e, the fact that a bacterium resistant to one antibiotics is often much more likely to be   resistant to other antibiotics, drastically decreases the chances of getting a second empirical attempt right. Resistance rates to the most  common prescribe drugs used in the treatment of (UTI)  vary considerably  in different areas, world-wide. The estimation of local etiology and susceptibility profile could support the most effective empirical treatment. Therefore, investigating epidemiology of (UTIS), the prevalence risk factors, are bacterial isolates and antibiotics sensitivity is fundamental for care givers and health planner to guide the expected intervention.</p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Ø  The aim of this study was to determine bacterial etiology agent and evaluate their invitro susceptibility pattern to commonly used antimicrobial agents.</p> <p>Ø  To identify the bacteria Isolates.</p> </div>\n\nBACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH URINARY TRACT INFECTION IN PREGNANT WOMEN AND THEIR ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " BACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH URINARY TRACT INFECTION IN PREGNANT WOMEN AND THEIR ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITY", "id": 20}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> <p>The prevalence of streptococcus pneumonia in pneumonia patients using university of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH) Enugu as a case study was carried out based on the fact of the pneumonia is one of the commonest afflictions of the aged people and children worldwide. A total of 50 samples were collected. 12 (24%) of the sample were from sputum while 38 (76%) were from nasopharyned swabs from children who can not produce sputum using sterilized disposable swab sticks. 12 (24%) of the patients were adults and 38 (76%) were children under the age of the. 29 (58%) of the patients were made while 21 (42%) were female. The media used for isolation of bacteria were blood agar and chocolate agar plates. This was followed by their appropriate biochemical tests  5 different organisms were isolated.

<p><strong>1.0              </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Bacterial  an  something cause severe infection in children the elderly and other people with weakened immune system is people that are more susceptible to infection because of an overal impairment of the immune response example Hiv infection chronic resease advanced aged and or function of defense mechanisms (example smoking chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) tumours inhaled toxins and aspiration (Stephen 2002). </p> <p>The trachea, bronchi and lungs are normally free from communal and potentially pathogenic bacteria, but when their reference  are upset they       are liable to be invaded by organization from the throat or nose (fraser, 1996) one of the commonest infection of the lower respiratory tract is pneumonia (Jawetz, et ,2001).</p> <p><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA</strong></p> <p>It is known that the inflammation of the lengs is called pneumonia it is pneumonia’s that result in the filling of alveoli with pus and fluid is called pneumonia (Naster et al 2001). Macrophages are numerous in the long issues and reality move into the alveoli and air ways to engaful infection agents,  thus helping to prevent pneumonia from developing but when there is upset of the defense mechanism, causative agents are then likely to enviable the host (Yolande and Broduem 1987).</p> <p>Pneumonia is an infection caused by different bacterial like streptococcus pneumonia, staphylococcus aureus, pneumococci etc. and in several case can lead to death for instance, William henry Harrison, the with president  of the united states, contracted pneumonia during his inauguration in 1841 and ride after being in office for only 31 days. Other notable persons to succumb to pneumonia include sir Francis bacon in 1626, who died after  staffing chikens with now while conducting freezing experimente and Thomas stonewal Jackson in 1863, whose arm required amputation after he was shot by one of his own sentries (Stephen 2002). Pneumonia is prevalent in cold weather and during raing season.</p> <p><strong>1.2              </strong><strong>CLASSIFICATION OF PNEUMONIA</strong></p> <p>Pneumonia can be classified into three</p> <p>-Acute, hospital –acquired</p> <p>-          Acute, community –acquired</p> <p>-          Chronic pneumonia  (Inglis 1996)</p> <p>a).        ACUTE COMMUNITY ACQUIRED:         this is defined as pneumonia whose onset occurs either prior to or immediately after mission to hospital. It is one of the classics of pneumonia that cause death worldwide (Fraser, 1996).</p> <p>Patients with acute pneumonia usually have cough, chest signs and fever. The cough may or may not be productive of purulent sputum  (Stephen, 2002). The most important consequence of actuate pneumonia is improvement of respiratory function, which should be assessed as a first priority ( Frasch and concopcion, 2000).</p> <p>b.                  ACUTE HOSPTAL ACQUIRED: This type of pneumonia affects smoker, patient with prior chest disense or following operation (especially thoracis and upper abdominal) and ventillated critically patient (inglis, 1996). The last group have the highest relative risk (Ross, 1994).</p> <p>c.                   CHRONIC PNEUMONIA: This have a more insidious onset and prolong course than actuate pneumonia. There is no single symptom complex, so the diagnosis is often bused on radiological finding (Frasch and cocaplion, 2002). Cough may productive of parnlent sputum occasionally blood stained.</p> <p><strong>1.3              </strong><strong>CAUSES OF PNEUMONIA</strong></p> <p>Cause for the development of pneumonia are extrinsic or intrinsic and various bacteria causative against exist (Nester et al 2001).</p> <p>Extrinsic factor include exposure to a causative agent pulmonary irratante, or direct pulmonary injury, while intrinsic  factor are related to the host.</p> <p>In  most cause, the primary infection is casued by qa virus eg Rhinovirus, Adanovirus etc. but there is often a secondary infection with a bacteria pathogen from the upper respiratory tract, most ommon is streptococcus pneumonia Gawatz et al, 2001) the streptococcus pneumonia also know as pnumococcus appears to be the primary cause of many cases of pneumonia, particularly ldorar and bronche pneumonia with Homophiles influenza as a frequent co- pathogen (Fraser, 1996) but often these pneumonic infection are triggered by a proceeding viral infection of the upper respiratory tract such as common cold (Wisconsin, 2003).</p> <p>Other secondary invaders of the lower respiratory tract that can cause pneumonia are staphylococcus aureus, which may cause fatal pneumonia after streptococcus pneumonia (Staphen, 2002). Haemophilus influenza, Kiabsiella pneumonia etc Jawetz at al 2001).</p> <p><strong>1.4              </strong><strong>JUSTIFICATION</strong></p> <p>Pneumonia infection is one of the major cause of death world wide and the infection is increasing rapidly in Enugu metropolis with streptococcus pneumoniae as the major pathogen (Okafor 1992). Therefore there is need to find out if this virulent organism is actually the primary bacterium that causes premnonia in Enugu metropolis. Although, many persons carry these bacteria harmlessly in their threat, mouth and nasopharyux and these are likely to contaminate the sputum as it is expected through the throat and mouth so as the commensal in nasopharynx which can equally contaminate the nasopharyueal swab (Ross, 1994).</p> <p><strong>1.5              </strong><strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVE</strong></p> <p>The aims and objective of this work are:</p> <p>1.                  To isolate bacterial pathogens form pneumonia patients.</p> <p>2.                  To ascertain the prevalence of streptococcus pneumonia in pneumonia patient using UNTH as a cast study.</p> <p>3.                  To determine the aga group and sex that are more susceptible to this infection.</p> <p><strong>1.6              </strong><strong>HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>Ho streptococcus pneumonia’s causes pneumonia</p> <p>H1­ streptococcus does not cause pneumonia</p> <p>H2 Streptococcus Pneumoniae have insight relationship on sex and age</p> <p><strong>1.7              </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Streptococcus pneumoniae is regarded as the commonest cause of pneumonia both in children and adults. Other bacteria have also been implicated as the cause of disease in severe case pneumonia can lead 15 death.</p> <p><strong>1.8              </strong><strong>DIAGNOSIS</strong></p> <p>In pneumonia patients streptococcus pneumoniae and other organisms (Causative pathogens) are diagnosed when they are grown from cultures of sterile fluids such as sputum from adult and nasopherynged swab as in case of children who are unable to produce sputum the clinical  presentation varies from the mildly to extremely ill patients (Wisconsin 2003). Straptococcue pneumonia and other causative bacteria can be isolated from specimens when cultured on blood agar and chocolate agar plates. Media have been described which facilitate the isolation  of small numbers of pneumococci from sputum heavily contaminated with secondary invaders form   throat and mouth commensals of 5% horse blood is affective incubation should be in 5-10 % coq (Gilks, 1997) .</p> <p>A list of biochemical tests are used in identify the presence of these bacteria. Catalase optochin sensitive test and bile solubility test for streptococcus pneumonia’s congulase test for staphylococcus aureus satellition test for Haemophilus influenza and citrate utilization for Klebsiella pneumoniae (Cheesbrough 1984).</p> </div>\n\nTHE PREVALENCE OF STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIA PATIENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PREVALENCE OF STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIA PATIENTS", "id": 21}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p> Fungi associated with the spoilage of cocoyam (<em>Colocasia esculenta</em>) during storage at ambient temperature (28+20c) was investigated in this study. This was done by cutting the damaged portion of the cocoyam tubers and blend with diluents (water) to have even distribution of the microorganism and ensure ease of plating out. This done with the sample and inoculation was done from the 4th test tube on SDA medium and incubated for three to seven days at the temperature 0f 270c.

In Nigeria, <em>Colocasia species</em> are the most important food and the third most important root/tuber crop after yams and cassava (Onwueme, 1978). Besides critical contribution to the national food security and cash  income  producing nations, cocoyam  are also being considered as source of starch for use in biodegradable film materials and for other industrial and pharmaceuticals purposes because of interesting properties of the amylopectin fraction of starch, which is the principal form of cocoyam starch (cecil, 1992).</p> <p>Cocoyams have very short post harvest storage life of a few days to weeks (Gollifer and Boot, 1973, Ugwunwanyi and Obeta, 1997). Differing and often conflicting reports have been made on the post harvest losses of cocoyam. But it bears nothing that post harvest storage life is often short and biodegradative losses are extensive and up to 100% losses are common due to the fungi which associates with the spoilage of cocoyam during storage condition,  (Onwueme and Charles, 1994),</p> <p>However, substantial post harvest losses caused  by the fungi associated with the spoilage  of cocoyam tubers during storage is attributed to a number of physical, physiological damage  arising  from harvesting, storage or transportation have  often been implicated as some of the predisposing factors  to cocoyam spoilage or deterioration (Ogundana et al;1970, Snowdon, 1991). Invasion by pathogens either through natural openings or wounds is considered the most critical factor in cocoyam spoilage (Degras, 1993).</p> <p>A wide range of micro-organisms (Particularly moulds) have been associated with cocoyam decay, relatively few are implicated as primarily pathogens (Aderiye and Ogundana, 1984). The degree of pathogenicity varies and is highly dependent upon storage conditions. It has been stated that fungi take the lead in the spoilage of cocoyam during storage. (Nwufo and Atu, 1987). Under these storage conditions, the fungi which are liable to  attack cocoyam include; <em>Fusarium  solani, Botryodiplodia, theobromae, Rhizopus, stolonifer, Aspergillus  niger, Sclerotium roltsii, Trichoderma hamatum </em>and<em> Pythium </em>species. (Nwufo, 1980,Uwgunwanyi and Obeta, 1996). Another factor also attributed to the spoilage of cocoyam is high respiratory activity. Storage temperature to an optimum of 70C and 85% relative humidity increases the storage time. The crops are usually left in the ground and harvested when need, and there  is a limit to how long the crop can be left in the soil since the corms and cormels sprout and produce new growth, which result  in the cocoyam losing its good values.</p> <p>Therefore, it has been suggested that November and March /April are the ideal time for harvesting cocoyam. However, due to the difficulties in storage, cocoyam are usually utilized or consumed fresh shortly after harvest because of these fungi which lead to their spoilage during storage, (Passam, 1982, and Onwueme, 1987). The objective of this study is to investigate the fungi associated with the spoilage of post harvest cocoyam during storage at ambient temperature (28 ± 20C).</p> <p>Cocoyam leaves are consumed as green or dry vegetables and the stem is either cooked or eaten on its own or together with other dietary staples or pound into flour. The leaves are consumed because they are rich in protein and vitamins while the roots is rich in carbohydrates and minerals, (Duru and Uma, 2002).</p> <p>Large quantities of carbohydrate-rich solid waste are produced in the course of processing cormels into starch and this constitute a waste disposal problem, (Duru, 2000).</p> <p>The changing economic, social, political and cultural values of the world have challenged all countries to efficiently use their resources.</p> <p>In Cameroon, two types of cultivated cocoyam varieties can be differentiated based on the colour of the flesh. The white –flesh cultivar or white cocoyam is the main cultivated variety because of its early maturation (6-(months) and high yield. In addition, the white cocoyam is most preferred in diet because of its excellent taste. The pink-flesh variety or red cocoyam is rarely grown because of its long maturation process (12-16months) Despite its importune, white cocoyam is highly susceptible to cocoyam    root  with attendant yield losses &gt; 90%.  In contrast, fields observations by farmers revealed that the red cocoyam has a certain degree of field tolerance against the cocoyam root rot   disease, (Tambong, 2000).</p> </div>\n\nFUNGI ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPOILAGE OF COCOYAM (COLOCASIA ESCULENTA)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FUNGI ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPOILAGE OF COCOYAM (COLOCASIA ESCULENTA)", "id": 22}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> <p>A total of fifty faecal samples were collected form pupils in airport primary school Emene Enugu were used for the study.

Many microorganisms contaminating food and water can cause acute gastroenteritis. In most cases it runs its own course over several (days. However it can be a serious condition if the fluid loss is sever enough to cause dehydration. When food is the source of the pathogen the condition is often called food  poisoning (Archeson 200)</p> <p>Gastroenteritis can arise in two ways the microorganisms may actually produce a food borne infection, that is, they may first colonize the gastrointestinal tract and grow within it, then either invade host tissues or secrete exo- toxins (Johnson, 1999).</p> <p>Alternatively the pathogens may secrete an exo- toxins that contaminates the food and is ingested by the host. This is some times reffered to as food intoxication because the toxins ingested and the presence of the living microorganisms is not required. Because theses toxins of the disrupt the functioning  of intestinal mucosa they are called enterotoxins (Sanders and sanders 1997)</p> <p>Most cases of gastroenteritis are due to viral infection about a half are caused by the rotavirus, first discovered and described at the royal children’s Hospital university of Melbourne in the early 1970 various other  virus may cause the same symptoms as well as bacteria like campylobacter protozoa and helminthes. In most cases the precise infective agent is not identified. It is only when symptoms are persisting that stools are sent for microscopy and culture in the laboratory (Nachamkin 1992).</p> <p>On a global scale gastroenteritis is a massive health problem. About 5 million people die each year, mainly young children in underdevloped countries most deaths are due to dehgdration, in adequate fluid replacement and cirulatory collapse. In Australia, Asia, African and South America an occasional fatality still occurs with gastroenteritis again mainly due to complication of sever dehydration A rotavirus vaccine has been developed in Australia and may eventually have  extensive world wide application (Prescott et al 2005).</p> <p>The main symptoms of gastroenteritis are vomiting diarliea and cramping abdominal pain. Sometimes of fever may also be present. In more severe cases, signs of dehydration may appear a young child may look floppy  and pale and  the   urine out put may be reduced. these signs means that urgent medical assessments and treatment are required. </p> <p><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>AIMS  AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>-                      to determine the prevalenble of gastroenteritis  in primary  school

<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Fungi spoilage organisms are silently invading acidifying, fermenting, discoloring, and disintegrating microbes that render corn (<em>zea</em> <em>mays</em>) unpalatable and unsafe.  Fungi spoilage is caused by two factors, (biotic) living which includes insects, birds, rodents and microorganisms and (non-biotic) non-living which includes temperature, humidity and time.  Two samples of spoilt corn, red (treated) and white were taken from the store respectivly for investigation to ascertain the microorganism associated with the spoilage of the corn.  Attention was focused on fungi.  Different methods were used in the identification and five genera were isolated.  <em>Mucor spp </em>occurred with a frequency of approximately 6%, <em>Aspergillus spp 9%</em>, <em>Rhizopus spp 15%,</em> <em>Penicillium spp 33% </em>and<em> Fusarium spp. 36%</em>. <em> Fusarium spp</em> was most frequent in occurrence in both samples.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0       </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>What food is more synonymous with summon than freshly picked corn on the cob?  Corn grows in “ears, each of which is covered in rows of kernels that are then protected by the silk-like threads called “corn silk” and encased in a husk. Corn is known scientifically as <em>Zea</em> <em>Mays</em>.  This moniker reflects its traditional name, Maize, by which it was known to the Native Americans as well as many other cultures throughout the world.  Although we often associate corn with the colour yellow, it actually comes in host of different varieties featuring an array of different colors, including red, pink, black, purple and blue.  Although corn is now available in markets years round, it is the locally grown varieties that you can purchase during the summer months that not only tastes the best but are usually the least expensive (Pitt and Hocking,<em> et al., </em>2009).</p> <p>From the time when primitive man began to cultivate crops and store food, spoilage fungi have demanded their tithe.  Fuzzes, powders and slimes of white or black, green, orange, red and brown are signs of silently invading, acidifying, fermenting, discoloring and disintegrating microbes rending commodities unpalatable or unsafe (Pitt and Hocking 2002). Pitt and Hocking 2009, also stated that in a prophetic article warned of the danger from common spoilage fungi.  Since 1960, a seemingly endless dream of pathogenic fungi discovered.  On these ground alone, the statement “it is only a mould” is no longer acceptable to microbiologist, health inspectors or consumers.  The demand for accurate identification and characterization of food spoilage fungi has become urgent. </p> <p>This research work is focused on corn and its spoilage organisms.  It set out to document current knowledge on the interaction of corn and fungi in the context of spoilage.  Area covered are how the fungi is isolated using the suitable best media and identification of corn spoilage fungi.  Mycologist develops preference and peculiarities of the type of fungi that are routinely grown.  Media will affect colony morphology and color whether particular structures are formed or not, and may affect whether the fungus will be even in culture (Hunt <em>et al,</em> 2004).</p> <p><strong>1.1    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Corn (<em>Zea</em> <em>Mays</em>) is a grain grown by farmers in various parts of the world especially in Africa.  Its spoilage most times limits its availability to consumers and causes economic waste to farmers. Corn is mostly spoiled by fungi.  The identification and characterization of these spoilage organisms will go a long way to profer solution on matter how little to this problem of corn spoilage.</p> <p><strong>1.2       </strong><strong>AIMS/OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>To microbiologically evaluate and identify fungi involved in corn spoilage using maize as case study.</p> <p><strong>1.3       </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study will help in the acquisition of the knowledge of fungi associated or involved in the spoilage of corn, factors that enhance spoilage of corn and the risk involved in the consumption of spoilt corn.</p> </div>\n\nISOLATION IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF FUNGI ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPOILAGE OF CORN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ISOLATION IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF FUNGI ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPOILAGE OF CORN", "id": 24}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT</strong></p> <p><strong><em>Chapter one</em></strong></p> <p>1.0        Introduction                               </p> <p><strong><em>Chapter Two</em></strong></p> <p>2.0        Literature  review       </p> <p>2.1    History of canned tomato    </p> <p>2.2    Types of canned Tomatoes          </p> <p>2.3    Nutrition facts of canned tomatoes</p> <p>2.4    Common additions of canned tomato     </p> <p>2.5    causes of canned tomatoes spoilage      </p> <p>2.6    Control/preservation of canned tomato</p> <p><strong><em>Chapter Three</em></strong></p> <p>3.0        Materials  and Methods</p> <p>3.1    Place of experimental work  </p> <p>3.2    materials used   </p> <p>3.2.1 Reagent used     </p> <p>3.3    Collection of sample    </p> <p>3.4    Medium preparation            </p> <p>3..4.1        Preparation of nutrient agar </p> <p>3.4.2 Preparation of potato dextrose agar      </p> <p>3.5    Sample preparation                    </p> <p>3.6    Microbiological Analysis of the Sample</p> <p>3.6.1 Determination of analysis load (bacterial and Fungi Load) </p> <p>3.7    Preparation of pure cultures pf Isolate (bacteria and fungi)</p> <p>3.7    Identification of bacteria isolates</p> <p>3.7.2 Colonial or  cultural characteristics</p> <p>3.8    Gram Staining    </p> <p>3.8.1 Indole test         </p> <p>3.8.2 Motility Test using stab cultures techniques     </p> <p>3.8.3 Methyl Red (Mr ) Test</p> <p>3.8.4 Volies –proskader (VIPs) test</p> <p>3.8.5 Identification of fungi</p> <p>3.9    Microscopic Examination              </p> <p>3.10  biochemical Reactions </p> <p><strong><em>Chapter Four</em></strong></p> <p>4.0        Microbial Load or bacteria Associated with canned Tomato  spoilage</p> <p>4.1    Discussion</p> <p>4.2    Conclusion </p> <p>4.3    Recommendation</p> <p><strong><em>          References</em></strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The micro-organism, associated with spoilage of tomatoes shows that tomato contain large amount of water which makes them more susceptible to spoilage by the action of various micro-organism. Out of  the (3) three sources of samples used in the assessment revealed that Bacillus species identified in the spoiled sample are  the major causes of canned spoilage while the fungi isolates are peniucillum species etc which revealed by the assessment are also the cause of  tomato spoilage. In this  assessment carried out,  it was  found out that bacterial species were the source of spoilage rather than bacteria because it dominated all the plates.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Canned tomatoes are tomatoes usually peeled that are sealed into a canned after having been processed by heat.</p> <p>This product are considered important world wide (Robinso, et al, 1994). In Nigeria tomato paste is the most important  tomato  product  because of its wide spread use for preparation of various food/menus. It contain on the average about 6.4% total solids, of which 3.5% is invert sugar, 0.5% citric acid,0.6% ash, 0.9% protein, 0.53% crude fibre and about 0.05% fat. When spoil as a result of the life processes of bacteria, yeast and molds, the sugars are  rapidly used up being changes into acetic  acid, lactic acid, alcohol and carbon dioxide, the amount of these substances depending  on the types of organism which are most  active in the particular sample in question.</p> <p>Until recent  years, nearly all the tomato paste consumed in Nigeria was important from European countries with Italy being the leading country. However, today, limited brands are produced locally. Although both the imported and the local brands are available on the market, consumers prefer the former  in spite of its relatively  higher cost.</p> <p>In general, adequate heat processing is given to tomato paste to achieve commercial  sterility (speck, 1984), but subsequent abusive post-process handling/storage may lead to undesirable microbiological changes  (Anon, 1980). It is public knowledge  that can of tomato paste often show external evidence of spoilage under tropical retail conditions. In addition, and interestingly, these d effective products are sold (especially to the less informed) at the same cost as the normal (non-defective- product.</p> <p>The structural   systematic approach for the control  of food safety “Hazard Analytsis and critical control point-HACCP” identifies, evaluated and controls hazards that are significant for food safety. The control parameters include various factors  such as  time of harvesting, temperature and moisture during storage, selection of agricultural products prior  to processing, decontamination conditions, addition of chemicals at final product storage ((Sango, 1995).</p> </div>\n\nMICRO-ORGANISM ASSOCIATED WITH SPOILAGE OF TOMATOES (CANNED TOMATOES)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MICRO-ORGANISM ASSOCIATED WITH SPOILAGE OF TOMATOES (CANNED TOMATOES)", "id": 25}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This work was done in order to investigate the microbial content of some bolted soft drivels sold in Enugu interlopes.

It is the appropriate to subject these soft drinks to some kind of investigation by isolation and characterizing the microorganism found. <br/>Simple Grows staining and biochemical test method were employed to isolate and identify the organisms found different bacterial and feast were identified these organisms include Fvlavobacterium spp. Bacillus Eschericjhism coli, Enteribacter arccosines Micro coccusroseus Micrococcus various Bacillus subtitles Aciuetobacter iwoffi, Micrococcus inteus Bacillus polymea, flavobacterium, rigeuse sacchenomyces, conevisciae klurenomyce sff, Torulopsis spp, cadida valida Geotrichuin candidium, sacchanoyces, carlbergersis cryptococus, albidus, Hausennlsa spp etc. </p> <p><strong>1.1 INTRODUCTION </strong><br/>Soft drinks were defined by Harry and Wilbert (1984) as a class of non alcoholic beverages which may be divided into two classes carbondrate soft drinks some time referred to as Soda ;’soda pop “etc) and still or non- carbondrate soft drinks. soft drinks in general contains 86 to 92% water, 7 to 10% nutrient sweetbriers, carbodioxide (if present) acid and flavoring. The food and drug administration standard of identity for carbonated soft drink define them as a class of beverage made by absorbing carbodiocide in potable water. The amount of carbonhdioxide used is not less than that which well be absorbed by the beverage at a pressure of one atmosphere and a temperature of 60F. these drinks contain no alcohol, or only such alcohol (not in excess of 0.5% by weight of the finished beverage) as is contributed by the flavoring ingredient that may be use in carbonated soft drinks in such properties are reasonable required to accomplish their intruded effects. These include nutritive sweeteners flavoring ingredient natural and antificial colour additive acidifying agent buffering agent emulsifying stabilizing or viscosity producing agent foaming agent caffeine and chemical preservatives the beginning of the carbonated beverage (soft) drinks) as recorded by Resrosier (1977) date back to the closing years of the eighteen (18th ) century <br/>Morris (1959) defined micro organisms as plant or animal organisms of microscopic or submicroscopic dimensions. Plant microorganisms are generally classified into three major groups, namely fungi bacteria and Algae as for as beverage manfacture is concerned the fungi are the most important group of spoilage organisms because yeast and mould belong to this group. The protozoa are the most important of the animal microorganisms. <br/>Actually individual microorganisms are microscopic in size they can form colonies clouds precipitates sediments and scums with time and these are visible to the naked eyes and are the direct signs of the presence of microorganisms.<br/>The microbiological safety and ratability of the diverse type of soft drinks products depend on their formulation (including) the use of chemical preservative carbonation low PH values and pasteurization) this was stated by ganglion (1982). Batchelor (1985) put it that the inter related environmental factors that determine the microbial load of product or the susceptibility of a product to microbial spoilage are intrinsic and Extrinsic factors. <br/>Intrinsic factor are derived from the product and its formulation according to pauezai comments they are not easy to change Extrinsic factor are variable introduced during processing packaging distribution and storage. They should be easier to change and control. Girighano further recorded that control should be by application of the air Hazard Analysis critical Control point (HACCP) system to raw material formulating processing condition and packaging examples of such control would be :<br/>a. Measurement of temperature during heat treatment of pasteurized product <br/>b. Measurement of carbonation level by routine monvtorning of carbendioxide pressures in carbonated products <br/>c. Measurement of pH water activity product viscosity and preservatives in combination with other formulation parameters <br/>d. Maintenance of good hygienic practice to prevent the building up of spoilage organisms on the plant equipment and in the production areas. <br/>Most microbiological problem arise because of poor quality of raw material (eg fruit concentrates sugar and syrup) poor processing hygiene packaging material and storage condition and these lead to over coming of the preservation system applied drinking manufactures or production of the beverages (soft drinks) by the micro organisms.</p> <p><strong>JUSTIFICATION</strong><br/>Soft drink are consumed in large quantities by the massed both male and female cutting across different age group adult and children of different classes of people all oven the state. This is aided by the general availability of these drinks almost every place where people gather for work or recreational activities so it is necessary to let the people taking this soft drinks know the consequences of leaving their drink open there by allowing some microorganisms which grow in the presence of air (acropea or acrophile organisms) to gain their way into the drink. Also for then to know the implicated organism in the soft drink thereby helping them to reduce their soft drink intake.<br/><strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVES</strong><br/>Aim and objective of this project is to investigation the microbial content of bottled soft drinks by:<br/>i.

It was then taken to the laboratory for analysis the samples were homogenized and serial dilution of the sample was made out using 5 ml sterile pipette and test tubes. The dilution were then cultured on different media, macconkey agar, nutrient agar and blood agar end later incubated at 370c for 24 hours. Discrete bacteria colonies were observed and each colomy was gram stained and examined microscopically. Biochemical test were carried out to confirm the particular bacteria present. Bactering isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus, lactobacillus, streptococcus and Escherichia coli. Most at this microorganisms isolated are pathogenic and are toxic when ingested in contaminated suya meat. They are capable of causing illness. For instance staphylococcus aureus produce air exotizcin and can with stand temperature of 1000c for 30 minutes. When ingested, if cause intoxication manifesting in 4-5 hours with acute diarrhoes vomiting and gastroertrities lasting 6-8 hours. </p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>Meat is an animal product. It is that part of animal that provides major source of protein in west African food. <br/>There are different types of meat from different types of animals, eg pork meat (pig) multon (goat) beef (cow).<br/>Meat can be served as prepared meat product eg corn beef, fried meat, cooked meat and suya, meat (smoke meat). Meat is perishable food and its composition is ideal for the growth of wide range of spoilage bacteria. Public concern has vison due to numerous food scandals such as those surrounding bovine spongiform encephalopathy and roof and mouth disease epidemics and food borne disease which remain substantial burden . we can meet those challenges with an improved and global food safety control system. One possible improvement would be a repid and accurate detection system for microbial spoilage. This technique should ideally also be non destructive and give result in real time for application in highly automated food processing environment.<br/>Suya meat is produced by smoking the raw beet with the addition of some syices, salt, oil, groundnut cake and flavors. The meat is first sliced into smaller pieces and the spices are rubbed onto it, it is later oven driedor over local source of heart. This allows the meat to get dried properly with the right taste before is gold to the consumers. <br/>This is gold at a specific joint or howked when it is Gold at joint it is constantly kept warm over fire source. The hawked saya meat is carried about in open basin from place to place thereby exposing it to dust and other effects of the environment so doing harmful organisms find their ways into the meat there by coursing for poisoning. <br/>Food poisoning is an illness with acute gastro ertritis as a major symptom caused by the ingestion of food counting my harmful micro organizer or harmful substances. Tomatari (1983). <br/>Some of the micro organisms present in suya causes food poisoning when consumed are Salmonella typhi staphylococcus aureus clostridum butilinum, clostridium preferring Bacillus cereces streptococcus progenies. <br/>Some of these micro organisms in meat cause off shavours which make the meat to be unfit for eating and also reduce the taste value. <br/>AIMS OF OBJECTIVE <br/>This project research is designed to isolate and identify the common spoilage organisms of suya meat often production thereby ensuring the safety of the population at risk in eating containineted suya meat</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS </strong><br/>HO: Hawked suya meat sold around ESBS metropolises contain pathogenic microorganisms <br/>H1 Hawked suya meat sold around ESBS metropolies does not cantinas pathogenic micro organisms.<br/>HI Hawked suya meat sold around ESBS, metropolies contain micro organisms but the load is not enough to cause disease.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY </strong><br/>The significance of this work is to enable those producers to improve the hygiene of the food (suya meat) and a good knowledge of safe food handling practice, suitable protective clothing to be worm end it will also enable us to be aware of various pathogenic organic and infection they transmit through food (suya meat) . As a result of this, the prevention of contamination of food is to be adhered to .This can be achieved by <br/>-keeping high risk food at temperature that will inhibits the growth of bacteria <br/>- Ensuring that during preparation, food is in the damger zone foras short time as possible.<br/>- Using suitable preservation such as salt and sugar.<br/>- Using various packing method like glass wares.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </strong><br/>Pathogenic organisms are organization that are referred to as specific health hazards associated with gusto intestinal disturbance counting foxiness.

staining protocol. They are differentiated by their cell wall structure. The following characteristics are displayed by gram negative bacteria as follows Cytoplasmic membrane Thin peptidoglycan layer(much thinner than gram positive) Outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharide outside the peptidoglycan layer Porin exists in the outer membrane, which acts like pores There is a space between the layer of peptidoglycan and the secondary cell membrane, called the periplasmic space If present, flagella have four (4) supporting rings instead of two No techoic acid or lipopolysaccharide<br/>14<br/>Some examples of gram negative bacteria include; Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Pseudomonas species, Klebsiella species, Proteus species, Helicobacter species, Mosoxella species, Cyanobacteria species, Spirochetes species.<br/>They also constitute a serious problem in urinary tract infections in many parts of the world. Appropriate antimicrobial treatments are often critical to decreasing morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients having the infections caused by the pathogens. Gram negative bacteria are non-spore forming bacilli that grow rapidly on ordinary laboratory media under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. It has been estimated that symptomatic urinary tract infects (UTI) occurs in as many as 7million visits to emergency units and 100,000 hospitalised annually. UTI has been the most common hospital acquired infections, accounting for as many as 35% of nosocomial infection. It is the second most common cause of bacteraemia in hospitalised patients (Nacem, 2000). UTI is known to occur in all populations but has a particular impact on females of all ages and males at two extremes of life, immuno-compromised patients and anyone with function or structural abnormalities of the urinary and excretory system.<br/>15<br/>UTI is known to be the microbial invasion of any of the tissues of the urinary tract reaching from the renal cortex to the urethrameatus (Nicolle, 2000). It is also known to be the presence in two consecutive urine samples of greater than 100rods (105 ) organisms per ml of a single bacterial strain in the urinary tract. UTI can be categorized in ascending or descending. Infections which are confined to the urethral or the bladder are ascending and referred to as uretitis or cystitis respectively. On the other hand, the pathogens spread from one or other infected body site to the kidney down along the ureter to the bladder. Such descending UTI cause severe kidney infection, a condition called pyelonephritis (Parsons, 1958). This is potentially more serious; infections to the urethra are called urethritis and to the prostrate gland are called prostitis. This classification is the presence or absence of symptoms, reoccurrence or absence or presence of complicating factors which are host factors facilitating establishment and maintenance of bacteraemia or worsening the prognosis of UTI`s engaging the kidney.<br/>Majority of pathogens are gram negative species with predominance of members of Enterobacteriace (Neu, 1992). Escherichia coli accounts for majority of urinary tract infections in young women but other gram negative<br/>16<br/>rods of different genera such as proteus species and pseudomonas aeruginosa an aerobic gram negative rod is also troublesome. As a urinary tract pathogens because of its resistance to antimicrobial medicine make it difficult to treat successfully (Nester et al. 1998).<br/>Antibiotics are used for the control of bacterial infections in human. Generally, gram negative bacteria are sensitive to many antimicrobial agents but strains from different patients and carriers differ in the pattern and degrees of sensitivity to different drugs. Increasing antimicrobials resistance in bacterial pathogen is a worldwide concern. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among urinary tract infectious agents is also increasing (Mathai et al. 2001 : Karaloswsky et al. 2001) and its treatment has become more complicated due to increasing resistance and empirical therapy leading to treatment failures of most associated with gram negative bacteria (Blondeau et al. 1999). The present study investigated the pattern of gram negative uropathogens and their antimicrobial resistance pattern among the clinical isolates to the commercially available antibiotics that are often prescribed in urinary tract infectious cases<br/>17<br/>1.1 Aims and objectives To find out the prevalence of gram negative organisms in the urinary tract among caritas university students. To investigate their antibiotic sensitivity pattern to enable formulation of drugs for urinary tract infection in our community. To determine the age and sex prevalence. To determine the prevalence of bacterial strains and their antimicrobial susceptibility in urine. To find the pathogenic bacteria commonly responsible with UTI and susceptibility patterns this will help the clinicians to choose the right empirical treatment.</p>\n\nPREVALENCE OF ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY OF GRAM NEGATIVE BACTERIA IN THE URINE OF CARITAS UNIVERSITY STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PREVALENCE OF ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY OF GRAM NEGATIVE BACTERIA IN THE URINE OF CARITAS UNIVERSITY STUDENTS", "id": 29}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Juice was extracted from banana <em>(</em><em>Musa sapientum) </em>pulp with the addition of lemon juice and was inoculated with Baker’s yeast <em>(Saccharomyces cerevisiae)</em> and held at 30 for seven days. The result of the yeast count increases at 48hr, and at 96hr the yeast count decreased gradually. It ranges from 4.9x107 cfu/ml at 0hr, 5.1x107 at the 48hr and 4.8x107 cfu/ml at 168hr. The pH of the Banana wine produced at the end of fermentation decreased (2.85) while the titrable acidity of the Banana wine produced increased. The total dissolved solids, total suspended solids decreased with increasing length of fermentation of juice. The alcohol content of the wine increased with 14%. The result obtained from the sensory evaluation by ten panelist shows overall acceptance of the wine produced. </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Wine is a product of alcoholic fermentation by yeast of the juice of ripe grapes or any fruit with a good proportion of sugar (Brook and Madigan, 2003; Okafor, 2007). Wine is one of the most recognizable high value added products from fruits. It can also be used as a substrate for the manufacture of vinegar, a by-product of wine manufacture.</p> <p>Wine manufacture is challenging in which marketable product can be obtained, but the processes involved in its production are relatively straight forward (Amerine <em>et al.</em>1980).</p> <p>Highly acceptable wines can be made from practically all fruits. Wine can be fermented with yeast that occurs naturally in grape and in other countries where grape is not produced, emphasis is usually placed on other fruits for wine making. There are some soft fruits from both temperate and tropical regions whose pigment stability and flavor profiles match those of any wine from grapes, but suffer from the lack of intensive research and development given to grape wine.</p> <p>Reports on tropical fruit wines have been mainly on exotic species such as banana, pineapple, citrus, mango, pawpaw, apple, strawberries e.t.c (Maldonado <em>et al</em>. 1975). Wine represents a safe and healthful beverage; it also provides calories and vitamins. During period when life was often strenuous, it offered relaxation and relief from pains.</p> <p>Bananas <em>(Musa sapientum)</em> are an important staple starchy food in Nigeria. It is a seasonal and highly perishable fruit, which can be available all year round. The large quantity of bananas and plantains provides the potential for industrial use (FAO 2003). In addition, any application to produce a marketable, value-added product will improve banana farming economies and eliminate the large environmental problem presented by banana waste. Banana could then compete in the market, either as banana juice or as mixtures with other juices because of its flavor and aroma (Lee <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p> <p>Bananas has a lot of nutritional benefits, thus demands in the market are high. They are highly recommended by doctors for patients whose potassium is low, because of its impressive potassium content. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids that helps control heart beat and blood pressure, countering bad effects of sodium. Banana is considered as an important food to boost the health of malnourished children, it contains good amount of soluble dietary fiber that helps normal bowel movements; thereby reducing constipation problems. Medicinal uses of banana have positive contribution towards successful treatment of anemia, heartburn, temperature control, ulcer, overweight e.t.c.</p> <p>Banana juice can also be applied to wine production; however, banana juice is turbid, gray in color, very viscous, tends to settle during storage and, therefore must be clarified prior to commercialization (Lee <em>et al.</em>2006). The turbidity and viscosity of banana wine are caused mainly by the polysaccharides in banana juice such as pectin and starch and therefore make the clarification process harder. Application of pectinase and -amylases that affect the quality of wine is important for improving the process of banana wine production.</p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>1.     To produce wine from banana wine</p> <p>2.     To evaluate the qualities of the wine</p> <p>3.     To carry out or monitor yeast count during fermentation.</p>\n\nPRODUCTION AND QUALITY EVALUATION OF BANANA (MUSA SAPIENTUM) WINE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PRODUCTION AND QUALITY EVALUATION OF BANANA (MUSA SAPIENTUM) WINE", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Ten (10) samples of suya meat in Enugu were collected randomly and analyzed microbiologically and the isolates were identified as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (35%)<em>Escherichia coli</em> (15%) Streptococcus species (15%) <em>Pseudomanas</em> (35%) .

Meat is a major source of protein and have valuable qualities of vitamins for most people in many parts of the world, thus they are essential for the growth, repair and maintenance of body cells which is necessary for our everyday activities. </p> <p>Meat could be traced back to human history, then when primitive men use raw flesh of dead animals, but as man developed, he domesticated as well as wild animals. Beef have been the major supply of meat in Nigeria as a result of extensive and semi-intensive cattle production system in Nigeria by Fulani and Hausa people of the northern Nigeria. (Umoh, 2004).</p> <p>Suya meat is a boneless lean meat of mutton, beef, goat or chicken meat staked on sticks, coated with its sauces, oiled and then roasted over wood using a fire from charcoal. It is a popular, traditionally processed meat product that is served hot and sold along streets, at clubs, picnics centers, and restaurants and within institutions. Suya meat is one of the intermediate moisture products that are easy to prepare and highly relish which is a mass consuming fast food and its preparation and sales are usually not done with strict hygiene condition because they are still done locally.</p> <p>Due to the chemical composition and characteristic, meat are highly perishable food which provides excellent source of growth of many hazardous microorganisms that can cause infection in human and also lead to meat spoilage and economic loss. The most important bacteria meat spoilage is caused by lactic acid bacteria which is physiologically related group of fastidious and ubiquitous gram-positive organisms, these includes many species such as <em>Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus and Streptococcus.</em></p> <p>Since meat has a high nutritive value, microorganisms could easily grow on it. The possible sources of contamination are through slaughtering of sick animals, washing the meat with dirty water, handling by butchers, contamination by flies, processing close to sewage or refuse dumps environment, spices, transportation and use of contaminated equipment such as knife and other utensils. (Igyor and <em>Uma, 2005).</em></p> <p>The slaughtering process affords extensive contamination of sterile tissue with gram-negative enteric bacteria from animal intestine including <em>Salmonella specie</em>and <em>Escherichia coli</em> as well as contaminant such as gram-positive <em>Lactic cocci</em>associated with humans, animals and the environment. <em>Enterococci </em>and <em>Clostridia</em>have been isolated from lymph node of red meat animals (Lawries, 2000, Alexander<em>et. al</em>. 1998).</p> <p>Microorganisms grow on meat causing visual, textural and organoleptic changes when they release metabolite (Jackson <em>et. al</em>. 2001). The smoke produced as a number of effects including preservative effect resulting from the deposition of organic compounds all presents in the smoked product (Suya meat). (Dineen<em>et.al</em>.1999). A preservative effect is also induced by the surface drying that occurs to the extent of 30% total weight loss in hot smoked product. Antioxidant effect is produced by the phenolic deposite unto the product.</p> <p>The microbial load in meat and meat product increases as long as growth conditions are favorable. The factor influencing microbial growth includes acidity pH, temperature, water activity, gaseous requirement, nutrient and competition of microbes for the nutrient. Controlling these factors implies maintaining long shelf life of meat and meat product but proper preservation of meat could be achieved by the combination of two or more preservation method which includes drying, salting and high temperature (Nester <em>e, al</em> 2001).</p> <p><strong>1.2                     AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>          This work is aimed at determining the microbial quality of suya meat sold in Enugu and has the following objectives:</p> <p>1.  To isolate, characterize and identify microbial species associated with                                 Suya meat.</p> <p>          2. To establish the public health implication of consumption of Suya meat.</p> <p>          3. To offer useful information where necessary to the consuming public.</p>\n\nMICROBIAL PROFILE OF SUYA MEAT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MICROBIAL PROFILE OF SUYA MEAT", "id": 31}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>HAPTER ONE</strong><br/><strong>1.1   INTRODUCTION </strong><br/>Canning food has been a labor of love for generations of families. Today has become an opportunity to take control of the food you and your family consume.<br/>The key to successful canning understands the acidity and spoilage factor of the food you wish to can, as well as the acceptable canning methods to process those foods. There are two types of food, categorized as low acid (vegetable, meat, poultry and seafood) and high acid (fruits and tomatoes). Both can be successfully canned by pressure canning.<br/>However, pressure canning is the only method recommended safe for canning low-acid foods according to the United State Department of Agriculture.<br/>Canning is not the only condition in the manufacture and preservation of foods in which anaerobic conditions can developed.<br/>In the 1900s, refrigeration practices unproved and sausages no longer caused a major problem with solution. However, as the technology for canning became availably, botulism became a problem in canned foods. By 1926, most of the problems in the commercial canning industry had been solved. Since then, most of the outbreak food borne botulism is the United State have caused by improperly home-canned foods, mostly fish and vegetables, such as string beans, corn, beets, spinach, asparagus and chili peppers.<br/>Some canned cured meat products are given relatively mild heat processes, inhibitory action of the curing agents, and in some cases refrigeration, being depended on to prevent spoilage by organisms in groups 2 and 3. It is usual for spores of aerobic bacilli to survive in some of these products.<br/>Glass home canning jars, sometimes referred to as Mason Jars, are made of heat-tempered glass for durability and reuse. These are the only jars recommended for safe home canning. They are available in standard sizes and will withstand the heat of a pressure canner, time after time.<br/>The two-piece home canning vacuum cap (lid and band) is the recommended closure for home canning. It consists of a flat metal lid with a rubber like seal on the underside and a threaded metal screw band that secures the lid during processing. The bands can be used repeatedly if they remain in good condition; however, new lids must be used each time.<br/>There are four basic agents of food spoilage-enzymes, mold, yeast, and bacteria. Canning will interrupt the natural spoilage cycle so food can be preserved safely. Pressure canners should be thoroughly examined and tested at the country extension office or with the manufactures to ensure their proper operation.<br/>Canned tomatoes are the most widely home-canned product in the United States. They also are one of the most commonly spoiled home-canned products. The canning processes recommended in this fact sheet are the result USDA research on safe home-canning procedures for tomatoes and tomatoes product. <br/><strong>Spoilage Canned Food: </strong>The most common reasons for spoilage in home-canned tomato products are under processing and incomplete seeks.<br/>Tomatoes that have not been processed long enough to destroy molds and heat-resistant bacteria may spoil during storage. One of the common spoilage organisms in canned food, bacillus coagulans, is very heat resistant and causes flat-sour spoilage. The jars lid may still be sealed and the product may appear normal, but the tomatoes will smell sour because of lactic acid produced by the growth of B. coagulans in the product.</p>\n\nISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF MICROBES ASSOCIATED WITH SPOILAGE CANNED FOOD SOLANUM LYCOPERSICUM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF MICROBES ASSOCIATED WITH SPOILAGE CANNED FOOD SOLANUM LYCOPERSICUM", "id": 32}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The primary function of intact skin is to control microbial population that live on the skin surface and to prevent underlying tissue from becoming colonized and invaded by potential pathogens (Ndip<em>et. al., </em>2007). Exposure of subcutaneous tissue following a loss of skin integrity (i.e. wound) provides a moist, warm and nutritious environment that is conducive to microbial colonization and proliferation.</p> <p>A wound is defined as any injury that damages the skin and therefore compromises its protective function. An acute wound is generally caused by external damage to the skin, including abrasions, minor cuts, lacerations, puncture wounds, bites, burns and surgical incisions. A wound is a breakdown in the protective function of the skin; the loss of continuity of epithelium, with or without loss of underlying connective tissue (Leaper and Harding, 1998). Wounds can be accidental, pathological or post operative. All wounds contain bacteria but majority of the wounds do no get infected. There are many variables that can promote wound infection when there is a discontinuity of skin barrier. This include both host and organism related factors like bacterial load and type, immune competence of host co-morbid like diabetes mellitus, etc (Mir <em>et. al.,</em> 2012). An infection of this breach in continuity constitutes wound infection. Wound infection is thus the presence of pus in a lesion as well as the general or local features of sepsis such as pyrexia, pain and indurations.</p> <p>Wound infections are one of the most common hospital acquired infections and are an important cause of morbidity and account for 70-80% mortality (Gottrup<em>et al., </em>2005; Wilson <em>et al., </em>2004).</p>\n\nAETIOLOGICAL AGENTS OF THE WOUND INFECTIONS AND THEIR ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY PATTERN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AETIOLOGICAL AGENTS OF THE WOUND INFECTIONS AND THEIR ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY PATTERN", "id": 33}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Yam popularly called “<em>Ji” </em>in Igbo Language is a tropical crop belonging to the Family Dioscoreaceae in the genus <em>Dioscorea</em>.

Yams are perennial herbaceous vines cultivated for the consumption of their starchy tuber in Asia, Africa, Central and South America, and Oceania. Nigeria is by far the world’s largest producer of yams, accounting for over 70–76 percent of the world production. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization report, in 1985, Nigeria produced 18.3 million tones of yam from 1.5 million hectares, representing 73.8 percent of total yam production in Africa.

The remarkable growth of the agriculture industry in many countries over the past decades has increased adverse impact on the environment. (Acketors, 2014). The cultivation of organisms in ponds (Tincker, 2012), tanks (Millamena <em>et al.,</em> 1991), rivers and coastal areas may have great influence on the environment, in addition to the impacts of all human activities. According to Hopkins <em>et al.,</em> (1995), there are potential and identified environmental impacts of fish farming such as the following. Wetlands, such as mangroves and mud flats, destruction for construction of ponds. Hyper-nitrification of estuarine ecosystems by fishpond effluent. “Biological pollution” of native fish stocks through escarpment of agriculture stocks.  The last for impacts can be addressed through improved water management methods. The environmental  impact of fish culture have been well documented as a result of the explosive growth of such operation in south east Asia and to a lesser extent in Latin America (Aiken, 2015) and it has also caused social impacts (Bailey, 2001). Chamberlin (2015) discovered, from fishpond effluent management study that dissolved oxygen, pH, ammonia, and nitrite, hydrogen sulfide, redox potential, sediments, phytoplankton, and bacterial counts are fishpond parameters to be monitored. Depending on the stocking density, the concentration of materials, suspended solid and oxygen demanding subsistence may be varied. During the harvest time, the water in ponds is drained and the nutrients, suspended solids and BOD are the highest in discharged water. Solid matter, mainly mixture of uneaten feed, feces, phytoplankton colonizing bacteria and dissolved matter such as ammonia, urea carbon dioxides and phosphorus are the major constituents of the effluents of fish farms (Macintosh, and Philips, 1992)”. A very high nutrient load can be expected in effluents during harvesting, draining and cleaning of ponds, because additional discharge of material previously bound to sediment and particulate in matter. These issues when not monitored and checked could precipitate worrisome environmental problems. It is therefore necessary to embrace on this study.</p>\n\nBIOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF WASTE WATER FROM FISH POND<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " BIOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF WASTE WATER FROM FISH POND", "id": 36}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Dandruff is a scalp disorder which is characterized by excessive shedding of skin cells from the scalp. It is a common problem faced by people of all age groups. As the epidermal layer continually replaces itself, cells are pushed outward where they eventually die and flake off. For most individuals, these flakes of skin are too small to be visible. However, certain conditions cause cell turnover to be unusually rapid, especially in the scalp. It is hypothesized that for people with dandruff, skin cells may mature and be shed in 2–7 days, as opposed to around a month in people without dandruff. The result is that dead skin cells are shed in large, oily clumps, which appear as white or grayish flakes on the scalp, skin and clothes (De Angelis <em>et al.,</em> 2005). Yeast like lipophilic basidiomyceteous fungus <em>Malassezia furfur</em> [<em>Pytirosporum ovale</em>] is the causative organism for dandruff (Arora <em>et al.,</em> 2011).  <em>Malassezia</em> converts the sebum lipid into fatty acids and triglycerides, which accelerate hyperproliferation of keratinoytes (Singla <em>et al., </em>2011). The treatment options [ointments, lotions, shampoos] currently available for management of dandruff have zinc pyrithione, salicylic acid, imidazole derivatives, selenium sulphide, tar derivatives, ketocanazole etc. as key ingredients (Vijayakumar <em>et al.,</em>2006). These synthetic treatment options have certain limitations, which may be due to poor efficacies or due to compliance issues (Vijayakumar <em>et al., </em>2006).  These are unable to prevent reoccurrence of dandruff with side effects that cannot be neglected. The best approach to treat dandruff is to use plants and herbal formulations which possess antidandruff properties. Studies evaluating antifungal effect of essential oils have also been reported (Lee <em>et al., </em>2010: Arora <em>et al., </em>2013). Antifungal activity of different plant extracts against <em>Malassezia furfur</em> is carried out in this work<strong>. </strong>Various natural plant extracts are known for their antidandruff properties. Evaluation of anti-fungal properties of such plant extracts can be done and they can be used effectively as an alternative to chemical agents in various anti dandruff formulations. Along with anti-fungal properties, plant extracts are also known for their conditioning properties which will be fruitful in maintaining the overall health of scalp and hair (Balakrishnan <em>et al</em>., 2011).</p>\n\nCOMPARISON OF ANTI-DANDRUFF ACTIVITY OF SYNTHETIC SHAMPOOS AND CRUDE PLANT EXTRACTS ON DANDRUFF CAUSING ISOLATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMPARISON OF ANTI-DANDRUFF ACTIVITY OF SYNTHETIC SHAMPOOS AND CRUDE PLANT EXTRACTS ON DANDRUFF CAUSING ISOLATE", "id": 37}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>There is high risk of contracting hepatitis B and C among individuals with psychotic disorders due to lifestyle factors and prisoners globally continue to demonstrate a higher prevalence of Hepatitis B and C than the general population. This study was aimed at determining the seroprevalence of HCV and HBV and to detect hepatitis C virus (HCV) among prison inmates and psychiatric patients in Kaduna Metropolis. A total of 276 (153 prison inmates and 123 psychiatric patients) serum samples were tested for anti-HCV and Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) using third generation Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and RDT method respectively. Hepatitis C virus genome was detected in ten (10) serum samples using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). An overall anti-HCV IgM prevalence of 10.14% (28/276), anti- HCV IgG prevalence of 8.69% (24/276) and HBsAg prevalence of 6.15% (17/276) was established. A 0.36% (1/276) HCV/HBV co-infection rate was obtained. Among the inmates, an anti-HCV IgM and IgG prevalence of 10.45% (16/153) and 8.5% (13/153) respectively was obtained with a 9.2% (14/153) HBsAg prevalence. An HBsAg, anti-HCV IgM and anti-HCV IgG prevalence of 2.4% (3/123), 9.75% (12/123) and 8.9% (11/123) respectively was obtained among the psychiatric patients. The highest HCV antibody prevalence was obtained among the female subjects (14.1% for IgM and 8.4% for IgG). No female tested positive for HBsAg. Subjects aged ≥48 years had the highest HCV prevalence (28.9%: 13/45 for IgM and 31.1%: 14/45 for IgG) while those within age group 28-32 years had the highest HBsAg prevalence (11.7%: 7/60). Age was observed to be associated with HCV infection (p=0.00). Viremia was evaluated by amplifying conserved untranslated region of HCV genome and bands of 244bp were observed. There was no statistically significant association between the viral infections and demographics. Presence of tattoo/scarification and alcohol intake were statistically associated with HCV infection while clothes sharing was associated with HBsAg among the inmates. Hepatitis C virus infection was statistically associated with blood transfusion, alcohol intake, presence of tattoo/scarification, sexual experience and shaving equipment sharing among the psychiatric patients while HBsAg was associated with only clothes sharing. This study established the circulation of HBV and HCV among inmates and psychiatric patients in Kaduna State. These individuals should therefore be screened for these viruses for appropriate clinical management and effective prevention.</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a small enveloped virus measuring 55-65nm in size. It is a positive sense single stranded RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae and genus Hepacivirus (Kapoor et al., 2011). It is the causative agent of human hepatitis C infection, although it has been found to infect chimpanzees, dogs, horses, and rodents (Rogo, 2011; Burbelo et al., 2012; Kapoor et al., 2013; Quan et al., 2013). Hepatitis C virus particle is made up of an RNA core of genetic material, surrounded by an icosahedral protective protein. This is further encased in a lipid envelope derived from the host. The viral glycoproteins, E1 and E2 are embedded in the lipid envelope (De-Beeck et al., 2003; Igwe et al., 2010). Hepatitis C virus encodes a single polyprotein of 3010-3011 amino acids which is processed into structural and non-structural proteins (NS). This is made possible with the aid of cell signalases and viral proteases.</p> <p>Hepatitis C genome consists of a single open reading frame (ORF) that is made up of 9600 nucleotide base long (Kato, 2000). The ORF possess highly conserved nontranslated regions (NTR) in its 5′ and 3′ ends. In the 5′ end, there is an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which allows the RNA to bind to the ribosomes close to the codon to start codon of the ORF. Based on genetic differences between HCV isolates, the virus is classified into seven genotypes (1-7) (Nakano, 2011). These subtypes are further broken into quasi species based on genetic diversity (Christian, 1996) and high error rate on the part of the virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase. The entry of the virus into the host is as a result of complex interaction between virions and cell surface molecules (Zeisel et al., 2009 Kohaar et al., 2010). The structure and replication of HCV is poorly known due to lack of efficient cell culture system, difficulty to grow or develop in cell culture as well as striking heterogenicity in density (Kawo et al., 2012). The virus replicates mainly in the hepatocytes of the liver, where it is estimated that daily each infected cell produces approximately fifty (50) virions with a calculated total of one trillion virions generated (Bartenschlager and Lohmann, 2000).</p>\n\nDETECTION OF HEPATITIS C AND HEPATITIS B VIRUS INFECTION AMONG PRISON INMATES AND PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DETECTION OF HEPATITIS C AND HEPATITIS B VIRUS INFECTION AMONG PRISON INMATES AND PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS ", "id": 38}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Microbial assessment of smoked <em>Scombia scombia spp. </em>of fish procured from two markets in Owerri metropolis was carried out.

Probiotics is a general name for microorganisms that are associated with beneficial effects for humans and animals. They contribute to intestinal microbial balance and play a role in maintaining health (Soccol <em>et al</em>., 2010). Probiotics play a vital role in increasing host resistance to colonization by exogenous, potentially pathogenic organisms. This is achieved through different mechanisms such as production of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide or acetic acid which increases the acidity of the intestine and inhibits the reproduction of numerous pathogenic bacteria (Reid <em>et al</em>., 2003). Probiotics has been found in dairy and non – dairy products (Soccol <em>et al</em>., 2010). They are usually consumed after antibiotic therapy which destroys the microbes present in the digestive tract. Regular consumption of food containing probiotic microorganisms is recommended to establish a positive balance of the population of beneficial microbes in the intestinal flora (Soccol <em>et al</em>., 2010). Benefits of consumption of probiotics include the prevention and treatment of infantile diarrhea, colon cancer, constipation, antibiotic induced diarrhea, hypercholesterolaemia, lactose intolerance, vaginitis and intestinal infections (Marchand and Vandenplas, 2000). Probiotic organisms used in foods must have the ability to resist gastric juices, exposure to bile, and be able to proliferate and colonize the digestive tract. The most commonly used probiotic bacteria belong to the heterogeneous group of lactic acid bacteria (<em>Lactobacillus</em>, <em>Enterococcus</em>) and to the genus <em>Bifidobacterium</em>, however, yeasts and other microbes have also been developed as potential probiotics during recent years (Ouwehand <em>et al</em>., 2002).</p>\n\nEXAMINATION OF SOME LOCALLY FERMENTED FOODS FOR PROBIOTICS BACILLUS COAGULANS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EXAMINATION OF SOME LOCALLY FERMENTED FOODS FOR PROBIOTICS BACILLUS COAGULANS", "id": 40}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Fish is highly nutritious with high protein content. However, it is a suitable medium for growth of microorganisms, if poorly processed (Oparaku and Mgbenka, 2012). The growth of microorganisms and other non-microbial activities such as lipid oxidation contribute to the deterioration of fish products (Martin, 2010). An increase in the ambient temperature triggers favourable conditions for microorganisms to thrive, which reduces the quality of fish and its potential keeping time leading to food loss (Abolagba <em>et al.</em>, 2011). Preserving food and other perishable products like fish and meat generally involves processes that impede growth of microorganisms either by the addition of growth inhibiting ingredients or adjusting storage conditions by freezing or drying (Akise <em>et al</em>., 2013). Processing methods affect the microorganisms in fish in different ways, resulting in different types of micro-flora and different risks from spoilage organisms and pathogens. In dried fish, the micro-flora are prevented from growing by the storage method used and the product may have a long shelf life in the preserved state. However, the microbial load of fish rarely indicates the quality of the fish, but gives an indication of the risk of spoilage induced since each of the organisms has different ways of affecting the health conditions of consumers of such contaminated fish (Gram <em>et al</em>., 2015).  As result there is a need to investigate microorganisms such fungi that are associated to fish spoilage. This necessitated this study into investigating fungi associated with smoked dried fish vended in Eke –Awka Market in Anambra state.</p>\n\nFUNGI ASSOCIATED WITH SPOILAGE OF SMOKED DRIED FISH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FUNGI ASSOCIATED WITH SPOILAGE OF SMOKED DRIED FISH", "id": 41}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>MICROORGANISM ASSOCIATED WITH  SPOILAGE  OF TOMATOES (CANNED TOMATOES)</strong></p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT</strong></p> <p><strong><em>Chapter one</em></strong></p> <p>1.0        Introduction                               </p> <p><strong><em>Chapter Two</em></strong></p> <p>2.0        Literature  review       </p> <p>2.1    History of canned tomato    </p> <p>2.2    Types of canned Tomatoes          </p> <p>2.3    Nutrition facts of canned tomatoes</p> <p>2.4    Common additions of canned tomato     </p> <p>2.5    causes of canned tomatoes spoilage      </p> <p>2.6    Control/preservation of canned tomato</p> <p><strong><em>Chapter Three</em></strong></p> <p>3.0        Materials  and Methods</p> <p>3.1    Place of experimental work  </p> <p>3.2    materials used   </p> <p>3.2.1 Reagent used     </p> <p>3.3    Collection of sample    </p> <p>3.4    Medium preparation            </p> <p>3..4.1        Preparation of nutrient agar </p> <p>3.4.2 Preparation of potato dextrose agar      </p> <p>3.5    Sample preparation                    </p> <p>3.6    Microbiological Analysis of the Sample</p> <p>3.6.1 Determination of analysis load (bacterial and Fungi Load) </p> <p>3.7    Preparation of pure cultures pf Isolate (bacteria and fungi)</p> <p>3.7    Identification of bacteria isolates</p> <p>3.7.2 Colonial or  cultural characteristics</p> <p>3.8    Gram Staining    </p> <p>3.8.1 Indole test         </p> <p>3.8.2 Motility Test using stab cultures techniques     </p> <p>3.8.3 Methyl Red (Mr ) Test</p> <p>3.8.4 Volies –proskader (VIPs) test</p> <p>3.8.5 Identification of fungi</p> <p>3.9    Microscopic Examination              </p> <p>3.10  biochemical Reactions </p> <p><strong><em>Chapter Four</em></strong></p> <p>4.0        Microbial Load or bacteria Associated with canned Tomato  spoilage</p> <p>4.1    Discussion</p> <p>4.2    Conclusion </p> <p>4.3    Recommendation</p> <p><strong><em>          References</em></strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The micro-organism, associated with spoilage of tomatoes shows that tomato contain large amount of water which makes them more susceptible to spoilage by the action of various micro-organism. Out of  the (3) three sources of samples used in the assessment revealed that Bacillus species identified in the spoiled sample are  the major causes of canned spoilage while the fungi isolates are peniucillum species etc which revealed by the assessment are also the cause of  tomato spoilage. In this  assessment carried out,  it was  found out that bacterial species were the source of spoilage rather than bacteria because it dominated all the plates.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Canned tomatoes are tomatoes usually peeled that are sealed into a canned after having been processed by heat.</p> <p>This product are considered important world wide (Robinso, et al, 1994). In Nigeria tomato paste is the most important  tomato  product  because of its wide spread use for preparation of various food/menus. It contain on the average about 6.4% total solids, of which 3.5% is invert sugar, 0.5% citric acid,0.6% ash, 0.9% protein, 0.53% crude fibre and about 0.05% fat. When spoil as a result of the life processes of bacteria, yeast and molds, the sugars are  rapidly used up being changes into acetic  acid, lactic acid, alcohol and carbon dioxide, the amount of these substances depending  on the types of organism which are most  active in the particular sample in question.</p> <p>Until recent  years, nearly all the tomato paste consumed in Nigeria was important from European countries with Italy being the leading country. However, today, limited brands are produced locally. Although both the imported and the local brands are available on the market, consumers prefer the former  in spite of its relatively  higher cost.</p> <p>In general, adequate heat processing is given to tomato paste to achieve commercial  sterility (speck, 1984), but subsequent abusive post-process handling/storage may lead to undesirable microbiological changes  (Anon, 1980). It is public knowledge  that can of tomato paste often show external evidence of spoilage under tropical retail conditions. In addition, and interestingly, these d effective products are sold (especially to the less informed) at the same cost as the normal (non-defective- product.</p> <p>The structural   systematic approach for the control  of food safety “Hazard Analytsis and critical control point-HACCP” identifies, evaluated and controls hazards that are significant for food safety. The control parameters include various factors  such as  time of harvesting, temperature and moisture during storage, selection of agricultural products prior  to processing, decontamination conditions, addition of chemicals at final product storage ((Sango, 1995).</p>\n\nMICROORGANISM ASSOCIATED WITH  SPOILAGE  OF TOMATOES (CANNED TOMATOES)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MICROORGANISM ASSOCIATED WITH  SPOILAGE  OF TOMATOES (CANNED TOMATOES)", "id": 42}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Fungi associated with the spoilage of cocoyam (<em>Colocasia esculenta</em>) during storage at ambient temperature (28+20c) was investigated in this study.

In Nigeria, <em>Colocasia species</em> are the most important food and the third most important root/tuber crop after yams and cassava (Onwueme, 1978). Besides critical contribution to the national food security and cash  income  producing nations, cocoyam  are also being considered as source of starch for use in biodegradable film materials and for other industrial and pharmaceuticals purposes because of interesting properties of the amylopectin fraction of starch, which is the principal form of cocoyam starch (Cecil, 1992).</p> <p>Cocoyams have very short post harvest storage life of a few days to weeks (Gollifer and Boot, 1973, Ugwunwanyi and Obeta, 1997). Differing and often conflicting reports have been made on the post harvest losses of cocoyam. But it bears nothing that post harvest storage life is often short and biodegradative losses are extensive and up to 100% losses are common due to the fungi which associates with the spoilage of cocoyam during storage condition,  (Onwueme and Charles, 1994),</p> <p>However, substantial post harvest losses caused  by the fungi associated with the spoilage  of cocoyam tubers during storage is attributed to a number of physical, physiological damage  arising  from harvesting, storage or transportation have  often been implicated as some of the predisposing factors  to cocoyam spoilage or deterioration (Ogundana et al;1970, Snowdon, 1991). Invasion by pathogens either through natural openings or wounds is considered the most critical factor in cocoyam spoilage (Degras, 1993).</p> <p>A wide range of micro-organisms (Particularly moulds) have been associated with cocoyam decay, relatively few are implicated as primarily pathogens (Aderiye and Ogundana, 1984). The degree of pathogenicity varies and is highly dependent upon storage conditions. It has been stated that fungi take the lead in the spoilage of cocoyam during storage. (Nwufo and Atu, 1987). Under these storage conditions, the fungi which are liable to  attack cocoyam include; <em>Fusarium  solani, Botryodiplodia, theobromae, Rhizopus, stolonifer, Aspergillus  niger, Sclerotium roltsii, Trichoderma hamatum </em>and<em>Pythium </em>species. (Nwufo, 1980,Uwgunwanyi and Obeta, 1996). Another factor also attributed to the spoilage of cocoyam is high respiratory activity. Storage temperature to an optimum of 70C and 85% relative humidity increases the storage time. The crops are usually left in the ground and harvested when need, and there  is a limit to how long the crop can be left in the soil since the corms and cormels sprout and produce new growth, which result  in the cocoyam losing its good values.</p> <p>Therefore, it has been suggested that November and March /April are the ideal time for harvesting cocoyam. However, due to the difficulties in storage, cocoyam are usually utilized or consumed fresh shortly after harvest because of these fungi which lead to their spoilage during storage, (Passam, 1982, and Onwueme, 1987). The objective of this study is to investigate the fungi associated with the spoilage of post harvest cocoyam during storage at ambient temperature (28 ± 20C).</p> <p>Cocoyam leaves are consumed as green or dry vegetables and the stem is either cooked or eaten on its own or together with other dietary staples or pound into flour. The leaves are consumed because they are rich in protein and vitamins while the roots is rich in carbohydrates and minerals, (Duru and Uma, 2002).</p> <p>Large quantities of carbohydrate-rich solid waste are produced in the course of processing cormels into starch and this constitute a waste disposal problem, (Duru, 2000).</p> <p>The changing economic, social, political and cultural values of the world have challenged all countries to efficiently use their resources.</p> <p>In Cameroon, two types of cultivated cocoyam varieties can be differentiated based on the colour of the flesh. The white –flesh cultivar or white cocoyam is the main cultivated variety because of its early maturation (6-(months) and high yield. In addition, the white cocoyam is most preferred in diet because of its excellent taste. The pink-flesh variety or red cocoyam is rarely grown because of its long maturation process (12-16months) Despite its importune, white cocoyam is highly susceptible to cocoyam    root  with attendant yield losses &gt; 90%.  In contrast, fields observations by farmers revealed that the red cocoyam has a certain degree of field tolerance against the cocoyam root rot   disease (Tambong, 2000).</p>\n\nFUNGI ASSOCIATED D WITH THE SPOILAGE OF COCOYAM (COLOCASIA ESCULENTA)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FUNGI ASSOCIATED D WITH THE SPOILAGE OF COCOYAM (COLOCASIA ESCULENTA)", "id": 43}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>       This work is aimed at determining the incidence of bacterial injections such as Salmonella and Escherichia coli which cause health hazards to the  poultry in their feeds.  Sample feed were obtained from commercial mash operation/ pellet mill operation at New heaven and top feed at Ogbete main market Enugu.  The samples were screened for total aerobic bacteria count, total coliform count and the characterization of the bacteria isolates carried out while indole test and citrate test were used to confirm the presence of Escherichia coli.

That provision of baby friendly facilities at place of work for mothers to breastfeed their baby was an important occupational factor. That giving of water and the belief that exclusive breastfeeding makes the breast become flabby and unattractive were perception held by nursing mothers. Based on these, it was concluded that maternal nutrition does not affect practice of exclusive breastfeeding in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State.</em> <em>Some recommendations were made   such that all hands should be on deck to increase the uptake of exclusive breastfeeding of infants, government and private enterprises should provide baby friendly facilities at their place of work for mothers to breastfeed their baby exclusively, maternal health status should be paramount to everyone as the health of their infant is tied to the mother.</em>   <br/><br/><br/><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong> <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong> <strong>Background to the Study</strong>           Through the course of human history, the feeding of the new born has puzzled man. A lot has been written about what is more beneficial for the growth and wellbeing of the child, mostly outlining breastfeeding’s pivotal role (Papastavrou, 2014).           The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of life, from six months onwards, continued breastfeeding combined with complementary foods of good quality and in the right quantity for two years is recommended.           Exclusive breastfeeding means that the child only receives breast milk, and if necessary the addition of vitamins, minerals and medicine for the first six months of life. The (WHO) recommendation applies to all countries and populations regardless of economic status or developmental level.           Breastfeeding has many health benefits for both the mother and the infant. Breast milk is not only a source of food but contains immune related components and various biologically active substances that contribute to efficient nutrient utilization and gives the child active and passive protection against infections. Breast milk provides all of the nutrients, vitamins and minerals an infant needs for growth for the first six months of life. Optimal breastfeeding practices in the first two years of life can have the single largest impact on child survival of all preventive interventions. Breast feeding provides many health benefits for the mother. These benefits includes more rapid recovery from childbirth, decreased postpartum bleeding, delayed return to fertility, reduced risk for breast and ovarian cancers, and less bladder and other infections.               In developing countries, and in Nigeria for instance, breastfeeding can be the difference between life and death for several reasons, including poor hygiene, prevalence of malaria and lack of safe drinking water. An exclusively breastfed child is less likely to die in the first six months than a non-exclusively breastfed child.           Adequate nutrition during early life is critical for cognitive, mental and physical development. This period ensures proper development and plays a significant role in lifelong health outcomes. Inadequate nutrition during pregnancy and the first two years of life can lead to irreversible limitation in the ability of a child to achieve his or her full potential. These outcomes may include delays mental development, reduced mental capacity, reduced school performance and working capacity and overall increased susceptibility to diseases and infections.           An undernourished child has an increased risk of dying from diarrhea, measles, malaria and pneumonia. The first 1000 days of life from conception through the first two years of life is often referred to as “window of opportunity” because of the profound positive effect optional nutrition can have on the developing child and due to the fact that damage during this period is often permanent and irreversible.           Human breast milk provides energy, nutrients and trace elements that are required by infants until weaning. During lactation, bone is mobilized and exerts influence on the availability of these macro-elements to the mineral poll that supply the mammary gland.           Kinsara 2006, posited that human breast milk composition is dependent on many maternal and gestational factors ranging from stage of lactation, maternal age, maternal nutritional status, diet, parity and gestational age.           A woman’s appetite increases during pregnancy and lactation, these results in increase in food intake. This occurs because the energy, protein and other nutrients in breast milk comes from the mothers’ diet or from her own body stores, so there is need for increased food intake to compensate for the demand of lactation.           In sub-Sahara Africa, many women suffer from chronic under-nutrition and micronutrient deficiencies and fail to gain enough weight during pregnancy. This could be traced to the low standard of living, unemployment and global economic recession and failure of government at all levels to provide for its citizens basic amenities. This has a great impact on the rate at which the young infant is breastfed.           In the present study, we will be looking at the effects of maternal nutrition on the actualization of exclusive breastfeeding. This research work will also be looking at other constraints that can cause the discontinuation of exclusive breastfeeding and also make recommendations on how to improve mothers’ adherence to the campaign on exclusive breastfeeding. <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong>           The importance of exclusive breastfeeding cannot be overemphasized. Government at all levels and health practitioners have embarked on various health outreaches to encourage exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of the infants life. However, these intervention seems not to be yielding the desired results as there are several maternal factors that could hinder the continuation of exclusive breastfeeding which could range from maternal occupation, perception, socio-economic status etc. Therefore the present study aims at investigating the relationship between maternal nutrition, quality of life and exclusive breastfeeding in a sample of mothers from Egor Local Government Area of Edo State. Based on the problems, the following research questions are asked. 1.     What are the effects of maternal nutrition on exclusive breastfeeding of infants? 2.     What is the influence of maternal socio-economic status on the practice of exclusive breastfeeding? 3.     What are the effects of maternal occupation on the actualization of exclusive breastfeeding? 4.     What is the influence of maternal perception on exclusive breastfeeding? <strong>Purpose of the Study</strong>           The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of maternal nutrition on exclusive breastfeeding. The study will also look at the influence of maternal socio-economic status, occupation and perception on the attainment of exclusive breastfeeding.<strong>Significance of the Study</strong>           Inspite of government, Health practitioners and non-governmental organizations effort over the years, to sensitize the people of Egor Local Government Area through seminars, lectures, workshops and door to door campaign on the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding to both mother and child, little has been done in the area of research to ascertain if this outreach is yielding desired result in terms of attitudinal change of the people of the local government. Data are not readily available to show progress made or otherwise. This prompted the need for this research work. This study will also serves as a basis for more research work on the field of study. <strong>Scope/Delimitation</strong>           The present study only deals with nursing mothers in Egor Local Government Area and also the use of questionnaire for data collection.     <br/><br/></p>\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF MATERNAL NUTRITION ON THE EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING OF INFANTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECTS OF MATERNAL NUTRITION ON THE EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING OF INFANTS", "id": 45}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Cosmetic(creams) need not be sterile,however they must not be unduly contaminated with micro-organism and should remain in a stable state throughout the shelf life of the product (or when be used by the consumer).the aim of this project was to determine the microbial load in selected creams and to identify the specific contaminants.<br/><br/>For the determination of the number of contaminants, 1 mL of each cream was diluted to a factor of 104,1mL of this dilution was mixed with cool nutrient agar and macConkey agar and poured on the petri-dish and incubated at 370c for 24hours.the amount of micro-organism was determined to see if they conform to standard.<br/><br/>Colonies were picked and sub-cultured on slants of nutrient agar and macConkey agar<br/><br/>Purification of cultures was done (i.e isolation of pure culture) by picking each colony from the slant and growing it on freshly prepared nutrient agar and macConkey agar media to identify specific contaminants.the contaminants identified were both bacteria (staphylococcus spp and enterobacteriaceae) and fungi(moulds) <br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>1.0INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>Cosmetics (cream) are those preparation which are applied to skin for the purpose of beautifying the skin. They are used in some other cases for treatment purposes. Their composition can range from simple ingredients to an array of complex substances. <br/><br/>Cosmetics (cream) can be said to be topical preparations intended to be applied to/on the human body for cleaning or improving the appearance of the skin with negatively affecting the dermatological properties or structure of the skin. The warm and rather humid climatic conditions that prevail in most tropical countries including Nigeria would tend to support the survival and growth of many micro-organisms. In a situation whereby a nutritionally rich pharmaceutical/cosmetic product is severely contaminated, rapid growth and multiplication of micro organisms would be expected. Contaminating micro-organisms in creams may cause spoilage of the produce and, when pathogenic, they represent a serious health risk for consumers worldwide (Becks and Lorenzoni 1995, Behravan et al. 2005).<br/><br/>Due to their complex composition of substances, preservation of these preparations against microbial spoilage involves protection of the large number of different constituents with variable physical and chemicals properties.<br/><br/>Products contamination may arise from raw materials or water used in the formulation process or accidentally during use.<br/><br/>1.1 CONTAMINATION OF CREAMS AND LOTIONS<br/><br/>The hazards of inadequately preserved cosmetics to human health have been demonstrated by reports of staphylococcal infections from use of contaminated hand creams (Campana et al; 2006). Regardless of whether a cosmetic becomes contaminated during manufacture or during consumer use, the hazard is usually two fold, namely: <br/><br/>(1) The Direct effect of micro-organism on human health e.g. allergic reactions, skin irritations and even neurotoxic manifestation;<br/><br/>(2)The Indirect effect also on human health due to production contamination and spoilage as well as formation of harmful/noxious microbial metabolic.<br/><br/>Microbial contamination of cosmetics during manufacture was a major problem in the 1960’s and 1970’s. Since then, microbial contamination is still one of the major causes of product recall on the world, particularly in developing tropical countries (Okeke and Lamikanra 2001). However, significant progress has been made by cosmetic industry towards implementation of sanitary manufacturing practices, more rigorous microbiological control and the development of better preserved cosmetic products. Therefore, it is important to improve the preservation system. (Farrington et al 1994; inter and Genet 1998) in order to inhabit the growth of contaminating micro-organisms during manufacturing, storage and use by consumers, also by using non-invasive package (Brannan and Dille 1990).<br/><br/>1.2 Microbial Spoilage of Topical Preparations<br/><br/>The formulation of an efficacious, elegant and safe product which will be both stable and acceptable to the consumer may require the use of a variety of ingredients in a complex physical state. This complexity in the composition or constitution of the product could create conditions conducive to the survival of micro-organisms that contaminate the product either during manufacture or consumer use. A topical preparation may be considered microbiologically spoilt if depending on it intended use it possess:<br/><br/>i.low levels of acutely pathogenic micro-organism or higher level of opportunistic pathogen are present<br/><br/>ii.Toxic microbial metabolic persist even after dealth of the original/primary contaminants or <br/><br/>iii.Microbiological growth has initiated significant physical or chemical deterioration of the product. Such spoilage might result in financial loses for the manufacturer, either in the immediate loss of products or in the increasingly expensive cost of litigation should spoilage cause harm to the end user. <br/><br/>1.3 Manifestation and Mechanisms of Microbial Spoilage<br/><br/>Before spoilage can occur, organisms which are capable of altering the components of a product in situ must first be introduced via raw materials, the processing plant, packaging materials, operatives or elsewhere in the environment. Although spoilage does not necessarily depend upon the growth of these contaminants it is generally facilitated if the formulation and the ambient conditions of temperature and humidity encourage their multiplication. When these criteria are satisfied changes in the product will occur and may ultimately manifest themselves to the user in one or more of the following ways:<br/><br/>TOXIC EFFECTS<br/><br/>Microbial toxins: <br/><br/>Several specials of micro-organisms produce molecules and may render a product dangerous if they grow in it under conditions supporting toxin production. Endotoxins, produced by Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, are intimately bound to the cell, lipopolysaccharide in nature and are not necessarily inactivated by sterilization as they are heat stable. Toxins of this type are poorly absorbed by the oral route but are very important in connection with injectable products, particularly perfusion fluids. Exototins are much more highly lethal and are bound less rigidly to the cell so that they are readily liberated into the growth medium. The outstanding example, of course, is that produced by Clostridium botulinumwhich is lethal to mice in doses of the order of 0.1ng. Fortunately, conditions for growth and toxin production are quite strict; anaerobiosis, the presence of suitable pH and nutrients and of few competing bacteria is required. Such conditions are not often attained in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics and we know of no case of botulism arising from their use. Certain strains of staphylococeusaureus produce a toxin, characterized as a specific polysaccharide, but the organism must grow to a density of several million cells per gram before its toxin becomes a problem. The evidence in connection with other bacterial, e.gClostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, streptococeusfaecalis, proteus and pseudomonas species is less clear, but poisonous metabolites are certainly produced by a variety of fungi. Over the last decade there has been much interest shown in the afflatoxins produced by Aspergillusflavus(Barnes, J. M. (1970). These heat-stable compounds exhibit potent toxic and carcinogenic properties in animals. A. flavuscommonly infects peanuts, cotton seed and grain which are all components of animal foods. Under poor storage conditions mould growth occurs and toxic doses of aflatoxin accumulate in the food stuff. While it is difficult to visualize this occurring with cosmetics or pharmaceuticals, it is wise to ensure that ingredients such as talc, kaolin or starch are not stored for long periods under conditions supporting mould growth.<br/><br/>Metabolic Products:<br/><br/>In addition to microbial toxins, which are complex molecules and may be looked upon as biosynthetic products, simpler catabolic products such as organic acids and amines, which can be toxic to man, may be produced. Indeed, many microbial metabolites exhibit pharmacological activity (Perlman,D. and Peruzzotti, G. P.(1970). As these compounds are considerably less toxic than are the classic bacterial toxins, relatively high concentrations have to be attained before a spoiled product causes illness and the sense often detect that something is wrong before food spoiled to this extent is swallowed. This may not apply to medicines, as they are expected to be unpleasant and, indeed, frequently contain a flavouring agent in order to mask an unpleasant taste. However, well-documented examples incriminating specific metabolic products in pharmaceuticals are not easy to find.<br/><br/>Irritancy:<br/><br/>Incidents of irritation following the application of cosmetics occasionally occur, and the offending preparation may subsequently be shown to contain a high level of microbial contamination. Direct evidence that irritation is caused by the presence of the micro-organisms is lacking but it is reasonable to suppose that, on some occasions, the contaminants provide a source of foreign protein evoking an allergic contact dermatitis reaction or that high levels of a microbial metabolite will cause a primary irritant reaction. The eye, of course, is particularly susceptible to infection from contaminated cosmetics and it is also at risk from the direct effect of irritant metabolites left in a product even after the organisms producing them have been eradicated.<br/><br/>Change of activity:<br/><br/>An interesting aspect, but perhaps not one of great significance, is the inactivation of biologically active molecules by organisms contaminating a formulation. Several examples have now been demonstrated in the laboratory and in some cases have been observed to occur in practice. A classic example is the destruction of penicillins by penicillinases, enzymes produced by a broad range of micro-organisms. Microbial enzymes which inactive chloramphenicol are also known (Smith, G. N. and Worrel,(1949) and the destruction of preservatives and disinfectants is established (Hugo, W. B.(1965). Pharmacologically active substances can also be degraded. For instance Kedzia, Lewon and Wisniewski (Kedzia, W.,et.al(1961) found that a loss of atropine of up to 20% in eye drop could be caused by Corynebacterium and Pseudomonas spp. isolated from the eye drops and atropine itself. Recently, Grante, de Szors and Wilson (Grant, D. J et.al.(1970) have shown that in the laboratory, a strain of AcinetobacterIwoffi, obtained from distilled water, utilized aspirin as a sole carbon source in a mineral salt solution. The same organism metabolized other active esters; for instance it could degrade heroin to morphine. Another organism, Corynebacteriumhoffnaii, which was isolated from laboratory dust, metabolized and analgesics, aspirin, phenacetin and paracetamol.Loss of useful activity is not restricted to pharmaceutical products. For instance emphasis on the need for detergents which are biodegradable has had some repercussion and shampoos have been known to lose their surface-active properties due to degradation of the surfactants by contaminating bacterial.<br/><br/>VISIBLE EFFECTS<br/><br/>Visible Growth: <br/><br/>When micro-organisms can actually be observed in or on a product then there is obviously no doubt that microbial spoilage has occurred. In fact, this is probably the most common way in which it is manifest. In liquid formulations contaminants may be seen as a sediment, turbidity or a pellicle while on more solid preparations colonies, often coloured, of bacteria, yeasts or mould may form.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Colour changes<br/><br/>Sometimes visible spoilage is more striking, particularly if a colour change is involved. Colour changes due to alternations in the components of a product may result from pH.Redox or other changes caused by the metabolic activities of an organism, or to pigment production by the contaminants themselves. <br/><br/>Members of the Pseudomonas genus are often implicated in spoilage of this type. These organisms metabolize a very broad range of compounds, and can also produce soluble pigments ranging in colours from blue-green to brown. In addition, they can render conditions suitable for less adaptable spoilage organisms; for example they can create conditions favouring the growth of anaerobes. Similarly, in an acidic product, oxidative yeasts can cause a rise in pH by utilizing organic acids and this will encourage bacterial growth.<br/><br/>Gas production<br/><br/>If microbial metabolism produces gas in a sufficient amount to exceed its solubility in a product, visible bubbles, frothing and other manifestations of an increase in pressure occur. Products containing carbohydrates or other fermentable substrates are particularly susceptible to this type of spoilage. Of the latter, glycerol, an essential ingredient in many cosmetic preparations, is fermented particularly readily by some common waterborne organisms.<br/><br/>Other changes<br/><br/>Microbial metabolism can result in the composition of a homogeneous product becoming visibly heterogeneous. Emulsions, for instance, are notoriously susceptible to changes in physicochemical conditions; hydrolysis of the oil phase or changes in the pH of the aqueous phase will upset the equilibrium and thus cause visible changes. In liquid product changes of viscosity can be seen to occur when contaminants have broken down large molecules, utilized sugars or caused the aggregation of particles in suspension.<br/><br/>Olfactory effects<br/><br/>It has long been known that many micro-organisms produce characteristics odours and as early as 1923 a variety of aroma=producing bacteria had been listed (Omelianski, V. C.(1923). These aromas include the highly characteristics ones of sulphur-containing metabolites such as hydrogen sulphide, the sickly smells of the fatty acids, the ‘fishy’ odours of the amines and the astringency of ammonia. Often these are combined to produce the ‘off’ odours of a spoiled product. Changes in the aroma of a product due to contaminants vary from the production of a nauseating smell to a slight change in the bouquet but all can be disastrous, particularly to cosmetic and toiletry preparations which depend so much upon their specific perfumes. One of the most common olfactory warnings of spoilage is the typical smell of mould. The responsible aromatic elements have not been clearly identified but some actinomycetes which taint water with undesirable earthy odours have recently been shown to produce goesmin, a strongly earth-smelling, neutral oil (Gerber, N. N. and Lechevalier,H . A.(1965). An alcoholic odour, produced from fermentable substrates, is typical of spoilage by yeast.<br/><br/>Taste<br/><br/>Reports that products taste ‘peculiar’ are often the first indications that they may be spoiled. The sense of taste varies widely between individuals and these reports do not invariably indicate microbial contamination. For this reason, and because of the hazards involved, taste is not a practicable control procedure with which to detect spoilage at an early stage. Nevertheless, the combined sense of smell and taste are highly perceptive to changes in flavor, particularly in bland, unflavoured, preparations where the presence of microbial metabolites is not masked. Margalith and Schwartz (Margalith, P. and Schwartz, Y.(1970) have listed over 100 organic compounds involved in the production of flavor by micro-organisms. These consist mainly of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acetals, acids, amines, esters and phenols.<br/><br/>Texture <br/><br/>The feel of topical preparations, particularly cosmetic and toiletry ones, is vital to their acceptability but texture may be marred by contaminants. For instance, creams can become lumpy or ‘gritty’ and changes in viscosity of liquid preparations, which can be detected when applied to the skin, may occur.<br/><br/>Audible effects<br/><br/>Apart from immediate manifestations of toxicity, which happily appear to be rare, audible manifestations of spoilage are the most dramatic. If visible effects of spoilage are obscured by the pack, an explosion can be the first indication that a gas-producing micro-organism has successfully adapted itself to what may have been considered inimical conditions. <br/><br/>Types of Susceptible Product<br/><br/>The range and composition of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products is so varied and the species, and even strains, of micro-organism capable of causing spoilage are so multifarious that, as we have already emphasized, each spoilage incident tends to be unique. Generalizations about susceptible products are therefore likely to be inaccurate and are made more difficult today because of the inclusion, particularly in cosmetics, of increasingly sophisticated and often highly biodegradable ingredients. Nevertheless, some types of product are more susceptible than others to spoilage by specific organisms and those of which we have experience are described below.<br/><br/>Liquids <br/><br/>Water:<br/><br/>Water is a major constituent of living material and participates in many metabolic reactions. Bacteria, in particular, require high concentrations of water in their immediate environment and may be regarded as aquatic organisms. Hence, all products containing large amounts of free water can be particularly susceptible to spoilage by bacteria.<br/><br/>Water supplied by water undertakings in this country is of high micro-biological quality and is generally suitable for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Low-conductivity water, whether prepared by distillation or deionization, may be chemically purer but can constitute a greater microbiological hazard. Distilled water leaving the still can readily pick up organisms from pipes and tubing and ion-exchange columns may actually serve as a reservoir of organisms because nutrient organic residues are not removed by the process. Without effective treatment to minimize contamination, water can, within a few days, contain large numbers of initially Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and subsequently a wide variety of bacterial, moulds and yeasts. At this stage, visible and olfactory spoilage occurs and a foul taste may develop. Indeed, contaminated deionized water has often been incriminated as the original source of spoilage in a formulation. Often the responsible organism arepesudomonads which are not only highly resistant to preservatives but are also able to use the widest range of organic compounds as substrates.1.4 Isolation of Contaminant in Pure Culture<br/><br/>In order to study the properties of a given organism, it is necessary to handle it in pure culture free of all other types of organism by isolating a single cell colony from all others and cultivated in such a manner that is collectively progeny also remain isolated.<br/><br/>Since in the majority of cases, the organism to be isolated is part of a mixed population, the isolation of a single species from the environment is crucial. The isolation of single species from a mixture of micro-organisms is called the pure culture technique. Two methods are routinely used in the laboratory to obtain pure cultures, each can be enhanced by isolation of selective media if appropriate. They include:<br/><br/>(a)Pour Plate Method<br/><br/>In this method, the mixed population of micro-organism is first diluted and a small quantity is transferred to the bottom of a sterile petri-dish. Melted agar is then poured into the petri-dish to cover the micro-organisms and gently tilted to ensure uniform distribution of organism. Colonies will develop on the surface as well as within the Agar.<br/><br/>(b)Streak Plate Method<br/><br/>In the streak method, a small quantity of the mixed bacteria population in a specimen is streaked directly on the surface of an already set agar medium. The streaking is done with a wire loop. The procedure thins out the microbial population on the surface of the Agar, and where an organism has been deposited, a colony will develop after a suitable incubation. From one of these colonies is streaked onto the surface of a second plate and the colonies that develop there are also examined. This subculture procedure ensures that only one kind of micro-organism was present in the initially isolated colony.<br/><br/>1.4.1Identification of Contaminants (Micro-organism)<br/><br/>The various metabolic activities of bacteria and their responses to immediate environmental changes have been explored in the design of special diagnostic and selective media.<br/><br/>Such media are used in public health laboratories and hospitals for identifying organisms found in samples believed to be contaminated by them and as an aid to their diagnosis and treatment. <br/><br/>Micro-organisms have specific shapes and structures that can be identified and characterized. The following are some of the techniques used in the identification of micro-organism in the laboratory.<br/><br/>(a)Examination of stained preparations: for example Gram-staining procedure: This is one of the first important identification procedures after isolation of colonies and enhances the divison of the bacteria world to at least four (4) categories, namely:<br/><br/>i.Gram Positive colliii.Gram Positive Bacilli<br/><br/>iii.Gram Negative colliiv.Gram Negative Bacilli<br/><br/>(b)Examination of biochemical characteristics, for example: <br/><br/>Catalase Test<br/><br/>In some micro-organism, the transfer of hydrogen to oxygen in respiration results in the production of hydrogen peroxide (H202) which is toxic to the cell. Most aerobic organisms produce an enzyme catalase, that is capable of oxidizing the H202 , bubbles of oxygen will appears if the cells are in the colony. This test is used in the laboratory to distinguish between staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermictis and staphylococcus saprophyticas.<br/><br/>Coagulase Test<br/><br/>There is some difficulty in determining virulence among staphylococcal strains. The primary laboratory criterion for virulence is the “coagulase test”. Strains that clots plasma are termed coagulase positive which is tantamount to saying that they are virulent while strains that do not clot plasma are termed coagulase negative.<br/><br/>Indole Test<br/><br/>Breakdown of amino acid tryptophan by bacteria leads to the accumulation of indole. Indole can be detected in the birth culture by the addition of a colour reagent – korac’s solution. A positive test is the appearance of a red ring in the brota.<br/><br/>Quality Control of Topical Pharmaceutical Products<br/><br/>Topical (non-sterile) pharmaceutical products for application to the skin should have the following control:<br/><br/>Number of micro-organisms is to be limited to not more than organisms, per ml or per gram of the preparation of these organisms, none should be staphylococcus, enterobacteria … or psendomanas.<br/><br/>For fungi, not more than 102 moulds per gram or per ml. however, for certain preparation especially those whose raw materials are derived from a natural source, the presence of a few enterbacteriaccae may be tolerable, this number should however, not to be more than entities per gram.<br/><br/>In all such cases, it is essential to specify the absence of Eseherichia coli and salmonella typi.<br/><br/>The lowest possible number and least pathonenic nature of micro-organism can be ensured in a finished product by:<br/><br/>1.Quality Control<br/><br/>This refers to that area of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) which ensures that”<br/><br/>(a)At each stage of manufacture, the necessary tests were conducted <br/><br/>(b)The product is not released for marketing until it has passed the appropriate tests.<br/><br/>2.Quality Assurance<br/><br/>This refers to the sum total of the process involved in making sure that the final product is of the quality and intended for use by the consumers<br/><br/>3.Good manufacturing practice (GMP)<br/><br/>This is an area of quality assurance which is aimed at ensuring that a product is consistently manufactured to a quality appropriate for its intended use.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>i.Isolation of possible microbial contamination and contaminants in selected creams.<br/><br/>ii.Determination of the number of contaminants per gram and/or per ml<br/><br/>iii.Identification of these microbial contaminants to see if they conform to standard.</p>\n\nMICROBIOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF SELECTED CREAMS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MICROBIOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF SELECTED CREAMS", "id": 46}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p> <p>Two medicated soaps and one local soap were investigated for their antibacterial activities against <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.

This study was conducted to determine the incidence of <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and <em>E.coli</em> isolates in certain clinical and environmental samples as well as to determine the susceptibility patterns of these isolates to some commonly used antibiotics. The organisms were isolated using standard microbiological techniques and the antibiotic susceptibility was determined using disc diffusion method while plasmid curing was done using sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). The result of this studies showed that most of the clinical and environmental isolates were more resistant to amoxacillin and augumentin but clinical isolates showed higher resistance. It was also observed that clinical isolates showed least resistance to gentamycin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin; similar least resistance were observed in environmental samples with gentamycin and ciprofloxacin. There was a significant difference (P≥ 0.05) in the percentage resistance between the clinical and environmental isolates. Thirteen isolates that were resistant to more than seven antibiotics were subjected to plasmid curing using 1% and 5% SDS. It was observed that at treatment with 1% SDS some of the isolates became resistant to more than one antibiotic; when SDS was increased to 5%, some of the isolates that were resistant become completely sensitive to all the antibiotics used. However, one of the<em>P.aeruginosa</em> that was initially sensitive to chloramphenicol became completely resistant at 5% SDS and another isolate of <em>P.aeruginosa</em> that was initially sensitive to septrin, sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin became completely resistant at 1% and 5% SDS. This study indicates that <em>P.aeruginosa</em> and <em>E.coli</em> isolated from clinical samples were more resistant to antibiotics than those isolated from environmental samples. It has as well shown that there may be a possible transfer of resistance from one strain to another.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1 Introduction</strong></div> <div>The discovery of antibacterial agents had a major impact on the rate of survival from infections. However, the changing patterns of antimicrobial resistance caused a demand for new antibacterial agents. Therefore, the emergence of bacterial resistance to most of the commonly used antibiotics is of considerable medical significance (Khan and Malik, 2001; Oteo <em>et al.</em>, 2002).</div> <div>Antibiotic resistance genes in most bacteria are frequently found in extra chromosomal elements known as R-plasmids. <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> is naturally resistant to many of the widely used antibiotics, so chemotherapy is often difficult (Dubois <em>et al.</em>, 2001).</div> <div>Resistance is due to a resistance transfer plasmid (R-plasmid) which is a plasmid carrying gene encoding proteins that detoxify various antibiotics (Poole, 2004). Antibiotic resistant bacteria are widespread. Several antibiotic resistant genes can be carried by a single R-plasmid or alternatively, a cell may contain several R plasmids.

Therefore,<em> Escherichia coli </em>is widely disseminated in the environment through the faeces of humans and otheranimals and its presence in water is generally considered to indicate faecal contamination and the possible presence of enteric pathogens. <em>Esherichia coli</em> is able to acquire antibiotic resistance easily. Antibiotic resistant <em>Esherichia coli</em> may pass on the genes responsible for antibiotic resistance to other species of bacteria, such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, through a process called horizontal gene transfer (Dubois <em>et al.,</em> 2001). </div>\n\nMULTIDRUG RESISTANCE PROFILES OF CLINICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISOLATES OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA AND ESCHERICHIA COLI<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE PROFILES OF CLINICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISOLATES OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA AND ESCHERICHIA COLI", "id": 48}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <p>Crude oil and kerosene have useful applications in the society and are, therefore, used as sources of income and energy. However, the spills arising from crude oil and kerosene in our environment are becoming a visible problem in our ecosystem. Crude oil and kerosene pollute our farmlands and other arable lands and may negatively affect the growth and activities of nitrifying bacteria responsible for nitrification process, leading to loss of soil fertility. Considering the important roles played by nitrifying bacteria in soil fertility in our ecosystem, the assessment of the response of the nitrifying bacteria to pollution stress exerted by crude oil and kerosene on them was investigated. Two genera of nitrifying bacteria were isolated from the soil and were identified as<em>Nitrosomonas</em> sp and <em>Nitrobacter</em> sp based on their morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics. <em>Nitrosomonas</em> sp was isolated using Winogradsky medium for nitrification phase I while <em>Nitrobacter</em> sp was isolated using Winogradsky medium for nitrification phase II. A range of crude oil and kerosene concentrations (in triplicates) were prepared and introduced into sterile Winogradsky salt broth to arrive at final concentrations of 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 5% and 10% (v/v) respectively. The flasks were thereafter inoculated with standardized pure cultures of <em>Nitrosomonas</em> sp and <em>Nitrobacter</em> sp using a uniform inoculum size of 1ml of 1.5 x106 cells for <em>Nitrosomonas</em> sp and 1.2 x106 cells for <em>Nitrobacter</em> sp and incubated for 120 hours. The result of the toxicity test carried out on these isolates showed that the sensitivity of each test organism was a function of both the contact time and concentrations of crude oil and kerosene. The effect of different concentrations of crude oil and kerosene on the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate showed that oxidation of nitrite to nitrate was hindered at higher concentrations of the two pollutants, but, at lower concentrations, crude oil and kerosene did not hinder oxidation of nitrite to nitrate. Information generated from various tests can be of use in the management of pollution for the purpose of prediction of environmental effects of crude oil and kerosene, comparison of toxicants or organisms or test conditions and regulation of crude oil and kerosene spills. For instance this study will help us to provide information for regulatory purposes that a soil contaminated with certain percentage of crude oil or kerosene should not be used for agricultural purposes or practices.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>Introduction</strong></div> <div>Crude oil and kerosene have useful applications in our society and are, therefore, used as</div> <div>source of income and energy. However, the spill arising from crude oil and kerosene dumped into our environment is becoming a visible problem in our ecosystems ( Njoku <em>et al.</em>, 2009). The environment is increasingly exposed to changes resulting from both crude oil and refined petroleum products contamination. These changes could be drastic and as such affect the ecosystem substantially (Ikhajiagbe and Anoliefo, 2010). Crude oil and its refined products can be released into the environment from a number of sources, which can pollute both land and water (Jane<em>,</em> 2010). Refined petroleum products result when crude oil is split into fractions such as petrol, kerosene, diesel oil, engine oil and many other petroleum products by a process called fractional distillation. Crude oil, which has accumulated underground, can reach the surface if not contained by impermeable rock.</div> <div>Apart from this release of crude oil, the main sources of crude oil and refined petroleum products such as petrol, kerosene, diesel and motor engine oil, released on land comes from the disposal of waste motor oil, the leaking of storage tanks, and other spillages and accidents during the transportation of crude oil and other petroleum-based products (Raina <em>et al.,</em> 2009). The spill arising from crude oil and refined petroleum products dumped into our environment is becoming a visible problem in our ecosystem. Crude oil and kerosene can pollute our farmlands and other arable lands and may, negatively, affect the growth and activities of nitrifying bacteria responsible for nitrification process, leading to loss of soil fertility (John <em>et al.,</em> 2011). These contaminants/pollutants may contain components that may be toxic to soil microorganisms including the nitrifying bacteria and as a result may display some levels of toxicity on the growth of the nitrifying bacteria indigenous to the soil thereby affecting their activities in the soil.</div>\n\nCOMPARATIVE TOXICITY OF CRUDE OIL AND KEROSENE ON THE GROWTH OF NITRIFYING BACTERIA ISOLATED FROM SOIL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMPARATIVE TOXICITY OF CRUDE OIL AND KEROSENE ON THE GROWTH OF NITRIFYING BACTERIA ISOLATED FROM SOIL", "id": 49}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Honey has been used traditionally for ages to treat infectious diseases. Antimicrobial activity of honey is complex due to the involvement of multiple bioactive compounds. The physico-chemical and antimicrobial properties of honey varieties from <em>Apis</em> <em>mellifera </em>and stingless bees,<em>Hypotrigona </em>sp. (Okotobo - Igbo) and<em> Melipona </em>sp.(Ifufu - Igbo) were studied using International Honey Commission protocols and microbiological methods (agar-well diffusion and broth microdilution) respectively. A total of nine honey samples (3 from each) were used. The physico-chemical analyses of the honey varieties showed that the honeys had mean pH range of 3.73±0.08 - 4.24±0.20. Honey samples from <em>Hypotrigona</em> sp. had the highest mean moisture (17.50 ± 0.80 %), total dissolved solids (370.01 ± 22.51 ppm), hydromethylfurfural (16.58 ± 0.37 mg/kg), total acidity (35.57 ± 0.42me q/kg), protein content (16.58 ± 0.37 g/kg)and phenol content (527.41 ± 3.60 mg/kg). <em>Melipona</em> sp. honey had the highest average flavonoids (86.39 ± 4.69 mg/kg), total sugar (80.71 ± 1.37 % (g/100g) and reducing sugar (75.64 ± 1.99 % (g/100g) contents. There were no statistically significant differences between the mean pH, electrical conductivity and protein contents of <em>A. mellifera</em> and <em>Melipona</em> sp. honeys (<em>p</em>&lt; 0.05). Several strong correlations were observed among some of the physicochemical properties of these honey varieties. In the initial antimicrobial activity testing, <em>Hypotrigona</em> sp. honey samples had statistically the highest mean inhibition zones diameter (mm) against MDR <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (7.14 ± 4.11), <em>Klebsiella pneumonia</em>(7.92 ± 3.96)<em>,</em> <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </em>ATCC 25783 (9.77 ±4.58)<em>, </em>MDR<em> S. enterica </em>(6.96 ± 4.03),and <em>Aspergillus niger</em> (10.12 ± 5.51)<em>.</em>The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the honey varieties from <em>A. mellifera, Hypotrigona</em> sp. and <em>Melipona</em> sp. ranged from 6.3 – 25.0%, 3.1 – 12.5% and 6.3 – 25.0% (v/v) respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the mean MICs of <em>A. mellifera,</em> <em>Hypotrigona </em>sp. and<em> Melipona </em>sp.honeys against<em> P. aeruginosa </em>ATCC 25783 (7.64 ±2.76, 7.28 ± 4.14 and 8.33 ± 3.31 % v/v respectivel y).<em>Hypotrigona</em> sp. honey had the least mean MICs (4.15 ± 1.58 – 11.11 ± 2.76 % v/v) against most of the test organisms.The minimum biocidal concentration (MBC) of the honey varieties from<em>A.</em> <em>mellifera, Hypotrigona </em>sp. and<em> Melipona </em>sp. against the test organismsvaried from 6.3</div> <div>– 50%, 3.1 – 25% and 12 – 50% (v/v) respectively.

It was not until late 19th century that researchers discovered that honey has natural antimicrobial qualities (Zumla and Lulat, 1989). Resistance to antibiotics continues to rise and few new therapies are on the horizon, there is further increased interest in the antimicrobial potency of honey (Fahim <em>et al</em>., 2014). Previous studies showed that honey hadremarkable antimicrobial activity against fungi, bacteria,viruses and protozoa(Molan, 1992; Sherlock <em>et al</em>., 2010; Mohapatra <em>et al</em>., 2011; Fahim <em>et al</em>., 2014).</div> <div>Honey is a natural sweet mixture produced by honey insects from the nectar of flowers or from living parts of plants. The insect transform the nectar into honey by combining this mixture with substances of their own. The mixture is then regurgitated, dehydrated and stored in the waxy honeycomb inside the hive to ripen and mature for further use (Iurlina and Fritz, 2005). Honey is composed mainly of carbohydrates, smaller amount of water and a great number of minor components. Sugars are the main constituents of honey, constituting of about 95%. Honey characterization is based on the determination of its chemical, physical or biological properties (Gomes <em>et al.,</em> 2010).</div> <div>Even though honey is produced worldwide, its composition and antimicrobial activity can be variable, and are dependent primarily on their botanical origin, geographical and entomological source (Maryann, 2000). Other certain external factors, such as harvesting season, environmental factors, processing and storage condition, also play important roles (Gheldof and Engeseth, 2002). Entomologically, the honey variety produced by honey bees (the genus<em>Apis</em>) is one most commonly referred to, as it is the type of honey collected by most beekeepers and consumed by most people in Nigeria. Honeys produced by other insects (stingless insects) have different properties (Sherlock <em>et al.,</em>2010).</div> <div>Antimicrobial activity of honey is highly complex due to the involvement of multiple compounds and also due to large variations in the concentrations of these compounds among honeys. It depends on osmotic effect (sugar concentration), hydrogen peroxide, and low pH, as well as more recently identified compounds, methyl glyoxal and antimicrobial peptide, bee defensin-1 (Fahim <em>et al</em>., 2014).</div>\n\nANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITIES AND PHYSICO-CHEMICAL ANALYSES OF HONEYS FROM HYPOTRIGONA SP., MELIPONA SP.

It is rich in protein and is obtained by a solid state fermentation of the seed of African oil bean tree (Pentaclethra macrophylla Benth). It is essential food item from various traditional ceremonies where it is mixed with slices of boiled stock fish (ugba and okpoloko). The natural fermentation of the seed which at present is still done at the house-hold level, renders the production nutritious, palatable and non-toxic (Enujiugha, 2002).</p> <p>        Its production, like many African fermented foods depends, entirely on mixed fermentation by microorganism from diverse source.</p> <p>        Some of these seeds have been exploited as soup bases such as Gbegiri from Vigna unguicuata (Akanbi, 1992). Others are fermented and used as condiments and seasonings such as okpei from Prosopis africana (Achi, 1992) and ogiri from Ricinus cummunis (Odunka, 1989). Another of such seeds is the African oil bean seed (Pentaclethra macrophylla Benth), a highly nutritious leguminous crop seed abundant in the rain forest areas of west and central Africa.</p> <p>Pentaclethra macrophylla Benth is a large woody plant abundant in the rain forest areas of west and central Africa. It’s origin in Nigeria is believed to be around 1937 (Ladipo, 1984); where it is found in the South Nigeria, (Mbajunwa et al, 1998).</p> <p>        “Ugba” Pentaclethra macrophylla Benth belongs to the Family Leguminosae and sub-family microsoideae (Keay, 1989 and NFTA, 1995). </p> <p>        Ugba seeds are irregular and oval, they are flat, black and hard pods. It is composed of oil, protein and small amounts of carbohydrate (Obeta, 1982).</p> <p>        Production of Ugba is still on age old traditional family in the rural area. The fermentation depends on random inoculation of boiled slices of the oil bean seed by microorganism within he immediate environment. Earlier report attribute the sources of the micro-organism to the leaves used in packaging, human handling, container and utensils used in processing (Obeta, 1993, Odunfa &amp; Oyeyiola, 1985).</p> <p>        A number of researches have been carried out to know what causes this fermentation, and was attributed to micro-organisms that are probably introduced through the air, water, and banana leaves. Organisms such as Micrococus roseus, Micrococcus luteus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus substilis, Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus circclans, E-Coli</p> <p>        Fermented African oil bean seed (ugba), has a high rate of susceptibility to microbial spoilage and therefore has a very short self life of 1-2 weeks (Enujiugha &amp; Olajundoye, 2001).</p> <p>        Manifestation of food spoilage are many and vary typically resulting in an off smell, colour, taste and texture.</p> <p>         Reports by Mbajunwa (1998) Obeta, (1983) and Nwagu et al. (2010) indicates that micrococcus species do not play an active role during microbial fermentation of Ugba. </p> <p>        However, further work on spoilage association of ugba by Nwagu et al (2010) showed that the population of Micrococcus sp increased with increase in keeping time of ugba. This indicates the ability of micrococcus to thrive in the alkalophilic environment while constituting as a spoilage organism of ugba. This may be attributed to the ability of microorganism to produce amylase, lipase, or protease able to utilize protein, carbohydrate or lipid content of ugba as source of nutrition (Njoku et al., 1990).</p> <p>        Amylases are enzymes that breakdown starch or glycogen. The amylases can be derived from several sources such as plants, animals and microbes. The major advantage of using microorganisms for production of amylase is in economical bulk production capacity and microbes are also easy to manipulate to obtain enzymes of desired characteristics</p> <p>1.1   Aims and Objectives</p> <p>        This work is aimed at the following;</p> <p>a.           isolating micrococcus from fermented ugba</p> <p>b.           producing amylase from the micrococcus from ugba </p>\n\nISOLATION OF MICROCOCCUS FROM FERMENTED UGBA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ISOLATION OF MICROCOCCUS FROM FERMENTED UGBA", "id": 53}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div><p> <strong>1.0   INTRODUCTION</strong>         Yoghurt is a cultural diary product produced by lactic fermentation of milk (Hui, 1992).

It is one of the most popular fermented milk products in the world and produced commercially at home. (Willey <em>et al., </em>2008). In its commercial production, non fat or low fat milk is pasteurized cooled to 43°c and are inoculated with known cultures of microorganisms referred to as starter cultures. The starter cultures may be a pure culture of a particular species of <em>Lactobacillus </em>or a mixed culture of <em>Streptococcus thermophilus </em>and<em>Lactobacillus bulgaricus </em>in a 1: 1 ratio. The coccus which is the<em>Streptococcus thermophilus </em>grows faster than the Rod which is the<em>Lactobacillus bulgaricus </em>and is primarily responsible for acid production while the rod adds flavor and aroma. The growth of these Microorganisms causes the transformation of milk's sugar, lactose into lactic acid. This process gives yoghurt it's texture. The associative growth of the two organisms results in acid production at a rate greater than that produced by them individually.</p> <p>Yoghurt is generally made from a standardized mixture containing whole milk, partially defatted milk, condensed skim milk cream and non fat dry milk. Alternatively milk may be partly concentrated by removal of 15- 20% water in a vacuum pan or by heating. While the microorganisms fermenting milk confers on it certain health benefits inadequate pasteurized milk may contain microorganism of special importance to man. (Boor and Murphy, 2002). In which its presence or absence in milk may reflect success or failure of good manufacturing practice (GMP) or cause infection when consumed together with food. This is of economic significance in Africa where the HIV/AIDS and cancer scourge has left the public who consume milk products immune suppressed and prone to bacterial and fungi infection. (Boor,2001).</p> <p>Health complications associated with consumption of inadequately pasteurized milk products include serious infections that are hard, to treat with antibiotics. This becomes clinically significant if organisms isolated from an assessed sample is resistant to conventional antibiotics. Thus, can confer antibiotic resistance to the infected host while providing no alternative drug (Gould, 1994). Heat treated yoghurt do not contain lactic acid bacteria as these are killed during post fermentation. Yoghurt manufacturing companies mainly market \"heat treat\" yoghurt to prolong it's shelf life (Hove <em>et </em>al, 1999). It is important however to evaluate the microbial gravity of some milk products sold in Nigeria. This project work aims at assessing the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of microorganisms present in yoghurt sold in Enugu.</p>                                                          \n\nASSESSMENT OF THE ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY PATTERN OF MICROORGANISMS PRESENT IN YOGHURT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF THE ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY PATTERN OF MICROORGANISMS PRESENT IN YOGHURT", "id": 57}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT </p> <p>Comparative analysis  of water was  carried out on well water, stream and pipe born water obviated within Emene locality of Enugu state the sample were subjected to some analytical tests final like presumptive tests, comfirmative test final like presumptive tests, comfirmative test, completed test, indole test and plate count for the organism that develop on  the culture, the result show that well water and stream were found to contain pathogenic organism like salmonella, Shigella andstaphylococcus  aureus  as well as numerous viable counts, the cloform or the indicator organisms Escherichia coli the family of enterbactercteriaceae were isolated too form well water the pipe borne water a sample containedstaphylococcus  aureus and have lowtotal viable counts. </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>           Following the theory of creation, it is clear that water is as old as man.

Water is a potential carried of pathogenic organisms that can endage human life. Most of drinking water sources are often contaminated with different pollutants like faces, animal and plant wastes, making such water  unfit for drinking if not treated. The pollution of water with pathogenic organisms and other pollutants can only be detected by carrying out microbiological assessment of such water. Most human disease such as typhoid paratyphoid cholera, arnboebiasis, Trichinosis, gastroenteritis, sanonall shigellosis, diphtheria, giadia, dracunculus etc are know to be water borne disease.

Production as a specialized industry (Encycloparredia Britaimca, 1988).  Heavy breed poultry animals are used for meat white light bread chickens are primarily for the production of eggs (Mc Graw Hill encydopaedia 1992).  The meat and eggs produced from poultry are important sources of dietary portion.  In Africa, animal protein foods from all sources contribute between 7g and 15g daily per person to the total food intake (Oyenyga, 1974).  Today, Poultry production in the country is increasing at a tremendous rate and yet cannot meet the demand because of population growth and the awareness created by the campaigns for the need of animal protein in the diet.</p> <p>The growth and well-being of organisms are to a large extent dependent on the mount and type of food they receive and the manner or rate at which they receive it. The food should contain nutrients such  as water, carbohydrates, fats, protein, minerals, vitamins and added growth factors improper balance.  Each of these nutrients has a major role to play concerning growth, maintenance and productivity of the poultry.  According to Leonard 91981), nutritional deficiency or inbalance. These diseases may include rickets, perosis, and nutritional roup, curly the paralysis etc.  These diseases could result due to deficiency in vitamins D, Manganese, vitamin A, vitamin E and riboflavin.  Improper sanitation and inadequate management play major roles in disease.  Outbreak and productivity of the desired products.  In developing     countries like Nigeria, the cost of feeding, especially the monogastries continues to escalate primarily in response the soaring cost of the conventional feed ingredients.  This phenomenon is precipitated by under production and importation of some food stuff coupled with the competition between man and farm animal for energy and protein concentrates.</p> <p>The use of agro-industrial by-products towards reducing food cost has been widely recognized (EshieH and Ademosun, 1981; Atteh and Oloagbenla, 1993). Chicken and turkeys satisfy their energy needs provided the ration a allows them to do so (Church, 1988).  The are of course exceptional to this rule particularly where heavy breed layers are concerned, when birds have a tendency to over-eat.  Where this is a problem, it is general practice to subject the birds to some degree of food restriction during the growing  and production periods. The major ingredients that are integral parts of poultry rations at the present time in the USA are corn, as the primary source of energy and soybean meal as the major protein supplement (Roland et  al    1972), while in Nigeria, Udedibie et al (1988) and Nwokon (1993) produced poultry offal meal (P.O.M) and chicken offal meal (COM) respectively from waste product similar to poultry visceral Offal (PVO) according to these authors POM has been used to replace ground nut cake in layer and broiler finisher diets and COM has been used along with  fish meat and blood meat as sources of methodize and lysine in the starter diets of lockerels.  These major ingredients, usually available in plentiful supply, allow rapid growth or high egg production with very efficient conversion.  However, corn-soy rations are deficient in some nutrients for chickens and these nutrients are normally supplied by other poultry meal.</p> <p>There are different  types of feeds given to poultry brids depending on the purpose.  These different types of feeds given to poultry birds depending on the purpose.  These different types are the breeders’ starters, growers’ and layer’ feeds. The percentage of each ingredient in the feed varies depending on the type of feed. The ingredient include ground yellow corn, ground oats or barley, Alfata meat, Fish meal, Oystershell, managised salt, vitamin A, vitamin D, and coccidiostat (which is given in form and at the level recommended by the manufacturer). The different percentage of each ingredient varies depending on the kind of feed for example, ground yellow corn in starter and grower feed is 25% and 22% in breeder and layer feeds. There could be the same percentage of a particular ingredient in different feeds as in the case of a alfafa meal which constitutes 10% inall the feed types. Some ingredients could be absent in a particular feed but present in the others as in the case of riboflavin supplement which is absent in starter feed and present at the levels of 2 and 5% in rower, layer and breeder feeds respectively.</p> <p>To maintain healthy birds, the feeds are kept fresh as much as possible at all times.  The amount of feed in feeders are limited to the extent necessary to avoid wastage.  It is a good practice to fill hanging feeders – only three quarter full, and trough feeders only two third full (Graham, 1977). Checking the weight of the birds and its feed consumption is very necessary.  A drop in feed intake usually is the first indication of trouble, a disease outbreak, molt, stress or poor management (Graham, 1977).  Most poultry feed are prepared in dehydrated forms and because of this, there is the need to store them properly  to avoid moisture uptake and damage by heat.  In this way,. They can remain safe for a considerable period of time without loosing their safeness and value.  The feed should be stored in a suitable place where it will not be attacked by microorganisms, insects, rodents, etc.  Air tight storage is not advisable because offensive odour might result when there is obstruction of out flow and inflow of air (Leonard, 1981).  High temperature and oxidation destroy certain vitamins, therefore, care must be taken in the  preservation and storage of feeds to protect the vitamins they contain (Mc Graw – Hill encyclopaedia 1992). The condition of feed storage and handling could be a source of contamination.  When feeds are unhygienically handled and stored, there could be a buildup of microbial contaminants.</p> <p>Poultry have been found to be susceptible to infection due to certain microorganisms and man may be secondarily infected through heavy contaminated food such as poultry meat and eggs (Gorden and Tucker, 1965, Hall, 1977, and Barrell, 1982).  Micro-organism that may contaminate feed include the following general another disease caused by salmonella infections is paratyphoid. Paratyphoid is an infection disease of chi, Entherobacter,  Escherichia,  Protens, Pseudomonas, staphylococcus, salmonella, shigella, providencia, serratia, Klebsiella,streptococcus, clostridium, Aspergillus and Erysiphelothrie (Leonard, 1981). Typically, in some countries, about 50% of all outbreaks of salmonellosis in man are caused by infections derived from these sources and the incidence of salmonella in poultry carcasses has, in certain cases been found to be 7% or more (Van schothorst Notermans, 1980).  Okongi (1984) examined poultry feed and found that salmonella was present in the sample.  Another disease caused by salmonella infections is paratyphoid, Paratyphoid is an infections disease of chicken, turkeys, ducks and other birds.  Bofulism another kind of disease occurs in both young and adult poultry birds.  It is caused by a bacterium, Clostridium Botulinum. This organism grows in decaying plants and animals materials. Birds feeding material containing the toxins produced by the bacteria lose control of their neck muscle (Leonard, 1981).</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong> <strong>Statement of problem</strong></p> <p>Poultry feed is known to contain salmonella, and other microorganisms are also implicated in poultry feeds, (Klinger and Ladidot, 1993).  It is therefore pertinent to carry out microbiological examination of commercially prepared poultry feeds to ascertain their safety to livestock.</p> <p>The presence of moulds and mycotoxins in poultry feeds are usually from the raw materials used in their production. Mould and mycotoxin contamination of the raw materials can occur pre-harvest in field produced fungi and post-harvest in store produced fungi (Krnjaja <em>et al., </em>2008; Davies and Wales, 2010). Feeds may be contaminated by pathogens at any point in the production, storage, preparation processes. Pathogens like <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Escherichia coli</em> have been reported to be transmitted by the feed to susceptible consumers, where they grow and cause diseases, or a food borne infection (Church and Dupont, 1993). <em>Salmonella </em>spp. is the major hazard for microbial contamination of animal feed. </p>                                                           \n\nTHE MICROBIAL SAFETY OF COMMERCIAL POULTRY FEEDS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE MICROBIAL SAFETY OF COMMERCIAL POULTRY FEEDS", "id": 59}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE </p> <p><strong>2.0     INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The term poultry used in agriculture generally refers to all domesticated birds kept for egg or meat production.  These includes chickens (domestic fowls),  Grallus domestics, turkeys, ducks and geese.  This project will deal largely with the chicken which are the most common domestic fowl.  The species of poultry are habitable or can survive in different environments therefore, they are widely distributed in the world, with great increase in population, the demand for goods especially protein food become acute.  To meet the demand for animal protein and its development, rapid multiplying ones becomes very necessary.

Proteases are (physiologically) necessary for  living organisms; they are ubiquitous and found in a wide diversity of sources. Protease is the most important industrial enzyme of interest accounting for about 60% of the total enzyme market in the world  and  account  for approximately 40% of the total worldwide enzyme sale (Godfrey and West, 1996; Chouyyok <em>et al.</em>, 2005). They are generally used in detergents (Barindra <em>et al.</em>, 2006), food industries, leather, meat processing, cheese making, silver recovery from photographic film, production of digestive and certain medical treatments of inflammation and virulent wounds (Rao <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Paranthaman <em>et al.</em>, 2009). They also have medical and pharmaceutical applications.</p> <p>Microbial  proteases  are  degradative  enzymes  which catalyze the total hydrolysis of proteins (Raju <em>et al.</em>, 1994; Haq <em>et al.</em>, 2006). The molecular weight of proteases ranges from 18 – 90 kDa  (Sidney and Lester, 1972). These enzymes are found in a wide diversity of sources such as plants, animals and microorganisms but they are mainly produced by bacteria and fungi. Microbial proteases are predominantly extracellular and can be secreted in the fermentation medium.</p> <p>In the production of protease, it has been  shown to be inducible and was affected by the nature of the substrate used in fermentation. Therefore, the choice of an appropriate inducing substrate is of great importance. Different carbon sources such as wheat bran, rice straw, rice bran, cotton  and  bagasse have been studied for the induction and biosynthesis of protease. However, wheat bran is a superior carbon source for the production of protease by <em>Aspergillus flavus</em>. So the further studies were carried out by using wheat bran as carbon source.</p> <p>The use of agro-industrial residues as the basis for cultivation media is a matter of great  interest, aiming to decrease the costs of enzyme production and meeting the increase  in  awareness  on  energy  conservation  and recycling (Singh <em>et al.</em>, 2009). Major  impediments to the exploitation of commercial enzymes are their yield, stability, specificity and the cost of production. New enzymes for use in commercial applications with desirable biochemical and physiochemical characteristics and low production cost have been focus of much research (Kabli, 2007). Solid state fermentation (SSF) was chosen for the present research because it has been reported to be of more grated  productivity than that of submerged fermentation (Ghildyal  <em>et al.</em>, 1985; Hesseltine, 1972). Economically, SSF offers many advantages including superior volumetric productivity, use of simpler machinery, use of inexpensive  substrates, simpler downstream  processing, and lower energy requirements when compared with submerged fermentation (Paranthaman <em>et al.</em>, 2009).</p> <p><strong>1.2     Aim of the study</strong></p> <p>The aim of  this  study  was  to produce  protease from <em>Aspergillus flavus </em>using wheat bran as a substrate under Solid State Fermentation.</p> <p><strong>1.3     Objectives of the study</strong></p> <p>The objectives of the study include:</p> <p>·        To isolate <em>Aspergillus  flavus</em> from spoilt bread in Gwagwalada.</p> <p>·        To determine the frequencies of occurrence of  the isolated <em>Aspergillus flavus</em> from spoilt bread using simple percentages.</p> <p>·        To determinethe proteolytic potential of the isolated fungi using basal medium.</p> <p>·        To determine the quantity of the protease enzyme produced by the isolated fungi using spectrophotometer.</p>                                                            \n\nPRODUCTION OF PROTEASE BY ASPERGILLUS FLAVUS IN SOLID STATE FERMENTATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PRODUCTION OF PROTEASE BY ASPERGILLUS FLAVUS IN SOLID STATE FERMENTATION", "id": 61}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p>The study was carried out with aim to isolate <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> from cow meat and determine the antibiogram pattern of <em>S. aureus</em>. Three samples of cow meat from three different locations (Gwagwalada market, Abattoir market and <em>Kasuan Dare</em>) in Gwagwalada were collected to isolate <em>S. aureus</em> from the samples. The organisms isolated were <em>Salmonella spp</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Staphylococcus</em> <em>aureus</em> and <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em>. Several biochemical tests were carried out to identify, the <em>S. aureus</em> isolates like Catalse test (positive), Manitol test (positive), Coagulase test (positive) and Oxidase test (negative). The antibiogram pattern of <em>S. aureus</em> was evaluated using commercially prepared disk. The antibiotics tested were Pefloxacin (Pef), Streptomycin (S), Ampiclox (Apx), Amoxacilin (Am) and Ciprofloxacin. The pattern indicated that the overall <em>S.</em> <em>aureus </em>were resistant to Pef, S, Cpx and less resistant to Am and Apx. Results clearly suggested a possibility of potential public health threat of <em>S. aureus</em> resulting from contamination of cow meat with pathogenic bacteria which is mainly due to unhygienic processing, handling, and unhygienic environment.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The right of a consumer is to have a product of good quality and not a product that will constitute any form of health hazard. Cow meat are highly desirable, palatable, digestible and highly nutritious. Cow meat is comprised of about 20-45% protein; others are water, fat, phosphorus, iron, vitamins and zinc (USDA, 2011). Quality products are those that meet some need or expectation of consumer and are safe and wholesome as well (Sahoo <em>et al</em>. 1996). The microbiological safety and quality of cow meat are equally important to producers, retailers and consumers. Two quite different groups of micro-organism are relevant: ones that are pathogens and ones that are generally harmless to human health, but being psychortrophic, they are able to multiply on the product during chill storage (Clay, 2004). Spoilage result mainly from off-odour development and product shelf-life is determined both by the number of spoilage organism present initially and the temperature history of the product at all stages of production and subsequent storage and handling (Pooni and Mead, 1984). For chill stored cow meat, Viehweg <em>et al</em>. (1989) demonstrated that virtually all the odourous substances found at spoilage could be attributed to microbial growth and metabolism. Contamination of cow meat with food borne pathogens remain an important public health issue, because it can lead to illness if there are malpractices in handling, cooking or post cooking storage of the product.</p> <p>Fresh (uncooked) food such as cow meat caries natural micro flora that may contain organism potentially harmful to humans. The microbial flora of cow meat is largely confined to the skin surface. Isolates from cow meat could include members of the following genera <em>Proteus,Enterobacter</em>, <em>Alcaligenes</em>, <em>Escherichia</em>, <em>Bacillus</em>, <em>Flavobacterium</em>, <em>Micrococcus</em>,<em>Pseudomonas</em>, <em>Staphylococcus</em> and  <em>Salmonella</em> (Frazier and Westhoff, 1988). </p> <p>Contamination of the skin and lining of the body cavity occurs during washing, plucking and evisceration. Bacterial numbers vary considerably on the surface of the cow meat. This variation is greater between cows found in different location. The type of organism isolated depends upon where the samples are taken and upon the stage of processing (Frazier <em>et al.</em>, 1985). Fresh cattle products like cow meat are known to undergo detoriation due to microbial action, chemical and physical changes. In normal handling and storage of cow meat, this detoriation changes are attributed to microbiological contamination and activity.</p> <p><strong>1.1 Contamination &amp; Preservation of Cow Meat</strong></p> <p>Cow and cow products are frequently contaminated with several types of micro-organism. This problem is even more severe under temperature-abused conditions as well as improper or inefficient refrigeration commonly observed in retail cow meat sold in open markets. Cow meat can be kept in good condition for month if properly freeze and the storage temperature is low enough. Cow meat should freeze fast enough to retain most of the natural bloom of a freshly killed cow. The storage temperature should be below 17.8ºC and relative humidity above 95% to reduce surface drying. Most cow meat is sharp-frozen at about 29ºC or less in circulating air or on a moving belt in a freezing tunnel. Other spoilage micro-organism are introduced into the cow meat by the workmen during cutting and evisceration, through water, and air in the dressing, cutting and cooling room environment (Bhagirathi <em>et al.,</em> 1982). However, various methods are used in the preservation of cow meat in order to reduce the incidence of these organisms. These include ascepsis, use of heat, use of low temperature, chilling, freezing, preservative such as asceptic, adipic, succinic etc at pH 2.5 and use of irradiation (Frazier and Westoff, 1988). Despite these methods of preservation, contamination of dairy products remains the order of the day before it gets to the final consumer.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>Many micro-organisms have been found to be pathogenic to human consumption.<em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> being one of the most ubiquitous on food material such as raw meat and raw bulk milk (Matthews <em>et</em> <em>al.</em>, 1997) was chosen to be studied to know the antibiotics that are most effective against <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. The knowledge of the antibiotics that are most effective can be suggested for the treatment of the cows that their meat are being sold in the market to reduce the effect of <em>Staphylococcal </em>infestation on cow meat and the resultant detrimental effects it has on humans when consumed.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Aims and Objectives</strong></p> <p>Various bacteria are associated with cow meat; this research is aimed at achieving the isolation of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> from cow meat sold at different locations in Gwagwalada metropolis. The specific objectives of this study include:</p> <p>i. To determine the amount of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> found in cow meat in Gwagwalada market.</p> <p>ii. To carry out antibiogram analysis of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.</p> <p>iii. To speculate the significance of the antibiotics used.</p>                                                           \n\nISOLATION, IDENTIFICATION AND ANTIBIOGRAM OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS ISOLATED FROM COW MEAT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ISOLATION, IDENTIFICATION AND ANTIBIOGRAM OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS ISOLATED FROM COW MEAT", "id": 62}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The study examined the various fungal pathogens associated with tomatoes spoilage as well as their preliminary taxonomic grouping up to genus level. 25 samples of the spoiled tomatoes were collected from five locations within Gwagwalada area council. Locations include: Passo Village, Gwagwalada market, Phase III, New Kutunku and Dagiri. Thesame prevalence rate(100%) was recorded for all tomato samples purchased in all locations.The level of awareness of the general public in regards to the spoilage of tomatoes by Fungi was very significant with about 62.5% of the respondents attesting to the claim of tomato spoilage caused by Fungi and 37.5% disagreeing. Morphological studies reveal the fungal members which include members of the genus <em>Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Fusarium, MucorPenicillium</em>and <em>Rhizopus</em> species. Species of <em>Fusarium</em> were seen to be the most occurring in all samples. Satistical analysis also concurred to the fact that fungi are responsible for spoilage of tomatoes purchached in Gwagwalada (p&lt; 0.05). It implies that fungi are greatly responsible for tomato spoilage. Proper handling, transportation and thorough washing with clean or chlorinated water will go a long way in reducing the risk of tomato spoilage by Fungi.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0                                 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Vegetables constitute commercially and nutritionally important indispensable food commodity. Vegetable naturally play a vital role in human nutrition by supplying the necessary growth factors such as vitamins and essential minerals in human daily diet and that can help to keep a good and normal health. Vegetables are widely distributed in nature. One of the limiting factors that influence the fruit economic value is the relatively short shelf-life period caused by pathogen’s attack (Droby, 2006: Zhu, 2006).</p> <p>Tomato (<em>Lycopersiconesculentum</em>) pronounced Toh-MAH-to is the most important vegetable worldwide. Tomato is an annual plant which belongs to the <em>Solanaceae</em>family which includes other well-known species such as Potato, Tobacco, Pepper and Egg plants (aubergine) and can reach a height of over two meters. It’s a berry fruit, tomato is grown mainly in soil (Frazier and Westhoff,2004).</p> <p>Tomato is essential mainly for its dietary needs and can be consumed in diverse ways. It can be cooked as vegetable, as an ingredient in many dishes and sauces; in the making of stew, fruit juices and can be eaten raw in salads(Masefield <em>et al.,</em> 2002).</p> <p>The modern day tomatowhich is a very popular fruitoriginated from South-Western Hemisphere, now the Peru-Euador area(Rick,2001).From here,it was distributed to many parts of tropical America. It possibly arrived the West African Ports via Portuguese traders or the Sudan (Tindall, 2004).</p> <p>Tomato in West Africa is grown in gardens and irrigation schemes. In Nigeria, most tomatoes are grown in the northern parts of the country(Erinle,2007) and there is no record of any systematic or organized traditional storage method for vegetables and fruits. They are usually sold immediately after harvesting. They are packed in baskets, cardboard boxes, or wooden crates ready for transportation to the markets.</p> <p>Tomato is the most perishable vegetable during handling, transportation and storage. This is because tomato contains large amount of water which makes them susceptible to spoilage by the action of microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria and protozoans (Ross, 1975). Estimates have shown that about one third of the produce is lost before reaching the consumer (Erinle, 2007), this loss has been attributed to a number of factors which include physical (mechanical breakage, bruises), physiological and also damages caused by pathological agents (Thompson and Kelly, 2000), market value of the tomato are mainly reduced by this factors.</p> <p>Watt and Merrill, (2000) defined spoiled food as that which have been damaged or injured so as to render it undesirable for human consumption. Various activities may result in food spoilage: insect activities,causing physical injuries for example, bruisingand enzyme activity by microorganism causes change in colour, taste, smell, texture and quality of the food.</p> <p>Pauland Sarisbury, (1981)  also referred to spoilage as any change in the condition of food in which the food becomes less palatable or even toxic: these changes may be accompanied by alteration in taste, smell, appearance or texture.</p> <p>The spoilage of food by microorganisms should not be viewed as a sinister plot on the part of the microbes deliberately to destroy foods but as a normal function of these organisms in the total ecology of all living organisms (Watt and Merrill, 2000). It has also been estimated by Watt and Merrill (2000) that 20% of all fruits and vegetables harvested for human consumption are lost through microbial spoilage causing one or more of 250 market diseases. Spoilage of fresh tomato usually occurs during storage and transit and also while waiting to be processed.</p> <p>Frazier and Westhoff,(2004) reported that fruits and vegetables after picking continue to respire and as a result heat is produced, this heat is known as ‘vital heat’, the amount which varies with particular amount of fruits and vegetables.</p> <p>Vegetables that respire more thereby generating most heat are those that perish/spoil most rapidly (Wheeler, 2005). The resulting respiration of the fruits in addition to the normal ripening process complicates an independent discussion on microbiological spoilage of fruits in general and tomato in particular.</p> <p><em>Fusarium oxysporium f.sp.lycoperisici </em>and<em>Verticilliumalbo-atrum</em>are two fungi that cause similar wilt disease on tomato.(Nesmith <em>etal</em>.,1983). <em>Fusarium</em> is more common in replant fields and gardens while <em>Verticillium</em>has been destructive on greenhouse tomatoes and in commercial stake tomatoes. <em>Verticillium</em> wilt is more of a problem at cooler temperature while <em>Fusarium</em> wilt is considered a warm temperature disease. Both are favoured by wet conditions.</p> <p>According to Nesmith<em>etal.,</em> (1983), both fungi are common inhabitants of Kentucky soils. These fungi attack the plant through the roots and grow up through the water-conducting vessels. <em>Fusarium</em>and<em>Verticillium</em>may be introduced to soils in several ways: Old crop residues, transplants, wind, water,implement-borne soils or mulches. These fungi become established readily in most soils and can remain in the soil for years. When susceptible tomatoes are planted, in infected soil, their roots are also subjected to attack by these fungi. Both diseases are much more serious when accompanied by root knot nematode. These problems can be controlled by using resistant tomato varieties and fumigating or stream sterilizing greenhouse soils.</p> <p><strong>1.1     JUSTIFICATION</strong></p> <p>Since microorganisms have been identified with the major cause of spoilage in fruits and vegetables due to their high water content, proper isolation and characterization of these organisms in tomatoes will greatly reduce the spoilage of this perishable fruit and as such producers and consumers will be able to protect their vegetables (tomato) and also identify spoiled tomatoes that have been attacked by fungi.</p> <p>Works have been done on the isolation and identification of bacteria and fungi on fruits(Okoli, 1998). Little or no work has been done on the isolation and characterization fungi on spoiled tomatoes in Gwagwalada.Therefore, the major organisms responsible for field and market diseases will be majorly identified and checked.</p> <p><strong>1.2     AIM AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>This research work is aimed at identifying the various fungi organisms associated with the spoilage of fresh tomatoes in Gwagwalada with the view of mapping out strategies to curtail these fungal attacks and also to determine the effects of the isolated fungi on the spoiled tomatoes.</p> <p><strong>Objectives</strong></p> <p>i.        To isolate of fungi organism from spoilt tomatoes in Gwagwalada.</p> <p>ii.       To characterize and identify of the fungi in spoilt tomatoes.</p> <p>iii.      To determine the prevalence and pathogenicity of fungal organisms.</p> <p>iv.      To create public health awareness about the preponderance of fungal organisms.</p> <p><strong>1.3     LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Researches have been conducted to ascertain the fact that various microorganisms are responsible for the spoilage of tomatoes.

They help the body to fight diseases. More than 3,000 years ago ancient people stumbled over the discovery that some moulds could be used as a cure. The egyptians, the chinese, and indians of central American would use mold to treat rashes and infected would. At that time they didn’t understand either diseases or treatment. As time went on, people began to gain some insight of disease. In the 1860 Louis Pasteur Shaw that many disease were caused it bacteria. Later he discovered that we may be able to fight germ and other microbes. It was two German doctors, who were first to make an effective medication form microbes. Kudo if and Emmerich and Oscar has conducted their experiment in the  1890. They proved that germ that would for another. All the men did was to take the germ from infected bandages and grow then in a test tube. They would  then isolate a particular germ that caused green in factions in open would. This germs was bacteria called Bacillus pyoicyaneus. They put then into another test tube containing other type of bacteria, it was  then it happened that the bacillus pyocyaneus wiped out the other disease germ. The germs that was killed were those that caused cholera, typhoid, diphtheria and anthrau. From this the two men created a medication that they called pyoanase, it was the first antibiotics used in hospitals.</p> <p>In 1928 Alexander Fleming, a Scottish scientist, discovered penicillin, the first antibiotics. He was keeping in a petn dish when a speck of mold fell in, it cause the mold to grow on the nutrient agar used to feed the bacteria. Surpassingly, it stopped the growth of the bacteria. Fleming through the mold called penicillin notatum produced a substance that killed the bacteria and so called it penicillin. However, he was not able to entrant it from broth in which he grew the mold.</p> <p>In 1945, Waksman used the word antibiotics for the first time and proposed that it can be defined as a chemical substance of microbial origin that possesses antibiotic powers. He discovered a drug called streptomycin. It onginated frommicrobes found in soil and was a cure for many intestinal  diseases. Now antibiotics like penicillin and streptomycin was discovered. Each was effective against certain disease, but scientist wanted more. Doctors however, anted broad spectrum drug. That is a single antibiotics that could cure many disease</p> <p>The search proved successful one laboratory discovered Aureonycin, which is a drug that does the job of penicillin and streptomycin. Another laboratory discovered chloromycin.</p> <p>In 1949, yet another laboratory came with one of the effective  antibiotics ever found, terranycin. This drug could be used against many bacteria disease (Katzung, 1994).</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVE</strong></p> <p>1.                To identify causative organism that are delectious to mans health.</p> <p>2.                To determine the potency of the different antibiotics.</p> <p>3.                To know the type of organism sensitive to the different antibiotics.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>H0-    Streptomycin is more effective</p> <p>H1 – Streptonyin is not  effective</p> <p>H2  -   Chloramphenicol is not effective</p> <p>H3-  Chloramphenicol is not effective</p> <p>H4- Gentamicin is more effective</p> <p>H5 –Gentanicin  is not effective</p> <p>H6 – Comparing the strength of the three antibiotics.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Due to the problem encountered in Enugu Urban (obiagu), most people abuse antibiotics owing to the general belief that antibiotics can be used  in the treatment of all kinds of diseases.

All the frozen chicken samples from the five sellers examined were contaminated with some bacterial species namely, <em>Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphyloccus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. </em>The total bacteria counts for all the chicken examined from the different sellers was in the range of 0.7 × 102</p> <p>cfu/ml to 8.5 × 102 cfu/ml and the coliform counts obtained for all the chicken samples ranged from 0.1 × 102 cfu/ml to 3.2 × 102 cfu/ml. These finding suggest that most of the frozen chicken parts stored in the open market may constitute sources of bacterial food poisoning consequently public health hazard.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0                                 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The first consumer right is to have a product of good quality and not constituting any health hazard. Poultry meat products are highly desirable, palatable, digestible and nutritious for all ages. Poultry meat is comprised of about 20–23% protein, other are water and fat, phosphorus, iron and vitamins. Comminuted products, such as frankfurters, bologna and sausages typically contain about 17–20% protein, 0–20% fat, and 60–80% water (Smith,2001).Quality products are those that meet some need or expectation of consumers and are safe and wholesome as well. (Sahoo<em>et al.</em>, 1996).The microbiological safety and quality of poultry meat are equally important to producers, retailers and consumers. Two quite different groups of microorganisms are relevant: on the one hand certain foodborne pathogens, and, on the other, organisms that are generally harmless to human health, but, being psychrotrophic, are able to multiply on the product during chill storage. Spoilage results mainly from off- odour development, and product shelf-life is determined both by the number of spoilage organisms present initially and the temperature history of the product at all stages of production and subsequent storage and handling (Pooni and Mead, 1984). For chill- stored poultry, Viehweg<em>et al</em>. (1989) demonstrated that virtually all the odorous substances found at spoilage could be attributed to microbial growth and metabolism. Contamination of poultry meat with foodborne pathogens remains an important public health issue, because it can lead to illness if there are malpractices in handling, cooking or post-cooking storage of the product.</p> <p>Fresh (uncooked) foods such as chicken carries natural microflora that may contain organisms potentially harmful to humans. The microbial flora of table poultry is largely confined to the skin surface or visceral cavity. Isolates from poultry and poultry products could include members of the following general <em>Enterobacter, Alcaligenes, Escherichia,Bacillus, Flavobacterium, Micrococcus, Proteus,Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium</em>and <em>Salmonella. </em>(Frazier and Westhoff,1988).</p> <p>Contamination of the skin and lining of the body cavity occurs during washing, plucking and evisceration. Bacterial numbers vary considerably on the surface of chickens. This variation however is greater between birds than is between different areas of the same birds. The type of organisms isolated depends upon where the samples were taken and upon the stage of processing (Frazier and Westhoff, 1988). Fresh poultry products like meat are known to undergo deterioration due to microbial action, chemical and physical changes. In normal handling and storage of poultry meat, this deterioration changes are attributed to micro biological contamination and activity.</p> <p>Poultry and poultry products are frequently contaminated with several types of microorganisms. This problem is even more severe under temperature-abused conditions as well as improper or inefficient refrigeration commonly observed in retail chicken sold in open markets. Poultry can be kept in good condition for months if freezing is prompt and rapid and the storage temperature is low enough. Poultry should freeze fast enough to retain most of the natural bloom or external appearance of a freshly dressed fowl. The storage temperature should be below 17.8oC and the relative humidity above 95 percent to reduce surface drying. Most poultry is sharp-frozen at about 29oC or less in circulating air or on a moving belt in a freezing tunnel. Other spoilage micro-organisms are introduced into the poultry products by the workmen during cutting and evisceration, through water, and air in the dressing, cooling and cutting room environment (Allen<em>et al</em>., 2000). However, various methods are used in the preservation of these poultry products in order to reduce the incidence of these organisms. These include asepsis, use of heat, use of low temperature, chilling, freezing, preservatives such as acetic, adipic, succinic etc. at pH 2.5 and use irradiation (Frazier and Westhoff, 1988). Despite these methods of preservation, contamination of poultry products remains the order of the day before it gets to the final consumer.</p> <p>1.2   <strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>Various bacteria are associated with poultry products; this project is aimed at achieving the following objectives:</p> <p>i.       To isolate the various microbial isolates associated with frozen chicken purchased from different sellers in Gwagwalada market.</p> <p>ii.       To characterize and identify these micro-organisms.</p> <p>iii.      To speculate on the significance of these isolates.</p> <p>iv.      To compare the level of contamination of the samples (frozen chicken) collected from different parts of the market.</p>                                                          \n\nBACTERIOLOGICAL QUALITY OF FROZEN CHICKEN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " BACTERIOLOGICAL QUALITY OF FROZEN CHICKEN", "id": 65}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p> An investigative study was carried out to determine the bacteriological qualities of borehole water samples in halls of residence in the University of Benin, Ugbowo Benin City. A total of five water samples were collected from the the various halls of residence in the school. Bacteriological analysis was carried out using standard methods. The total bacterial count was determined by pour plate technique and total coliform determined. Eight genera of bacteria which include <em>Klebsiella</em> spp., <em>Salmonella</em> spp. and <em>Alcaligenes</em> spp. were isolated from the water samples. Total bacterial count in water samples ranged from 0 to 32 x 102cfu/ml. The total coliform count of the borehole waters analyzed ranged from 0 to 39 MPN index of coliform/50 ml. It was concluded that not all tank waters are safe for consumption and proper measures should be taken in cleaning and treating our water tanks regularly.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0    INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Water is indispensable and intricately connected to life, without which there is no life. This is the reason for which water must be given the necessary attention at all times. Good drinking water is not a luxury; it is one of the most essential amenities of life itself. The supply of safe drinking water to all has therefore engaged the attention of many individuals, groups, governmental organizations and private organizations. (Adetunde et al. 2010).</p> <p> Drinking water free of pathogenic organisms is fundamental to breaking one of the principal transmission routes of infectious disease. This fact has stimulated worldwide investment in the construction of water systems that are designed to meet stringent water quality standards. (Trevett, 2004).</p> <p> Waterborne pathogens, including a variety of viral, bacterial, algal and protozoan agents, account for much of the estimated 4 billion cases and 2.5 million deaths from endemic diarrheal disease each year. (Kosek et al. 2003).</p> <p> Increase in human population has exerted an enormous pressure on the provision of safe drinking water, especially in developing countries (Umeh et al. 2005). Unsafe water is a global public health threat, placing persons at risk for a host of diarrheal and other disease as well as chemical intoxication (Hughes et al. 2005). Unsanitary water particularly has devastating effects on young children in developing world. Each year, more than 2 million persons, mostly children less than 5 years of age, die of diarrheal disease (Kosek et al. 2003; Parashar et al. 2003).</p> <p> Nearly 90% of diarrheal-related deaths have been attributed to unsafe or inadequate-water supplies and sanitation conditions affecting a large part of the world’s population (Hughes et al. 2005; WHO 2004). An estimated 2.6 billion persons lack access to adequate sanitation (Okonko et al. 2008).</p> <p>The University of Benin, Benin City, has 5 main halls of residence (halls 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). There are also various staff quarters in the school: Junior Staff Quarter, Senior Staff Quarter, Dentistry Quarter and Doctor’s Quarter. These halls depend on borehole water stored in overhead tanks for their water supply.</p> <p><strong>1.1    AIM OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p> This study is aimed at the bacteriological analysis of the water from these tanks.</p> <p><strong>1.2    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>1.     To attain the total bacterial count of the water samples.</p> <p>2.     To determine the coliform counts (Most Probable Number) of the water samples.</p> <p>3.     To determine the species of bacteria present in the water.</p>                                                            \n\nBACTERIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF WATER TANKS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " BACTERIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF WATER TANKS", "id": 66}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>Nunu is Nigerian locally fermented milk product commonly prepared by Hausa/Fulani cattle rearers. It’s mostly available in the Northern part of Nigeria. It’s production and consumption derives food security and economic benefits to the rural people in the region. However, the process characteristics results in products which are not appealing to many people. Lactic acid bacteria are mostly associated with the production of fermented milk products. They play key role in producing desirable flavour, aroma and good physical appearance in fermented milk products. Isolation and identification of LAB from nunu of spontaneous fermentation was carried out and labeled LAB 1-LAB 4. An assessement of the organoleptic property, pH, shelf-life and overall acceptability was determined. After 24 hours of fermentation, a general decrease in pH was observed. The pH ranged between 5.58 - 6.29. Nunu samples fermented with mixed starter culture,  LAB 1+2, had the best sensory evaluation described as ; fermented, sour, characteristic of the nunu, pleasant, soft, smooth, semi- solid, viscous and with the highest overall acceptability of 7 on the hedonic scale. While nunu fermented with Lab3 and Lab 2+3 had a sensory evaluation of being umami, milk, rough, not pleasant aroma and gritty with an overall acceptability of  2 on the hedonic scale. The nunu sample produced stored in refrigerator had a shelf-life of 6 days while the sample stored at room temperature (28±2</em><em>o</em><em>C ) had a shelf-life of 3 days.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0     INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><em>Nunu </em>is a spontaneously fermented milk (yoghurt-like) product in Nigeria and other parts of West Africa including Ghana and Burkina Faso. Unlike other African fermented milk products where milk of goats, sheep, and camels is used, <em>Nunu </em>is solely prepared from cow milk. The traditional processing of <em>Nunu </em>involves collecting fresh cow milk into containers and then allowing it to ferment for a day or two days at ambient temperature. <em>Nunu </em>is yoghurt-like in taste (a sharp acid taste) and it can be taken alone or with <em>Fura </em>(Owusu-Kwarteng <em>et al</em>., 2012; Akabanda <em>et al</em>., 2013). Like many other spontaneously fermented foods in  Africa, the production of <em>Nunu </em>is largely home-based and the fermentation is spontaneous. Thus, starter cultures are not available, but old stocks of previous ferments and fermentation containers are used to initiate fermentation in new batches. The dependence on such undefined and diverse microbial consortium during <em>Nunu </em>fermentation may result in product of variable quality and stability.</p> <p>Currently, there is no information on the use of starter cultures for <em>Nunu </em>fermentation. However, few investigations have been carried out on the microbiology of Ghanaian traditionally fermented milk products (Obodai and Dodd,2006; Akabanda <em>et al</em>., 2010). The predominant microorganisms isolated from this traditionally fermented milk should be developed into starter cultures that could be used to produce fermented milk products of consistent quality and consumer acceptability. Thus, it should be possible to improve the quality and consumer acceptability of <em>Nunu </em>through controlled fermentation using starter culture.</p> <p>The culture should, however, be well-defined.

All the sample were freshly prepared, serial dilution of the soymilk samples was carried out. The sample were cultured using the streaking method on nutrient and Macconkey agar media Gram staining and microscopic  examination was carried out to identify the organism. Biochemical test were finally carried out to confirm the implicated organism. The bacteria implicated in this study were staphylococcus sp and escherichia coli.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>The three basic needs of man are food shelter and clothing but food has been proved to be the most important. Food has been defined as that which can be eaten to nourish the body. Since the economic situation is getting worse day by day, it becomes imperative that an alternative soymilk be provided to improve nutrition status.</p> <p>Soybeans (Glycine max) is a member of the family legminosae, sub family papilnonaceae (Howell and Caldwell, 1972) Ezedinma F.O.C 1964) it is an annual summer legume  be4ing that it is found in the hairy pods of an erect bushy legume native to Asta and have been reported   to have originated from eastern and where used as food as long as before the existence of written record. It is highly proteinous in that it contains a large proportion of assailable protein, have carbohydrate having no starch at all. The protein of soybeans  are  glycinun, phaseolin, and legumlin are equally good source of B- comple vitamins and minerals (James et al 1992). They are also known to contain best blance of essential ammoniac’s and that is why it is usually referred to as the miracle legume or the poor mans meats”.</p> <p>SOYBEAN PRODUCTION</p> <p>Originally confined to the temperate zone is no spreading rapidly into tropic particularly in Brazil and other parts of south American in India and in the far East Inspite of being one of the earliest filed crops, soybeans was introduced into Nigeria shows that Benue state and Kogi state is the most important soybeans producing are in the country. In Nigeria, nearly all of the soybeans  production estimated at 30,000 tons is for human consumption and in response to increasing demand for. Soybeans as a source of protein and vegetable oil, National programmes in Nigeria have expanded their research on the crop since 1981) ( III A Annual report 1983).</p> <p>Soymilk, which is traditionally an equeous extract of whole soybeans has been of considerable interest to nutritionists as a possible  substitute for cow or human milk due to its advantage over many other protein source in that no allergenic properties have been associated with it so far. Therfore it is recommended for infants who are allergic to cows milk (food and food production Encyclopedia 1971)</p> <p>Soymilk has been made in china for generation and its consumption is fast gaining ground in Nigeria (Ahmed 1984; bashiell et al, 1990) soymilk has been recommended by physicians for years  to patients who are allergic to cows milk and now it is being recommended to those who have suffered from or are prone to degenerative heart diseases and who need a milk with unsaturated fat as a   replacement for dairy milk. (Ahened 1984) </p> <p><strong>IMPORTANCE OF LEGUMES AS FOO</strong>D</p> <p>Generally legumes contain 17-25% protein except soybeans which contains about 40% protein and 40-70% carbohydrate. Legume seeds are also good  sources of minerals such as  phosphorsphrous and iron (Bresani and Elias, 1974; stegel and fawceth, 1976) except for soybeans and groundnuts, which  contains 18% and 48% oil respectively (Muller and Tobin 1980) legume seeds their utilization is impaired by inherent constraints such as the presence of several antinutrients and toxic components despite their high nutrient content. Legume seeds are generally low in fats and oils.  Consequently legume seeds as protein souces despite the fact that legume protein are cheaper. However, with adequate processing legumes are safe and nutritious.</p> <p>Today. In Nigeria, the house holds use of various Nigerian Families and communities all over the country. Food recipes have been developed for those based mainly on soybean and those in which soybean I incorporated so as to increase the nutrient content especially protein. Soybean are incorporated into cereals tubers, and roots and other legumes. They are used to prepare the main dish breakfast, foods for adults and children weaning foods and convalescent diets.</p> <p>JUSTIFICATION</p> <p>Soymilk is rich beverage and food products rich in protein, substitute for cow milk and other source of protein, cheaper than other source of protein and a food beverage for student to take all day long without feeling the cost. Therefore there is need to ensure that the milk is hygiene prepare, free from pathogen and other spoilage organism with longer shelf ;life  to  protein, cheaper than other sources of protein and a food beverage for student to take all day long without feeling the cost. Therefore there is need  to  ensure that the milk is hygiene- prepare, free from pathogen and other spoilage organism with longer shelf  life to protect the student from diseases arising from food poisoning</p> <p> <strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVE</strong> </p> <p>The objective of this research work  is to carryout  microbiological quality control of the soymilk beverage sold in I.M.T campus 3 Enugu. This is to ensure that the soymilk sold is from pathogenic and spoilage organizes and also to  ensure that the food compties with the food keeping quality.</p> <p>HYPOTHESIS</p> <p>HO     Soymilk is associated with spoilage microorganism</p> <p>H1      Soymilk is not associated with spoilage Microorganisms.</p> <p>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>Soymilk as a food of high  nutritional value is highly associated with microorganism as a result of this  hygienically prepared and declared fit for consumption so as to protect the student from disease that arises due to food poisoning.</p> <p>LIMITATION</p> <p>This study will be limited to I.M.T campus 3 Enugu and soymilk as the main beverage consumed on campus  III. This is due to the prevailing economic situation in the country and the relatively depreciating value of the naira has extremely affected the supply of materials and transportation difficulty encountered in the course of the study.</p> <p>METHODOLOGY</p> <p>30 soymilk samples will be collected  from the various hawkers within I.M.T campus 3 Enugu.

That is to say, the more one increases in weight, the higher the tendency of him or her becoming hypertensive. Mori TA (2007).</p> <p>          In essence, there is a symbolic relationship between being over-weight and being hypertensive or having high blood pressure. It is in the interest of people who are likely to develop high blood pressure (over-weight people) to seek out ways of managing their weight, as this research work will try to bring out the effects of weight on such people with high blood pressure. What seems unresolved here is the extent to which weight affect people suffering from high blood pressure. Many writers’ views will be examined in the cause of this work to help resolve the issue at stake.</p> <p>          Over-weight here will be described or rather defined based on a calculation called “Body mass index” (BMI). According to this formular, one is regarded as over-weight if his BMI is greater than 25. Mancia G. (2007). High  blood pressure on the other hand occurs when one’s blood move through the arteries at a higher speed than normal. It is also known that for now there is no cure for high blood pressure. Papadakis A, Macphere J. (2008).</p> <p>          The seriousness of this adult illness (high blood pressure) is not just that it can lead to more serious illness or complications, raises the risk of stroke, kidney failure, heart disease and heart attack. The matter is made worse with the existence of too much weight or fat in the body as this tends to make the condition severe.</p> <p>          It is the duty of stakeholders in health sectors to keep the adult folk aware of the implication of over-weight by providing them with accurate, timely and up to date information regarding this health condition. It is also the duty of health personnel to warn and educate adults who are more prone to high blood pressure, about the dangers of over-weight in the management of high blood pressure. This awareness is expected to affect the feeding habit of these people, since it has been observed that poor feeding (that is, poor combination of the classes of food, not necessarily the quantity) is one of the causes of over-weight. Sacks F.M (2008).</p> <p>          Statistics have it that between the years 2000 and 2008, there has been about forty percent (40%) increase in the number of people having high blood pressure. Manson J (2009). Another statistics show that in 2005, sixty percent (60%) of people suffering from high blood pressure were suffering also from kidney failure and heart disease, and that high blood pressure was identified as the remote cause of the disease that later led to the death of a greater percentage of the patients. Manson J. (2009).</p> <p>It is believed in many quarters that some of the findings above and many more are the reasons for the recent step-up in action in the area of high blood pressure management. Hence, many Nigerians knowing the cost of managing such diseases that tends to originate from high blood pressure hightened by over-weight, seem to have woken to the call on “healthy and fit”.</p> <p>          This research therefore, would not have been more timely than this. As a matter of fact, it is this situation on ground that necessitated this research work.</p> <p><strong>1.2 AIMS AND OBJECTIVE</strong></p> <p>-This project work is aimed at investigating whether there is a relationship between weight and blood pressure of patients with high blood pressure.</p> <p>- To estimate the regression model between the variables based on the sample collected.</p> <p>-To test the significance of the coefficient of regression.</p> <p>-To determine the extent and direction of the relationship between the variables; weight and blood pressure.</p> <p><strong>1.3 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          This project work is designed to cover the statistical model of effects of weight on thirty (30) patients with high blood pressure in the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital Ituku/Ozalla Enugu State.

It is an exceptionally good source of protein which is of a high biological value in promoting the growth of children (ihekorany and Ngoddy, 1985). Milk  is decribed as a good of outstanding interest, which is designed by nature to be  complete good for very young mammals (fox and Cameron, 1980).</p> <p>Milk contains a wide variety of  constituents and contains  most of the food factors associated with bacterial nutrition. Milk as a single food is of high nutritional value and is associated with spoilage microorganisms. At the time milk leaves the udder of the healthy cow, it contains few bacteria these stem from milk  ducts and cistern. During the milking process, bacteria are usually added from various sources. In hand milking the sources are air the hair of the animal manure, the milkers equipment such as pails, feed and machine, most of these environmental factors are less important.

It is one of the most popular fermented milk products in the world and produced commercially at home. (Willey <em>et al., </em>2008). In its commercial production, non fat or low fat milk is pasteurized cooled to 43°c and are inoculated with known cultures of microorganisms referred to as starter cultures. The starter cultures may be a pure culture of a particular species of <em>Lactobacillus </em>or a mixed culture of <em>Streptococcus thermophilus </em>and<em>Lactobacillus bulgaricus </em>in a 1: 1 ratio. The coccus which is the<em>Streptococcus thermophilus </em>grows faster than the Rod which is the<em>Lactobacillus bulgaricus </em>and is primarily responsible for acid production while the rod adds flavor and aroma. The growth of these Microorganisms causes the transformation of milk's sugar, lactose into lactic acid. This process gives yoghurt it's texture. The associative growth of the two organisms results in acid production at a rate greater than that produced by them individually.</p> <p>Yoghurt is generally made from a standardized mixture containing whole milk, partially defatted milk, condensed skim milk cream and non fat dry milk. Alternatively milk may be partly concentrated by removal of 15- 20% water in a vacuum pan or by heating. While the microorganisms fermenting milk confers on it certain health benefits inadequate pasteurized milk may contain microorganism of special importance to man. (Boor and Murphy, 2002). In which its presence or absence in milk may reflect success or failure of good manufacturing practice (GMP) or cause infection when consumed together with food. This is of economic significance in Africa where the HIV/AIDS and cancer scourge has left the public who consume milk products immune suppressed and prone to bacterial and fungi infection. (Boor,2001).</p> <p>Health complications associated with consumption of inadequately pasteurized milk products include serious infections that are hard, to treat with antibiotics. This becomes clinically significant if organisms isolated from an assessed sample is resistant to conventional antibiotics. Thus, can confer antibiotic resistance to the infected host while providing no alternative drug (Gould, 1994). Heat treated yoghurt do not contain lactic acid bacteria as these are killed during post fermentation. Yoghurt manufacturing companies mainly market \"heat treat\" yoghurt to prolong it's shelf life (Hove <em>et </em>al, 1999). It is important however to evaluate the microbial gravity of some milk products sold in Nigeria. This project work aims at assessing the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of microorganisms present in yoghurt sold in Enugu.</p>                                                          \n\nMICROBIAL CONTAMINATION OF YOGHURT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION OF YOGHURT", "id": 74}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong> <strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Antiseptics and disinfectants are used extensively in hospitals and other health care settings for a variety of topical and hard-surface applications. In particular, they are an essential part of infection control practices and aid in the prevention of nosocomial infections. Mounting concerns over the potential for microbial contamination and infection risks in the food and general consumer markets have also led to increased use of antiseptics and disinfectants by the general public. A wide variety of active chemical agents (or “biocides”) are found in these products, many of which have been used for hundreds of years for antisepsis, disinfection, and preservation. Despite this, less is known about the mode of action of these active agents than about antibiotics. In general, biocides have a broader spectrum of activity than antibiotics, and, while antibiotics tend to have specific intracellular targets, biocides may have multiple targets. The widespread use of antiseptic and disinfectant products has prompted some speculation on the development of microbial resistance, in particular crossresistance to antibiotics.</p> <p>Chlorinated compounds are often used in dental clinics and laboratory environment due to their broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, low toxicity, low cost and efficacy in biofilms.1 However, they corrode metals and are inactivated by organic matter at high concentrations. A slow-release chlorine compound, sodium dichloroisocyanurate is used in healthcare settings; however, it too is corrosive. Slow-release chlorine dioxide disinfectants have been developed containing corrosion inhibitors which are extensively used in the industrial settings. </p> <p>The use of chlorine dioxide containing products in dentistry has been explored. Studies have shown that in mouthrinses it is effective for the management of chronic atrophic candidiasis, denture stomatitis, and the control of plaque accumulation, periodontal pathogens and oral malodor.2-5 The efficacy of sodium dichloroisocyanurate for disinfection of radiographic films and irreversible hydrocolloid impression material has also been established.6,7 none of the above studies have tested the efficacy of these disinfectants against Mycobacteria and Hepatitis B virus. In addition, anti hepatitis B virus activity of chlorine dioxide has not been established. </p> <p><strong>1.2</strong> <strong>Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>Chlorination of bacteria by active chlorine compounds with the aim of killing them occurs both in a variety of disinfection processes and, in vivo, in the myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite system that operates within phagolysosomes of human leuco-cytes.8–10 Investigations on the main long-lived oxidant produced by granulocytes and monocytes, N-chlorotaurine (NCT),11,12 revealed new insights in the consequences of the chlorination of pathogens. Incubation for a sublethal time of 1min in 1% NCT solution caused a lag of regrowth (postantibiotic effect) of bacteria and a loss of virulence of highly encapsulated staphylococci and streptococci, demonstrated in the mouse peritonitis model.13,14 In addition, bacteria chlorinated by the myeloperoxidase system lost their ability to induce nitric oxide and tumour necrosis factor-a in macrophages.</p> <p>These findings prompted us to establish methods of detection and quantification of chlorination of bacterial surfaces and to perform the first systematic examination of chlorine covers on Gram-positive and -negative bacteria and Candida albicans.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong> <strong>Objectives of the study</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study is to assess the antimicrobial properties of chlorine and alcohol disinfectants.</p> <p>This study compares the antimicrobial effect of a chlorine dioxide and a chlorine generating disinfectant on the contaminants commonly present on dental instruments and in the dental surgery.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong> <strong>Significance/ Justifications of the study</strong></p>                                                         \n\nANTIMICROBIAL PROPERTIES OF CHLORINE AND ALCOHOL DISINFECTANTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANTIMICROBIAL PROPERTIES OF CHLORINE AND ALCOHOL DISINFECTANTS", "id": 75}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p><strong>1.2       Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Antimicrobial resistance is a global concern, particularly pressing in developing nations where  infectious diseases, poverty and malnutrition are endemic. Infections caused by resistant bacteria have been shown to be more frequently associated with increased morbidity and mortality than those caused by susceptible pathogens. In areas of concentrated use, such as hospitals, antimicrobial resistance  lead to hospital stays, increased health care costs and in extreme cases untreatable infections. The lack of clinical microbiology laboratories to identify the specific etiologic agents and their antimicrobial susceptibility testing has increased empirical therapy which in turn leads to emergence of AMR. Moreover, self-antibiotic prescription, lack of access to local antibiogram data and poor awareness of prescriber about AMR were the leading local factors for AMR development in Ethiopia (Abera<em>et al</em>., 2014).</p> <p>Studies have shown that besides the temporal changes in profile of infecting micro organisms and pattern of resistance over time, antimicrobial resistance profile of bacteria varies among population because of difference in geography, local antimicrobial prescribing practices and prevalence of resistant bacterial strains. Such differences are never stable and may change rapidly especially in places where misuse of antibiotics are common particularly in developing countries. A systematic review in Ethiopia has also indicated a trend towards an increasing resistance rates among pathogens such as <em>Escherichia coli</em>, P<em>roteus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas,Citrobacter</em> and A<em>cenotobacter</em> to commonly prescribed antibiotics, including Ampicillin, Amoxicillin, Amikasin, Imipenem, Cefixime and Ciprofloxacin (Moges <em>et al.,</em>2014). Thus, up to date information on microbial resistance is needed at local level to guide the rational use of the existing antimicrobials.</p> <p>The adult human vagina is a complex biota containing a profusion of micro organisms.  These can be either unicellular or multicellular and are present everywhere in nature. They include  bacteria, fungi,  archaea,  protists,  some  microscopic  plants  such  as green  algae  and  animals  such  as  planktons  and  palanarian. On account of their nature, viruses may or may not be included. Bacteria   and   yeast   form   normal   flora   of   this ecosystem, which is normally found on the skin and every opening of the body such as mouth, ears, rectum and vagina. Even  a  neonate  carries  specific  flora  of  his/  her  mother  and soon develops own floral  community. This flora persists till death of the individual. An adult human carries normal flora consisting of more   than 200 bacterial species.  Normally these are harmless and are involved in benefiting their hosts. Yet some are parasitic in nature, living at the expense of their host, and some are even pathogenic.These pathogenic microbes, after getting a chance, invade their   hosts   and   lead   to   opportunistic   infection. These diseases caused by normalflora are termed endogenous diseases <em>(Khan et at.,</em>2002).</p> <p>Resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is an imminent threat to patient management all over the world. This issue has plagued policy makers and clinicians everywhere but there seems to be no simple way of circumventing the problem. Rapidly rising antibiotic resistance is a challenge to comprehensive patient care in all branches of medical science. The interaction between various clinical bacteria and the antimicrobial agents is a complex issue involving the prokaryotic adaptive mechanisms and genetic changes.  This complex interaction must be studied in depth in order to achieve a sustainable and effective solution to the looming threat of antibiotic resistance. Earlier, the problem of antibiotic resistance was primarily a concern for not so comical infections. But now, even community acquired infections are caused by organisms with high levels of antibiotic resistance. As a report had demonstrated, such multi-drug resistant community acquired infections can be a cause of significant.</p> <p>Earlier, such drug resistant organisms were said to infect mainly patients with identifiable risk factors or profound immune suppression. But now, reports are showing such infections in seemingly normal healthy persons. Also, such drug-resistant infections may complicate the newly emerging infectious diseases. For example, influenza epidemics are sometimes reported to be complicated by superadded infection with drug-resistant bacteria (Hageman <em>et al</em>., 2004). The issue of drug resistance in clinical bacteria is such a vital threat that the UN held a special assembly in 2016 to address only this issue. In that assembly, the issue was said to be of as much importance as climate change and it was deemed to require a global response (Farr, 1994) and   non-pregnant women  attending  the  University  of  Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH), Maiduguri, Nigeria”.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Antibiotic Sensitivity         </strong></p> <p>Antibiotic   sensitivity   is   a   term   used   to   describe   the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics. Antibiotic sensitivity testing (AST) is  usually  carried  out  to  determine  which antibiotic  will  be  most  successful  in  treating  a  bacterial infection <em> in  vivo</em>. Testing  for  antibiotic  sensitivity  is  often done  by  the Kirby-Bauer  method  while  other    methods include  the  Stokes  method, E-test (also  based  on  antibiotic diffusion)   and      Agar   and   Broth dilution   methods   (for Minimum  Inhibitory  Concentration determination). Muller Hinton   agar   is   most   frequently   used   in   this   antibiotic susceptibility test.

However, reference will be made to other works of hers and other relevant materials to the discourse.<br/>1.3    Methodology<br/>    In this essay, the primary text Purple Hibiscus is studied alongside other secondary materials like articles, research papers, group discussions, internet materials as well as journals. The method applied in this work is textual analysis.<br/>1.4    Definition of Terms<br/>Violence<br/>Violence as defined by the Oxford English Dictionary is “a violation of conditions which are supposed to be held in high esteem either by force or through diplomatic means” (22).<br/>Georges Sorel, defines Violence as “the exercise of physical force so as to inflict injury on or cause damage to persons or property; action or conducts characterized by this treatment or usage tending to cause bodily injury or forcibly interfering with personal freedom”.<br/>The Oxford learner’s Dictionary Seventh Edition defines Violence as “violent behavior that is intended to hurt or kill somebody”.<br/>Hypocrisy<br/>According to the  Free Dictionary by Fartex, Hypocrisy is the practice of professing beliefs, feeling or virtues that one does not hold or possess; falseness. It is also an act or instance of such falseness.<br/>Hypocrisy is also described as a feigning to be what one is not or to believe what one does not; especially the false assumption of appearance of virtue or religion.<br/>According to Fellow Dictionary.com, Hypocrisy is a pretense of having a virtuous character, moral or religious beliefs or principles, etc, that one does not really possess. A pretense of having some describable or publicly approve attitude.<br/>1.5    Review of Literature<br/>Several writers have done numerous works on Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus. The book has gained attention from both local and foreign critics and reviews.<br/>According to Anthony C. Oha in his view of the novel says that;<br/>“the motif of innocence helps Adichie to achieve concrete realism <br/>devoid of excessive exaggerations. In the world of the child, details are hardly seen but truth is hardly compressed. All these are seen in Purple Hibiscus. It is a novel shrouded in the reality of odds and the pains of anarchy” (208).<br/>The critic above sees the novel as devoid of exaggerations but written in plain truth. He comments that Adichie effectively presents her work in an easy way to enable the readers easily capture the message.<br/>    Ugwuanyi Oruchukwu Kingsley examines the noel Purple Hibiscus, by looking at the characters as well as what their actions seem to have influenced. We have in his words, thus:<br/>“There is no doubt that new dimensions to postcolonial criticism are still evolving. But the analysis here explores the danger of subjecting oneself to orientations and behaviours which colonial connotations. Much has been done on Purple Hibiscus but the approach adopted in this discourse appears noble, for it takes a close examination of the actions of the characters and their implications to our understanding of the postcolonial life”. (37)<br/>The critic pays more attention to the actions of the characters in the novel and how these actions are suggested to have influenced the characters because of colonial mentality. The actions of Eugene (Papa) the male antagonist of the novel, is a typical example. He adds that:<br/>The climax of Eugene’s brutality in Purple Hibiscus is seen when he burns the feet of his children for staying in the same house with their grandfather, Papa Nnukwu. Also, the two incidents where he beats his wife such that she suffers a miscarriage may have made him to commit what Ernest Emenyonu calls “Tragic-Excesses”. (40)<br/>Here, Ugwuanyi Kingsley tries to show the weakness of Eugene’s religious display as influenced by the whites he works with in his catholic church.<br/>Another critic Christopher Anyaokwu views Purple Hibiscus from a linguistic perspective. He says:<br/>“The meter of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s novel Purple Hibiscus is largely adroit interweave of thoroughly domesticated English, complete with Nigerianisms, slangs, buzzwords, among others. Besides, we find in the novel an admirably successful overlading contextual realism”. (83)<br/>Here, Christopher Anyaokwu’s focus is that of Adichie’s linguistic competence which puts her novel, Purple Hibiscus, on the path of literary grandeur. He sees the work as unique because of slangs and certain words the writer adopts.<br/>    According to Jonathan Highfield, who concentrates on symbolism of the Hibiscus flower on the experience of Kambili and other actions of violence in the text Purple Hibiscus, the Hibiscus flower serves as a potent, symbol of resilence of violence towards women.<br/>    Basically, even though Highfield discusses evidence of violence in Purple Hibiscus, his emphasis are on the metaphor of Purple Hibiscus. Ahmed Maidawa however, explains that Purple Hibiscus, is more closely related to Meghann Cleary’s The Thorn Birds. Some of Meghann Cleary’s in the fields, the protective role of Frank for his mother against his father which duplicated in Purple Hibiscus to spin the wheel of suspense.<br/>    Another critic also discusses the need to fight for and get freedom using Purple Hibiscus as a backdrop. According to him;<br/>Eugene Achike popularly known as Papa dominates his family to the point that Chimamanda arouses silence as a device for the Nigerian people. These repressive rulers Nigeria has suffered throughout most of its history have demanded that its people remain silent (Bernestian).<br/>According to Bill Brown in a review  titled “Fiction: A moveable Feast” a Nigerian coming of age with her boisterous relatives yields appetizing result says Americans have no problem eating a big Mac with their hands, but to get them to venture into a West African restaurant, where forming balls to fulfill a thick yam porridge”.<br/>    Again in an electric review, Andrade Susan in her article, “Adeichie’s Geneologies National and Feminine Novels”, comments on Adichie’s works “having elements of relation to Adichies’s works more importantly they form part of a longer tradition of writing by African women, while at the same time, they extend that traditional like novels by Nwapa, Emecheta and others”. Adichie’s novel present a politics of the family while quietly but clearly telling stories of the nation. Adichie also tells more explicit tales of the Nigerian National imaginary, especially in her second novel, Half of a Yellow Sun. Adichie advances her story telling in Purple Hibiscus by telling a domestic tale with yet stronger national overtone”.<br/>    Finally Emily Whitchurch in her article “Culture wars” she states that:<br/>“Through the eyes of a fifteen years old Kambili, notions of freedom and religion are gently explored. But the novel goes beyond a simple coming-of-age story by reading the wider social and cultural events that reflects and inform this experience. Eugene cannot see that his household is a microcosm of the regime he opposes”.<br/>In conclusion, many critics seem to have expressed their views on the novel relating the family issues and influence colonialism has on the characters in the novel but not much has been done to critically reflect on the issues of Hypocrisy and violence. Therefore, this essay will examine how violence and hypocrisy are effectively portrayed by the author in the novel.<br/>1.6    Thesis Statement<br/>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus, deeply reflects the violent and hypocritical nature of men in the home and society. The author creates characters and situations and also deploys language and literary devices that bring out most clearly these points.<br/><br/>\n\nMICROBIAL ISOLATION OF THAWED AND COOKED  PORK MEAT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MICROBIAL ISOLATION OF THAWED AND COOKED  PORK MEAT", "id": 77}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THESTUDY ON THE EFFECT OF GARLIC AND HONEY ON SOME UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS</b><br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>MEDICINAL EFFECT OF HONEY-<br/>1.2    MEDICINAL EFFECT OF GARLIC             <br/>1.3    UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS BROBLEMS      <br/>CHPATER TWO<br/>2.0    LITERATURE REVIEW   -       -      <br/>2.1    HISTORY OF GARLIC AND HONEY   -       -       -<br/>2.2    WHAT IS UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTION?<br/>2.3    CAUSES OF UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS       -      <br/>2.4    PATHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS        -       -<br/>2.5    CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT OF BACTERIAL INFECTION: ANTIBIOTICS AND RESISTANT BACTERIA  -      <br/>2.6    DIET FOR UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTION      <br/>2.7    NATURAL HOME REMEDIES FOR UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTION     <br/>2.8    NUTRITIONAL APPROACHES TO BACTERIAL INFECTION: A HEALTHY IMMUNE SYSTEM    <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0    MATERIAL AND METHOD       -       -      <br/>3.1    MATERIALS -       -       -       -      <br/>3.2    STUDY POPULATION:   -       -<br/>3.3    SPECIMEN COLLECTION       -      <br/>3.4    METHODS          -       -       -       -       -       -<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.0    RESULT AND ANALYSIS        -       -      <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>5.0    DISCUSSION      -       -       -              <br/>5.1    CONCLUSION      -       -       -<br/>REFERENCE -       -<br/>ABSTRACT<br/>The study on the effect of honey and garlic on some upper respiratory tract infections was conducted between the month of June and October 2012 in Imo state.<br/>A total number of sputum samples were collected from males and females age 20-25 years with clinical signs and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections. The sputum samples collected were analyses using standard microbiological method. The micro organisms isolated from these sputum samples were, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumonia, staphylococcus viridians, haemophilus influenzae and mycoplasma  pneumonia. With the study on the effect of honey and garlic on some upper respiratory tract infections which these micro organisms were isolated from, reveals that garlic and honey has an effect on these micro organisms, by revealing its inhibitory zone on these organisms that were all isolated from these samples.<br/>Staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumonia, staphylococcus viridian, heamophilus influenzea have a<br/>6high inhibitory effect than mycoplasma pneumonia; it was revealed that there was no significant difference on their effectiveness of garlic and honey on the organisms tested, also there was high inhibiting zone in garlic and honey in patient aged 40-50 years.<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/> Honey and Garlic’s current principal medicinal uses are to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease by lowering blood pressure and cholesterol, as an antimicrobial, and as a preventive agent for cancer. The active constituents are several complex sulfur-containing compounds that are rapidly absorbed, transformed and metabolized. Pooled data from numerous randomized trials antibacterial effects, but these have not been evaluated in controlled trials in humans. Epidemiologic data, in vitro studies and animal data suggest that garlic may help prevent some solid tumors, but no randomized trials have evaluated its effectiveness as a therapeutic agent in oncology. There are no studies evaluating its effectiveness or safety in treating children or pregnant or nursing women. Garlic is safe when eaten as food, though in some sensitive persons, it can cause gastrointestinal irritation, and of course, halitosis. Prolonged topical use has been associated with moderate burns.<br/> Until the first part of the 20th century, honey dressings were part of everyday wound care practice.<br/>1.1    MEDICINAL EFFECT OF HONEY<br/>In a test-tube study published in 2009, researchers found that honey can kill three types of drug-resistant bacteria known to cause sinusitis. In fact, study results showed that honey knocked out the bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus) more effectively than commonly used antibiotic drugs.<br/>While these study results indicate that honey remedies may be of some use to people with sinusitis, it's important to seek medical attention in treatment of sinusitis in order to reduce risk of serious complications (such as meningitis and vision problems).<br/>1.1.1 Honey Remedies for Cough<br/>When it comes to easing the cough and sleep problems associated with childhood upper respiratory tract infection, honey may be preferable to standard cough suppressants. That's the main finding of a 2007 study, in which 105 children with upper respiratory tract infections were given a single dose of honey, dextromethorphan, or no treatment a half-hour before bedtime. When comparing the effects of honey and dextromethorphan, researchers found no significant differences.<br/>In a report published in 2010, however, researchers concluded that there is \"insufficient evidence to advise for or against the use of honey for acute cough in children.\"<br/>1.1.2 Honey Remedies for Allergies<br/>Some honey proponents claim that regular consumption of locally harvested honey can help protect against allergies (such as hay fever). To test this theory, researchers in a 2002 study assigned 36 people with rhinoconjunctivitis (allergy-induced runny nose and itchy, watery eyes) to eat a tablespoon of locally collected honey, nationally collected honey, or honey-flavored corn syrup each day. Study results showed that neither group of honey-consuming study members experienced significantly greater improvement in their symptoms (compared with the placebo group).<br/>1.1.3 How to Use Honey Remedies<br/>More research needs to be conducted before honey remedies can be recommended as a treatment for any health condition. However, since honey is generally considered a safe, healthy substance, it's unlikely that use of honey remedies will produce any adverse effects. In addition to using honey as a remedy, you can increase your honey consumption by using it as a sweetener in a number of health-promoting beverages, such as black tea and green tea.<br/> 1.2    MEDICINAL EFFECT OF GARLIC<br/>Research garlic online or at your local library. You'll learn that garlic, or more accurately the compound allicin found in garlic, has antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal properties that make it a treatment for respiratory infections.<br/>Go to your local market and stock up on garlic at the start of the cold and flu season. As the winter goes on, you should use garlic more than you do at other times of the year. The garlic you use in your food will help boost your immune system to combat upper respiratory infections caused by viruses and other common ailments.<br/>Use raw garlic in the foods you eat to realize maximum benefits. Finely chop or mince your garlic and add it to foods. Consume at least 1 full garlic clove per day, if not more.<br/>Use garlic supplements to treat respiratory infections. Garlic capsules can be purchased at supermarkets, health food stores or drug stores. They are a good way to incorporate garlic into your diet without incurring garlic breath.<br/>Brew a pot of garlic tea to treat respiratory infections. When you develop a cough or feel a sore throat coming, mince a garlic clove and add it to boiling water. Let it sit for several minutes to allow the allicin to infuse the water. Strain out the minced garlic and drink the brew.

A total of 30 Food samples were collected from the different market in ten different locations in Owerri and examined for the presence of Salmonella. After the culturing and biochemical tests, three different Salmonella species were isolated and they include: Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella paratyphi A. out of the 30 Foodsamples examined, Salmonella were found in 20 (66.67%). Out of the total samples examined, Salmonella typhi were isolated with the prevalence rate of 12 (40%) from 30 samples, Salmonella paratyphi A were isolated with the prevalence rate of 5 (16.67%), and Salmonella typhimurium were isolated with the prevalence rate of 3 (10%).<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Illnesses from food are one of the most important economic and health problems among industrial and non-industrial countries. In recent years, Salmonella has been one of the most common causes of food born disease Salmonellosis is an infectious disease which often occurs through contaminated food, especially food products with an animal origin such as meat, chicken, egg, animal foods and sometimes vegetables in the food chain. In developing countries, estimation of Salmonelosis is difficult because there has not been sufficient surveillance. Therefore, globally, many studies have been performed reporting that the prevalence and kind of salmonella serotypes are different based on geographical regions. Salmonella entericaserovarsEnteritidis and Typhimurium were reported to be the two most frequent serotypes of Salmonella isolated in Iran and other countries. During the two past decades, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella has become a serious problem worldwide. Wide usage of antibiotics in the diet of domestic animals has made drug resistant bacteria which could betransfered to human beings. Also, in recent years, problem of resistant strains to multiple drugs (MDR) is increasing and most studies in Iran and other countries have shown high resistance of Salmonella strains to several antibioticsIt belongs to the family Emtero-bacteriaceae and it is a facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacillus that parasitizes the intestine of a large number of vertebrate species. It also infects man leading to enteric fever, gastroenteritis and septicemia, collectively known as Salmonellosis infection.<br/>Of all the enterobacteriaceae, the genus salmonella is the most complex with more than 2,000 closely related bacteria that causes illness by reproducing in the digestive tract. (Aora, 2004). Each salmonella subgroup or serotype share common antigen and has its own name and the antigenic complexity of the bacteria have been described by Kauffman-White scheme. According to this scheme, the terminology that identifies the particular protein coats, or serovars, is not well settled, and what previously were thought to be various species of the genus Salmonella are now thought to be serovars of only two species by many researchers, Salmonella enterica and Samonellabongori.<br/>However, these designations are not always accepted in the scientific literature and so common serovars that have been named in the past are still used (for example, S. typhi, S. typhimurium, S. enteritidis, S. cholerasuis, S. saintpaul ). The Serovars are identified by the Kauffman-White classification that uses two major types of antigens (Somatic O and flagella H) to distinguish the over 2, 500 types of samonella bacteria. Initially each Salmonella species was named according to clinical consideration, e.g. Salmonella typhi-murium (mouse typhoid fever), S. cholerae-suis  (hog cholera). After it was recognized that host specificity did not exist for many species, new strains (or serovar, short for serological variants) received species name according to the location at which the new strain was first isolated.<br/>SerovarTyphimurium has considerable diversity and may be very old. The majority of the isolates belong to a single clonal complex. Isolates are divided into phage types, but some phage types do not have a single origin as determined using mutational changes. Phage type DT104 is heterogeneous and represented in multiple sequence types, with its multidrug-resistant variant being the most successful and causing epidemics in many parts of the world. Serovartyphi is relatively young compared to Typhimurium, and probably originated approximately 30,000-50,000 year ago. The common salmonella serotypes that are important in Animals and mammals include;<br/>*      Salmonella enterica subspecies arizonae – is found in cold-blooded animals, poultry, mammals.<br/>*      Serovars of Salmonella  enterica subspecies enterica.<br/>*      Salmonella choleraesuis (Bacillus paratyphoid B and C). This is an intestinal commensalists in pigs; it becomes pathogenic if resistance is weak; humans can be infected by ingesting sick animals; the bacteria cause septicemic salmonellosis in swine.<br/>*      Salmonella enteritidis – It is found in the intestines of cattle, rodents, ducks and humans; it causes calf paratyphoid fever and acute gastroenteritis in humans.<br/>*      Salmonella paratyphi B, in central Europe usually human pathogen, causes paratyphoid fever.<br/>*      Salmonella typhi, occurs in temperate and subtropical zones. It is the human pathogen of typhoid fever; 3-5% of persons falling ill remain permanent carriers of the pathogen.<br/>*      Salmonella typhimurium, causes a wide range of infections in birds to severe systemic paratyphoid diseases. It causes salmonella enteritis (food poisoning) in humans.<br/>*      Salmonella dublin, one of the pathogens causing cattle salmonellosis.<br/>*      Salmonella typhisuis, one of the pathogen causing hog Salmonellosis.<br/>*      Salmonella brandenburg, causes abortion and enteritis in shepherd cattle.<br/>*      Salmonella anatum  and  Salmonella montevideo.<br/>Animals consume Salmonella from the soil or contaminated processed food e.g. feeds. The bacteria are then shed alive in the infected animals’ faeces.<br/>Humans on the other hand consume Salmonella through contact withUnclean food, particularly in institutional kitchens and restaurants<br/>Excretions from either sick or infected but apparently clinically healthy people and animals (especially endangered are caregivers and animals)<br/>Polluted surface Food and standing Food (such as in shower hoses or unused Food dispensers)<br/>Unhygienically thawed fowl (the melt Food contains many bacteria).<br/>An association with reptiles (Pet tortoises and snakes) primarily aquatic turtles is well described.<br/>Salmonella bacteria can survive several weeks in a dry environment and several months in Food; thus, they are frequently found in polluted Food, contamination from the excrement of carrier animals being particularly important. Aquatic vertebrates, notably birds and reptiles, are important vectors of salmonella.  Poultry, cattle, and sheep are frequently agents of contamination. Salmonella can be found in food, particularly meats and raw eggs.<br/>Salmonella infections other than typhoid fever are termed enteric fever, salmonella food poisoning and gastroenteritis. These diseases are usually less severe than typhoid fever and are scribed to one of the many serotypes of Salmonella enteritidis. Most outbreaks of epidemics and food poisoning in humans and animals are caused by salmonella enteritidis  and  Salmonella typhimurium,  others are Salmonella Dublin, Salmonella Thompson. Non-typhodialsalmonellosis are more prevalent than typhoid fever and currently holding steady at 40,000 to 50,000 case a year. All strains are zoonotic in origin though human may be some carriers under certain circumstances by contrast. The type of salmonella that affect humans usually cause disease which can be recognized by diarrhea, vomiting.<br/>Diarrohoeal disease seems to be one of the major health hazards both for human and animals. Many salmonella grow in the gut of their host and once in the gut, salmonella wave-long filament called flagella moves about until they touch a suitable cell. The bacteria stick to the cell and are “swallowed” smaller “hairs” called fimbriae are important in stimulating immunity in the host.<br/>THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY ARE:<br/>To isolate salmonella species from Frozen Foods  inOwerri.<br/>To identify the isolated species.<br/>To identify the market location from where salmonella were isolated.<br/>To determine the locations (or market) with the high isolation numbers.<br/><br/>\n\nISOLATION AND CHARACTERISTICS OF SALMONELLA SPECIES FROM FROZEN FOODS IN OWERRI<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ISOLATION AND CHARACTERISTICS OF SALMONELLA SPECIES FROM FROZEN FOODS IN OWERRI", "id": 79}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>RADIOACTIVITY CONCENTRATION OF SOME STAPLE FOOD CONSUMED IN UVWIE <br/>AND WARRI SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND EFFECT ON HUMAN AFTER CONSUMPTION<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>Radioactivity can be defined as the spontaneous disintegration of nucleus of an atom with an emission of alpha, beta particles and gamma ray. The radiation burden of the environment is constantly being enhanced by ionizing radiations from natural sources and their transfer to flora and faunas as have been noted by many researches (Badran, et al., 2003; Velasco, et al., 2004; Eyebiokin, et al., 2005 and Akinloye and Olomo, 1995).<br/>Radiation plays an important and sometimes vital role in our everyday lives, every day we are exposed to naturally occurring quantities of radiation. We get exposed to naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORT) through the air we breathe, the food we eat, the soil we walk on and the water we drink and even within our bodies (Ademola 2008). Monitoring these radioactive materials is therefore of primary importance for human and environmental protection but rapid and accurate method for the assessment of radioactivity is essential (El-bahi 2004). There are over  60 radionuclide (radioactive elements) can be found in nature and are generally classified into three; the Primordial- those formed before the creation of the earth, the cosmogenic – formed as a result of cosmic rays interaction and the artificial radionuclide- these formed due to human action or activities (Eyebiokon et al., 2005)<br/>The series naturally occurring radionuclide are found in food chain are Uranium -238 and Thorium 232 and their progenies while the non-series one is the Potassium-40(40K). Potassium-40 is the principal naturally occurring source of internal radiation, despite it low isotopic abundance (ICRP, 1994). The deleterious radiological health hazard posed by human activity especially in energy production, research, medical application of nuclear facilities and oil and gas extraction and production have attracted great concern and tremendous interest in radiation protection (Arogunjo, et al., 2004).<br/>Dietary pathsways become contaminated with radioactive materials from these man-made applications during routine operation.Since radioactivity was first discovered, there has been concern regarding the damage that it might pose to humans, living creatures and the environment. Many studies have been dedicated to monitoring amounts of radionuclides activity in food and nutritional supplements, particularly related to the human diet, seeking to determine the risks those amounts may bring Concern with radiation levels in food samples is also very important, because ingestion is one of the most common way radionuclides enter living organisms.<br/>Radionuclides are chemical elements with unstable atomic structures called radioactive isotopes. The unstable structures breakdown to release or emit radiation energy from the nucleus or other parts of the atom. Three types of radiation can be released: alpha particles, beta particles and gamma rays (photons). Most naturally occurring radionuclides are alpha particle emitters (uranium-231 and radium-226), but some beta particle emitters also occur naturally (radium-228 and potassium-40). Manmade radionuclides are mainly beta and photon (gamma) emitters. Tritium is a beta particle emitter that may be formed naturally in the atmosphere or by human activities (OEPA, 2005). Radiation being energy emitted when a radionuclide decays, it can affect living tissue only when the energy is absorbed in that tissue. Radionuclides can be hazardous to living tissue when they are inside an organism where radiation released can be immediately absorbed. They may also be hazardous when they are outside of the organism but close enough for some radiation to be absorbed by the tissue. Radionuclides move through the environment and into the body through many different pathways: air, water (both groundwater and surface water) and the food chain. Knowing these pathways make it possible to take necessary control measure to reduce their intake by aquatic animals, terrestrial animals and human beings to minimal levels.<br/>Radionuclides enter the human body through complex mechanism including foodstuffs via the food chain from natural sources. The season of the year determines to a great extent the magnitude of contamination of different foods (IAEA, 1989; Strand et al., 2002). Green leafy vegetables are very prone to external contamination during the raining season, while roots and tubers may also become contaminated (Badranet al., 2003). Grain are subjected to contamination mostly during storage and if fallout occurs during the growing season. Radionuclides may be transported into grains through the plant growth. The most predominant naturally occurring radionuclides in foodstuffs is 40K, Other contributions to the radio-nuclides in foods include deposited fallouts from fission and activation products released during nuclear accidents and constituents of weapons tests released after detonation.This work is aimed at assessing the radioactivity concentration of some staple food in Uvwie and Warri south local government areas inDelta State, Nigeria.<br/>BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/>The radiation burden of the environment is constantly being enhanced by ionizing radiations from natural sources and their transfer to flora and faunas have been noted by many researchers (Badran, et al., 2003; Velasco, et al., 2004; Eyebiokin, et al., 2005 and Akinloye and Olomo, 1995). The deleterious radiological health hazards posed by human activities, especially in the production of energy (oil and gas exploration and exploitation), research and medical applications of nuclear facilities have attracted great concern and tremendous interest over the years in the field of radiation protection (Arogunjo, el al., 2005). Dietary pathways become contaminated with radioactive materials from naturally enhanced radionuclide and man-made applications during routine operation, accidents, and migration of radionuclide from radioactive waste deposal repositories into the biosphere (Tang, et al., 2003). This androgenic contribution gained prominence after the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident on 26 April 1986 when large quantities of radioactive substances were released to the environment, which eventually found their way into the fishes organs from contaminated water bodies, soil and vegetation (Tang, et al., 2003, Rhaman and Voigt, 2004; Arogunjo et al., 2005). Contamination of the human food chain occurs as a result of direct deposition of this radionuclide on fauna from contaminated soil or water, and animas ingesting contaminated plants, soil or water. Considerable efforts are being made by researchers in many parts of the world to measure the activity of radionuclide in the rivers and sea faunas and the estimated of their deposition in human organs and tissues as a result of the consumption of these fauna from radionuclide contaminated water (Hakonson-Hayes, et al., 2002; Badran, et al., 2003; Tang, et al., 2003; Velasco, et al., 2004; Avwiri et al,. 2005; Uchida and Tagami, 2007). Some radioisotopes are only found on the earth as a result of human activity, they are Stontium-90 (90Sr), Cesium- 137 (137Cs), Iodine-131 (131I) and Technetium-99 (99TC), and some Isotope like Potassium-40 (40K) is only present due to natural processes, a few isotopes are present as a result of both natural processes and human activities e.g tritium (3H). The concentration and location of some natural isotopes, particularly Uranium-238 (238U), can be affected by human activity (Wikipedia, 2009). There have been claim of loss of endanger species of aquatic organisms, health problems due to the consumption of fish and other faunas from Worlds ocean, water pollution and other health related radiation and radioactivity induced sicknesses. The biological effects of radiation on marine animals will be essentially the same as they are humans. Both would have the same long-term risks, which are a very slight increase in the risk of cancer, all humans have a risk of dying from cancer. About 19% to 23% of us will die from cancer, even if we are never exposed to radiation levels above natural background levels. According to the American Cancer Society’s website there would be no giant or super sea creatures produced by the dilute amounts of natural, man-made radioactive material found in seawater. Also, there is essentially no increase in mutations in the generations the follow the exposure of the parent animals. Because the radioactive material in the ocean is so dilute and the water itself absorbs radiation and is a very good shielding material, very little if any exposure will be from the water outside the animal. Essentially all exposure will be from radioactive materials ingested by the animal.<br/>1.2. STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Radionuclide (radioactive nuclide, radioisotope or radioactive isotope) is an atom that has excess nuclear energy, making it unstable. This excess energy can either create or emit from the nucleus, new radiation (gamma radiation) or a new particle (alpha particle or beta particle), or transfer this excess energy to one of its electrons, causing it to be ejected (conversion electron).Radionuclide which emit radiation are found naturally in air, water and soil. Natural radioactivity is common in materials that make up our planet, in waters and oceans, and rock. A radionuclide (radioactive nuclide, radioisotope or radioactive isotope) is an atom that has excess nuclear energy, making it unstable. This excess energy can be either emitted from the nucleus as gamma radiation, or create and emit from the nucleus a new particle (alpha particle or beta particle), or transfer this excess energy to one of its electrons, causing that electron to be ejected as a conversion electron. During those processes, the radionuclide is said toundergo radioactive decay. Radionuclides that find their way into the environment may cause harmful effects as radioactive contamination, Potential health damage from exposure to radionuclides depends on a number of factors, and can damage the functions of healthy tissue/organs. Radiation exposure can produce effects ranging from skin redness and hair loss, to radiation burns and acute radiation syndrome. Prolonged exposure can lead to cells being damaged and in turn lead to cancer. Signs of cancerous cells might not show up until years, or even decades, after exposure.(Ionizing radiation, health effects and protective measures\". World Health Organization. (2012; 2014).<br/>Unplanned exposure to radionuclides generally has a harmful effect on living organisms including humans, although low levels of exposure occur naturally without harm. The degree of harm will depend on the nature and extent of the radiation produced, the amount and nature of exposure (close contact, inhalation or ingestion), and the biochemical properties of the element; with increased risk of cancer the most usual consequence. However, radionuclides with suitable properties are used in nuclear medicine for both diagnosis and treatment.<br/>1.3 JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY<br/>A preliminary assessment of Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (NORM) found in staple food crops within Warri south local government would be the main purpose of the research work using the Gamma spectrometer (sodium iodide detector) for analysis of the thirteen (13) selected staple food to determine the background ionization radiation level of the study area and the food crops samples. The study would ascertain the level of rising radiation level as it affects the consumption of these staple foods though within the acceptable limit for the general public and within the safe limit for radiological workers.  Other analytical methods of ascertaining the exposure rate such as Hyper Pure Germanium (HyGe) detector to know the specific radionuclide responsible for the contamination and pollution of these foodstuffs. The study hopes to establish the relevance of knowing the effect of Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (Norm) on commonly consumed staple food and its effect on human after consumption of these food stuffs.<br/> 1.4 AIM &amp; OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>This work is aimed at assessing the radioactivity concentration of some staple food consumed in Uvwie and Warri South local government and effect on human after consumption, with the following objectives;<br/>To measure radioactive contaminants in some staple foodstuffs consumed in Uvwie and Warri south local government areas of Delta state.<br/>Determination of naturally occurring radionuclide’s in foodstuffs sample.<br/>Analyzing the result to ascertain the radiological implication on the people consuming these foods stuffs.<br/>To make recommendation that will help guide the ongoing project.<br/> Better understanding of the nature of distribution of radionuclide’s in food stuff in Delta State.<br/>Addition of new findings to existing baseline data.<br/>1.5. LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>This research is born out of the concern for the increasing case of food related sicknesses which are mostly attributed to the content of staple food consumed. The radionuclide content of these food are becoming a growing concern also due to the indiscriminate application of fertilizers that are radionuclide laden. This research work therefore intended to examined as many as possible the most of the consumed stapled food. But for time and financial constraint, this work is restricted to only thirteen major staple food item in the studied area. <br/>1.6.STUDY AREA<br/>The study samples are restricted to staple food consumed in Uvwie and Warri south local government area of Delta state. Delta State is an oil and agricultural producing state of Nigeria, situated in the region known as the South-South geo-political zone with a population of over 4 million, the capital city is Asaba located at the Northern end of the state with an estimated area of 762 square kilometers (294sqm) while Warri is the economic nerve center of the state and also the most populated in the Southern end of the state. The state has a total land mass of about 18,050km2, of which more than 60% is land. The state covers approximately between the longitude 5000 and 6045’ east and latitude 5000 and 6030 north. It is bounded in the north and west by Edo state, the east by Anambra, Imo States, South East by Bayelsa state and on the southern flank is the Bight of Benin which covers about 160 kilometers of the state coastline. Delta State is generally low lying without remarkable hills. The state has a wide coastal belt inter-lace with rivulets and streams. Apart from oil Delta State is rich in agricultural produce. Warri is an important seaport in the country and the commercial nerve centre of delta state, the area is predominantly riverine with large expanses of mangrove forests and has a land area approximately 1,520 square kilometers. The local government area consist of several communities namely Ode-itsekiri, Agbassa, Orugbo, Ogunu, Obodo, Igbudu, Omadino, Edjeba, Ijala, Ekurede, Ugbori, Okere, Ikpisan, Ifie-kporo, Ubeji, Ajamimogha and Alders town. According to national population census warri has over 311,970 inhabitants who are drawn from the Urhobo, Itsekiri and Ijaw extraction but also host people from varied ethnic groups around delta state and Nigeria at large. Uvwie local government is proximal to Warri south local government area with a population of approximately 251,200 is anUrhobo speaking community within headquarters in Effurun, Uvwie is also use to describe the people and their language the local government area consist of several communities.<br/><br/>\n\nRADIOACTIVITY CONCENTRATION OF SOME STAPLE FOOD CONSUMED IN UVWIE AND WARRI SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND EFFECT ON HUMAN AFTER CONSUMPTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RADIOACTIVITY CONCENTRATION OF SOME STAPLE FOOD CONSUMED IN UVWIE AND WARRI SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND EFFECT ON HUMAN AFTER CONSUMPTION", "id": 80}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION OF YOGHURT<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION <br/>Yoghurt is a fermented dairy product obtained from the lactic acid fermentation of milk. It is one of the most popular fermented milk products in the world and produced commercially at home. (Willey et al., 2008). In its commercial production, non fat or low fat milk is pasteurized cooled to 43°c and are inoculated with known cultures of microorganisms referred to as starter cultures. The starter cultures may be a pure culture of a particular species of Lactobacillus or a mixed culture of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus in a 1: 1 ratio. The coccus which is the Streptococcus thermophilus grows faster than the Rod which is the Lactobacillus bulgaricus and is primarily responsible for acid production while the rod adds flavor and aroma. The growth of these Microorganisms causes the transformation of milk's sugar, lactose into lactic acid. This process gives yoghurt it's texture. The associative growth of the two organisms results in acid production at a rate greater than that produced by them individually.<br/>Yoghurt is generally made from a standardized mixture containing whole milk, partially defatted milk, condensed skim milk cream and non fat dry milk. Alternatively milk may be partly concentrated by removal of 15- 20% water in a vacuum pan or by heating. While the microorganisms fermenting milk confers on it certain health benefits inadequate pasteurized milk may contain microorganism of special importance to man. (Boor and Murphy, 2002). In which its presence or absence in milk may reflect success or failure of good manufacturing practice (GMP) or cause infection when consumed together with food. This is of economic significance in Africa where the HIV/AIDS and cancer scourge has left the public who consume milk products immune suppressed and prone to bacterial and fungi infection. (Boor,2001).<br/>Health complications associated with consumption of inadequately pasteurized milk products include serious infections that are hard, to treat with antibiotics. This becomes clinically significant if organisms isolated from an assessed sample is resistant to conventional antibiotics. Thus, can confer antibiotic resistance to the infected host while providing no alternative drug (Gould, 1994). Heat treated yoghurt do not contain lactic acid bacteria as these are killed during post fermentation. Yoghurt manufacturing companies mainly market \"heat treat\" yoghurt to prolong it's shelf life (Hove et al, 1999). It is important however to evaluate the microbial gravity of some milk products sold in Nigeria.

From time immemorial, man has restorted to the use of this unique commodity for domestic and other purposes. <br/>Most of our water supplies are from surface water which include: rivers, streams, lakes, oceans and seas and there water bodies are likely to be polluted with domestic and Industrial as well as agriculture waste, As populations increase, the problem become more serious and as such, water can endanger the health and life of human beings because when polluted by fecal materials it becomes potential carrier of pathogenic organism (Carpenter 1977).<br/>Water, is of course, absolutely essential to life, not only human life but all life, animal and vegetable. Most of the biochemical reaction that occur in metabolism and growth of living cells involved water, and all take places in water. (Camp etal,1974).<br/>Man uses water not only for drinking purposes but also for bathing, washing, laundering, heating, air conditioning, agriculture, stock raising and gardens, Industrial processes and cooling water power and steam power, fire protection, fishing, swimming and wild life propagation and navigation.<br/>Natural water contain not only then natural flora but also micro – organisms from soil and possible from animals or sewage. Surface waters in streams or pools and stored waters in lakes and large ponds vary considerably in microbial content. (frazier 1978) water is broadly divided into three types viz., surface water which include: streams, rivers, lakes  sear, and oceans Kelman et al (1957) <br/>The ground water, well borehle, many people have defined the ground water in different ways: ground water is subter water that occurs where all pores in the soil or rock counting materials are saturated (pelezer et al 1992).<br/>The atmospheric water, which includes rain, falls. All water bodies consist of a variety of bacterial and other microorganisms like the Algaes fungi, which inhabit these natural water bodies. Some of these micro –organisms are indigenous to thus natural water while others are transient, entering the water from external environment (Pelezar and Reg, 1997).<br/>The generality of bacteria are mostly commonly found ordinarily in fresh water some of which include:  pseudomonas, Archacbacter, and vibrio these are gram negative, the gram-positive bacterial which are found in water include: micrococcus Archacbacter and actinomycentes. Gebharal (1975)  Tap water, as one of the water sources is mostly used domestically, it is observed that tap change sometime the water tap will be clear this calls for load, in order to be sure of its portability. Bonde (1977) <br/>The increase in drinking water from different sources especially in Enugu state has made necessary to investigate the microbial content of water. Water is a potential carried of pathogenic organisms that can endage human life. Most of drinking water sources are often contaminated with different pollutants like faces, animal and plant wastes, making such water  unfit for drinking if not treated. The pollution of water with pathogenic organisms and other pollutants can only be detected by carrying out microbiological assessment of such water. Most human disease such as typhoid paratyphoid cholera, arnboebiasis, Trichinosis, gastroenteritis, sanonall shigellosis, diphtheria, giadia, dracunculus etc are know to be water borne disease. Ewington et al (1971).<br/>Water born disease are those disease which have water as their vehicle of transmission these disease are capable of destroying a whole community if not checked. Therefore, the quickest ways to prevent out break of these disease and to determine the portability of such water sources is to determine the microbial load or content if the microbial content is nor within acceptable limit, such  water sources should be condemned immediately.

Flour confectionery describes a large range of flour based goods other than bread manufactured from batter sponge or dough by mixing, kneading and may be created by fermentation, chemical or other means resulting in puff/flaky short or sweet product. Those that have their moisture content reduced to make them exceptionally brittle or crops are generally regarded as biscuits. (Okaka, 1997)<br/>            The word biscuit come from the Latin word Biscuit meaning twice cooked, baking at high temperature followed by drying at lower temperature (Okaka, 1997). The term biscuit and cookie are synonymous. The American Encyclopedia described biscuit as a form of bread baking soda as a raising agent rather than yeast.<br/>            Biscuit are a common feature of southern us cousine which can be served as a side dish with meal or as a breakfast item. Biscuit is also said to be essentially bakery confectionery dried down to low moisture content name derived from Latin word for twice cooked, made from soft flour, mostly rich in fat and sugar and consequently of high energy content of 420 to 510kcal per 100g they are cherished by people of all ages and used at different meals and occasions as part of breakfast, snacks etc. they are eaten with butter and jam or jelly or as a part of a dish called “Biscuit and gravy”. Biscuits are also eaten covered in pizza sauce and cheese. Many varieties exist, both sweet and savoulry often produced in industrial quantities by large food companies. Sweet biscuit are commonly eaten as snack and may contain chocolate fruit, jam or nuts (peanuts). Savoury biscuits are plainer and commonly eaten with cheese following a meal<br/>            The simplest form of biscuit is a mixture of flour and water but may contain fat sugar and other ingredients mixed together into a dough which is rested for a period, passed between rollers to make a sheet. The sheet is then stamped out baked, cooled and packaged. Biscuits are generally made from wheat flour but according to the topic of this project, “use of composite blends for biscuit making”. Some raw materials other than wheat have to be used in producing the flour for the biscuits. In order to get a superior product especially for crackers, the following factors are of importance – choice of flour for sponge and dough, selection of fermentation environment and the baking conditions. It is therefore necessary to search for raw materials that give flour of light quality.<br/>            Biscuits are classified based on their degree of enrichment and processing or by the method adopted in shaping them. Based on the enrichment criterion are hard dough, soft dough and batter biscuit respectively. (Okaka; 1997). Soft wheat is used in making flour for most biscuit and the softness is de to lower protein (gluten) content when compared with the hard wheat. Based on this fact, raw materials are chosen from other legumes such as Peanut and Roots such as cassava. Since they contain protein though in lesser quantity and quality.<br/>            Peanuts are one of the leading agricultural crops of the world and belong to the family leguminous. It is a source of edible oil and plant protein. The characteristic feature of legume seed protein is that they are markedly deficient in methionine and tryptophan. Infact, methioine is t he first limiting essential amino acid in almost all the legume grains. Peanuts contain about 26% to 35% protein with the peanut meal containing a large amount of nutritionally essential amino – acid. The seeds are nutritional and contain vitamin E, Niacin, folacin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, iron, riboflavin, thiamine, potassium etc (Ogbo; 2002). Peanut also contain a significant load of  resveratrol, a strong antioxidant which inhibit lipid peroxidation of low – density lipoprotein (LOL), prevents the cytotoxicity of oxidized (LDL) and protects cells  against lipid peroxidation. Hydrophilic aid lipophilic properties, it can as well provide more effective protection than other well known antioxidations such as vitamin C and E.<br/>Peanut is used for different purposes, food (raw, roasted or b oiled, cooking oil), animal feed and industrial raw material. There are four varieties of peanut:- Virginia, Peruvian runner, Valencia and Spanish.<br/>Cassava, one of the raw materials is an indigenous and stable food of millions of Nigerian people. The few misconceptions related to cassava especially with regard to its low nutritional value and its toxicity have been effectively challenged by National ad International Research Institutions. National Institutions like University of Agriculture Umedike in Umuahia who have succeeded in producing many Tropical Manioc Selection (TMS) varieties with an added advantage of low cyanide.<br/>Despite the obvious advantages of cassava like being easily propagated by stem cutting. Relatively high yielder and excellent source of calories, cassava remained for some time a neglected crop in agricultural research and development activities to an extent not commensurate with its importance as food. However, some developments within the past 15 years have enhanced interest in the crop and research priority has been given to research on its improvement, increased production and utilization.<br/>First, the International Society for Tropical Root and Tubers Crops was founded in 1967 to encourage research, increased production and utilization and exchange of information on tropical root and tuber crops including cassava yams, sweet potatoes and avoids. Second, among the International Institutions (International Institute for Tropical Agriculture – IITA – in Nigeria, and he International Centre for Tropical Agriculture – CIAT in Colombia) that have programmes giving high priority to research on the improvement, production systems, storage and utilization of cassava and other related training.  Roots and Tubers Expansion Programme (RTEP was also put in place to develop and source for alternative uses of cassava as industrial raw material and create enabling market environment. High Quality unfermented flour”, including fortified cassava flours are now more accessible because of the improved processing and technological methods for processing cassava. These technologies can be used to produce particle / whole substitute for wheat flour from 540 100 percent in bakery and confectionery products such as biscuit, chin-chin etc. and some of these snacks have no noticeable change in texture, flavour, aroma nor colour.<br/>The cassava flour is fortified with peanut butter in this project because of its high protein content, vitamins like vitamin E, which is a powerful antioxidant. The manufacture of good biscuit therefore depends mostly on the selection of correct flour for each type ad applying processed which are compatible such processes a re mixing, accretion and fermentation, laminating, baking and cooling (Okaka, 1997:- p. 155). <br/>1.2       AIM / PURPOSE <br/>As everybody including the federal government is putting effort together to induce foreign exchange conservation by means of local material utilization. It has been decided to carryout some work on cassava and peanut blend in order to use them as substitute for imported wheat in making flours for biscuit manufacture. Peanut butter is also added to complement the necessary amino acids.<br/>The result of research carried out and test conducted by Roots and Tubers Expansion Programme show that it is possible to produce acceptable biscuits of comparable standard to that of wheat flour biscuits using composite flours from the above named legume and Roots.<br/>Wheat whose flour is the major material used for biscuit manufactures in most countries of the world traditionally employ wheat for biscuits and similar products. Although wheat flour is generally employed as the basic ingredients in biscuit manufacture. Wheat is uniformly grown all over the world and being a temperature crop, it only grows under certain climatic conditions. Consequently, biscuit manufacture industries in countries where wheat does not grow have to import the grain or the flour.<br/>In countries, Nigeria, to be precise, wheat is cultivated though not in appreciable quantity due to climate conditions, a large sum of foreign exchange is spent on importation especially with the present rate of growth of biscuit and allied industries in Nigeria (Federal Office of Statistics, Lagos Nigeria). There are a lot of industries (confectionery) although the date is not yet readily available, all based on wheat flour. Foreign exchange spend as at 1982 are huge amount of money. Therefore success in this trend of supplementation will save a huge sum of money being spend annually on wheat importation and could now be utilized to improve other sector of the country’s economy.<br/>The aim of this project work therefore is to reduce or stop totally the extensive importation of wheat, thereby broaden the food base of Nigerians. The commercial and industrial implication will bring economic benefits to all biscuit consumers by making the product more readily available. Supplementation of imported wheat flour with cassava flour will save millions of naira in foreign exchange.<br/>It is also estimated that the use of these composite blends (cassava flour and peanut butter) will result in the production of biscuits that are less expensive and highly nutritive than those produced before.<br/>It will also create new employment opportunities as well as economic self-reliance both at the industrial and house – hold level of cassava processors.<br/><br/>\n\nUSE OF COMPOSITE FLOUR BLENDS FOR BISCUIT MAKING (PEANUT/CASSAVA FLOUR)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " USE OF COMPOSITE FLOUR BLENDS FOR BISCUIT MAKING (PEANUT/CASSAVA FLOUR)", "id": 84}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ONION IS ASSOCIATED WITH MICRO-ORGANISMS WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF CAUSING SPOILAGE.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>          Onion is associated with micro-organisms which are capable of causing spoilage.

It is one of the oldest vegetable cultivated by man for food. In the world onion buld are found in ancient Egypt, India, China and Europe during the middle ages, and in the late sixteenth or early seventeenths centuries, it spread to the new world by the Spaniards. The crop is now wide spread in both temperate and tropical regions with Europe as the largest producers (cobley and Steele, 1976).<br/>          In the tropic most onions are grown with irrigation during the relatively cool dry season in semi arid region, they are not good crop for hot wet tropic. Onions can be grown under a wide range of climatic condition but they succeed best in a mild climate without excessive rainfall or great extremes of heat and cold. They are not suitable to regions with heavy rainfall in the lowland humid tropics. Cool conditions with an adequate moisture supply are most suitable for early growth followed by warm drier condition for maturation, harvesting and curing. They can be grown on a variety of soils, but the soil should be retentive of water, non – packing and rich in nutrient, a good fertile loam usually gives the best result. They may be grown successfully on peat soils. The soil optimum pH is about 6.0 – 7.0 (alkaline) (carl and Hall, 1986).<br/>          In storage a specific environment must be provided for the onions, if a high quality product is to result. Storage losses are a function of storage environment as well as the condition and cultural practices used during the growing season. Proper control of storage environment can however, significantly extend the storage season from that which would result from storage environment that were not matched to the condition of the onions when placed in storage (carl &amp; Hall, 1986).<br/>          Onions may be stored in bulk or may be placed in palletised bins that are stacked in a storage structure. The use of bins may make handling of onions convenient but it does make ventilation of the onions more difficult. Improved bins design may alleviate the ventilation problems in future (cobley and Steele, 1976).<br/>          Onions are packed locally by using basket and jute bags these packaging material come locally from palm; bamboo and fibrous jute trees, also they have different sorts and sizes. These packaging materials have the function for transportation and storability of the onions. Again these packaging material are locally available and relatively cheap. Apart from these few advantages mentioned they have no barrier to dust, not suitable for measuring weight and can easily be crushed which might lead to damage of the onions.<br/>          The deterioration of raw onions may result from physical factors; actions of their own enzymes, microbial or combination of these factors. Mechanical damage resulting from action of animals, birds or insects or from brushing, wounding, bursting, cutting, freezing, desiccation or other mishandling may predispose towards increased enzymatic action or entrance, and growth of microorganisms. Also previous damage by plant pathogens may make the part of the crop used as food unfit for consumption or may open the way for growth of saprophytes and spoilage by them. Contact with spoilage onions may bring about transfer of organisms causing spoilage and increasing the wastage. Improper environment condition during harvest, transit, storage and marketing may favor spoilage.<br/>Genera of bacteria usually present in onion include pseudomonas spp, Bacillus spp, chromobacterium, Enterobacterium, flavobacterium, lactobacillus serratia, staphylococcus spp, streptococcus spp and others and perhaps genera containing plant pathogens, such as Erwinia and  xanthomomes. Grouwth  of some micro-organisms may take place between harvesting and processing or consumption of the vegetable. Adequate control of temperature and humidity will reduce such growth  (frazier and westhoff, 1978).<br/>1.2         AIMS OF THIS RESEARCH PROJECT<br/>The aims of this research project are:<br/>1               to isolate, identify and characterize the different micro-organaniszs that are responsible for the spoilage of onions.<br/>2               To categorize the pathogenic micro-organisms associated with the spoilage of onions.<br/>1.3         STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>The society is a place where a vegetable is been consumed everyday. This project research goes a long way in identifying problems which is encountered when spoilage occurs in onions; onion bulb that is contaminated when consumed causes severe stomach ache (presence of enterobacteriacea) because  of the pathogenic micro-organisms present in if  and this inturn is hazardous to ones health. The pathogenic micro-organisms present in the spoilage of onoins are  deterimental to humans e.g pseudomonas spp., staphylococcus spp, Erwinia etc.<br/>Onions been a member of the vegetable group  is used widely in seasoning, flavouring and sometimes cured and stored as spicing agent. The proper storage of onions makes it available for use all year round and the effect of spoilagemicro-organisms afecting it has an adverse efect on the society at large because if makes onions not readily available to the society; that is why studies is been carried out in this project research to minimize and or stop spoilage of onions.<br/>1.4         HYPOTHESIS<br/>HO-A mixed flora of bacteria and fungi is found in spoilt onions.<br/>Hi-bacteria and fungi found in onion result in the onions own enzymatic actions causing physical, microbial or combination of these factors leading to entrance and or growth of micro-organisms.<br/>1.5         SIGNIFCANCE OF STUDY<br/>The justification of this project research is to ascertain the different micro-organism responsible for the spoilage of onions. In this process bacteria and fungi were isolated identified and characterized because they are the microorganisms associated with the spoilage of onions.<br/>The deterioration of raw onions can also result from physical factors, actions of their own enzymes, microbial action or combination of these factors. In physical factors; the storage patter can affect the raw onions that is if it is stored in bulk or may be placed in palletized bins and this does not make ventilation of the onions easily, so improved bins design may be of great help. In action of their own enzymes; if the raw onions is crushed during packaging, handling, this may inturn allow the penetration of micro – organisms which will now alter the enzymatic action of the raw onions and may lead to spoilage of the onions flesh which is meant for food and if consumed could be hazardous to health.<br/><br/>\n\nONION IS ASSOCIATED WITH MICRO-ORGANISMS WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF CAUSING SPOILAGE.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ONION IS ASSOCIATED WITH MICRO-ORGANISMS WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF CAUSING SPOILAGE.", "id": 85}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN EPIDEMOLOGY SURVEY FOR SCTRISTOSOMIASIS AMONG PUPILS <br/>IN AMAGUNZE COMMUNITY IN NKANU LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA IN EENUGU.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The survey of urinary sehistomiass in Ishele in Amagunze, Nkanu East local Government was carried out using two methods of diagnosis i.e combination of questionnaire on clinical signs and symptoms, and laboratory microscopy using primary school children in the area as test samples.

A specie which infect the urinary bladder is caused by schnstosome haematobuim widely  found in Africa and was first discovered by bilharza in 1851 in Egyptian mummies and He also carried out an urogential tract autopsy. About 20million people are infected with schnstosome parasite, those  who get heavy infection are especially or death. Billaries modify dictimery (1998) defined Schistosomiasis as infection disease of man caused by blood flukes of genus schnstosome. It is one of the most serious parasitic infection of man, affecting millions of people in tropical and sub-tropical regions of Africa, Asia and west Indies. <br/>Schistosomiasis  presents a constant threat to as many as 600millons people as they perform daily activities related to water, such like swimming, washing and bathing ( Bayers 1984) this Schistosomiasis affect for different prpolation from as a result of human contact with infected water, they includes (a) occupational  (b) recreational (c) domestic (d) socio- cultural (Ukoli 1984) The three main species of schnstosome responsible for human infection are schnistasoma japonicum. Four other species occurring much less commonly are interculum, S matter, S bovis and S meking<br/>The blood flukes in schnstosome is a long narrow known as Schistosomiasis or bilharziasis. schnstosome that livers in the urinary bladder of man is known as schisotosoma haematobium while that in the intestine is . schistosoms mansm, and also schistosnma japonicum, <br/>Ramsay (1934) reported that male and female worms are separated individual but the female is smaller and is carried in a groove on the under surface of the male and lives in the vein of the host. The female lays eggsin the walls of the bladder and intestine causing inflammation and bleeding. The eggs are excreted with body wastes and find their way to water contaminated by several different water snail example bulinus which is the intermediate host of  schrostome haematobium. Schistosomiasis is very wide spread and associated with poverty, poor housing and inadequate sanitary facilities and unsanitary human behavior. <br/> TABLE 1<br/>TIME SCALE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHISTOSOME SPICES<br/>     S. haematobuim     S.

Ishiehy Amagunze using annual the river Afavu having an agricultural base with the people contact with the infected water and swampy soil, there is the tendency of the disease which manifest in the people with symptoms as haematuria tenderness of lower etc. It is prevalence in Armagunze increases as the people gets more into contact with the water bodies this makes water bodies unsafe for Agricultural recreational activities enchangers farm works and use of the water contact relation for the people have increased alarming due to the poor facilities and recreational features. hence, there is need to redetemine the level of Schistosomiasis in Ishelu Amagume, Nkanu local government <br/>1.2              AIM AND OBJECTIVE <br/>To evaluate the epidermiology of Schistosomiasis among pupil of Ishielu Amagunze in Nkanu local government. <br/>2                    to educate the pupils with respect to the disease on the mode of infection and identify ways of preventing and controlling the disease. <br/>1.3              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>Amagunze has a number of slow moving streams and water bodies with high human contact. The exposed population is primary school pupils who swims, wash food clothes at long hours. It is expected that water intact diseases and schistomiasis will be highly prevalent in the community.<br/>1.4              HYPOTHESIS<br/>H0 prevalence of schristosmiasis is more in primary school children between ages 6-12 years who have highest water contact such as swimming food washing etc. <br/>H1 Schistosomiasis is not present amoge pupils in Amagunze even though they have high water contact events. <br/>1.5              JUSTIFICATION <br/>Since all human activities required water such as drinking., bathing, washing of clothes and agricultural purpose etc. there is need for proper disposal of faces and urine to reduces the rates of infection of Schistosomiasis and pupils coming to the water should be screened before allowing to settle in the area. <br/><br/>\n\nAN EPIDEMOLOGY SURVEY FOR SCTRISTOSOMIASIS AMONG PUPILS IN AMAGUNZE COMMUNITY IN NKANU LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA IN EENUGU.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN EPIDEMOLOGY SURVEY FOR SCTRISTOSOMIASIS AMONG PUPILS IN AMAGUNZE COMMUNITY IN NKANU LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA IN EENUGU.", "id": 86}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>MICROBIAL EXAMINATION OF SPOILT AVOCADO FRUIT.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            Microbial examination of spoilt Avocado fruits was carried out to obtained the causal organism.  A total of 60 avocado from Ogbete Main market and New market Enugu were examined by culturing on nutrient agar and sabourand dextrose agar (SM), for bacteria and fungi causing post – harvest spoilage on the fruits; six bacterial species and six fungal species were isolated.

Despite the high water activity of  most fruits, the how PH leads to their spoilage being dominated by fungi, both yeast and moulds.  Other common diseases of pears include the black spot or scab caused by as comycetes<br/>            Avocado fruits has being estimated that one fourth of all produced harvested is no consumed before spoilage (Salulche, 1974), spoilage of fresh fruits usually occurs during storage and transport and while wacting to be processed unlike many other foods fruits after picking and before processing are ‘a live’ of the products plus the normal ripering process complicate an independent discussion of the microbiological spoilage problems are really market diseases of these products:<br/>            Shape, varies from slightly obligate to highly elongate, an intermediate oval or pear shape is preferred.  Yellow to purple or black.<br/>            The composition of the fruit influences the likely type of spoilage.  thus bacteria soft rot is widespread for the most part among the fruits is limited to those that are not highly acid.  Because most fruits are somewhat acid are fairly dry at the surface, and are deficient in B vitamins, mold are the most common causes of spoilage.  The compositions too, must determine the particular kind of molds most likely to grow, thus avocado support a large, variety of fungal spoilage organisms and other kinds comparatively few.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>            Micro-organisms are known to destroy fruits, thereby reducing the quantity for consumption and the profits desirable from fruits such as avocado.  Many spot are noticed on pears which do change the taste when consumed.<br/>            Bacteria and fungi are harmful and useful living organisms.  The spoilage of most fruits is always associated with  bactera and fungi, many diseses of plants are associated with bacteria and fungi (Micro-organisms)<br/>            The adverse effect of bacteria in plants and fruits has resulted in shortage of avocado fruits for consumption. Revenue is lost by farmers and industries that uses avocado fruits as a raw materials for fruit juice due to the spoilage caused by micro-organisms.<br/>1.3       AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>            Microbial examination of spoilt avocado fruits <br/>To isolate and identify how micro-organism destroy avocado so as to guide producer  and farmers on how to manage the fruits<br/>To isolate and identify it those micro-organisms are responsible for the spoilage<br/>To compare the extent of spoilage in the area of colelction (tree) with that of market<br/>1.4       HYPOTHESIS<br/>            HO:     Microbial organisms do not cause spoilage of avocado at either in the field or during exposure for sale.<br/>Hg       = Microorganisms (Fungi and Bacteria) are responsible for avocado spoilage.<br/>1.5              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study will be useful to farmers, fruit juice industries and consumers of avocado fruits.

(Awan and Okaka, 1983). <br/>Starch is the major storage form of carbohydrate in sorghum and millets. It consists of amylopectin, a branched – chain polymer of glucose, and amylose, a straight chain polymer (FAO, 1992).<br/>            The digestibility of the starch, which depends on hydrolysis by pancreatic enzymes, determines the available energy content of cereal grain. Processing of the grain by methods such as steaming, pressure cooking, flaking, puffing or Micronesian of the starch increases the digestibility of sorghum starch.<br/>            This has been attributed to a release of starch granules from the protein matrix rendering t hem more susceptible to enzymatic digestion (FAO, 1992).<br/>            When starch is heated in water (moist heat) it will produce a gel – an important property needed in the thickening of gravies, sauces, in the baking of bread and production of custards (Awan and Okaka, 1983).<br/>            The physico-chemical properties of the starch affect the textural characteristics of the food preparations made from the grain.<br/>            The behaviour of starch in water is temperature and concentration dependent (Malleshi and Desikachar, 1985).<br/>            Starches in general show very little uptake of water at room temperature and their swelling power is so small. At higher temperature, water uptake increases and starch granules collap--- which leads to solubilisaiton of amylose and amylopectin to form a colloidal solution.  This is the gelatinisation stage. Genetic and environmental factors affect the gelatinisation temperature of starch (Freeman and Bocan, 1973).<br/>            Heat treatment of starch in a limited amount of water lead to swelling the granules  with very little loss of soluble material and partial gelatinization of the starch (Watson, 1970).<br/>            On cooking, the gelatinized starch tends to return from the soluble,  dispersed and amorphous state to an insoluble crystalline state.<br/>            This phenomenon is known as retrogradation or set back; it is enhanced with low temperature and high concentration of starch (Rooney, 1991). Amylose, the linear component of the starch, is more susceptible to retrogradatioln than the amylopectin (Freeman and Bocan, 1973).<br/>1.1       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>            Steeping of sorghum for a longer period consumes time and imparts undesirable flavour to the starch extracted from the sorghum due to the action of some spoilage microorganisms. Hence the need to reduced the steeping time and detect its effect on the yield and their sensory properties.<br/> 1.2       The overall objective of the project work is to develop a process for extracting starch from two different cultivar of sorghum by subjecting to different steeping time.<br/>            The null hypothesis is that cultivar and steeping period will not have effect on the yield and functionality of the extracted starch.<br/>            Specific aims are:<br/>            To determine the effect of steeping period on:<br/>1.         The yield of the starch<br/>2.         The functional properties of the starch<br/>3.         Organoleptic properties of the starch<br/>4.         The glycosidic cyanide level of the starch<br/>5.         The metabolysable energy value of the starch<br/>  <br/><br/><br/>\n\nEFFECT OF STEEPING PERIOD ON YIELD AND ACCEPTABILITY OF STARCH EXTRACTED FROM SORGHUM (SORGHUM BICOLOR, WHITE VARIETY AND RED VARIETY)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF STEEPING PERIOD ON YIELD AND ACCEPTABILITY OF STARCH EXTRACTED FROM SORGHUM (SORGHUM BICOLOR, WHITE VARIETY AND RED VARIETY)", "id": 88}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF MICROBIAL LOAD OF THE ENUGU MAIN WATER PRODUCTION AND WATER AVAILABLE TO IMT CAMPUS II HOSTEL<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            Samples of water from the different hostels in campus II and other source of water production namely Ajali-owa water, from bore hole 9th mile and spring water from GRA water board were water collecterd and analysed using total plate count and multiple tube fermentaton techniques coliform.  The results shows no coliforms in production water from Ajali-owa and in GRA spring water reservaiour and no coliform in 9th mile bore hole water, 14 organism and 149 cfu/ml plate counts were obtained from tap water in IMT campus II hostel 7 coliform and Tocful / ml plate count from well water and 28 coliform and 280 cfu/ml plate count from spillage waste water.  These results obtained show that tap water  consumed in IMT campus II did not meet with NAFDAC and WHO standards.  Preventive measures such as proper treatment of these water should be encourage and all pipes in campus II should be checked for leakages<br/> TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>1.0       CHAPTER ONE<br/> Introduction              <br/>1.1       Aims / objectives of the study                       <br/>1.2       Statement of problems                                   <br/>1.3       Hypothesis                                                                 <br/>1.4       Scope of limitation                 <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Literature review        <br/>2.1              The major group of biological Pollutions of water                            <br/>2.2       Source of water supply                                  <br/>2.3       Source of water pollution                              <br/>2.4       Treatment of water sample                <br/>2.5              International standard for drinking water                                         <br/>2.6              Diseases from water                           <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0       Materials &amp;

Water is a tasteless, odourless and colourless mobile liquid except in large volume where it appears blue.  It has a melting point of OoC (320f) and a boiling point of 1000C (2120f).  water is a basic necessity of life, in the absence higher animals survive only but a few hours or days.  It has several uses such  as  washing  cooking, food  processing ,swimming, and  among  others. Out  of   these  uses, drinking  of  water  seems  to  be  the  most   sensitive  as  it  could  have  a  direct   deleterious  impact  on  health  of  human  beings.<br/>            Therefore, drinking  water  should  be  potable  free  diseases, or  toxic  substance (Beren 1991) .<br/>            Water is portable when it is colourless.  Odourless, or tasteless and also free from poisonous, corroding, staining substances as well as disease casuiong oirganisms (Cruich 1972).  The problem of providing safe and adequate water is as old as life on earth.  Water can be made unifit or unsafe for drinking it contamination occurs either by nature or activities of human beings.    <br/>            Perhaps the greatest danger associated with drinking water is contamination by human  excrement (Forest 1979).  In most cases, the pollution/contamination is hardly severe and is not particularly detrimental to health.<br/>            Thus a few substances and microbes that are health hazard do occur in water, and can cause illness or even death.  From microbiological point of view, the pathogens most frequently transmitted through water supply ranges from ultrasmall virus to the microspic bacteria and relatively large cysts entemoeba instolytica.  These organism cense infectrons of intestinal trach, when consumed censing amebic dysentery, and Gardia lamblia is a protozoa responsible for Giadiasis.  Defective plumbing for example was the cause of out break during the world fair in Chicago 1933 (Garelick 1987) water borne disease cause acute diarrhoe, often last 2-3 months.  The most common water borne disease can be by bacteria includes typhoid fever, paratyphoid.  Asiatic cholera and bacteria dysentery.<br/>            Other disease that may be transmitted by water include brucellosis, shige /losis, these disease are consuming.  Untreated water (Hetolett 1921) various countries of the world and the world Health organisation (WHO) has set up standards for water quality against which the level of pollution can be assessed.  The world Health organization (WHO) National Agency for food and Drug Administration control (NAFDAC), standard for potable water include the following, that in 100ml of water coliform bacteria should be absent, total plate count of bacteria growth should be 100 CFU/ML of water.  Hence the sanitary Quality of water should not be over looked since  contaminated water can cause health hazards when consumed.<br/>According to guideline for drinking water quality of WHO (1998)<br/>TABLE 1<br/>WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION STANDARD FOR DRINKING WATER<br/> PH    5.0 – 9.0<br/>COLOUR    15 Hazen unit<br/>Dissolved solids    500 mg/l<br/>Total Hardness    500 mg/l<br/>Calcium    75 mg/l<br/>Iron    0.3 mg/l<br/>Chloride    200 mg/l<br/>Nitrate    45 mg/l<br/>Coliform    10 colonies<br/>1.1       AIMS / OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>            The objective of this projects is to make comparative analysis of Enugu state water cooperation provide against supplies.<br/>            To identify contamination microbial advice on measures to control pollution  of water bodies etc.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>            The treated water produced by Enugu state water co-operation could be contaminated by defective plumbing which cause the rush of water out of the pipe forming pull mixed with sewage matters.  The pull eventually suck back through the burst pipe into the pipe line being distributed to various location and collected as drinking water.<br/>1.3       HYPOTHESIS<br/>H.O:    there is difference in the microbial load of water from Enugu state water operation at point of production against the load as the point of supply and consumption.<br/>HI:      There is statistical differences between the microbial load of water from the Enugu state water co-operation as the production point against the load as supply and consumption point.<br/><br/>\n\nCOMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF MICROBIAL LOAD OF THE ENUGU MAIN WATER PRODUCTION AND WATER AVAILABLE TO IMT CAMPUS II HOSTEL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF MICROBIAL LOAD OF THE ENUGU MAIN WATER PRODUCTION AND WATER AVAILABLE TO IMT CAMPUS II HOSTEL", "id": 89}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>MICROOBIAL EVALUATION OF RAM MILK FROM A DIARY FARM<br/>ABATRACT</b><br/>Microbial evaluation of twenty samples of raw milk from a diary farm (Emene fulani cattle rearers) was carried out using five method: viz direct microcopies count nutrient agar count, Blood agar count, Mac conkey agar count (celiforms only) and Acid fast bacilli staring was done to  assay for the presence of the Tubercle bacillus.

It is an exceptionally good source of protein which is of a high biological value in promoting the growth of children (ihekorany and Ngoddy, 1985). Milk  is decribed as a good of outstanding interest, which is designed by nature to be  complete good for very young mammals (fox and Cameron, 1980). <br/>Milk contains a wide variety of  constituents and contains  most of the food factors associated with bacterial nutrition. Milk as a single food is of high nutritional value and is associated with spoilage microorganisms. At the time milk leaves the udder of the healthy cow, it contains few bacteria these stem from milk  ducts and cistern. During the milking process, bacteria are usually added from various sources. In hand milking the sources are air the hair of the animal manure, the milkers equipment such as pails, feed and machine, most of these environmental factors are less important. However, the milking equipment may serve as an important source of contamination if it is not carefully cleaned and sanitized (ihekoronye and Ngoddy, 1985) . <br/>After milk has been drawn it is rapidly cooled to 45 of prevent contaminants from multiplying. To eliminate pathogens from milk the process of pasteurization is applied. This involves application of heat below the boily point (fraizer and westhoff, 1978).<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/> Mike as a food of high nutritional value is highly associated with microorganisms.  As a result of this contamination of raw milk, it not sterilized and taken directly or used for production of milk products, causes disease to man and also contribute to the spoilage of milk and milk products. <br/>1.3              AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY. <br/>AIM:   The aim of the study is to evaluate the micro-flora of raw milk <br/>Objectives: The objectives of the study are <br/>i)                    To isolate and identify micro organisms that are contaminate raw milk. <br/>ii)                  To determine of the milk  is tubercle bacilli free <br/>iii)                To assay for the presence of coliform as an index of pathogens. <br/>1.4 HYPOTHESIS <br/> Ho: All fresh raw milk from healthy cows are free from marshal contamination both pathogenic and non- pathogenic <br/>H1:   All fresh raw milk from healthy cows are net free from microbial contamination both pathogenic and non- pathogenic. <br/>1.5 JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY<br/>Milk is know to be heavily contaminated by microorganisms if net properly handled. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate consumption or processing it for milk products <br/><br/>\n\nMICROOBIAL EVALUATION OF RAM MILK FROM A DIARY FARM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MICROOBIAL EVALUATION OF RAM MILK FROM A DIARY FARM", "id": 90}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PRODUCTION AND ACCEPTABILITY STUDIES OF MALTED SORGHUM (SORGHUM BICOLOR) BISCUIT <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Biscuit was produced from malted sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and wheat flour blend.

Four samples of biscuit were produced using sorghum and wheat in the following ratios samples A; 30: 70, sample B; 50:50, sample C; 60:40, sample D; 100:0. Creaming method was used in biscuit production with specified ingredients.

They are crisps, unleavened and sometimes sweet pastry produced light by the addition – F baking powder or soda, sometimes with chocolate or fruit in put (Achukoh; 1992). Biscuit can also be defined as a baked product having not less than 8% of flour content calculated (Hannemah, 1981). Okaka, 1997 stated that biscuits are termed “cookies” in USA but the Word biscuit means a small cake like bun.<br/>            According to Terrell, 1981 there are basically some ingredients that are used for biscuit production such as sugar, salt, milk, shortening flavour leavening. Egg improves the volume of biscuit as well as the taste and flavour. Egg and butter are also used for variety, these improves the quality of the products.<br/>Wheat flour is a critical and principal raw material in biscuit production its. Superiority over other cereals is due to the presence of gluten which inherently imparts all  the essential qualities to their products. The absence of this simple protein in non-wheat flour makes them unsuitable as substitutes for wheat flour. Unfortunately, wheat is a temperature crop, there fore, our tropical climate does not favour its cultivation. Flour which has high gluten content are classified as a strong hard flour, and therefore produces a strong dough and thus a strong biscuit is produced (Richtea), while flour with small gluten content produces a soft I weak biscuit (Digestive) Aerating chemicals, syrups and water were further added as one of the basis ingredients for biscuit making (Achukoh; 1992). The production of biscuits involves weighing, mixing, dough formation, kneading and rolling out, machining and shaping, prickling Bakino, cooling and packaging (Okaka, 1997).<br/>The malting potentials of sorghum grains can be utilized to produce soft dough biscuit. Germinated sorghum grains, develop alpha – amylase, carboxy peptidase, endo – beta – 1, 3 – glucanase, pentosanase, limit dextrinase and endo – protease in the grain during malting. Malting involves essentially steeping, germination and limiting cereals, seedling growth by kilning. During germination enzymes are produced for the degradation of starch and protein in the cereal grain. Malting yields higher proportions of hydrolytic enzymes such as X and B – amylases which may be either completely soluble or largely insoluble depending on the variety.<br/>Malted sorghum and wheat flour are used in order to check the baking potential of biscuit, malts produce from sweet sorghum and related variety usually contain insoluble amylase. The insoluble substances that make aqueous extraction impossible (Amori, 1 9 8 7) – Glucosidase in sorghum malt is also highly insoluble malt solid (Barry, and Dorota 1988).<br/>Malting causes a decrease in the density of caryposis in sorghum grain (Isola, 1992). Lower the amount of lysine from 0.25% in unmalted sorghum to 0.18% in sorghum malt (Ilori, 1989) and reduces the milling energy (Swanstoo et al, 1994).<br/>Time and temperature of storage influence the percentage soluble amylase in sorghum grain. For example, sorghum grain stored at 12t 23oc temperature for 2 to 3 years give higher levels of soluble amylase (between 57 – 73%) while nearly harvested grain give about 25%. Lowering the temperature to 7oc reduces the level of soluble amylase in the level of soluble amylase in the grains to about 37% after 3 years (Novellie et al, 1973).<br/>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>To evaluate the acceptability of the biscuit made from malted sorghum and wheat flour blend and to reduce cost of production manufacturers, so as to break even and make gain.<br/>Malted sorghum flour has blended with wheat flour in the preparation of some confectioneries will go a long way in reducing he country’s heavy reliance on imported wheat and conserve the Nation Foreign Exchange. <br/><br/><br/>\n\nPRODUCTION AND ACCEPTABILITY STUDIES OF MALTED SORGHUM (SORGHUM BICOLOR) BISCUIT <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PRODUCTION AND ACCEPTABILITY STUDIES OF MALTED SORGHUM (SORGHUM BICOLOR) BISCUIT ", "id": 91}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EXAMINATION OF JOLLOF RICE SERVED IN HOTELS FOR PATHOGENIC ORGANISMS<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This project work is aimed at examination of jollof rice served in hotels for pathogenic organisms and to find out possible pathogenic organisms in the food.

No one doubts the importance of food in our lives. All active living organisms must have a constant serviced of energy  this  energy may be supplied by materials a cell or organism has stored internally (e.g  our fat  or carbohydrate) or it may come from an external source in the environment food (Nutrition) supplies two major component of life, ENERGY and the chemical  building blood of life, (Bor). <br/>Energy is required for the various enzymatic reaction that require an input of energy for the reaction, the catalyze for example the movement of the muscles on our legs during a race or in their intestine as we digest our intest meal on to draw air into lungs for breathing all requires energy.<br/>Food  also supplies the structural material required for living organisms to make new macromolecules for repair of damage structure  or for new construction such as the manufacturing of off springs,. Apart from it vital function of substaing life, food is referred to as labours of pathogenic  organisms, if not prepared in a tidy and clean environment. This has been recognized as a problem in some restinants in Enugu, concerned with providing proper food for consumers. <br/>Pathogenic organisms  exist in two major categories. INTOXICATIONS –INFECTION. Intoxication is a result of ingesting toxins produced by microbes that have grown on the food prior to it being eaten. Infection is the result of the food serving as a forniute that carries an infection pathogen deep into the juicy recesses of a body where it is able to gain a foot . generally food pathogenic organism results from contamination of food and the subsequent growth of food pathogenic organisms. <br/>Food poisoning out breaks are of recognized by the sudden  on set of  illness with a shout period of    time among many individual who have eaten or drunk one or more food (Jollodf rice) in common. Single cases are difficult to identify unless in botulism for example there are distinct symptom. Food pathogenic organism may be one of the most common cause of actuate illness, yet cases and difficult to identify vnlesssas in Botulision for example  <br/>There are distant Symptom. Food pathogenic organism may be one of the most common causes of acute illness. Yet cases and outbreaks are generally under recognized and under-requited.   The number of bacterial present : food (jolloff rice) may be used to determined whether or not the food (jolloff rice ) has been handled correctly. Sources, Vehicles and Reuters of continuations <br/> Some disease that are spread by bacteria that enters the body in food (jolloff rice) can multiply at an amazing rate when they are provided with warmth and moisture, (especially at room temperature) Our food can become an ideal home for then. Clean food (jolloff rice ) can be contaminated by bacterial from four main sources. <br/>*   The people present in the workplace and their clothing.     <br/>•other  food that is already contaminated.<br/>•Dirty kitchen or work premises <br/>•Insect and vermin. <br/>Some time, harmful bacterial  pass directly from the source  of  high risk food, but usually they rely on other things to transfer them to food. These  things are called  vehicles. Ihekoronye A. I. And Ngoddy P.O (1979).<br/>Indirect  contamination using an intermediate  vehicle is the most common e.g the movement  of bateria from the intestine of a food handler to food via their hands after using the toilet. Where contamination  is via for example a culting board, this is known is  cross contamination,  the path that bacteria use to more from the sources to the food is know is the Route. <br/>The privation of pathogenic organism in food, in most cases of food poisoning chain of events takes place and if we are to reduce the incidence of illness, the chain must be broken. <br/> Food poisoning bacteria<br/>Multiply<br/>Warmth<br/>Give time and<br/>High risk food<br/>Contamination  <br/>THE FOOD POISONING CHAIR <br/>There  are different ways of breaking the food poisoning chain.<br/>*          Protecting food  (Jolloff rice) form contamination .<br/>*          Preventing any bacteria present in food from multiply. <br/>*          Destory those  bacteria that are present in the food. The problem of food sanitation.    <br/>•Inspecting all food and  washing fruit and vegetable before preparation. <br/>•Using good personal hygiene practice always.<br/>•  Not coupling or sneezing over or around the food. <br/>•Keeping covered as much as possible in destroy those bacteria with in food (Jollof rice) An adequate cooking food ensuring that a minimum internal cooking temperature of 800c is reacted. The heating processing such as pasteurization sterilization or caming. A combination of a suitable temperature and sufficient time is always required to destroy bacteria. The time and temperature required depends on the particular organism (e.g spores of clostridium perfringen are much more  heat resistant than salmonella bacteria).<br/>In food safety programmes the hazard analysis critical control point (HACC?), this is recommended that every food business adopt the HACCP approach to identify all potential hazards and control them before they result in problems. <br/>In setting up a HACCP system will involve the following <br/>•Set up a HACCP team of those people who fully understand the product. <br/>•Draw up flow chart that define all stages in the preparation process, from raw materials though to consumption or sale.<br/>•Identify all potential hazards (eg physical chemical bacterial) e.t.c<br/>•Identify the citial point consider preventive measures and decide which are needed to eliminate or  reduce poetical hazard to acceptable levels. <br/>1.2              AIM AND OBJECTIVE <br/>This is to find out possible pathogenic organism found in food (Jollof rice) sold to Top Rink Hotel and presidential hotel to examine and identify micro organism (bacteria) associated with  Jollof rice (food) sample collected from these hotels in Enugu. And to determines the bacteria load growth. <br/>1.3              SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY. <br/>The signifcance of the work is to enable us improve the hygiene of food (Jolloff rice) served and a good knowledge of a safe food handling practice suitable light colour protection clothing to be worn and it, will also enable  us to be aware of various pathogenic organism and the infection they transmit through   food (Jollof rice). As result of this the prevention of contamination of food is to be adlered to, this can be achieved by:<br/>•keeping high risk food at temperature that inhibits the growth of bacterial (i.e our of the damager Zone.) food should be kept below 40c in a refigecated unit an about 700c in a suitable warming unit. <br/>•Ensuing  that during preparation food is in the danger zone for as short a time as possible high risk food must not be left sitting out at room temperature. <br/>•Using suitable preservation such as salt and sugar. <br/>•Using various packing method like gas flushing or vacuum packing. <br/>1.4              hypothesis <br/>Ho          Presence of non- pathogenic organism in the Jollof rice served. <br/>H1          Presence of pathogen organism in the Jollof rice served. <br/>1.5              SCOPE OF STUDY <br/>This project work is based on the identification examination of pathogenic bacterial organism associated with (Jollof rice) served in the following hotels, Top rink and presidential hotel all in Enugu town and the cavsatire organism include  staphylococcus auvious, salmonella, clostridia per fringers, Escherichia coli, the modern problem to food satiation<br/>1.6              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>Pathogenic organism are organism that are referred to as specific health hazard associated with gas to intestinal distribute resulting from the consumption of food containing toxins. The  victim suffering from abdominal pain and diarrheas with more vomiting than diarrheas usually manifest the illness, which when untreated in time result to the does not result to death it had  led to unnecessary expenses in seeking medical advice. This has now made me be interested on how we can  improve on our food lygiene to avoid contamination.<br/><br/>\n\nEXAMINATION OF JOLLOF RICE SERVED IN HOTELS FOR PATHOGENIC ORGANISMS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EXAMINATION OF JOLLOF RICE SERVED IN HOTELS FOR PATHOGENIC ORGANISMS", "id": 92}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>BACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH URINARY TRACT INFECTION IN PREGNANT WOMEN AND THEIR ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITY.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Urine Sample  from pregnant  women were analysed for bacteriuria.

This usually begins in week 6 and peaks during week 22 to 24 of pregnancy due to a number of factors including ureteral dilatation, increased bladder Volume and decreased  bladder  tone.  Along with decreased  ureteral tone which contributes to increased urinary stasis and ureterovesical reflux (chaliha et al, 2002). Up to 70% of pregnant women develop glyucosuria, which encouraged bacteria growth in the urine (AI.  Issa, 2009). It may manifest as Asympromatic  bacteriuria (ASB) or symptomic Bacteriuria (SB).  The  prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria UTI has been previously reported to be 2% to 13% in pregnant women (Delzell et al, 2000).  Compared with that of symptomatic Bacteriuria in (UTI) which occur in 1-18% during pregnancy. Urinary tract infection (UTI) during pregnancy may cause complications such as Pyelonephritis, hypertensive disease of pregnancy, anaemia, chronic renal failure premature delivery and foetal mortality.<br/>(Dwyer, et al 2002). The incidence of these complications can be decreased by treating promptly Asymptomatic Bacteriuria (ASB) and Symptomatic (SB) during pregnancy due to the potential adverse sequelea of Urinary tract infection in pregnancy. Most  clinic perform routine urinalysis of midstream urine specimen  during one or more antenatal clinic (ANC) visits (Smaill 2007). However, culture and antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing are needed for  surveillar purposes  to guide the clinician on the proper management and prevent empirical  treatment of pregnant women with (ASB) and  (SB).<br/> A limited spectrum of organisms cause UTI and these include Escherichia Coli, which accounts  for the majority of uncomplicated urinary tract infection Isolates.  (crupta, et al, 2001). Others are Staphylococcus Saprophyticus, Klebsiella  Spp, Proteus Spp, Enterococcus  Spp and Enterobacter  Spp (Massinde, , et al  2009).<br/>Data  on the current distribution and antimicrobial Isolates from pregnant women in Tanania is limited .<br/>Urinary tract infections refer to the presence of microbial pathogen within the urinary tract and it is  usually  classified by the infection site, bladder (Cystitis), kidney (Pyelonephritis or urine (Bacteria) and also can be a Asymptomatic or symptomatic  (UTI) that occur in a normal genitourinary tract with no prior instrumentation are considered as “Uncomplication” whereas “Complicated” Infections are diagnosed in genitourinary tracts  that have  structural or functional abnormalities Urethral catheters, and are  frequently asymptomatic  (3,4)  (kriptke, 2005).<br/>It has been estimated    that globally symptomatic  (UTIS) result in as many as 7 millions  visits to out patient  clinic,  1 million visits to emergency departments, and 100,000 hospitalization annually (5) (chin et al 2011).<br/> Many different microorganisms can cause  urinary  tract infection (UTIS),  though the most  common pathogens  causing the  simple ones in the community are Esherichia  Coli and other Enterobacteriacae, which accounts approximately 75% of the isolates (Kebira et al, 2009).<br/>In complicated Urinary tract infections and hospitalized patients,  organisms  such as Enterococcuss Faecalis  and Highly resistant, gram-ve rods including Pseudomoinas Spp.  are comparatively more  common.  The relative frequency of the pathogens varies depending upon age, sex, catheterization and hospitalization.<br/> Urinary tract infection cases is often started empirically an therapy is based on information determined from the antimicrobial resistance pattern of the urinary pathogen. However, a large proportion of uncontrolled antibiotic  usage has  contributed to the emergency of resistant bacterial Infections (7-10). As a result, the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among urinary track has been increasing world wide. (Biadglegene. et al, 2009).<br/>Associated resistance i.e, the fact that a bacterium resistant to one antibiotics is often much more likely to be   resistant to other antibiotics, drastically decreases the chances of getting a second empirical attempt right. Resistance rates to the most  common prescribe drugs used in the treatment of (UTI)  vary considerably  in different areas, world-wide. The estimation of local etiology and susceptibility profile could support the most effective empirical treatment. Therefore, investigating epidemiology of (UTIS), the prevalence risk factors, are bacterial isolates and antibiotics sensitivity is fundamental for care givers and health planner to guide the expected intervention.<br/> OBJECTIVE OF STUDY <br/>The aim of this study was to determine bacterial etiology agent and evaluate their invitro susceptibility pattern to commonly used antimicrobial agents.<br/>To identify the bacteria Isolates<br/>  <br/>\n\nBACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH URINARY TRACT INFECTION IN PREGNANT WOMEN AND THEIR ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITY.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " BACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH URINARY TRACT INFECTION IN PREGNANT WOMEN AND THEIR ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITY.", "id": 93}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE PEEVALENCE OF STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE IN PNEUMONIA PTIENTS IN ENUGU METROPOLI <br/>A CASE STUDY OF UNTH ENUGU.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The prevalence of streptococcus pneumonia in pneumonia patients using university of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH) Enugu as a case study was carried out based on the fact of the pneumonia is one of the commonest afflictions of the aged people and children worldwide.

INTRODUCTION <br/>Bacterial  an  something cause severe infection in children the elderly and other people with weakened immune system is people that are more susceptible to infection because of an overal impairment of the immune response example Hiv infection chronic resease advanced aged and or function of defense mechanisms (example smoking chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) tumours inhaled toxins and aspiration (Stephen 2002).  <br/>The trachea, bronchi and lungs are normally free from communal and potentially pathogenic bacteria, but when their reference  are upset they       are liable to be invaded by organization from the throat or nose (fraser, 1996) one of the commonest infection of the lower respiratory tract is pneumonia (Jawetz, et ,2001). <br/>1.1              PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA <br/>It is known that the inflammation of the lengs is called pneumonia it is pneumonia’s that result in the filling of alveoli with pus and fluid is called pneumonia (Naster et al 2001). Macrophages are numerous in the long issues and reality move into the alveoli and air ways to engaful infection agents,  thus helping to prevent pneumonia from developing but when there is upset of the defense mechanism, causative agents are then likely to enviable the host (Yolande and Broduem 1987). <br/>Pneumonia is an infection caused by different bacterial like streptococcus pneumonia, staphylococcus aureus, pneumococci etc. and in several case can lead to death for instance, William henry Harrison, the with president  of the united states, contracted pneumonia during his inauguration in 1841 and ride after being in office for only 31 days. Other notable persons to succumb to pneumonia include sir Francis bacon in 1626, who died after  staffing chikens with now while conducting freezing experimente and Thomas stonewal Jackson in 1863, whose arm required amputation after he was shot by one of his own sentries (Stephen 2002). Pneumonia is prevalent in cold weather and during raing season. <br/>1.2              CLASSIFICATION OF PNEUMONIA <br/>Pneumonia can be classified into three <br/>-Acute, hospital –acquired <br/>-          Acute, community –acquired <br/>-          Chronic pneumonia  (Inglis 1996) <br/>a).        ACUTE COMMUNITY ACQUIRED:         this is defined as pneumonia whose onset occurs either prior to or immediately after mission to hospital. It is one of the classics of pneumonia that cause death worldwide (Fraser, 1996). <br/>Patients with acute pneumonia usually have cough, chest signs and fever. The cough may or may not be productive of purulent sputum  (Stephen, 2002). The most important consequence of actuate pneumonia is improvement of respiratory function, which should be assessed as a first priority ( Frasch and concopcion, 2000).<br/>b.                  ACUTE HOSPTAL ACQUIRED: This type of pneumonia affects smoker, patient with prior chest disense or following operation (especially thoracis and upper abdominal) and ventillated critically patient (inglis, 1996). The last group have the highest relative risk (Ross, 1994). <br/>c.                   CHRONIC PNEUMONIA: This have a more insidious onset and prolong course than actuate pneumonia. There is no single symptom complex, so the diagnosis is often bused on radiological finding (Frasch and cocaplion, 2002). Cough may productive of parnlent sputum occasionally blood stained. <br/>1.3              CAUSES OF PNEUMONIA <br/>Cause for the development of pneumonia are extrinsic or intrinsic and various bacteria causative against exist (Nester et al 2001).<br/>Extrinsic factor include exposure to a causative agent pulmonary irratante, or direct pulmonary injury, while intrinsic  factor are related to the host. <br/>In  most cause, the primary infection is casued by qa virus eg Rhinovirus, Adanovirus etc. but there is often a secondary infection with a bacteria pathogen from the upper respiratory tract, most ommon is streptococcus pneumonia Gawatz et al, 2001) the streptococcus pneumonia also know as pnumococcus appears to be the primary cause of many cases of pneumonia, particularly ldorar and bronche pneumonia with Homophiles influenza as a frequent co- pathogen (Fraser, 1996) but often these pneumonic infection are triggered by a proceeding viral infection of the upper respiratory tract such as common cold (Wisconsin, 2003). <br/>Other secondary invaders of the lower respiratory tract that can cause pneumonia are staphylococcus aureus, which may cause fatal pneumonia after streptococcus pneumonia (Staphen, 2002). Haemophilus influenza, Kiabsiella pneumonia etc Jawetz at al 2001).<br/>1.4              JUSTIFICATION<br/>Pneumonia infection is one of the major cause of death world wide and the infection is increasing rapidly in Enugu metropolis with streptococcus pneumoniae as the major pathogen (Okafor 1992). Therefore there is need to find out if this virulent organism is actually the primary bacterium that causes premnonia in Enugu metropolis. Although, many persons carry these bacteria harmlessly in their threat, mouth and nasopharyux and these are likely to contaminate the sputum as it is expected through the throat and mouth so as the commensal in nasopharynx which can equally contaminate the nasopharyueal swab (Ross, 1994).<br/>1.5              AIMS AND OBJECTIVE<br/>The aims and objective of this work are: <br/>1.                  To isolate bacterial pathogens form pneumonia patients. <br/>2.                  To ascertain the prevalence of streptococcus pneumonia in pneumonia patient using UNTH as a cast study. <br/>3.                  To determine the aga group and sex that are more susceptible to this infection. <br/>1.6              HYPOTHESIS <br/>Ho streptococcus pneumonia’s causes pneumonia <br/>H1¬ streptococcus does not cause pneumonia <br/>H2 Streptococcus Pneumoniae have insight relationship on sex and age <br/>1.7              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>Streptococcus pneumoniae is regarded as the commonest cause of pneumonia both in children and adults. Other bacteria have also been implicated as the cause of disease in severe case pneumonia can lead 15 death. <br/>1.8              DIAGNOSIS <br/>In pneumonia patients streptococcus pneumoniae and other organisms (Causative pathogens) are diagnosed when they are grown from cultures of sterile fluids such as sputum from adult and nasopherynged swab as in case of children who are unable to produce sputum the clinical  presentation varies from the mildly to extremely ill patients (Wisconsin 2003). Straptococcue pneumonia and other causative bacteria can be isolated from specimens when cultured on blood agar and chocolate agar plates.

Poultry has so  many advantages over other domesticated animal whose production is very much hindered by lack of money, high temperature, disease and lack of good at certain periods of the year.<br/>            The diseases of poultry is like the disease of other animals may be caused by: a. pathogenic organisms like bacteria and viruses, protozoa, worms and some members of arthropods<br/>b.                  Nutritional deficiency, (c) From wound or cannibalism<br/>The following diseases are usually associated with the fowls locally<br/>1.                  New castle disease<br/>2.                  Chronic respiratory diseases<br/>3.                  Fowl typhoid<br/>4.                  Coccidiosis<br/>5.                  Fowl pox<br/>The incidence of salmonella and Escherida coli simply means the extent to which the enteric organisms (Escherichia coli) that are part of the normal flora and incidentally causes disease and pathogenic organism (salmonella) affect the poultry feeds.  Hill, D.H; and Davis, O.s; (1962).  Shoening et al 1942). Defined diseases as any abnormal condition of the tissue of the body, the cells that make up the various tissue have specific functions to perform. Pekzar et al (1977) defined Salmonell is as a disease of the chick fowl and swim bird cause by some species or Salnaonells. <br/>Anon (1963) described pullorum disease as an  actute infection disease of body chicks caused by salnonella pullorum. Infection is the entering of the  disease produces organisms into the animal. <br/>Livestock (Poultry )gets infected when pathogenic  organisms passes to the susceptible animal through the  through the   following  avenues. Esmat.omar 1977.<br/>1.                  Feeds and contaminated water feed or water containing droppings or waste products of diseased animal will help spread the organisms to fresh hosts.  The feeding troughs and watering vessels aso spread the diseases if not seperated.<br/>2.                  Dropping  or excretes: These material are the gateway out for some stages of oarganisms to go out of the host and get to fresh animal hosts.<br/>3.                  Close contact – some disease spread by contact.  Their agents may be external parasites or air borne in which case nearness to the superior’s birds increase the changes of getting the organisms<br/>4.                  To or event the disease pathogenic organism from getting into the body of poultry, attention should be payed to those factors that influence their infections and spread.  First and foremost, they should have disease resisting stock, provide good shelter, clean range, proper  feeding and practise separating the unhealthy ones from the healthy poultry, quarantining new stock.  In case of poultry, the brooder house should be 30m to 48m from old birds. Such that they gets good feed and sunlight.  They should act be allowed to get in contact with their droppings or excretes since their dropping carry the pathogenic organisms.  Sanitation is very important in poultry management by cleaning of water cans and feed troughs and finally disinfecting the stock to help reduce organic matter.<br/>1.1       JUSTIFICATION<br/>            This study has been justified by the need and safety of consuming children (white meat) which has low cholesterol but rich in protein than beef which has high cholesterol.  Also human beings and the world at large, benefit from our poultry farms where we have the layers (Egg producing Chiks) and the broilers (Heavy chicks) for consumption.<br/>            The poultry (chicken) are rich in protein and amino acid needed for growth.  Livestock feeds are formulated to a ratio for different species and classes of poultry.  These are also feed additive, which may be added to the feed to prevent disease or make animals utilize feed better.  Some ingredient concentrate is added to nourish the feed.<br/>1.2              AIMS AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>1.         To highlight the varius importance of the livestock (poultry) t human and our industries.<br/>2.           To determine the incidence of bacteria infection such as balmonella        <br/>and Escherichia coli which cause health hazard to the poultry    (Chiken).<br/>3.          To isolate and deduce effect of salmonella specie and Escherichia coli <br/>           in livestock (poultry) and their feeds.<br/>4.           To advice poultry farmers on how to preserve and handle their farms  <br/>           feeds from infections diseases to the birds.<br/>HYPOTHESIS<br/>HYP. 10:- Salmonella and Escherichia coli are the major causes of bacteira infection found in livestock (poultry) feeds.<br/> HYP. II: - salmonella only is the infection that effects the livestock (poultry) feeds.<br/> HYP. II0:- Escherichia coli only is the bacteria infection that effects the livestock (poultry) feeds.)<br/>STATEMNET OF PROBLEM<br/> 1.                  poultry feeds are infected during procession by handling, mixing of ingredient and exposing the raw materials and furnished products to the atmospheric micro organism.<br/>2.                  Poultry (birds) are being infected through the consumption of the contaminated feeds and unpurified water<br/>3.                  Also when the healthy and unhealthy birds are fed together from the some feeding trough and water vessels, eventually the pathogenic and the enteric organisms from infested ones may widely spread<br/> <br/>4.                  Salmonella and Escherichia coli as the bacterial organisms effects the essential requirement of the body such as water, carbohydrate, fats, vitamin, minerals and protein thereby reducing the content of the nutrient needed for the food to the palatable and easily digestible<br/>5.                  Consumers (humans) get infected by the in take of uncooked and half done chicken<br/> <br/>\n\nTHE INCIDENCE OF SALMONELLA AND ESCHERCHIA COLI IN LIVESTOCK (POULTRY) FEEDS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE INCIDENCE OF SALMONELLA AND ESCHERCHIA COLI IN LIVESTOCK (POULTRY) FEEDS", "id": 95}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EVALUATION OF MICROORGANISMS ON GARRI AT OGBETE MARKET<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            In the work, samples of Garri obtained from Ogbete market were evaluated for microbial contamination.

The microbial load in the air can raise above toxic level became of some air borne organism and if Garri is kept in such environemnt it will be contaminated.<br/>5.                  Storage for longtime may enhance deterioration.  Keeping Garri in storage room for longtime will affect the nature of the Garri.<br/>1.4              HYPOTHESIS<br/>HO      the Garri on sale at Ogbete market have no microbial lead<br/>Hi        The Garri on sale at Ogbete market have some bacterial load.<br/>15        SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>            This study is based on the fact that Garri which is the staple food of man may caused a lot of harm to his life.  This is due to the unhygienic condition of the environemnt during processingg, storage and further exposure to  the market in which Garri is sold.  These microbes can leads to food poisoning and other intoxication (ailment) which can lead to loss of man power and  loss of life. Therefore this work is to stem down ugly trend which may even affect our socioeconomic life by educating the people that are involved inteh processing, storage and selling of Garri about personnel hygiene on the product and how it can be store.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE EVALUATION OF MICROORGANISMS ON GARRI AT OGBETE MARKET<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EVALUATION OF MICROORGANISMS ON GARRI AT OGBETE MARKET", "id": 96}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF COMMUNITY BANKS IN THE RURAL DEVELOPMENT OF NIGERIA.<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF OGUI COMMUNITY BANK, ENUGU SOUTH L. G. A.)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The community banking scheme has been in operation since December 1990, and has to a large extent achieved its objectives as a vehicle for poverty alleviation at the grassroots’ level. With about 1000 unit community banks and hundreds of thousands of customers, the banking habit has reasonably increased in the rural areas.<br/>The poor farmers, cattle rears, fisher men and artisans who might not have collateral but are hardworking could get loans from their community banks for productive activities thereby boasting the gross domestic products of the country. Since government encouraged the communities to invest in community banks, the scheme should be supported to succeed. It is cheaper way of sustainable development of the rural areas in the short, medium and long term.<br/>However, in examining the problems and prospects of the community bank in the rural development of Nigeria, some prepared Questionnaire were distributed to Ogui Urban Community Bank of Nigeria Ltd. staff in Enugu. Information received from the responses were supplemented with oral interview, personal observation and the review of some related books and journals.<br/>The responses from the returned questionnaire were analyzed and the result of the analysis were later converted into table percentages.<br/>Recommendation were made based on information obtained and some literature reviewed. <br/>Finally, conclusion was drawn on the topic studied.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    Problem Identification and Purpose of Study<br/>1.2    Rationale of the Study<br/>1.3    Significance of the Study <br/>1.4    Background of the Study<br/>1.5    Definition of Terms <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>LITERATURE REVIEW <br/>2.1 Theoretical Review<br/>2.2 Empirical Review<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>RESEARCH DESIGN<br/>3.1 Hypothesis of the Study<br/>3.2 Research Tools and Procedure<br/>3.3 Source of Data<br/>3.4 Limitation of the study<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS<br/>4.1 Presentation of the Data <br/>4.2 Analysis of Data<br/>4.3 Discussion of the Result<br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>Summary, Conclusion and Recommendation <br/>5.1 Summary of the Study<br/>5.2 Conclusion<br/>5.3 a.

Recommendation for Further Studies<br/>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION AND PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The community bank is a financial institution established to carter to the savings and credit needs of small – scale producers throughout the country. Thus, the institution represents the coalescence and modernization of traditional institutions with which most Nigerians are very familiar with, the rotating savings and credit institutions known as “isusu” and the other town union or community development association.<br/>It was clear that inspite of government policy such as the agricultural credit quarantee scheme, conventional commercial banks and even development banking institutions face serious constraints in attending to the credit needs of millions of small producers in which most of whom have no collateral to put down on security.<br/>            The purpose of the study in this research includes:<br/>a.       To evaluate the role of Ogui Community Bank in rural development.<br/>b.      To investigate the problems facing the community banking system with special emphasis on community bank.<br/>c.       To make recommendations for the improvement of community banking system represented by Ogui Community Bank.<br/>1.2       RATIONALE OF THE STUDY<br/>The rationale of the study is aimed at helping researchers to evaluate the role of Ogui Community Bank in rural development.<br/>Thus, they enlighten the community on the effective use of credit and other banking services so as to enhance individual, collective and community production and development. It will help them perform non – banking functions that promote grassroots development  such as supporting individual, co-operatives and group formation activities, assisting clients in marketing of agricultural, rural, industrial and other products.<br/>            Thus, they provide financial and other extension services to clients and other community members.<br/>1.3       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY    <br/>When this project is completed, it will help researchers to work further on areas of development open to community banks.<br/>It will also assist customers of the bank to know the services provided by the bank. Ogui Community Bank Ltd. Could also use it to their own advantage especially with regard to areas where they are lacking.<br/>This study will also help the Community Bank explore other alternatives to improving their services. It will also remind the bank whether they have achieved their mandate.<br/>1.4    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>The historical development of the banking industry in Nigeria shows the initial exclusion of the generality of rural community in the provision of banking services. Government has in those days made several but less successful efforts to encourage the spread of banking services to the rural areas. It is this limited success that led to the realization of the need for a different set of banks to operate within the peculiarities of the rural environment. This led to the introduction of the community banking program in 1990.<br/>Ogui Community Bank of Nigeria Ltd. Thus came into being in july 1992. It is situated at the heart of Ogui New Layout and encourages the development and growth of Ogui Urban community. Most profits made in this bank are re-ploughed back into the community for self – help project. Many other benefits occur to this community by the establishment of this bank.<br/>1.5       DEFINITION OF TERMS  <br/>a.       Community Bank: this is a self sustaining financial institution owned and managed by a community or groups of communities for the purpose of providing credit, deposit, banking and other financial services to its members largely on the basis of their self recognition and credit worthiness. They are established for financing grassroot development in order to build a strong foundation of rural economy and those that benefit from their services are mainly farmers, roadside mechanics, transport operators etc. Other community banks include: Umuchinemere Community Bank, Umueze Community Bank, Ndi – Afia Community Bank and Umuoma Community Bank.    <br/>b.      Bank: a bank is a financial institution duly incorporated to perform banking functions of accepting cash for the purpose of lending or investing money from the public repayable on demand by cheque or cash.<br/>c.       Loan: This is the borrowing out of a sum of money to a customer repayable at an agreed interest by a bank. It is also a separate account on its own whereby the whole sum is granted to the customer is released in a lump, at a time. Individuals and institution can obtain loan from a bank which will be repayed later with the interest agreed.<br/>d.      Credit: They are offered to customer on request when a customer is gives loan by a bank, he is said to be a creditor to the bank.<br/>e.       Profitability: The ability of a bank to make profit from any facility granted. It is the rate of interest charged on loan that determines the profit. <br/>f.       Portfolio: This is a list of securities held by an investor.<br/>g.      Mortgages: A mortgage is a conveyance of land designed to secure the payment of money. It is also a pledge of designated property is security for a loan.   <br/> <br/>\n\nPROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF COMMUNITY BANKS IN THE RURAL DEVELOPMENT OF NIGERIA.\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF OGUI COMMUNITY BANK, ENUGU SOUTH L.

There are a number of locally grown food stuff which easily meet the body’s nutritional needs. The important thing is to have the right combination of these foods in all meals.<br/>Malnutrition is described as the over or under consumption of food nutrient resulting in health disorder malnutrition is usually common even in well - to do families in the developing countries. It affects those individuals who are less knowledgeable of proper nutrition in the developed world.<br/>Over nutrition is the main source of malnutrition in many developed countries. Excessive consumption of fat and carbohydrate food is most often implicated in obesity. Obsessed people are more likely to involve in various disability and life expectancy is reduced.<br/>Many people lack the understanding of the function of food. One of the main aspects of this problems is the general false assumption that “full belly” is all t hat is necessary to provide good health. It is this “full belly” concepts and ignorance that causes many of the nutritional diseases in most countries.<br/>In many developing countries, malnutrition is the single most important public health problem. <br/>A person who is under nourished is more likely to fall victim to an infection diseases than a person of good nutritional status. Measles, diarrhea, tuberculosis, whooping cough is frequently fatal in young children if the child is poorly nourished.<br/>Malnutrition is known to lower the body’s resistance to infection. A malnourished child has a reduced ability both to form antibodies and to produce increased number of white blood cells. (Leucocytes).<br/>Infection makes malnutrition worse and poor intake of the nutrient increase the severity of infections diseases.<br/>Adequately nourished individual can often withstand the attack of parasites but those in a poor state of nutrition cannot.<br/>The effect of malnutrition on susceptibility to infection can affect a body even before it is born.<br/>Recovery of damaged tissue depends on the nutritional status of this subject. The more serious forms of malnutrition which universal among poor families and Nation result from consumption of poor diet over long period of time. This nutritional disorder is often referred as to under Nutrition. Deficiency of carbohydrates and protein in human diet is rare except among poorer families and is responsible for diseases called Kwashiorkor and marasmus were associated with marked cognitive effects.<br/>The predominant type of malnutrition in Latin America has changed dramatically during the second half of this century.<br/>However, this information above is sufficient to alert one of the possible hazard involved in malnutrition which can render man incapacitated in the society he belongs. An adage says “YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT.”<br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF MANAGEMENT ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF MANAGEMENT ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT", "id": 98}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>FUNGI ASSOCIATED D WITH THE SPOILAGE OF COCOYAM (Colocasia esculenta)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/> Fungi associated with the spoilage of cocoyam (Colocasia esculenta) during storage at ambient temperature (28+20c) was investigated in this study. This was done by cutting the damaged portion of the cocoyam tubers and blend with diluents (water) to have even distribution of the microorganism and ensure ease of plating out. This done with the sample and inoculation was done from the 4th test tube on SDA medium and incubated for three to seven days at the temperature 0f 270c.

In Nigeria, Colocasia species are the most important food and the third most important root/tuber crop after yams and cassava (Onwueme, 1978). Besides critical contribution to the national food security and cash  income  producing nations, cocoyam  are also being considered as source of starch for use in biodegradable film materials and for other industrial and pharmaceuticals purposes because of interesting properties of the amylopectin fraction of starch, which is the principal form of cocoyam starch (cecil, 1992).<br/> Cocoyams have very short post harvest storage life of a few days to weeks (Gollifer and Boot, 1973, Ugwunwanyi and Obeta, 1997). Differing and often conflicting reports have been made on the post harvest losses of cocoyam. But it bears nothing that post harvest storage life is often short and biodegradative losses are extensive and up to 100% losses are common due to the fungi which associates with the spoilage of cocoyam during storage condition,  (Onwueme and Charles, 1994),<br/> However, substantial post harvest losses caused  by the fungi associated with the spoilage  of cocoyam tubers during storage is attributed to a number of physical, physiological damage  arising  from harvesting, storage or transportation have  often been implicated as some of the predisposing factors  to cocoyam spoilage or deterioration (Ogundana et al;1970, Snowdon, 1991). Invasion by pathogens either through natural openings or wounds is considered the most critical factor in cocoyam spoilage (Degras, 1993).<br/> A wide range of micro-organisms (Particularly moulds) have been associated with cocoyam decay, relatively few are implicated as primarily pathogens (Aderiye and Ogundana, 1984). The degree of pathogenicity varies and is highly dependent upon storage conditions. It has been stated that fungi take the lead in the spoilage of cocoyam during storage. (Nwufo and Atu, 1987). Under these storage conditions, the fungi which are liable to  attack cocoyam include; Fusarium  solani, Botryodiplodia, theobromae, Rhizopus, stolonifer, Aspergillus  niger, Sclerotium roltsii, Trichoderma hamatum and Pythium species. (Nwufo, 1980,Uwgunwanyi and Obeta, 1996). Another factor also attributed to the spoilage of cocoyam is high respiratory activity. Storage temperature to an optimum of 70C and 85% relative humidity increases the storage time. The crops are usually left in the ground and harvested when need, and there  is a limit to how long the crop can be left in the soil since the corms and cormels sprout and produce new growth, which result  in the cocoyam losing its good values.<br/>Therefore, it has been suggested that November and March /April are the ideal time for harvesting cocoyam. However, due to the difficulties in storage, cocoyam are usually utilized or consumed fresh shortly after harvest because of these fungi which lead to their spoilage during storage, (Passam, 1982, and Onwueme, 1987). The objective of this study is to investigate the fungi associated with the spoilage of post harvest cocoyam during storage at ambient temperature (28 ± 20C).<br/>Cocoyam leaves are consumed as green or dry vegetables and the stem is either cooked or eaten on its own or together with other dietary staples or pound into flour. The leaves are consumed because they are rich in protein and vitamins while the roots is rich in carbohydrates and minerals, (Duru and Uma, 2002).<br/>Large quantities of carbohydrate-rich solid waste are produced in the course of processing cormels into starch and this constitute a waste disposal problem, (Duru, 2000).<br/>The changing economic, social, political and cultural values of the world have challenged all countries to efficiently use their resources.<br/>In Cameroon, two types of cultivated cocoyam varieties can be differentiated based on the colour of the flesh. The white –flesh cultivar or white cocoyam is the main cultivated variety because of its early maturation (6-(months) and high yield. In addition, the white cocoyam is most preferred in diet because of its excellent taste. The pink-flesh variety or red cocoyam is rarely grown because of its long maturation process (12-16months) Despite its importune, white cocoyam is highly susceptible to cocoyam    root  with attendant yield losses &gt; 90%.  In contrast, fields observations by farmers revealed that the red cocoyam has a certain degree of field tolerance against the cocoyam root rot   disease, (Tambong, 2000).<br/><br/>\n\nFUNGI ASSOCIATED D WITH THE SPOILAGE OF COCOYAM (Colocasia esculenta)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FUNGI ASSOCIATED D WITH THE SPOILAGE OF COCOYAM (Colocasia esculenta)", "id": 99}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>GASTROENTERITIS IN PRIMAY SCHOOL CHILDERN IN ENUGU METROPOLIS (6 – 12 YRS)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>A total of fifty faecal samples were collected form pupils in airport primary school Emene Enugu were used for the study.

Many microorganisms contaminating food and water can cause acute gastroenteritis. In most cases it runs its own course over several (days. However it can be a serious condition if the fluid loss is sever enough to cause dehydration. When food is the source of the pathogen the condition is often called food  poisoning (Archeson 200) <br/>Gastroenteritis can arise in two ways the microorganisms may actually produce a food borne infection, that is, they may first colonize the gastrointestinal tract and grow within it, then either invade host tissues or secrete exo- toxins (Johnson, 1999). <br/>Alternatively the pathogens may secrete an exo- toxins that contaminates the food and is ingested by the host. This is some times reffered to as food intoxication because the toxins ingested and the presence of the living microorganisms is not required. Because theses toxins of the disrupt the functioning  of intestinal mucosa they are called enterotoxins (Sanders and sanders 1997) <br/>Most cases of gastroenteritis are due to viral infection about a half are caused by the rotavirus, first discovered and described at the royal children’s Hospital university of Melbourne in the early 1970 various other  virus may cause the same symptoms as well as bacteria like campylobacter protozoa and helminthes. In most cases the precise infective agent is not identified. It is only when symptoms are persisting that stools are sent for microscopy and culture in the laboratory (Nachamkin 1992).<br/>On a global scale gastroenteritis is a massive health problem. About 5 million people die each year, mainly young children in underdevloped countries most deaths are due to dehgdration, in adequate fluid replacement and cirulatory collapse. In Australia, Asia, African and South America an occasional fatality still occurs with gastroenteritis again mainly due to complication of sever dehydration A rotavirus vaccine has been developed in Australia and may eventually have  extensive world wide application (Prescott et al 2005).<br/>The main symptoms of gastroenteritis are vomiting diarliea and cramping abdominal pain. Sometimes of fever may also be present. In more severe cases, signs of dehydration may appear a young child may look floppy  and pale and  the   urine out put may be reduced. these signs means that urgent medical assessments and treatment are required.  <br/>1.1              AIMS  AND OBJECTIVES <br/>-                      to determine the prevalenble of gastroenteritis  in primary  school children <br/>-                      also to implicate in gastroenteritis . <br/>-                      to relate the environment of the pupil to the types of diseases which they acquire from it. <br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS <br/>There are factors in the environment which iduce pior sanitation and the filthy habits of the children ideal for transmission of gastroenteritis, therefore infection rate is expected high. <br/>1.3              HYPOTHESIS <br/>H0 -      prevalence of gastroenteritis caused by bacteria and protozoa is common in primary school children <br/>H1 -      Although environment favours infection prevalence is not common in primary school children .<br/><br/>\n\nGASTROENTERITIS IN PRIMAY SCHOOL CHILDERN IN ENUGU METROPOLIS (6 - 12 YRS)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " GASTROENTERITIS IN PRIMAY SCHOOL CHILDERN IN ENUGU METROPOLIS (6 - 12 YRS)", "id": 100}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>FUNGI ASSOCIATED D WITH THE SPOILAGE OF COCOYAM (Colocasia esculenta)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/> Fungi associated with the spoilage of cocoyam (Colocasia esculenta) during storage at ambient temperature (28+20c) was investigated in this study.

According to him, legally, the whole thickness of the skin must be broken, and creating an internal injury wound.  Is also a breach of a coetaneous, mucous or serious surface (Charles 1979). Wound can also be defied as injury to the skin or underlying tissues or organs by a blow or cut, missile or stab which includes injury to the skin caused by chemicals,  cold, friction, heat, pressure and rays, and manifestation in the skin of internal conditions such as pressure sure and ulcers (Roper 1989).<br/>            Wound sepsis is the infection of wound by phylogenic organisms (Roper, 1989).  Wounds can be divided into Many types which includes (a) Incised wounds:  which are produced by sharp scuttling instruments (There is aponeuetic fascia of the scalp and most operations wounds are of a this category, Lacerased wounds which may be produced in category, Lacerased wounds which may be produced in road accidents, by factory machinery.  This type of wound is frequently contaminated and it supplies an excellent culture medium for microorganisms.  There is more pain than in an incised wound but bleeding may not be severe due to constriction of blood vessels.  Punctured wound which may be inflicted by sharp instrument, nails, edge’s teeth, knives and bullets.  These wounds are specially susceptible to injection from anaerobic organisms as those causing tetanus and gas gangrene which start thriving when the aerotic organisms such as staphylococcus and streptococcus have used up the available oxygen in the deep tissues.<br/>            Poisoned wounds are those which occurs as a result of insect strings, snake bites and dog bites and the inject bites produce swelling.  Irritation and dis-comfort caused and devitalized wounds are those that result for  industrial and severe road accidents and the area and depth of devitalized tissue depends upon the area and weight of the coushing force and the duration and velocity of impact.<br/>Burns and scalids which results from the destruction of tissue by dry heat fraction, electricity radiation or corrosive fluid while scald results from the destruction of tissue by mist heat.  Bruise and confusion is a superficient injury without damage to the skin and the swelling, pain and dis comfort are dye to the extra-vacation of blood into tissues.  Colour changes occur as a result of the moglobin oxidatron.<br/>Haematoma is the collection of blood in the tissues which causes a swelling which when pressed on surrounding structures, the haemotoma become readily injected by micro-organism<br/>Sprain is another wound type which involves the tearing of the capsule and ligaments round a joint with subsequent exudation of fluids.<br/>Wounds  cab further be classified into clean wounds with the amount of contamination being up 30% or more in dirty wounds.  The class I (clean) wounds which are non traumatic with no break in surgical technique without any septic folus or viscera being opened.  Classs II (clean contaminated) wounds are non traumatic, with only minor breaker own in technique being allowed orentry into a vucous without significant spillage.  The class III (contaminated) are traumatic wounds froma relatively clean source, or with a major break in technique or significant spillage from an open viscous, or when acute non- purulent infection is encountered.  Class IV (dirty) wounds are frammatic wounds from a dirty source following delayed treatment or when acute bacterial contamination and releases of pus occur.<br/>Micro organism of clinical importance can be isolated from wounds and they include Achinomyces species.  Bacteriodes species, clostridium perfringes, Eschericha coli, other gram negative enteric bacilli, my cobacterium species, pseudomonas aerug, nwa proteus vulgaaris, staphlococcus aureus. Stapholococcus epidermis stretococcus faecalis, clostridium fetani (Fischachi, 1987)<br/>Wound sepis depends on the opportunities for infection in different parts of the body which in turn depends on the normal bacteria flora of the part, the size of the wound, duration of the operation increase in the length of stay in the hospital and can even result in patients death<br/>1.1       COMPLICATION<br/>             Complication arising from wound sepsis are suppurations which results when there is an  imbalance between the infective agent on one hand and the defensive reaction on the other.  The other complications are cellulite which is characterized by a spreading infection, necrosis and sloughing; septicemia, pyaemia and kaolin formation chilling worth et al 1979).  Others that can also result from wound sepsis are gas gangrene, clostridia mystics, clostridical crepitate celluslitis which is a type of mixed infection usually found as a complication of wounds characterized by necrosis of the aveolar and fascia tissues with progressive gangrenous changes in the skin secondary in thrombosis or nutrient vessels repetition of the wound result from the formation of gas by the bacteria synergistic gangrene which is a mixed infection caused by the synergistic action of the acrobic hemolytic staphylococcus aurous and micro Europhilic haemolytic streptococcus also occur as a senous complication peritonitis, perforation and absences formation are other complications.  Wound sepsis can be complicated by mixed infection in which yeast and often fungal infection are involved (sabistan 1981) .  other complications are diabetic micro antipathy which involves the small vessels and capillaries an further complicate diabetes Nellutus.<br/>            Distinct and definitive thickening of the usement member inflammatory changes occur lading to the impairment of the resistant of the skin to secondary infections and delay the rate of healing following injures.  Arkrosclerosis is another major complication of diabetes mellitus.  Corponary Vessels are affected producing myscardid infection are the  vessels of the lower extremities producing gangrene of the toes and feets.  The precipitating causes of gangrene of the lower extremities resulting in ulceration, infliction and subbasement gangrene..<br/>            In the case of sickle cell disease leg ulcers, there is general reduction in the oxygen carrying capacity of blood resulting.  In tissue dypoxia  and parenthesis of the extremities occurs but although certain compensatory adjustment of the circulation occur the patients can become immemorially compromised in cases of secondary infections due to blocking of small vessels by sickled cells and infare of bones and joints which enhances the continued preponderance of any infecting organism (Anderson 1985).<br/>            This work is therefore an attempt to investigate bacteria associated with infection of wounds noting their differences .  in distribution peltern, age range 10-2) years, (3-5) years, (6-8) years (9-11) year (12-14) years, (15-17) years, (18-20) years and 21 years and above, sex distribution (male and female) predisposing factor and any other factor affecting in Nigeria where antibiotic sensitivity pattern especially in Nigeria where drugs are takes indiscriminately without prescription<br/>1.2              AIM &amp; OBJECTIVES<br/>a.                   The aim of this work is to isolate and identified bacteria associated with wound sepsis<br/>b.                  And the objectives are to assess whether any correlation exists between age, sex and different types of wound.<br/>2.c       To assess the antibiogram of different bacteria associated with wound sepsis so as to offer advice on therapy.<br/>1.3       STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>            Wound sepsis has really posed a serious threat to both surgical and un-surgical wounds.  There has been prevalence in wound sepsis following iyunes and fome disease state, and may have failed to heal after administration of common antibiotics resulting to foul smelling and petrifying wounds owing to their discriminate use of drugs especially in togena.<br/>            This  problems really propelled met know whether it is because efln discriminate use of dmgs that contributed to sensitive organisms to become resisted string to the drugs or could it be because of mosconical injection which comes bystaying very long in the hospital.

However, from practical experience in tropical obstetrics it is generally accepted that anaemia in pregnancy Exist when the Haemoglobin level is less than in loglde or the packed cell volume less than 30%<br/> EPIDEMOOGY:<br/>            Anaemia in pregnancy presents a world-wide problem but it is uncommon in developed world.  the importance of anaemia in pregnancy in the tropics lies firstly in its greatly increased incidence, and secondly in the seventy of the anaemia with which the patients commonly present for treatment.  Both combine to make this complication of pregnancy a major cause of matanal and fetal death in the tropics.  A third important problem  posed by anaemia in the tropics is polymorphism.  In almost all cales, the anaemia is caused by multiple factors whole individual importance varies from area to area.  This makes rational prophylaxis and treatment much more difficult.  Complicaion of pregnancy in the for at belt of West Africa, between January and April 1955.  it was directly responsible for more than 20% of all matanal deaths in patients under the car of the Department of obstetrics, university college Hospital, Ibadan.  It also contributed to many other deaths from Antepartum haemorrhage, postpartum haemorrhage and puerperal sepsis.  In Nigeria it is a frequent complication, its incidence is high and its severity is staggering.  The clinical feathers of anaemia in pregnancy in Nigeira are different from those encountered in temperate countries not only because of the severity of symptoms but also because of the concomitant autuminosis such as marked glossitis, Angular stomatitis and associated gross hepatomegly.  Agbola A. (1991)<br/>CLASSIFICATION<br/>            Anaemia in pregnancy could be mild, moderate or severe based on the haemoglobin level in the peripheral blood as well as the clinical manifestations and the management would differ for each.<br/>TYPES OF ANAEMIA                   HB LEVEL<br/>Mild Anaemia in pregnancy    9-Hg/dl<br/>Moderate Anaemia in pregnancy 7-9g/dl<br/>Severe Anaemia in pregnancy 7g/dl<br/>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY<br/>            For haemoglobin and Red blood cell synthesis, iron, folate, vitamin Biz and Vitamin c, trace elements like cobate and copper, and proteins are required. Erythroporetin produced by the renal parenchyma stimulates the bone marrow to increase erthropesis which is one of the noticeable physiological changes in pregnancy.  Barnes, F.C (1994).<br/>            In the non-pregnant female, the total body is about 3.5-kg. 2/3 of this is Haemoglobin another ¼ is in the body stores and the remaining is in the tissue and plasma.  Iron is stored in the liver and spleen as femitin and in bone marrows haemosiderin.  Iron in the serum is bound to transfer in, a B1 – globulin and transfers is only 1/3 saturated with iron.  A good diet provides about 10-15mg of iron per a day and only 10% of this is absorbed.  Iron is mainly absorbed in the duedenuim and to some extent in the upper jejunum.  The absorption is influenced by dietary phosphates, phytaces, ascorbic acid, sugars especially frutole, Hell in the stomach and gastric factors namely factors I, II and II, iron is lost in the bile, urine, fences, sweat and during menstruation.  About 1-2mg of iron is lost daily.<br/>            In normal pregnancy, iron demand is increased many folds.  The fetus need about 350mg, the placenta about 100mg:  the increased material haemoglobin mass about 350mg and that from lactation about 150mg.  In adding the pregnant women still excretes iron but on the credit side about 225mg of iron is available as a result of the amenorrhea of pregnancy is about 15%.  The increased iron requirement is not uniformly spread over the  period of pregnancy but as pregnancy advances from 28 weeks onwards,  the increased demand is noticed as a resultant drop in PCV or HB concentration it no iron supplementation has been given Abidu, O, Sofola (1990).<br/>COMPLICATIONS<br/>            In the absence of effective treatment, anaemia develops progressively as the pregnancy advances.<br/>The following complications may occurs;<br/>I.          CONGESTIVE CARDIA FAILURE:  This is the main effect of anaemia muscle oxygen lacse.  The most dangerous period is during the first 12 hours after delivery.<br/>II.                SHOCK: Severely anaemic women readity go into shock as a result of very small amount of blood loss and motality in such patients.<br/>TREATMENT<br/>            This disease cannot be cured, but can be managed for some extent.  Air travel during pregnancy should be avoided, especially in unpressurised air crafts sinle the resultant anorexic may cause splenic or other vital organ infection of anaemic pregnant women in our environment should be examined for worms and ova of hookworm.  However infestation of hookworm can be prevented by good food and personal hygiene and also protecting the slein from penetration for the worms by wearing fast wears.<br/>            Blood transfusion is given with caution in cases where the anaemia is severe, that is HB less than 5g/dl or PCV less than 5% or in cases where moderate anemia co-existing with seplis or Haemorrhage is discovered late after 36 weeks or in labour or immediate pos-partum<br/>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>The project work is aimed at the following:<br/>1.         To determine the haemoglobin level (HB) packed cell volume  (PCV) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of pregnant women.<br/>To determine the significance of age, educational level, occupation, severity and gestational age to the occurance of anaemia in pregnancy.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>1.         Most pregnant women in the rural area prefers to go to farm rather than going to atenantal, so as a result can become anemic because they are not enlightened about their nutritional intake.<br/>2.                  Because the foetus in the feeds more during 3rd trimester, so a pregnant women can appear healthy while she is anaemic, the only way to dectate such case is during laboratory test (HB, PCV, ESR) etc.<br/>  <br/><br/>\n\nANAEMIA IN PREGNANCY\r\n(A CASE STUDY OF PREGNANT WOMEN ATTENDING ANTENATAL CLINIC AT UNIVERISTY OF NIGERIA TEACHING HOSPITAL.

render corn (zea mays) unpalatable and unsafe.  Fungi spoilage is caused by two factors, (biotic) living which includes insects, birds, rodents and microorganisms and (non-biotic) non-living which includes temperature, humidity and time.  Two samples of spoilt corn, red (treated) and white were taken from the store respectivly for investigation to ascertain the microorganism associated with the spoilage of the corn.  Attention was focused on fungi.  Different methods were used in the identification and five genera were isolated.  Mucor spp occurred with a frequency of approximately 6%, Aspergillus spp 9%, Rhizopus spp 15%, Penicillium spp 33% and Fusarium spp. 36%.  Fusarium spp was most frequent in occurrence in both samples. <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0       INTRODUCTION<br/>What food is more synonymous with summon than freshly picked corn on the cob?  Corn grows in “ears, each of which is covered in rows of kernels that are then protected by the silk-like threads called “corn silk” and encased in a husk. Corn is known scientifically as Zea Mays.  This moniker reflects its traditional name, Maize, by which it was known to the Native Americans as well as many other cultures throughout the world.  Although we often associate corn with the colour yellow, it actually comes in host of different varieties featuring an array of different colors, including red, pink, black, purple and blue.  Although corn is now available in markets years round, it is the locally grown varieties that you can purchase during the summer months that not only tastes the best but are usually the least expensive (Pitt and Hocking, et al., 2009).<br/>From the time when primitive man began to cultivate crops and store food, spoilage fungi have demanded their tithe.  Fuzzes, powders and slimes of white or black, green, orange, red and brown are signs of silently invading, acidifying, fermenting, discoloring and disintegrating microbes rending commodities unpalatable or unsafe (Pitt and Hocking 2002). Pitt and Hocking 2009, also stated that in a prophetic article warned of the danger from common spoilage fungi.  Since 1960, a seemingly endless dream of pathogenic fungi discovered.  On these ground alone, the statement “it is only a mould” is no longer acceptable to microbiologist, health inspectors or consumers.  The demand for accurate identification and characterization of food spoilage fungi has become urgent.  <br/>This research work is focused on corn and its spoilage organisms.  It set out to document current knowledge on the interaction of corn and fungi in the context of spoilage.  Area covered are how the fungi is isolated using the suitable best media and identification of corn spoilage fungi.  Mycologist develops preference and peculiarities of the type of fungi that are routinely grown.  Media will affect colony morphology and color whether particular structures are formed or not, and may affect whether the fungus will be even in culture (Hunt et al, 2004).<br/>1.1    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>          Corn (Zea Mays) is a grain grown by farmers in various parts of the world especially in Africa.  Its spoilage most times limits its availability to consumers and causes economic waste to farmers. Corn is mostly spoiled by fungi.  The identification and characterization of these spoilage organisms will go a long way to profer solution on matter how little to this problem of corn spoilage.<br/>1.2       AIMS/OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>To microbiologically evaluate and identify fungi involved in corn spoilage using maize as case study.<br/>1.3       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>The study will help in the acquisition of the knowledge of fungi associated or involved in the spoilage of corn, factors that enhance spoilage of corn and the risk involved in the consumption of spoilt corn. <br/><br/>\n\nISOLATION IDENTIFICATION AND CHARATERIZATION OF FUNGI ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPOILAGE OF CORN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ISOLATION IDENTIFICATION AND CHARATERIZATION OF FUNGI ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPOILAGE OF CORN", "id": 104}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ISOLATIOIN AND CHARACTERISATION OF BACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH HAWKED SUYA- MEAT  <br/>(CASE STUDY OF ENUGU). <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This project work is carried at the isolation and characterization of pathogenic bacteria from hawked suya meat,  were bought in full from the sellers and was collected in raps of aluminum foil.

It is that part of animal that provides major source of protein in west African food. <br/>There are different types of meat from different types of animals, eg pork meat (pig) multon (goat) beef (cow).<br/>Meat can be served as prepared meat product eg corn beef, fried meat, cooked meat and suya, meat (smoke meat). Meat is perishable  food and its composition is ideal for the growth of wide range of spoilage bacteria. Public concern has vison due to numerous food scandals such as those  surrounding bovine spongiform encephalopathy and roof and mouth disease epidemics and food borne disease which remain substantial burden . we can meet those challenges with an improved and global food safety control system. One possible improvement would be a repid and accurate detection system for microbial spoilage. This technique should  ideally also be non destructive  and give result in real time for application in highly automated food  processing environment.<br/>Suya meat is produced by smoking the raw beet with the addition of some syices, salt, oil, groundnut cake and flavors. The meat is first sliced into  smaller pieces and the spices are rubbed onto it, it is  later oven driedor over local source of heart.

Trichomonas vaginalis is a pear-shaped, flagellaatic, motile protogoa, with an undulating membrance.  It is about 10-20 Hm wide, and oxide. The organism is propelled by four anterior flagella with a  flagellium attached to an undulating membrance (Heine, 1993).  I. Vaginalis is a eukaryrote, anaeobic and does not  contain mitochoria in its cytop[lasm but instead contains specialized granules called hydrogenosomes throguh out the region of the cytoplasm with a slender posteriorly protruding regid rod called axostyle (Nester, est el, 2001 and Rultyle, 1983).  I. Vaginalis exist only as a trophozoile and do not take o a cyst from (Lossick, 1990).  Due to the organism’s unique energy metabolism,s the organism bears a strong resemblance to anaerobic bacteria (Petriu, 1998).  In wet mount preparation of vaginal secretions, the live organism can often be recognised by its unmistakably swaying motion (Nester et al, 2001).  I. Vaginalis grows best under anearobic conditions and at elevated PH levels.  Masimum growth and metabolic functions are greatest at PH of 6.0 (Spence, 1992) In accord with its anaerobic state, sthese interesting cytoplasmic double –bounded organelles (hydrogenosomes) remove the carboxyl group (CooH) from pyruvate and trasnfer electrons to hydrogen gas (Nester et al, 2001).  I. Vaginalis derives its glucose into oseccinate, acelate, malate, and hydrogen.  In addition it produces some carbondioxide but nost via the kreb cycle pathway (Dyall and Johnson, 2000).<br/>            I. vaginalis causes sexually transmitted inecxtion (STI) called Trichomoniasis.  This infection is the most common nonviral sexually transmistted disease in the world.  Trichomoniasis, sometimes referred to as “Trich” is primarily an infection of the urogenital tract,. Which infects both men and women.  The urethra is the most common site for I. Vaginalis infection in men.  The organism can aslo be detected in the epididymis, semen and urine (Krieger, 1981). I. Vaginalis was first located in prostatie secretions from husbands of infected women (Drummond, 1936).  In women, vagina is the most, common site of the infection the organism may be isolated from the cervix, vagina, bartholins glands, bladder and occasionally.  The upper sreproductive / urinary tract (Reing, 1990).  Over 95% of infections have been isolated from vagina and only 5% from the urinaryu tract of adult women (Grys, 1964) the urethra and skene’s glands are infected in 90% of cases.  There have also been instances where organisms were isolated from bladder urine (Thoniason, 1989).  Infected men are usually asymsptomatic carriers of the organisms (Krieger, 1995) which most symptomatic I.Vaginalis infection occur in women (Wolner- Hanssen, 1989).  It ranks third after bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis among the diseases that commonly cause vaginal symptoms (Nester, et al, 2001).  According to World Health Organisation’s annual, estimates, There are an estimated 7.4 million trichomoniasis cases each year in the united states, with over 180 million cases reported world wide  (Weinstock et al, 2004).  WHO in 1999 states that the infection rates have been reported by some researchers to be as high as 67% in Monogolia in 1988 (Schwebke, et al, of 40 – 60% in Africa and 40% in indigenous Australians.  Trichomoniasis rates are also high in inner city populations in the united states.  I . vaginal is was originally considered a commensal until in the 1950s when the understanding of its role as a sexually transmitted infection began to involve (Swygard, et al, 2004).  Trichomoniasis often leads to vaginitis, an acute inflammatrory disease of genital mucosa.<br/>            This infection is associated with preterm delivery, low birth weight and increase in infant mortality.  It also pre-disposes individuas to HIV/AIDS and cervical cancer (Cohen, 2000 and Upcroft and Upcroft, 2001).  Among both women and men, I. Vaginalis is emerging as one o the most important factors in transmission and acquisition of HIV infection (Sorvillo, 1998).  In women, the health complications include increased  risks for the following, infertility, development of a typical pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infection following gynecologic suggery and cervical inflammatory neoplasia.  There have also been high rates of correlation between trichonioniasis and pregnancy complication in women (Cotch, 1997). In men, I vaginals has been linked to main factor in infertility and as a common cause of non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) in men (Sch webke 2002, and soper, 2004).  Minkoff, et al (1984) identified a strong association between I vaginalis infection and prefern rupture of membrane.  Several studies have showns I. Vaginalis to be a rish factor for tubal infertility (El-Shazly, 2001).  Sorvillo (1998) states that I.Vaginalis may amplify HIV – I transmission by increasing subceptibity in an HIV-1 negative person and the infectiousness in an HIV-1positive patient. He further stats that I. Vafinalis is emerging as one of the most important cofactor in  amplifying HIV transmission particularly in African American Communities in the united state (Sorvillo, 2001).  The association of trichomoniasis with HIV amplification is seen among men as well (Hobbs, 1999).  I. Vaginalis has a significantly increased incidence of HIV transmission (Jackson, et al, 1998). I vaginalis elicits an aggressive local cellular immune response with a heavy influx of target cells in HIV. This response may increase a seronegative individual. Conversely in an HIV-seropisitive individual, punctuate haemorrhages,  That are frequently associated wit I vaginalis infection, increased shedding and subsequent transmission of the virus (Cohen, et al, 1997).<br/>            In women, the infection is often characterised by vaginal i.e a thin foamy yellow – green, frothy vaginal discharge, vaginal odour, sometimes macodoros, pains with sexual intercourse, pain with urination and vulvovaginal sorness (Itching) (Rein, 1990, and Nester et al, 2001). (Common clinical signs include vulva erythema, inflammation excess of white blood cells seen on a wet mount preparation of vaginal discharge, numerous polymorphonuclear nuetrophils (Similar in size with Trichomonads) and occasional red blood cell (Rein, 1980), motile trichomonads in the wet mount preparation and a vaginal PH above 5.0, most of which overlap with Baterial vaginosis (Rein, 1984, and Wolner-Hassen, 1989).  The wall of the vagina and vulvu are diffusely red and slightly swollen (Nester et al, 2001). I vaginalis infection is a persistant disease of genitourinary tract, characterised with foul odour, serve cases, puncstuate or scattered pinpoint haemorrhagos are present.  It may also cause preumonies bronchitis (public Health Agency of Canada. (PHAC) 2001, and MC Laren, et al, 1983).  These symptoms usually appear within four to twenty days of exposure.  In men, the infection is more difficult to detect as the majority of infections remain a symptomatic and readily available diagnotic techniques are inadequate this is problematic since long tewrm carriage of I vaginalis in a symptomatic men have been documented up to 4 months (Kreiger, 1993).  Most men seeking treatment do so because of htier infected partners (Hager, 1994).  Up to 50% males are usally a symptomatic with the organism persisting in their prostate gland or seminal vesicles (Krieger, 1995).  Symptoms in men typically include Urethral discharge, dysuria, mild prurities licting burning after intercourse (Kreiger 1995, and Latif, 1987).  These may casue Urethritis, prostatis, reversible sterility and semen PH is 78.1 – 8.0 (Gopalkrishnan, 1990).  This changes have been attributed to the mechanical trauma by the moving protozoa, but toxins or exotoxins have not be ruled out by the organism.  The  frothy discharge is probably due to gas produced by the organism (Nester, et al, 2001).<br/>            The life cycle of I. Vaginalis is still poorly understood.  The trophozoite lives in close association with the epithelia of the urogenital tract (Latif et al, 1987) and reproduces by longitudinal binary fission (Nester et al. 2001). I vaginalis is distributed world wide as a human parasite and has no other reserviors (Nester et al, 2001) the mode of transmission is by intimate or direct copntact with vaginal and urethral discharges of infected persons during sexual intercourse rarely occurs by intimate contact with contaminated articles.  The highest rate of infection with multiple sex partners and congenital infection is possible (That is from infected mother to infant at child birth althought infrequent).  New born girls can acquire the infection from their infected mothers through birth canal.  In such cases, the infection tends to remain a symptomatic unstil puberty (Nester et al, 2001, Bradley, et al, 1993 and public Health Agency Canada (PHAC) 2001).  The organism can survive for hours on moist objects such as damp towels clothes and bathtubs of infected women (Lossick, 1989 and Nester et al, 2001).  Nonsexual transmission is extremely rare sine i. Vaginalis infection is generally rstricted to a specific sites namely the urogenital tract Ithomason (1989).  The only known nonviral form of transmission is through perinatal acquisition.  Approximately 5% of female babies born of infected mothers contract the infection (Bramley, 1976).  Nevetheless, I. Vaginalis infection in children should at least raise the question of sexual abuse and p[ossible exposure to other sexually transmitted diseases (Nester et al, 2001). Evidence for sexual transmission of I. Vainalis is very strong as prevalence is highest among patients with increased sexual acitivity and mul;tiple partners.  Approximately 14-65% of male partners of infected females are also infected (Krieger, 1995, and Sena, 2003).  The incubation period before symptoms arise is 4-28 days and years for persistat infection (PHAC, 2001).  There is high percentage of a sympstomatic carriers especially among men and this fosters tranmission of the disease (Nester et al, 2001).  Asymptomatic infected individuals factors in trichomoniasis transmission.  Many studies have shown that treatment of the male partner (s)  of infected women improves bsoth cure rates and recurrence rates (Hager, 1980 and lyng, 1981).<br/>AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>1.                  To determine the prevalence of I.

Barkey is a well know cereals for beer production due to some great advantage it has over other cereals but because of economic reasons other cereals like sorghum as many also in use for production. <br/>The effect of major adjust in  sorghum grain in beer production during which many is used a adduct to increase the carbohydrate content this carbohydrate is hydrolyzed to usable simple sugar during mashing which is later formatted by yeast (saacharonyces cerevisian) to production beer these are various  type of alcoholic beverage some of which are  as follows ales British beer and ates are described in many different ways in trade by this public some of the also are of wild bitter hight   pale and scorch.<br/>ii.                  stout. This is heavier type of beer in which well orated bardy or Walt or caramelized sugar is used Oatmed type stout is another special type main by the addition of a proportion of ostmed. <br/>iii.                Lager beer: The main difference between  also stomata companies with layer is the formation process. In that for ales and stout compared with lager is the fermentation processed. In that for ales and stout the yeast used is sarcharomyces cereisice and to formations is involved while sacharomyes carlsbergensis is used in lager and  bottom fermentation is involved and lager beers more highly  hopped than also and stout. Further the marshy  force of ales and stout  is carried out by an infusion process where as for larger a decoction process is used iv porter beer this is a weaker form of the stout now mainly brewed in treland it is saw to have derived it name from the fount that it was a popular drink of porter but in England the ordinary mild also have large superseded it . in beer production four technological processes we involved. They are as follow: malting mashing boiling wort and formation. Malting is the controlled germination process concerned with the modification of the grains that is the liberation of starch granle  from the  of endosperm cell and subsequent biosynthesis and digression of starch and protein by enzyme which     wh9ich become activate during germination Aisen (1980) Malting loses of nutrient are encountered during steeping and respiration of the grains. In modern malting practices malting loses are highly controlled due to the use of better quality  more inform and more easily modified quality sorghum grains. Mac fadden and Clayton (1989) reported the best result in work have been achieved with short grain Kara and farafora varieties of white sorghum  . Malting losses of 20-30% have been recorded after 5 day of germination. <br/>To elevate the nutrient status of the malted sorghum cereal adjuncts are used during mashing the net action of the amylase during malting is to digest the small starch Grammies preferentially. But the main activity of the analyses take place during mashing. <br/>Mashing can be defined as the conversion of barley malt or other sources of malt or cereal adjunct by complement of enzyme ranging from proteolytic to amylolytic enzyme into fermentable extract suitable for yeast growth and ultimately for beer production. Manner (1982) Cereal adjuncts may often a cheg and high yielding source of extract relative to malt. Briggs (1971) found  out that extract yields could be obtained from small scale mashes (50g totalk grist) with grist comprising 70% malt and 30% extrude barley wheat or maized under temperature programmed condition.  <br/>Masher counting extruded cereal adjunct frequently show  poor work filtration and high value of work viscosity supplement of industrial enzymes to mashes coutainbing extruded cereal adjunct may improve work filtration and lower work viscosity.<br/>Work is a product of filtration after mashing. The residence of the filtration is called spent grains. Work is therefore subjected to boiling to achieve several objectives. Fermentation is an important step in beer production and it’s major concern is the production of ethanol and carbondioxide form this conversion of fermentable sugars of saccharamyces cerevision and S. calsbergensis.<br/>Two types of fermentation are employed, top and bottom fermentation. The characteristic behavior of the top and bottom fermenting yeast determines the type of fermentation that can be employed. Bottom fermenting yeast may be fermented  in closed fermenters but open vats are necessary for the top fermenting yeast. The character of the beer depends on the method and materials, used for preparing the work.<br/>Cereal malt is very important in alcoholic beverage production because it is source of sugar amino acid fatty acid vitamin and minerals. <br/>1.1              HYPOTHESIS <br/>-Maize adjmict in sorghum beer brewing increase the carbohydrate constant in work. <br/>H1.

From time immemorial, man has restorted to the use of this unique commodity for domestic and other purposes. <br/>Most of our water supplies are from surface water which include: rivers, streams, lakes, oceans and seas and there water bodies are likely to be polluted with domestic and Industrial as well as agriculture waste, As populations increase, the problem become more serious and as such, water can endanger the health and life of human beings because when polluted by fecal materials it becomes potential carrier of pathogenic organism (Carpenter 1977).<br/>Water, is of course, absolutely essential to life, not only human life but all life, animal and vegetable. Most of the biochemical reaction that occur in metabolism and growth of living cells involved water, and all take places in water. (Camp etal,1974).<br/>Man uses water not only for drinking purposes but also for bathing, washing, laundering, heating, air conditioning, agriculture, stock raising and gardens, Industrial processes and cooling water power and steam power, fire protection, fishing, swimming and wild life propagation and navigation.<br/>Natural water contain not only then natural flora but also micro – organisms from soil and possible from animals or sewage. Surface waters in streams or pools and stored waters in lakes and large ponds vary considerably in microbial content. (frazier 1978) water is broadly divided into three types viz., surface water which include: streams, rivers, lakes  sear, and oceans Kelman et al (1957) <br/>The ground water, well borehle, many people have defined the ground water in different ways: ground water is subter water that occurs where all pores in the soil or rock counting materials are saturated (pelezer et al 1992).<br/>The atmospheric water, which includes rain, falls. All water bodies consist of a variety of bacterial and other microorganisms like the Algaes fungi, which inhabit these natural water bodies. Some of these micro –organisms are indigenous to thus natural water while others are transient, entering the water from external environment (Pelezar and Reg, 1997).<br/>The generality of bacteria are mostly commonly found ordinarily in fresh water some of which include:  pseudomonas, Archacbacter, and vibrio these are gram negative, the gram-positive bacterial which are found in water include: micrococcus Archacbacter and actinomycentes. Gebharal (1975)  Tap water, as one of the water sources is mostly used domestically, it is observed that tap change sometime the water tap will be clear this calls for load, in order to be sure of its portability. Bonde (1977) <br/>The increase in drinking water from different sources especially in Enugu state has made necessary to investigate the microbial content of water. Water is a potential carried of pathogenic organisms that can endage human life. Most of drinking water sources are often contaminated with different pollutants like faces, animal and plant wastes, making such water  unfit for drinking if not treated. The pollution of water with pathogenic organisms and other pollutants can only be detected by carrying out microbiological assessment of such water. Most human disease such as typhoid paratyphoid cholera, arnboebiasis, Trichinosis, gastroenteritis, sanonall shigellosis, diphtheria, giadia, dracunculus etc are know to be water borne disease. Ewington et al (1971).<br/>Water born disease are those disease which have water as their vehicle of transmission these disease are capable of destroying a whole community if not checked. Therefore, the quickest ways to prevent out break of these disease and to determine the portability of such water sources is to determine the microbial load or content if the microbial content is nor within acceptable limit, such  water sources should be condemned immediately. Fair et al (1970)<br/>AIMS OBJECTIVE <br/>I.            To find out if well, stream, Tap water coutain pathogens. <br/>II.          To help the public to know the danger of drinking these water without adequate treatment. <br/>III.       To compare the microbial load of the water source and advice on safer source of water .<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>These source of water are contaminated through one way or the other <br/>(i)     The short falls in the distribution of treated  pipe borne water leads people to resort to alternative source of water which may be unfit for human consumption <br/>(ii)               Tap water can be polluted through leakage’s/ improper plumbing.<br/>(iii)              Well water is contaminated as a result of running off into it, especially shallow well. <br/>(iv)             Streams can be contaminated through waste from industries, leaves, dust, and rain run often. <br/>HYPOTHESIS <br/>1.           HO- pathogenic bacteria are present in water <br/>2.           H1- pathogenic bacteria are not present in water <br/>3.           Hiii- The level of pathogenic organism in water can cause water borne infection <br/>4.           Hilo The level of pathogenic organism in water can not cause watt born infection. <br/>SIGNIFICANTS OF STUDY <br/>1)   The study will advice on water meet the standard quality required for any particular purpose <br/>2)   Also advice the eswc on quality of their product.

It is used primarily for seasoning or spice and also for its medicinal property.  The plant  contain a medicinal properly just like other plants such as aloes, Indian liquorices, alligator pepper etc which are also found useful, although the extend is not accurately recorded.  The medicinal property of garlic is due to its “sulphur” content which was believed to be responsible for it’s medicinal value.  Garlic as a medicinal plant has been widely used and found to be effective on number of serious infections.  Other plants like the ones mentioned earlier also have their medicinal properly, some which is as a result of the presence of ackloids, volatile oils, polyphenol and some related sulphur compound contained in them.  Similarly,  some are found to be used as  vermifuge, stimulating carminative toxic and also as condiments and for treatment of worm bites just like garlic.<br/>            The diluted juice of the fresh bulb is used externally as a mild antiseptic and the finely chopped cloves added to food act as an effective vermifuge.  By the distillation of the bulb, a volatile oil consisting mainly of daily disulphide and allyl – prop disulphide is obtained.  It is used to diminish cough in chronic bronchitic.  Meanwhile, in this project work, we shall be working on garlic’s bacteriocidal effect on staphylococcus  aureus. Garlic is one of the best known natural plant that provide sulphur.  Many of the sulphur containing compounds in garlic such as dietlyl – disulphide, propienyl methyl sulphide, allicin which stands as organic disulphide present in garlic inactivates the amino acid.  Cysteine and such reactions of the garlic disulphide present in garlic may inhibit protein synthesis in microorganism.  This reaction may have contributed to the bacteriocidal effect of garlic on bactenal cell.  Garlic also contain a glycoside, vitamin B,C and D and allisation I and II, the volatile sulphur  oil which form part of a vermifugal medicinal property.  An antibiotic substance “allicin” which appear to be more  bacteriostatic than bactericidal has been isolated from the cloves.  Barley (1950).  It has antibiotic effect on both gram positive and gram negative bacteria.  Example Salmonella  typhinurium, staphylococcus  aureus,  Bacillus  Species,  Eshericha   Coli, etc. (Shelef, 1980).<br/>            Staphycoccus aureus is a predominant causative agent of skin and urinary tract infection among men and women.  Therefore, urinary tract infection is referred to as infection affecting the urinary system comprising invasion of any of the tissues that make up the tract, extending from the renal cortex to the urethral meatus.  Kunin, (1979).  These  diseases include cystitis – inflammation of bladder, Urethiritis – information of the urethra.  Also, skin infection is referred to as infection affecting the skin.  The organisms are present on the whole skin or part of the skin surface including those in deeper parts of the skin such as the ducts of sebaceous and sweat gland follicles.<br/>Staphylococcus  aureus  is a gram positive bacteria, coagulase-positive and a   human pathogen which live as a commensal in the anterior nares of over half the normal population.  It may also colonize the skin.  It is the most common cause of acute pyogenic (pus-producing)) infection in man. It has a marked predilection for the skin and surface structures and causes boils, carbunches, pustules, styles, impetigo (often in association with streptococcus pyogenes), pemphigus neonatorum, and sticky eyes in babies.  Acute osteomyelitis in children and mastitis in lactating mothers.  It is the commonest cause of infection of wounds and bums.  Other staphylococcal  species are coagulase-negative (Jackson, M.H.

They help the body to fight diseases. More than 3,000 years ago ancient people stumbled over the discovery that some moulds could be used as a cure. The egyptians, the chinese, and indians of central American would use mold to treat rashes and infected would. At that time they didn’t understand either diseases or treatment. As time went on, people began to gain some insight of disease. In the 1860 Louis Pasteur Shaw that many disease were caused it bacteria. Later he discovered that we may be able to fight germ and other microbes. It was two German doctors, who were first to make an effective medication form microbes. Kudo if and Emmerich and Oscar has conducted their experiment in the  1890. They proved that germ that would for another. All the men did was to take the germ from infected bandages and grow then in a test tube. They would  then isolate a particular germ that caused green in factions in open would. This germs was bacteria called Bacillus pyoicyaneus. They put then into another test tube containing other type of bacteria, it was  then it happened that the bacillus pyocyaneus wiped out the other disease germ. The germs that was killed were those that caused cholera, typhoid, diphtheria and anthrau. From this the two men created a medication that they called pyoanase, it was the first antibiotics used in hospitals.<br/>In 1928 Alexander Fleming, a Scottish scientist, discovered penicillin, the first antibiotics. He was keeping in a petn dish when a speck of mold fell in, it cause the mold to grow on the nutrient agar used to feed the bacteria. Surpassingly, it stopped the growth of the bacteria. Fleming through the mold called penicillin notatum produced a substance that killed the bacteria and so called it penicillin. However, he was not able to entrant it from broth in which he grew the mold.<br/>In 1945, Waksman used the word antibiotics for the first time and proposed that it can be defined as a chemical substance of microbial origin that possesses antibiotic powers. He discovered a drug called streptomycin. It onginated frommicrobes found in soil and was a cure for many intestinal  diseases. Now antibiotics like penicillin and streptomycin was discovered. Each was effective against certain disease, but scientist wanted more. Doctors however, anted broad spectrum drug. That is a single antibiotics that could cure many disease <br/>The search proved successful one laboratory discovered Aureonycin, which is a drug that does the job of penicillin and streptomycin. Another laboratory discovered chloromycin. <br/>In 1949, yet another laboratory came with one of the effective  antibiotics ever found, terranycin. This drug could be used against many bacteria disease (Katzung, 1994). <br/>1.2              AIMS AND OBJECTIVE <br/>1.                  To identify causative organism that are delectious to mans health. <br/>2.                  To determine the potency of the different antibiotics. <br/>3.                  To know the type of organism sensitive to the different antibiotics. <br/>1.3                 HYPOTHESIS <br/>H0-       Streptomycin is more effective <br/>H1 – Streptonyin is not  effective <br/>H2  -     Chloramphenicol is not effective <br/>H3-  Chloramphenicol is not effective <br/>H4- Gentamicin is more effective <br/>H5 –Gentanicin  is not effective <br/>H6 – Comparing the strength of the three antibiotics.<br/>1.4              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>Due to the problem encountered , most people abuse antibiotics owing to the general belief that antibiotics can be used  in the treatment of all kinds of diseases. This can result to drug resist. Accumulation of these drugs can lead to internal denage.  Hence this study which compares the antimicrobial strength of three antibiotics. <br/>1.5              SOCOP OF STUDY <br/>This work will be limited to the maximum inhibitory concentration and know the organism sensitive to the different antibiotics under certain temperature. <br/><br/>\n\nCOMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF ANTIMICROBIAL STRENGTH OF THREE MOST COMMON ANTIBIOTICS USED IN ENUGU <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF ANTIMICROBIAL STRENGTH OF THREE MOST COMMON ANTIBIOTICS USED IN ENUGU ", "id": 111}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>HEPATOPRODUCTIVE EFFECTS OF SENA TORA LEAVE EXTRACT ON CARBON TETRACHLORIDE INDUCED TOXICITY<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>1.0     INTRODUCTION<br/>       Many of the developing countries including African countries like Nigeria practice traditional medicine as its main source of health care. This traditional medicine is normally gotten from plant origin [Rehan Ahmad et al, 2008, Stephen bent, 2008].Today nearly 88 percent of the global populations switch to plant derived medicines as their first line of defence for maintaining health and combating diseases [Kintzois et al,2006]. Presently there are about 60 types of medicinal plants that have been recognised in primary health care and are classified according to their pharmacological actions such as peptic ulcers, anti flatulence, laxative, anti diarrhoea and anti hepatic[Viomolos et al,2003]. However in future the discovery of novel therapeutic agents will be only dependent on plant origin [Perulmalsamy et al, 1999].<br/>        Senna tora is an example of traditional medicine with pharmacological actions as anticholesterolemic,antispasmodic,carninitative, emolliants, ophthalmic and purgative [Polunin and Stanton,1984,Yeung,1985,Manandhar, 2002]. It can be cardiotonic, antiperiodic, anthelminitic and expectorant  and can also be used in treating  cogh,leprosy ,ring worm ,colic,flatulence,constipation and other disorders[Nature serve,2007]. Senna tora formally regarded as cassia tora is capable of suppressing  the production of prostaglandins and other inflammatory agonists such as cytokines, histamine, kinin and free radical.manila,1998 buttressed his observations confirming its use in the treatment of constipation, edema and liver protection in Korea.<br/>          Liver, the largest internal organ of the human body performs more than five hundred functions, all of which are very vital to life. The liver can regenerate or grow back cells that have been destroyed by short term injury or disease, but if the liver is damaged repeatedly over a long period of time, it may undergo irreversible changes which permanently interferes with its function.<br/>     Carbon tetrachloride is a toxic substance that interrupts the liver and its functions. This is to say that it damages the liver when ingested.CCL4 is stable in the presence of air and light, it is also inflammable. Despite its toxic effect on the liver, it is useful as grain fumigant ,pesticide etc. Equilibrium of the body fluids and secretions are altered as a result of carbon tetrachloride. For instance lipid metabolism, cholesterol metabolism and  biotransformation  functions of the liver are terminated or altered in the presence of CCL4.Thus carbon tetrachloride is lethal. The liver produces some enzyme such as aspartate amino transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase,gamma glutamyl transsferase etc which catalyses the biochemical activities of  the body, and on the attack of CCL4 to the liver ,these enzymes will not be produced.<br/>      Free radicals are highly reactive compounds with uneven number of electrons in their outermost orbit. This can react with cellular compounds like unsaturated fatty acids and can generate new free radicals which result in irreversible biochemical injury like membrane damage, apotosis and cell necrosis. Antioxidants scavenge  free radicals  and stop the subsequent reactions hence protecting the macromolecules and cellular environment from toxicity and degeneration [Hong B.O. Shao et al, 2008].The oxygen consumption inherent in cell growth leads to the generation of series of reactive oxygen species [ROS].The ROS are molecules such as superoxide anion radicals and hydroxyl radicals[OH]. ROS may be very damaging  attacking  the lipids of cell membrane and DNA mutation which may further propagate the propagation of many diseases[Valontao et al 2002,Gulcin et al 2003]. Reactive oxygen  species are continuously  produced during normal Physiological  events  and are removed by antioxidants defence mechanism [Buyukokuroglu et al,2001]. Many results have shown that some of the cassia species have acquired antimicrobial substances and antioxidant activities.<br/>  1.1     AIMS OF THE RESEARCH<br/>The aim of this research is to find out hepatoproductive effects of sena tora leave extract on carbon tetrachloride induced toxicity.<br/><br/>\n\nHEPATOPRODUCTIVE EFFECTS OF SENA TORA LEAVE EXTRACT ON CARBON TETRACHLORIDE INDUCED TOXICITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " HEPATOPRODUCTIVE EFFECTS OF SENA TORA LEAVE EXTRACT ON CARBON TETRACHLORIDE INDUCED TOXICITY", "id": 112}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>MICROORGANISM ASSOCIATED WITH  SPOILAGE  OF TOMATOES (CANNED TOMATOES)<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT</b><br/>Chapter one<br/>1.0        Introduction                                <br/>Chapter Two<br/>2.0        Literature  review        <br/>2.1    History of canned tomato     <br/>2.2    Types of canned Tomatoes           <br/>2.3    Nutrition facts of canned tomatoes <br/>2.4    Common additions of canned tomato      <br/>2.5    causes of canned tomatoes spoilage       <br/>2.6    Control/preservation of canned tomato<br/>Chapter Three<br/>3.0        Materials  and Methods <br/>3.1    Place of experimental work   <br/>3.2    materials used    <br/>3.2.1 Reagent used      <br/>3.3    Collection of sample     <br/>3.4    Medium preparation             <br/>3..4.1        Preparation of nutrient agar  <br/>3.4.2 Preparation of potato dextrose agar       <br/>3.5    Sample preparation                     <br/>3.6    Microbiological Analysis of the Sample<br/>3.6.1 Determination of analysis load (bacterial and Fungi Load)  <br/>3.7    Preparation of pure cultures pf Isolate (bacteria and fungi)<br/>3.7    Identification of bacteria isolates <br/>3.7.2 Colonial or  cultural characteristics <br/>3.8    Gram Staining     <br/>3.8.1 Indole test          <br/>3.8.2 Motility Test using stab cultures techniques      <br/>3.8.3 Methyl Red (Mr ) Test<br/>3.8.4 Volies –proskader (VIPs) test<br/>3.8.5 Identification of fungi <br/>3.9    Microscopic Examination               <br/>3.10  biochemical Reactions  <br/>Chapter Four<br/>4.0        Microbial Load or bacteria Associated with canned Tomato  spoilage <br/>4.1    Discussion <br/>4.2    Conclusion  <br/>4.3    Recommendation <br/>          References <br/>ABSTRACT<br/>The micro-organism, associated with spoilage of tomatoes shows that tomato contain large amount of water which makes them more susceptible to spoilage by the action of various micro-organism. Out of  the (3) three sources of samples used in the assessment revealed that Bacillus species identified in the spoiled sample are  the major causes of canned spoilage while the fungi isolates are peniucillum species etc which revealed by the assessment are also the cause of  tomato spoilage. In this  assessment carried out,  it was  found out that bacterial species were the source of spoilage rather than bacteria because it dominated all the plates. <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Canned tomatoes are tomatoes usually peeled that are sealed into a canned after having been processed by heat.<br/>This product are considered important world wide (Robinso, et al, 1994). In Nigeria tomato paste is the most important  tomato  product  because of its wide spread use for preparation of various food/menus. It contain on the average about 6.4% total solids, of which 3.5% is invert sugar, 0.5% citric acid,0.6% ash, 0.9% protein, 0.53% crude fibre and about 0.05% fat. When spoil as a result of the life processes of bacteria, yeast and molds, the sugars are  rapidly used up being changes into acetic  acid, lactic acid, alcohol and carbon dioxide, the amount of these substances depending  on the types of organism which are most  active in the particular sample in question.<br/>Until recent  years, nearly all the tomato paste consumed in Nigeria was important from European countries with Italy being the leading country. However, today, limited brands are produced locally. Although both the imported and the local brands are available on the market, consumers prefer the former  in spite of its relatively  higher cost.<br/>In general, adequate heat processing is given to tomato paste to achieve commercial  sterility (speck, 1984), but subsequent abusive post-process handling/storage may lead to undesirable microbiological changes  (Anon, 1980). It is public knowledge  that can of tomato paste often show external evidence of spoilage under tropical retail conditions. In addition, and interestingly, these d effective products are sold (especially to the less informed) at the same cost as the normal (non-defective- product.<br/>The structural   systematic approach for the control  of food safety “Hazard Analytsis and critical control point-HACCP” identifies, evaluated and controls hazards that are significant for food safety. The control parameters include various factors  such as  time of harvesting, temperature and moisture during storage, selection of agricultural products prior  to processing, decontamination conditions, addition of chemicals at final product storage ((Sango, 1995).<br/><br/>\n\nMICROORGANISM ASSOCIATED WITH  SPOILAGE  OF TOMATOES (CANNED TOMATOES)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MICROORGANISM ASSOCIATED WITH  SPOILAGE  OF TOMATOES (CANNED TOMATOES)", "id": 113}]
