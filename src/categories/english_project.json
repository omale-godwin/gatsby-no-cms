[{"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>“OUR CHILDREN ARE COMING “ BY CHUKWUEMEKA IKE’S<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION <br/>This chapter is an introduction to the entire essay. It examines the life and work of the author, Chukwuemeka Ike, scope of study, justification of study and literature review in the novel. <br/>1.1    LIFE AND WORKS OF CHUKWUEMEKA IKE<br/>Vincent Chukwuemeka Ike was born on 28 April, 1931, in Ndikelionwu near Akwa in Eastern Nigeria. He studied at Government College, Umuahia, University College (now University of Ibadan) and at Stanford University, Paolo Alto, California, USA, where he obtained his M.A in 1966. He was a teacher at the Elementary School in Amichi, near Owerri from June to September 1963, and at Girl’s Secondary School in Nkwere near Orlu, from June 1955 to December 1956. In 1957, Ike became the Assistant Registrar of the University of Ibadan. He gave up the post in September 1971 and became a Registrar of the West African Examination Council. In 1978 he became a Visiting Professor of English, University of Jos, Jos.<br/>Ike has at several times been chairman of various commissions and committees. From 1983 to 1988, he was the chairman Culture Sector, member of the Nigerian National Commission for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNICEF). He was the Pro-chancellor/Chairman, Governing Council, University of Benin, Benin City from 1990 to 1991 and chairman, Nigerian Books Foundation from 1991 to 1993. He has also been the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Nigerian Book Foundation since 1993. He is married to Adebimpe Olorunsola (nee Abimbola) with children.<br/>As a novelist, Ike has authored many novels which their titles have manifested his creative prowess and thematic pre-occupation. His works are as follows: Toads for Supper (1965), The Naked Gods (1973), Sunset at Dawn (1976), The Chicken Chasers (1980), Expo’ 77 (1985), The Bottled Leopard (1985), Our Children Are Coming (1990), and To My Husband From Lowa (1996).<br/>As an artist, he uses his writing to mirror the society with a view to effecting the change that will lead to the progress of the people. <br/>1.2    SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>    This essay establishes that satire is both a means and an end. It is a tool in the sense that it is geared towards societal reformation. It is an end because it is realized by literary devices such as irony, humour and sarcasm. Looking at the background in which Our Children Are Coming (henceforth referred to as OCAC) is written, the essay evaluates the work as a social satire. This is based on how the social environment influences the writer.<br/>    Also, the various aspects of the social ills are identified and analyzed as the writer’s target of satire. The devices used for achieving this is looking at - the techniques, style, characterization, and function. <br/>    More so, the achievements and influences of satire on the reader and the public is also looked at. This is based on how the writer effectively employs satire to expose the prevalence of social vices in the society.<br/>1.3    JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY <br/>    This essay evaluates the depiction of satire in Ike’s Our Children Are Coming because through the novel, the author successfully depicts the prevalent social vices in the society with a view to correcting them. The efficient and artistic deployment of satire in the novel greatly contributes to its success.<br/>1.4    LITERATURE REVIEW <br/>    One of the critics who has been at the forefront of the literary battle fithing the war on who is rightly qualified as the critics of African literature is Ernest Emenyonu. He was the first to observe that critics have not given Ike and his works the adequate attention, despite his (Ike’s) contributions to the literary scene. Emenyonu observes that for too long:<br/>Chukwuemeka Ike has remained untouched by Africans and indeed Nigerian critics. A few uninformed generalizations have trickled in from abroad with little or nothing profound to say about Ike as a writer, his moral preoccupation, his portrait of his society, the world-view presented in his novels, the author’s literary techniques and his contributions to the African novel. (62)<br/>    The minute critical evaluation on Ike’s work is unfair because Ike through his novels offers critical opinions about the society which are worth reviewing. However, there are a handful of critics who have commentaries on Ike and his works.<br/>    Kanchada Ugbabe says that Chukwuemeke Ike is a writer whom works imaginatively articulates the social and political history of Nigeria over the years. He also says that Ike offers us a perspective on:<br/>events and institutions which we in our day to day involvement with these institutions do not see. He projects into the future through a vigorous leap of the imagination. (1) <br/>    Ugbabe concludes that Ike’s work offers a kaleidoscope of historical events and situations, and that his novel (OCAC) strikes an immediate rapport with his readers, whether young or old.<br/>    Commenting on the literary methodological approach of the author, the renown African novelist, Chinua Achebe observes that OCAC:<br/>Chronicle in a memorable fashion the live, the hopes, the despair of Nigerians. Ike achieves brilliant observation, light-hearted homour and somber seriousness. And that combination of light touch and serious purpose is the hallmark of his entire oeuvre. (1)  <br/>    Furthermore, Kpolugbo and Okwechime in their article remark that Ike in his novel, OCAC paints a picture of the stark reality of Nigeria’s political and social scenes. Thus, they state that:<br/>We are made to see the different facets of our society in which there is stinking rottenness, corruption, deceit, parental hypocrisy, false accusation of the youths, sexual promiscuity, misuse and abuse of power, and the exploration of the innocence of our students and youths in general as exhibited in the University System of this so-called great nation. (62). <br/>    Thus, Kpolugbo and Okwechimen’s criticism dwells on the author’s thematic concerns, and how these themes are verisimilitude to the contemporary African environments, especially Nigeria.<br/>    Again, Emenyonu in his review of Ike’s Our Children Are Coming, like Kpolugbo and Okwechime, dwells on the social realism of the author’s thematic preoccupation. He says:<br/>Ike explores the hypocrisy and double standards which characterize to scandalous proportions, adult behaviour in Nigeria society. It is perhaps Ike’s emotional attach to the subject that makes it difficult for him to distance himself from the issues he attacks in the novel. (12) <br/>Emenyonu goes further to say that Ike does not only dissect and criticize the society, but he offers possible solutions to the decadence even if some of the ideas he puts seem far-fetched in this century especially with the present generation. He sees Ike’s manner of conflicts resolution as unrealistic and says that it seems too contrived and mechanical to blend with the story. He further states that the end of the novel is untidy and that “it fails to sustain both the theme and the moral, and the ideological premise on which the development of the story had been so systematically built” (117).<br/>    These views on Ike’s works especially Our Children Are Coming, present Ike as a social critic committed to changes in the socio-political problems of his society. None seems to have evaluated his means to that achievement – which is our focus in this essay.<br/>    Though critical comments in Ike’s OCAC appear few, these are no doubt valid comments, when one reads the novel. However, none of these has examined the novel as satirical. Therefore, this essay looks at the novel and concludes that it is satirical as revealed in the employment of the devices and techniques.<br/><br/>\n\nOUR CHILDREN ARE COMING BY CHUKWUEMEKA IKE’S<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " OUR CHILDREN ARE COMING BY CHUKWUEMEKA IKE’S", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SPHERES IN NIGERIA AS DEPICTED IN “DANCE OF THE MOSQUITOES” ZIKY KOFOWOROLA<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>                INTRODUCTION</b><br/>1.1    Purpose of study<br/>    The aim of this essay is to x-ray the socio-political and economic realities in Nigeria, which are corruptions as well as criminal activities prevalent in the society as depicted in Ziky’s Dance of the Mosquitoes. These various aspects of corruption shall be critically examined with close reference to the text.<br/>1.2    Scope of study<br/>    This essay is limited to the analysis of the stark realities or happenings in social, political and economic spheres in Nigeria as depicted in the play. <br/>1.3    Research Methodology<br/>    In this essay, the library forms the basis of this work. Also, internet sources are explored. Personal ideas and analysis would be greatly utilized.<br/>1.4    The background of the author<br/>    Ziky Kofoworola holds a PhD in drama from Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria. He is an accomplished academic, a playwright and a theatre director. He is widely travelled and has participated in conferences, workshop, seminars or teaching programs as well as directed performances in India, Bulgaria, Germany, United Kingdom, Ghana and United States of America. His published plays Futonje and Ghasange, have been nominated for the Association of Nigerian Authors Prize (2007) and Nigeria LNG prize for Literature (2010) respectively. He has worked at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria; Ohio State University, Columbus, USA; and the University of Cape Coast, Ghana. Among his numerous academic publications is Hausa performing art and music. He is presently a professor of Performing Arts at the University of Illorin, Illorin, Nigeria.<br/>1.5    Definition of terms in the play<br/>Mosquito/ Mansquito: Literally, mosquito is a small flying insect that bites people and animals and sucks their blood (Oxford Advanced Learners’ Dictionary of Current English). In this play, the mosquitoes are likened to those who are corrupt in the society (mainly politicians): those who set out to siphon our National treasury and inflict pains (poverty) on the citizenry as a result of bad governance. The special breeds of mosquitoes, which are the human form of such, are the mansquitoes.<br/>Malaria: This is used to symbolize the effects of the mosquitoes and mansquitoes on the country. These effects include poverty, as a result of the corruption and oppression by them.  <br/>Niaghara: This is a fictional term coined by the playwright to indirectly mean “Nigeria”. This means that, the play as a whole, ex-rays the happenings in a country, Nigeria.<br/>Zombies: This is the symbolic representation of the police officers who are criminals/ or who support criminal activities in the play (Atanda: 10)<br/>1.6    About the play<br/>    Dance of the Mosquitoes is a metaphor on the nature of those who have been entrusted with governance of a fictional nation called Niaghara Land. Instead of nurturing her, they oppress and suck her, dry off her resources the same way mosquitoes suck their victims, deposit disease and leave them sick. This play is an examination of the excitement and the reckless abandon with which they carry out their plundering, and the ultimate catastrophic effects of their activities on the social and economic lives of the people who voted to put them in office.<br/>    The playwright does not really believe in the violent approach into effecting a positive change in our society, but by the way of performance; vices, corruption and bad eggs would be exposed. The narrator and chorus confirm thus:<br/>    NARRATOR:  That I believe is what we are all doing. The                 positive approach is not to give up in                     despondency but to strive and fight, for                     fighting is the only way out.<br/>    CHORUS:       our own fighting method is to expose the                 mosquitoes. To reduce their atrocities into                 dancing spectacles; to laugh at the                     spectacles of tragedy through a comic                     portrayal of their ravaging damages…                     (17).<br/>    This method, by using performance, art of dance drama, using a form of satire in coded symbols, images and metaphors of mosquitoes, is to depict by using the moribund state of affairs in Nigeria, a country suffering from the effects of wanton attacks of mosquitoes, blood sucking insects as metaphors for those who are in the position of authority, but fail to lead well. Only the privileged few, the self centered ones are the symbolic representations of the mosquitoes, now mansquitoes, who in their ‘reckless abandon with which they carry on their plundering, and the ultimate catastrophic effects of their activity on the social and economic lives of the people who voted to put them in the office’ (Blur 26). The image of mosquitoes is real. In the conversation between the performers of the dance drama, we are confronted with the graphic explication of the lethargic rampage of the mosquitoes which is noted in the trauma and pains of acute malaria in a son called Niaghara and his “widow” mother in her shared excruciating pains and the agony of a forlorn motherhood. The characters inform us thus:<br/>    CHORUS:  Mosquitoes are real. A ravaging                             creature that suck, suck and suck the                             human blood till you bleed, red with blood<br/>    NARRATOR: Thank you dear playmates. Thanks for                         agreeing that mosquitoes are real, and                         suck till you bleed, and bleed, and                             bleed red with blood… ( 8-9).<br/>1.7    The Review of Related Scholarship            <br/>    In the international community, corruption is a bane for it impedes the growth and development of democratic institution (Al Gore 10). Generally, corruption can be regarded as a canker worm that has eaten deep into the fabric of many developing as well as developed countries. In whatsoever form, corruption is an anti-ethical behavior, which is detrimental to the development of any society; this is evident because it pursues the selfish interest of the individuals in the society.<br/>    Yemi Atanda, in his review on Dance of the Mosquitoes by Ziky Koforowola, stresses the role of the local community in combating corruption in Nigeria. He said that eradicating corruption is not a sole responsibility of one person but rather a combine effort of all and sundry. In his “macabre Dance of Mosquitoes for good governance”, he said:<br/>        ‘…, the war will have to be waged by the entire                         community, there may be various and                                 many conflicting interests, yet there is a                             common denominator- to live in peace. It is                             pertinent to say that in peace there is progress.                         But can there be peace when the entire                             community watches on the                                     macabre dance of mosquitoes? (1)’ <br/>The above extract buttresses his fight against corruption as shown in the play.<br/>1.8     The theoretical background on corruption<br/>    Klitgaard broadly viewed corruption as misuse of office for unofficial ends. According to him, a “catalogue of corrupt acts includes- but not limited to- bribery, extortion, influence peddling, nepotism, fraud, the use of ‘speed money’ (money paid to government officials to speed up their consideration of a business matter falling within their jurisdiction and embezzlement)”.<br/>    Corruption is the efforts to secure wealth or power through illegal means, private gains at public expense or a misuse of public power for private benefits. In addition, corruption is a behavior which deviates from the formal duties of a public role, because of private gains. This definition includes such behavior as bribery, nepotism, and misappropriation (Banfield 56). Dike adds that corruption is an anti-social behavior conferring improper benefits contrary to legal and moral norms, and which undermine the authorities’ efforts to improve the living conditions of the people. Corruption causes a reduction in quality of goods and services available to the public, as some companies could cut corners to increase profit margins. Corruption affects investment, economic growth, and government expenditure choices; it also reduces private investment.<br/>    According to Igbuzor, corruption is one of the major challenges of democracy in Nigeria. There is no doubt that corruption is pervasive and has eaten deep into the entire fabric of corruption by implementing one program or the other. All these programs failed, not necessarily because of poor theoretical articulation but due to faulty implementation and the prevailing socio-economic and political conditions. The conduct and the behavior of the political elite and the advocates of these programs are in sharp contrast to what the programs were/are advocating.<br/>    Meanwhile, the fight against corruption has taken an international dimension. In Sept, 1997, citizens from 93 countries gathered in Lima, Peru, at the 8th International Conference against corruption and adopted what is now known as the Lima Declaration. The Lima Declaration noted that “corruption erodes the moral fabric of every society, violates the social and economic rights of the poor and the vulnerable, undermines democracy, subverts the rule of law which is the basis of every civilized society, retards development, and denies societies and particularly the poor, the benefits of free and open competition”.  <br/>    Corruption is a social problem that has interested many scholars. Ruzinder asserts that corruption in Africa is a problem of routine deviation from established standards and norms by public officials and parties with whom they interact. He also identified the types of corruption in Africa as bribery, private gain, and other benefits to non-existence workers and pensioners (called ghost workers). The dishonest and illegal behavior exhibited especially by people in authority for their personal gain is corruption. According to the ICPC Act (section 2), corruption includes vices like bribery, fraud, and other related offences. Gbenga asserts that corruption is contagious. According to the perception index of Transparency International, Nigeria was ranked 144th out of the 146 countries, beating Bangladesh and Haiti to last position. <br/>    Gerald and Naomi Caiden suggest three definitions of corruption: public interest, public duty, and market centered. Public interest corruption refers to bribery or other rewards leading a functionary to favor those who offer bribes and to damage the public interest in the process. Public duty corruption refers to behavior that deviates from the formal duties of a public role because of so-called private-regarding pecuniary or status gains. Market- centered corruption refers to attempts by individuals or groups to influence the bureaucracy. The Caidens comment on the weakness of each definition, such as the imprecision of the “public irresponsibility”, and the difficulty of dealing with divergent social norms for the conduct of public office. Peter DeLeon, in discussing political corruption in the United States, defines it as “a cooperative form of unsanctioned, usually condemned policy influence for some type of significant personal gain, in which the currency could be economic, social, political, or ideological remuneration”. Clearly, it goes beyond bribery, which is the focus of some other scholars’ definition of corruption.<br/>    These other scholars, however, do notice that the meaning attached to particular, such as bribery, varies from culture to culture. One calls offering an item of economic worth to a public official a bribe, but another culture says it is a gift from our hearts to you, and refusing it constitutes a rejection of our goodwill. The essential point, as Susan Rose-Ackerman says, is that, “societies differ in the way they channel self interest. Endemic corruption is the misuse of public power for private gain”, implies that, corruption is relational. It occurs at the interface of the public and private sectors. In the same vein, Kimberly Ann Elliot argues that the most common definition of corruption is abuse of public office for private gain, although she distinguishes petty corruption and grand corruption. Petty corruption tends to involve lower- level administrators and their interaction with private actors concerning such matters as taxes, regulations, licensing requirements, and allocation of government benefits. Grand   corruption, in contrast involves high- level political participation in such matters as procurement of so-called big-ticket items like military equipment, civilian aircraft, and infrastructure, or politics decisions about allocation of credit or industrial subsidies. However defined, corruption is ubiquitous. Elliot notes, “It occurs in democracies and military dictatorships, and at all levels of development and in all types of economic systems, from open capitalist economic systems, from open capitalist economy, such as that of the United States, to centrally planned economies such as the former Soviet Union’s (p.1). Although corruption varies across the world, it is unquestionably a global phenomenon. Just in the 1990s, alone, we have witnessed, in the words of Patrick Glynn, Stephen J. Kobrin, and Moises Naim a “ corruption eruption”. They ascribe it to a number of causes, not the least of which is the globalization of the economy. Global economic integration, the increasing permeability of national borders, and “the emergent of an Electronically Networked International Financial System” collectively contribute to the opportunities for corruption.<br/>    When considering the opportunities for corruption, recall the existence of relational views and that corruption exists at the nexus of the public and private sectors. As Rose-Ackerma suggests, “corruption depends upon the magnitude of the benefits and costs under the control of public officials”. Since government buys and sells goods and services, distributes subsidies, and participates in privatization. There are many incentives for corruption among private citizens and public officials. For example, Elliot maintains that democratization and market reforms in developing countries and the transitional economies in Eastern Europe may, in the short run, “introduce new reforms of corruption or allow more virulent reforms to take hold”. In advanced economies, she points to the campaign finance scandals in the United States, the political dissatisfaction and turmoil in Western Europe and similar difficulties in Japan as evidence that corruption is by no means limited to developing nations. To put it simply, opportunity for various types of corruption is everywhere.<br/>    John Locke outlined the doctrine of the separation of powers, indicating the danger of oppressive and arbitrary rule when all functions of government are exercised by a single person or institution. The growing corruption in Nigeria can be traced to people holding power at the federal, state, and local government levels. Gray and Kauffman have argued that, in an underdeveloped capitalist economy, corruption is widespread for two main reasons. First, the motivation for corruption is strong; second, opportunities to engage in corruption are numerous. The motivation for rural-urban migrants, newly engaging in a modern economy, to earn wages and extra income, is very strong. It is exacerbated by general poverty and by low public sector wages. In Nigeria, as in other state-centric countries, the dominance of the state in economic activity ensures that the opportunity to obtain economic rents is present. Furthermore, the discretion of many public officials is broad and rules and regulations are poorly disseminated and institutions and accountability is weak. Corruption does not involve just people in government, but also to people in both private and public positions and even traditional rulers.<br/>1.9    Justification  <br/>    In the light of the aforementioned, it could be deduced that the focal point of Ziky’s depiction of the social, political and economic realities in the play is on corruption and dysfunctions in the society. <br/>    To the best of my knowledge, nobody has written on this play or on the said topic, aside Atanda, who in his review, concentrated on the joint fight against corruption, but failed to give a critical analysis on the social, political and economic realities as a whole.<br/>1.10    Thesis statement  <br/>    Therefore, this essay examines the social, political, and economic realities in Dance of the Mosquitoes.<br/><br/>\n\nSOCIAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SPHERES IN NIGERIA AS DEPICTED IN “DANCE OF THE MOSQUITOES” ZIKY KOFOWOROLA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SPHERES IN NIGERIA AS DEPICTED IN “DANCE OF THE MOSQUITOES” ZIKY KOFOWOROLA", "id": 2}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE CHARACTERISTICS AND STYLE OF THE SEARCH  BY CHUKUEMEKA IKE’S <br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION <br/>This chapter is a general introduction to the entire essay. It will focus attention on Vincent Chukwuemeka Ike and his works, purpose of study and scope of study. Attention will also be given to review of critical writings on The Search.<br/>1.1    VINCENT CHUKWUEMEKA IKE AND HIS     WORK <br/>Vincent Chukuemeka Ike was born   in 1931, into the royal family of Ike of Ndikelionwu, in the present Orumba North Local Government Area of Anambra State. He  attended Government College Umuahia between January 1945 to July 1950, where he was college prefect. However, Ike proceeded to the University college, Ibadan from October 1951 to June 1955. In purist of higher academic qualification, Ike attended the prestigious Stanford University in California in 1966.<br/>    Ike has had a varied experience in his working life. Between 1957 to 1960, he was an Assistant Registrar and Student Affair Officer at the University college, Ibadan. Besides that, Ike became the Deputy Registrar of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka from 1960 to 1963. However, Chukuemeka Ike became the first African Registrar of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka from 1963 to 1971. In 1971 to 1979, he became the Registrar and Chief Executive of the West African Examination Council, (WAEC), with headquarters in Accra, Ghana. However, on July 1, 1979, Ike voluntarily retired from the Public Service. Again, he was invited by the University of Jos to be visiting Professor of English and Creative Writing from 1983 to 1985.<br/>    A novelist par-excellence, Ike is a committed writer who takes up his pen not because of a concern for the aesthetics of writing for its own sake, but because he has pressing observations to make or a message to communicate. He has written and published ten fiction and two non-fiction. His fiction include;<br/>Toad for Supper, (1965), The Naked Gods, (1970), The Potter’s Wheel, (1973), Sunset at Dawn, (1976), Expo’ 77, (1980), The Chicken Chasers, (1980), The Bottled Leopard, (1985), Our Children Are Coming, (1990), The Search, (1991), and To My Husband from Iowa, (1996). In addition, his non-fiction are: How to Become a Published Writer, (1991) and the University Development in Africa: The Nigerian Experience, (1991).<br/>1.2    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>    The purpose of this study is to demonstrate how Chukuemeka Ike has been able to reflect reality in the Nigerian society through his novel, The Search.<br/>1.3    SCOPE OF STUDY <br/>    The scope of this essay includes the examination of the setting, characteristics and style of The Search. In this endeavour, what Ike does in his spatial and temporal setting of his fictional society will be exposed. The way he inverts characters in situations to dramatic realistic issues vis-à-vis the use of style will also be our focus.<br/>1.4    REVIEW OF CRITICAL WRITINGS ON THE SEARCH <br/>Literature, oral or written form has consistently remained one of the greatest tools in the representation of reality. Literature has become an important means of understanding human and interpreting aspect of society such as politics, religion, social conflicts, class struggle and the human condition. The creation of illusion of reality has the preoccupation of every literary artist since ancient times. To buttress this fat, Ernst Fischer posits that “Literature is born of reality and acts back upon reality”. (496).<br/>Novel, a genre of literature has become a viable tool through which practicers depict reality of life, especially contemporary life as it is lived in the society. Fischer’s position as revealed in this comment does not go further to show how a novelist doe this in his work. He merely says that literature is born of reality without position how and where in prose (our focus), poetry or drama. However, George Eliot says that:<br/>The novelist’s prerogative as an artist is the just representation of life in its details, for art is the nearest thing to life…(5).<br/>Eliot it is observed, went deeper than Fischer when the former pays attention to the novel as a genre of literature, and concluded that a realistic novel must have details of life in it, as quoted above.<br/>    Fiction writing in Nigeria particularly and Africa generally has become one which practiers of the genre have engaged in an attempt to relate their experience and thus pass critical comments on the happening around them. Many African writers have since the emergence in the 50’s tried to focus attention on socio-cultural issues, colonialism, anti-colonial struggles and socio-political ills in post-independence African status.<br/>    Vincent Chukuemeka Ike happens to be one of the Nigerian fiction writers who tried to lend voices to the morally deteriorating post-independence Nigerian society as he creates characters to expose to degenerating social milieu. Having written many novels since he began practicing the genre in 1965, not so much seems to have been said about his literary outpourings. Ernest Emonyony gives support to this fact when he says that:<br/>For too long, Chukuemeka Ike has remaind untouched by African and indeed Nigerian critics… Quite often, Nigerian critics have chosen to skirt around the so-called big names in African society generally referred to as the first generation of African writers namely Achebe, Soyinka, Ekwensi, Ngugi, Clark to mention but a few.(111),<br/>This attitude of critics towards Ike applies generally to all his novels. But Ike is one writer whose artistic pen has been relentlessly influenced by his vision of society as expressed in The Search.<br/>    According to Emenyonu:<br/>The Search is a sequel to Our Children Are Coming, the restlessness among the young and moral decadence in society proving a scenario for the event in The Search. (5-6),<br/>From the above quotation, it has been observed that Emenyonu arrived at his conclusion from the point of view of youth restiveness and moral decay in the society not as a reality. On the other hand, Obiwu Anyanwu Iras termed The Search “faction”. (5), he possibly takes this critical position because of the elements of fiction and reality he observes in the novel. But one notes that he does not tell his audience how Ike realizes faction and not full blown fiction. In any case, this is not the scope of this study.<br/>    From the foregoing, it has been observed that the few available critics have made valid comments on The Search. But none has focused on the novel as a realistic work. Therefore this essay examines The Search as a work of reality as it is revealed in its setting, characteristics and style.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE CHARACTERISTICS AND STYLE OF THE SEARCH  BY CHUKUEMEKA IKE’S <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE CHARACTERISTICS AND STYLE OF THE SEARCH  BY CHUKUEMEKA IKE’S ", "id": 3}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>GRAMMATICAL ANALYSIS OF WAR SPEECHES<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    Introduction <br/>1.1    Life of Adolf Hitler                 <br/>1.2    Life of Odumegwu Ojukwu                <br/>1.3    Purpose of Study                <br/>1.4    Scope of Study                    <br/>1.5    Methodology                        <br/>1.6    Theoretical Background                <br/>1.7    Literature Review                    <br/>1.8    Thesis Statement                    <br/>CHAPTER TWO: SYNTACTIC ANALYSES OF SELECTED <br/>WAR SPEECHES (HITLER AND OJUKWU)<br/>2.1    Sentence                    <br/>2.1.1    The Simple Sentence                    <br/>2.1.2    Simple Sentences in Adolf Hitler War Speech: “Declaration of <br/>War on US”                    <br/>2.1.3    Simple Sentences in Odumegwu Ojukwu’s War Speech <br/>Titled: “Ojukwu’s Call from Exile”             <br/>2.1.4    A Compound Sentence                <br/>2.1.5    Compound Sentence in Adolf Hilter War Speech    <br/>2.1.6    Compound Sentences in Odumegwu Ojukwu War Speech: <br/>“Ojukwu Call from Exile”             <br/>2.2    Complex Sentence                <br/>2.2.1    Complex Sentences in Adolf Hitler’s War Speech: “Declaration <br/>of War on US”                <br/>2.2.2    Complex Sentences in Odumegwu Ojukwu’s War Speech: <br/>“Ojukwu Call from Exile”                <br/>2.3    Functional Sentence                <br/>2.3.1    Declarative Sentence                     <br/>2.3.2    Declarative Sentence in Adolf Hitler War Speech         <br/>2.3.3    Declarative Sentence in Ojukwu War Speech    <br/>2.3.4    Interrogative Sentence            <br/>2.3.5    Interrogative Sentence in Adolf Hitler’s War Speech    <br/>2.4    Clause Patterns                <br/>2.4.1    Clause Patterns in Adolf Hitler’s War Speech         <br/>2.4.2    Clause pattern in Odumegwu Ojukwu’s War Speech        <br/>2.5    The Complex Noun Phrase                <br/>2.5.1    Complex Noun Phrase in the Extracted Sentences of Adolf <br/>Hitler War Speech                <br/>2.5.2    Complex Noun Phrase in the extracted sentence from Odumegwu <br/>Ojukwu war speech                 <br/>CHAPTER THREE: MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF <br/>WAR SPEECHES (ADOLF HITLER AND ODUMEGWU OJUKWU)<br/>3.0    Morphology                     <br/>3.1    Morphological Analysis of Extracted Lexical Items from War <br/>Speech of Adolf Hitler: “Declaration of War on the US”         <br/>3.2    Morphological Analyses of Extracted Lexical Items from War <br/>Speech of Odumegwu Ojukwu: “Ojukwu Call from Exile”     29<br/>3.3    Stems in the selected lexical items from Adolf Hitler War Speech    30<br/>3.4    Stems in the selected Lexical items from Odumegwu Ojukwu <br/>    War Speech                         <br/>3.5    Affixation                         <br/>3.5.1    Inflectional Affixes                <br/>3.3.2    Derivational Affixes                    <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>Conclusion                        <br/>Work Cited                            <br/>Appendix                                 <br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION <br/>    Language is a powerful tool of socio-political interactions in the human society. Bloch and Trager (1942:5) define language as ‘a system of arbitrary vocal symbols by means of which a social group cooperates’. According to Okolo and Ezikeojaku (2008: 10). This definition puts all emphasis on the social function of language, thus narrowing the role of language in human interaction”. Humans communicate with language. According to Longe and Ofuani “to communicate means to share”. Humans ‘share’ with language and we cannot ‘share’ if we do not ‘cooperate! Hence ‘UNDERSTANDING in Longe and Ofuani  (2008:1) is needed to ‘cooperate’. That is “we must agree on or come to an absolute understanding about the rules that govern whatever we are sharing” (Longe and Ofuani). <br/>    However, language depends on the context of situation for it to be meaningful. A particular human language is designed for a specific purpose and situation.  A language for war is different from a language of marriage. This is because the two events occur in   different situation. Hence, Halliday (1976: 28) uses the term situation to mean the environment in which the language we use comes to life and becomes meaningful. More on language will be looked at, in the subsequent sub-topic. <br/>    Perhaps, this work is titled: Grammatical Analysis of war speeches (Adolf Hitler and Ojukwu) and it is very necessary we unveil something about their lives. <br/>1.1    LIFE OF ADOLF HITLER <br/>    Adolf Hitler, the leader of the Nazi Germany was born April 20th 1889 in a small Austrian town called Braunau, near the border of Germany. Hitler was not popular at school and he made few friends. He rarely performed well at school work. Adolf Hitler came from a very poor background. His father showed him no care unlike his mother who cared so much about him. His encounter with the Jews at his miserable early age made him grew some kind of hatred far the Jews in the future. Hitler was a very good orator. He incited the second war. He died in 1945. <br/>1.2    LIFE OF ODUMEGWU OJUKWU<br/>    Odumegwu-Ojukwu was born on 4th of November 1933 at Zungeru in Northern Nigeria. He was one of the first and few University graduates to join the army. Ojukwu was the brain behind the emancipation of Biafra Republic. His dream never came to reality though. He died on 26th November 2011 in the United Kingdom after a brief illness, aged 78. <br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>    This work is aimed to do the grammatical analyses of war speeches. Data from Hitler’s was speech titled. “Declaration of war on the U.S” and Ojukwu’s war speech titled. “Ojukwu Call from Exile” will be used as case studies. <br/>1.4    SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>    This work will cover the syntactic and morphological analyses of war speeches of Adolf Hitler titled ‘Declaration of War on US’ and Odumegwu Ojukwu title: “Ojukwu Call from Exile”. In syntax we will look at the following. <br/>i.    Structural sentence types in the selected war speeches <br/>ii.    Functional types of sentences in the selected war speeches <br/>iii.    Sentence/clause patterns in the selected war speeches <br/>iv.    The complex noun phrase in the selected war speeches. <br/>In the second part of the work we will deal with morphological analysis of selected lexical, items in the war speeches. We will look at; <br/>i.    Morphemes <br/>ii.    Stem <br/>iii.    Root <br/>iv.    Affixes <br/>v.    Inflectional <br/>vi.    Derivations <br/>1.5    METHODOLOGY<br/>    The war speeches that are to be used are majorly online sources. We will use Quirk et al method in the syntactic analyses of the war speeches. S.H Tomori morphological analyses pattern will also be adopted or employed in the morphological analyses of the selected war speeches. <br/>1.6    THEORETICAL BACKGROUND<br/>    The science of language is known as linguistics. It includes what are generally distinguished as descriptive linguistics and historical linguistics. <br/>    Hall (1968: 158) defines language as “the institution whereby humans communicate and interact with each other by means of habitually used oral-auditory symbols”. Language here is treated as a purely human institution, that is, that language used by a particular society is part of that society’s culture. Ideas, feelings, emotions etc are ‘communication’; the definition above refers to the fact that language is a process by which information is exchanged between individuals through a common system of symbols, signs or behavior. ‘Interactions’ that is introduced seems to be preferred to “cooperation” used by Bloc and Trager because language actually involves mutual or reciprocal action., <br/>    Moreover, communication can be simply be regarded as the act of transferring information from one place to another. The desired outcome or goal of any communication understands. The process of interpersonal communication cannot be regarded as a phenomena which simply ‘happens’ but should be seen as a process which involves participants negotiating their role in this process, whether consciously or unconsciously. Effective communication involves minimizing potential misunderstanding and overcoming any barriers to communication at each stage in the communication process. Successful encoding of messages is a vital skill in effective communication. Once received, the receivers need to decode the message, and successful decoding is a vital skill. If that be the case, the communicator then needs to speak in the language of the listener. A medical Jargon will be useless in a gathering of literary elites. Language in communication should be in accordance with the context of the situation or else it will lose it linguistic value. Lets see what then is language variety. <br/>    Longe quoted Catford (1965:84) in his work; Studies in the varieties of language (1995; 15) that “A language variety is a sub-set correlates (regularly) with a particular type of socio-situational feature”. Tom Mc Arthur in the Oxford Companion to English Language (1992) defines variety as “use-related varieties, associated with function, such as legal English (the language of courts, contracts, etc) and literary English (the typical usage of literary texts, conversation etc)”. The main point in the above definitions is that language varies according to the situation. According to Halliday (1976:28). “Situation means the environment in which the language we use comes to life and becomes meaningful”. Then the idea of register sets in which according to Gregory is “The linguistic reflection of recurrent characteristics of the users use of language in situation”. This means a register is a variety of a language used for a particular purpose or in a particular setting. The language of war is definitely different from the language of marriage. The lexis, choice of words, tone etc used in time of war is different from that of love. This is because the two are of different contextual situation. <br/>    The language of war is kind of technical, complex and strict. The speaker is normally business minded – no time for frivolity in speech. When spoken, the language of war is usually tensed. The tone is high. While written as in speeches, the sentences as in speeches, the sentences are so long. We find declarative sentences in most war speeches as we will see later in the war speeches of Adolf Hitler and Ojukwu respectively. Their sentence contain structurally simple but also long, complex and compound sentences. We will look more into these in the subsequent sub topic. <br/>1.7    LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>    Various authors and institutions have written on varieties of language. A look at some of these authors is therefore necessary. A Nigerian linguist, Prof. V.U. Longe in his work Studies in the varieties of Language discusses the use of language in an official context, with a focus on the Nigeria civil service. He is of the opinion that it is misleading to give the impression that there is a civil service language because there is varying linguistic and stylistic makers of language from one civil language to another. He went further to say that civil service English refers to the language of the administrative group because it meditates between the government and the governed. Hence, he focuses on describing the language used by the administrative group. Longe states that minutes, letters, memoranda, briefs and notices are the major modes of communication used in the Nigerian civil service. This is based on the information he got through administered questionnaires. <br/>    In analyzing his data Longe used discourse features, pragmatic features and textual features to determine the language of the administrative group in the Nigerian civil service. <br/>    G.L. Brooks (1973) also wrote in the area of officialese, where he divided officialese into two broad groups. The ceremonial and the language used by the civil servants in the communication with one another and with the public. He too is of the opinion that this kind of English has its distinctive markers. He says that the language of civil service is predominantly complex with complex sentences. <br/>    Martin Joos (1962), in one prominent model describes five styles in spoken English. He talked of unchanging such as Biblical quotations of certain archaism. Examples are: the pledge of allegiance, wedding vows and other statues. He also talked consultative where two ways participation and background information is provided prior knowledge is not assured. Back channel behavior such as ‘uh’, ‘hu’ ‘I see’ etc is common. Interruptions are allowed. Examples are, teacher/student, doctor/patient, expert/apprentice. He also mentioned casual, such as group friends and acquaintances where no background information is provided. Ellipsis and slangs are common. <br/>    Eloghene Oganah (2003) wrote on the language of aviation, where he picked out the already laid out features of ICAO, and march then in relation to their functions (communication and linguistic). He also found out the linguistic factors responsible for communication in the aviation language which according Jones Kent and Laird Ketty led to several crashes and near crashes both in the past and the present. <br/>    Okoma Ogochukwu (2011) wrote on the language of television news broadcast. She collected data from Edo Broadcasting service and Nigeria Television Authority. She looked at the word formation and phrase types and found out that affixation occurs more often in the language than other word formation processes. <br/>1.8    THESIS STATEMENT<br/>    Through the manipulation of syntactic and morphological elements, Adolf Hitler and Odumegwu Ojukwu rouse their audience and with their sympathy respectively.  <br/><br/>\n\nGRAMMATICAL ANALYSIS OF WAR SPEECHES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " GRAMMATICAL ANALYSIS OF WAR SPEECHES", "id": 4}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EMANCIPATION IN BERNARD SHAW’S ARMS AND THE MAN AND MOLIERE’S TARTUFFE<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0  Introduction    -    -    -<br/>1.1    Purpose of Study-    -    <br/>1.2    Scope of Study-    -    <br/>1.3    Methodology-    -    -    -    -<br/>1.4    Theoretical Background    -    <br/>1.5  Review of Related Scholarship  and Justification of Study    <br/>1.6 Thesis Statement    -    -<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/> SOCIO-POLITICAL EMANCIPATION    <br/>2.1 The Need for Individual Liberty    -<br/>2.2 Freedom and Equality as Nuclei for Human Value     -<br/>2.3 Triumph over Social Class Barriers -    -<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>INTELLECTUAL AND ECONOMIC EMANCIPATION    <br/>3.1 Enlightenment as a Drive for Freedom    -    -<br/>3.2 Agitation for a Capitalist Economy: The key to Financial Emancipation    <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>STRATEGIES EMPLOYED IN THE QUESTS FOR EMANCIPATION<br/>4.1 Self-Determination     -    -    -<br/>4.2 Pursuit of Financial Empowerment -    -    <br/>4.3 Freedom of Expression     -    -    <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>Conclusion    -    -<br/>Works Cited    -    -    -<br/> Chapter One<br/>1.0   INTRODUCTION:<br/>1.5       Purpose of Study:<br/>This study sets out to examine emancipation as depicted in Bernard Shaw’s Arms and the Man and Moliere’s Tartuffe and also the strategies the playwrights employ to explore intellectual, socio-political and financial emancipation. The choice of these texts is based on the fact that both playwrights present characters from the lower class who seek freedom from the tough and oppressive grips of people in the upper class. <br/>1.6    Scope of Study:<br/>This essay concentrates on Bernard Shaw’s Arms and the Man and Moliere’s Tartuffe. Only the aspects of the texts which contribute to the subject-matter of emancipation are studied.<br/>1.7    Methodology:<br/>This research adopts a qualitative approach because it is based on content analysis of excerpts. The primary texts are read and relevant articles from online and print journals are cited. The emancipatory excerpts from the texts are studied based on Sigmund Freud’s Psychoanalytical Theory.<br/>1.8     Theoretical Background:<br/>This study is based on Sigmund Freud’s Psychoanalytical Criticism which centres on the human mind and personality make-up that account for liberation quests. The mind may be dormant or awake but whichever state it is in contributes largely to human actions. Freud argues that, ‘…if in such a division of personality, consciousness remains constantly bound up with one of the two states, this is called conscious mental state, and the other the unconscious’(10).When the mind is conscious, man becomes sensitive to happenings around him. <br/>Over the years, Freud has developed different models of the human psyche. The first one is the Dynamic Model which contains the conscious (the rational) and the unconscious (the irrational) parts of the mind. Charlse E. Bressler explains this model thus:<br/>The conscious, Freud argued, perceives and records external reality and is the reasoning part of the mind. Unaware of the presence of the unconscious, we operate consciously, believing that our reasoning and analytical skills are solely responsible for our behaviour. Nevertheless Freud is the first to suggest that it is the unconscious, not the conscious, that governs a large part of our actions. (121)<br/>This model explains the interplay between the mindset of a man and his actions. With the pressing need to expand his argument, Freud develops a second model which is known as the Economic Model. It contains the pleasure and the reality principle which Bressler captures in these words:<br/>…the pleasure principle craves only pleasures, and it desires instantaneous satisfaction of instinctual drives, ignoring moral and sexual boundaries established by society. The pleasure principle is held in check, however, by the reality principle, that part of the psyche that recognizes the need for societal standards and regulations on pleasure. Freud believed that both these principles are at war within the human psyche. (122)         <br/>Freud,in this model, asserts that the human race in different societies has societal values that often conflict with man’s self-interest. For the sake of normalcy, the reality principle places a check on the pleasure principle. Based on this model, Freud further explains his studies on the human mind in his Topographical Model which Bressler quotes below:<br/>Freud separated the human psyche into three parts: the conscious, the preconscious, and the unconscious. The conscious is the mind’s direct link to external reality, for it perceives and reacts with the external environment, allowing the mind to order its outside world. The preconscious is the store house of the memories that the conscious part of the mind allows to be brought to consciousness without disguising these memories in some form or another. As in his previously devised models, Freud contends that the third part of the psyche, the unconscious, holds the repressed hungers, images, thoughts, and desires of human nature. (122)<br/>Once again, this model, like others, agrees with the fact that the human psyche (mind) relates with physical actions that everyone engages in. Bressler  summarises the Tripartite Model, the last psychological model put forward by Freud thus:  <br/>This model divides the psyche into three parts: the id, the ego, and the super-ego . The irrational, instinctual, unknown and unconscious part of the psyche Freud calls the id. Containing our secret desires, our darkest wishes, and our most intense fears, the id wishes to fulfill only the urges of the pleasure principle. In addition, it houses the libido, the source of all our psychosexual desires and all our psychic energy…. The second part, Freud names the ego, the rational, logical, waking part of the mind, although many of its activities remain in the unconscious. Whereas the id operates according to the pleasure principle, the ego operates in harmony with the reality principle. It is the ego’s job to regulate the instinctual desires of the id and to allow these desires to be released in some non destructive way… the third part of the psyche, the superego, acts like an internal censor, causing us to make normal judgment in light of social pressures. (122-3)<br/>The tripartite model clearly demonstrates how the mind aids every human action. Without the ego performing a check and balance function, the id can easily prompt reckless actions. <br/>The psychoanalytical approach to literary interpretation, analysis and evaluation of literary texts is looked at from another scholar’s point of view. The perception of James S. Nairne is sampled in this essay since it is somehow different from Bressler’s. Nairne makes critical efforts to link Freud’s psychoanalytical concept to human personality which is related in one way or the other to the quest for emancipation. Russell Keat agrees that there is a link between psychoanalysis and human emancipation. This is contained in these words, ‘There may be senses or forms of freedom that are incompatible with determinism. My suggestion is only that we can understand the idea of psychoanalysis as an emancipatory process’(14). Freud’s Psychoanalytical theory dwells on the human mind and how it interacts with the outside world. This view is supported by Nairne’s argument which states that, ‘we ultimately control our own behavioral destiny, personality reflects our uniqueness as well as our environment and personal view of the world’ (399). The mind, according to Nairne, controls and coordinates the quests for a better place in society. Unlike Bressler who dwells on just the models which explain the components of our minds, Nairne points out Freud’s models that influence the human mind and personality. According to him:<br/>Freud believed the human mind can be divided into three major parts: the  conscious, the preconscious, and the unconscious. The conscious mind contains the contents of current awareness-those things that occupy the focus of your attention at the moment. The preconscious mind contains inactive but accessible thoughts and memories-those things that you could easily recall, if desired, but are simply not thinking about the moment .Finally the unconscious mind houses all the memories, urges and conflict that are beyond awareness. Freud believed that the contents of the unconscious mind exert powerful and long-lasting influences on behaviour, despite the fact that they are hidden and unavailable to consciousness. (388)<br/>Nairne strongly believes that the conscious, the unconscious and the preconscious parts of the human psyche control the mind, the seat of reasoning while the id, ego and superego control human personality. Nairne extends the frontier of his argument by saying that:<br/>Freud believes that human personality consists of three parts, the id, ego and the superego. He was convinced that each of us is born with powerful instinctual drives, particularly related to sex and aggression, which motivate and control our actions. Freud used the term id to represent the portion of personality that is governed by these forces (translated from Latin, id means “it”). As a component of personality, the id seeks immediate satisfaction of natural urges without concern for the morals and customs of society… the superego is the part of our personality that encourages us to act in an ideal fashion-to act in accordance with the moral customs defined  by parents and culture. The superego is acquire from experience and it acts, in part, as a conscience; it makes us feel good when we act the way we should and feel guilty when our behaviour strays from acceptable standards… Sitting between the forces of the id and the superego, and acting as a mediator, is the third component of personality-the ego. The ego which comes from the Latin word for “I”, serves as an executive role in Freud’s conception of personality. The ego encourages you to act with reason and deliberation and helps you conform to the requirements of the external world. (389)<br/>This means that the human personality and how it works can be decoded using Freud’s concept of human psychology. Every action human beings take can be traced back to the interaction among the id, the ego and the super-ego. Having explained Freud’s components of the mind from the point of view of Nairne and Bressler, that of M.H Abrams and Geoffrey Galt Harpham is also looked at. Abrams and Harpham state that psychoanalytical criticism, ‘deals with a work of literature primarily as an expression, in an indirect and fictional form, of the state of mind and the structure of personality of the individual author’ (289). This means that this theory has the power to mirror the hidden contents of authors’ minds and characters’ personalities. The strength of each person’s personality accounts for certain actions taken in the face of restriction. To support Abram and Harpham’s assertion, Catherine E. Seta et al say that, ‘a person’s actions reflect his/her underlying personality’ (369). This statement is valid because everybody walks, talks and acts based on how he or she perceives life. In other words, each person’s personality is proportionally related to his or her mental function.<br/>Having examined the comments of scholars on Freud’s Psychoanalytical theory, it is necessary to state the place of the theory in this study. The force that triggers or propels anyone into action lies in his or her mental make-up. This force is tied around the id, ego and super-ego. Freud strongly believes that certain human wishes are locked behind the unconscious part of the mind and with undue pressure from the outside world, society, the id explodes into actions especially when the ego and super-ego cannot suppress its quest. It is on this account that this study examines some characters’ quests for emancipation in the primary texts. That is, based on Freud’s Psychoanalytical tenets, efforts are put together to decipher the disguised motives and wishes of characters chosen as literary specimens for this study. Attempts are made to reveal the contents of these characters’ personalities and mental states especially the premises and procedures they subscribe to in their struggles for emancipation. Therefore, the concepts of Freud’s psychoanalysis are used to understand what motivates characters’ emancipatory moves in Shaw’s Arms and the Man and Moliere’s Tartuffe. The positions of Nairne on Freud’s Psychoanalytical Criticism and that of Keats which states that ‘we can understand the idea of psychoanalysis as an emancipatory process’ are largely relied on in this study.   <br/>1.5    Review of Related Scholarship  and Justification of Study:<br/>Arms and the Man (Arms) is an important play of the 20th century. As a literary portrait of the era, it is considered a key text because it clearly documents contemporary happenings especially in Europe. One of the unspeakable events of the 20th century is war and Shaw in this play clearly depicts popular opinions people hold about war then. For instance, Stephen N.  Matsuba observes that the issue of war permeates the play. He puts this thus:<br/>War is a highly visible element of Arms and the Man. The first act deals almost exclusively with Sergius cavalry charge at Silvnitza, and while the war between the Serbians and Bulgarians is over at the beginning of the second act, the business of war continues into the third.Sergius announces his resignation from the army(act 2,30).Petkoff asks Bluntschli for help in  drafting the orders for sending three cavalry regiments to Philipopolis (act 2,44),and act three opens with Bluntschli writing the orders and sending Sergius and Petkoff off to give these to the messengers(act 3,51).Moreover,the two principal male characters, Sergius and Bluntschli; never remove their uniforms,and Petkoff does not change into civilian clothing until the final act. Many critics perceived war as an important theme in the play. (8) <br/>Shaw explores the issue of war that is peculiar to the 20th century and this has rightly been pointed out by Matsuba’s comment above. Shaw does not see war as what should be celebrated. As a matter of fact, he wrote Arms to challenge Virgil’s glorification of war in the poem ‘The Aeneid’ which begins with, ‘I sing of arms and of a man.’  May Ahmed Majeed agrees with the assertion that Shaw frowns at war. This he notes when he says that, ‘like other important subjects that affect society, Shaw in Arms and the Man takes up war for a satiric treatment. He criticizes a society that looks to war as a noble adventure’(435-6). Shaw indeed uses Bluntschli to trivialiSe the heroism attached to war. By carrying chocolate instead of cartridges inside his gun, he disregards war as legendary. Muhammad Iqbal and Amjad Ali thus describe Blunctschli in the light of Charles Darwins’ survival of the fittest’ assertion. Iqbal  and Ali hold that:<br/>Bluntschli, of course is the character opposed to Sergius in the play. Whereas Sergius aspires towards a heroic death, Bluntschli’s interest is in living as long as possible: “ It is our duty to live as long as we can” and to preserve his life, he is prepared to perform acts which a Darwinian like Sergius would reject out of hand, such as obtaining the protection of a woman by threatening to shame her. Bluntschli is thus prepared to adapt to the world in order to survive. (Web)<br/>Iqbal and Ali are of the view that a reasonable man should strive to survive and not involve himself in wars which are destructive. They see Sergius as an idealist and Bluntschli as a realist. To support their view, they quote from Arthur Granz that, ‘ Arms and the Man for Arthur Ganz denigrates the romantic dream of military glory. Bluntschli represents reality while Sergius stands for illusion’ (231). Shaw, as a satirist, tries to purge his society’s excesses and expose the danger violence holds for those who use it to achieve their goals. Azher Suleman notes that:<br/>Shaw chose to set his place in the midst of a foreign war, in part so that he would offer some commentary about war. His purpose in this play is to attack the romantic notion of war and love by presenting a more realistic depiction of war, devoid of the idea that such death and destruction are both noble and romantic. These deconstructions make Arms and the Man a satirical comedy about those who would glorify the horrors of war and romanticism of love. However, Shaw was dedicated throughout his life to curbing violence especially that of war, and Arms and the Man was one of the vehicles he used to plead his case. (62)<br/>As Suleman rightly points out above, war is so much glorified that army generals and powerful world leaders venture into it with pride. A popular dictum employed by the 20th century propagandists to plunge people into war is ‘dulce et decorum est pro patria mori’ ( it is sweet and glorious to die for your country). This statement is taken from Horace’s  ‘Odes’ and Wilfred Owen who also detests war like Shaw claims the statement is deceitful. He notes this in his poem entitled ‘Dulce et Decorum Est.’ After highlighting the destructive effects of the First World War, he concludes the poem by saying: <br/>        My friend, you would not tell with such high zest<br/>To children ardent for some desperate glory,<br/>The old lie, Dulce et Decorum est<br/> Pro patria mori. (line 26-9)<br/>While Owen attacks Horace’s adoration of  war through this poem, Shaw does the same through Arms. He uses the character of Bluntschli to mock the quests for glory through war. Majeed, quoting the words of Ivans Wilson, says that, ‘ lvans Wilson argued that ‘ modern war taught us that Shaw was largely right. Bluntschli is certainly not a heroic figure; he has joined as a mercenary, and for him war is a regrettable necessity, not a chance to obtain glory.’ Later Sergius realizes that soldiering is ‘the coward art’ (436).Wilson’s comment shows that war is simply all about murderous activities. It only plunges people into pain that is not justifiable. Those who become super heroes as a result of the war they fight achieve nothing but what Lucius Sergius Catiline calls ‘mournful victory’ (82).Williams Mackintire Salter also describes Arms as, ‘a burlesque on war, or rather on the romantic ideals of war (and indeed on romanticism in general): we have a very unconventional picture of the ordinary soldier to whom war is a trade like any other and who finds chocolate quite as practical as cartridges’ (451). Salter’s  description of war shows that it is not an ideal way to win honour. Moreover, he sees soldiering as a less noble profession. This means that war can only bring mournful victories to those who subscribe to it as a way of obtaining  honour. Anna Manevik also argues in this direction that , ‘in Arms and the Man, however, where the idealized image of the military is a central theme, the playwright questions and mocks the whole concepts of heroic soldiers’(7). Manevik clearly condemns war because it is destructive. She does not see it as a way of asserting one’s personality. She commends Bluntschli’s display of maturity in his bid to assert his strength of personality. She explains that: <br/>Arms and the Man is considered to be a satire on love, war and heroism, but, as I have demonstrated, it can also be considered a poignant critique of notion of hegemonic masculinity as such. My interpretation of the play is that one of the things that Shaw wanted to convey was a message that there are alternative ways for men to gain respect and be considered highly masculine than through violence, economic power and oppression. Captain Bluntschli is the perfect example of a strong and skillful man who could have reached power and status through violent, economic and oppressive methods if he had chosen to do so. (18)<br/>Manevik considers Bluntschli a realist, one who is guided by an honourable dignity that sets him above Sergius. Shahzad Ahmad Siddiqui and Syed Asad Raza support this view in their observations .They say that: <br/>Arms and the Man is a wonderful play by Bernard Shaw that reflects wonderfully the element of realism. In this play, Shaw attacks genially the romantic notion of war and love. He has adopted a realistic approach in depicting every day activities which were common those days. Here Shaw attacks the social follies of society in order to bring a positive change for which he received criticism. (48)<br/>Siddiqui and Raza hold that those who try as much as possible to be practical and objective about life often end up triumphantly. Bluntschli fits into this description because he acts on reasons and not emotion or any romantic ideology. Therefore, he is a leading realist in the play. This explains why he readily shares the opinion of Louka who discusses life with him on a realistic note. <br/>    Fatemeh Azizmohammadi and Zohreh Tayari examine Arms beyond the scope of war. They look at the play from the angles of sex and gender differentiation. They say that, ‘There is masculinity in Louka’s character while annoying Nicola.She reveals her control through her interaction with Sergius. Mrs Petkoff also shows masculinity in controlling household work in the absence of her husband’(8). Louka, though a woman and a maid, has the right personality make-up to assert her place in her society. She puts Nicola and Raina  where they belong and nobody, not even Major Petkoff and Catherine, can stop her from marrying Sergius who is already engaged to Raina. Catherine also acts in the capacity of a husband over her household. It is on this note  Majeed says that ‘Shaw was among the limited number of men who supported the principle of equality between man and woman. Most of his heroines have the characteristics of the new woman. They are independent in spirit, self-confident, clear headed, morally courageous and emotionally well controlled’ (434). Azizmohammadi and Tayari, commenting on Shaw’s treatment of social class say that, ‘In Arms and the Man, Shaw portrays higher classes that control and rule over the lower classes through power, fear and custom’ (7). Indeed, right from the Victorian Era into the 20th century, class consciousness has ruled Europe. The upper class lord it  over the lower class members who are not expected to complain. This is the very situation Nicola finds himself.  Louka, unlike Nicola, fights to set herself free from the grip of the rich.<br/> Moliere’s Tartuffe has also enjoyed critics’ attention though many of the reviews are  written in French. However, the few translated into or written in English are cited in this essay. Most critics examine Tartuffe mainly as a work of literature challenging religious hypocrisy. One of such scholars is Edgar V. Roberts. He describes the double standard of Tartuffe thus:<br/>You have heard that what you do speaks louder than what you say.  The same is true in literature, and sometimes actions illustrate important character traits. An author may create a character who professes honesty yet does dishonorable things. Uriah Heep in David Copperfied and Tartuffe in Moliere’s play Le Tartuffe have such characteristics. (12-13)<br/>Roberts’ comment shows that Moliere’s apt use of irony shows the two sides of Tartuffe (with his hypocritical tendency) . Edgar Johnson who also looked at Tartuffe from Roberts’ point of view says, ‘Let Orgon be hypothesized by Tartuffe and his own cowardly superstition into becoming blind and cruel  to his own family, and Moliere will pepper him with follies of stinging arrows’ (197). Johnson describes Moliere as an active satirist who does not turn a blind eye to any form of vice. He uses the character of Tartuffe to expose the antics of pretenders and that of Orgon to condemn gullibility among those who blindly follow the likes of Tartuffe. Moliere considers the moral sensibility of men and women of his time to be important. He believes that literature must improve the morality of people. It is on this note that Gerry McCarthy says:<br/>In his few critical writings Moliere occasionally argues the value of comedy in evoking moral problems and behaviours which may serve as examples of the pitfalls which attach to our everyday life in society. He also stresses repeatedly, pleasure. He was expected by those hostile to theatre to attempt a justification of the dangers of that pleasure and that justification was sought in the common place that the moral effect of the stage was aversive. (xvi-xvii)<br/>McCarthy sees Tartuffe as a fun seeker and a deceiver who will stop at nothing in his bid to enjoy maximum pleasure at the expense of his helpers. Many religious leaders condemn Moliere for what they see as an attack on Christianity but in the preface to Tartuffe, Moliere justifies himself when he says that comedy ‘corrects men’s vice by means of agreeable lessons’ (308).<br/>    In a comparative study of Tartuffe and Blifil in Henry Fielding’s The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, James E. Evans says Tartuffe , ‘can be read as ridiculing not only hypocritical piety but also excessive piety, such as actions by those less consciously deceptive then Tartuffe or Blifil, whose excesses imply corresponding defects. As W.D Howarth points out, Tartuffe ‘was objected to by sincere churchmen of all shades of opinion and surely with every justification’ (103). Evans sees Tartuffe as an impostor who is a stain on the Christian faith. To support his claim, he quotes the comment of W.D. Howarth. Both Evans and Howarth therefore, conclude that religion has been used by many false teachers to defraud their followers. The statement of Karl Marx, ‘religion is the opium of the people’ is relevant here. Orgon and his mother  see Tartuffe as a holy man and in turn, Tartuffe plays on their ignorance by duping the Orgons’ household. Michael Hawcroft also studies Tartuffe from the point view of religion. His work which is based on the religious content of Cleante’s speech explains that, ‘Moliere makes Cleante express certain views of religious devotion simply because they are the artistic opposite of Tartuffe’s exaggerated and false piety’ (79). Hawcroft is of the view that Moliere has presented Cleante as Tartuffe’s rival or contrast. Cleante uses his sermonising speeches to counter the hypocritical speeches of Tartuffe. On the contrary, Hawcroft has identified some critics whose opinions counter  his. He lists and quotes their arguments thus:<br/>Other critics are quick to find fault with Cleante and turn him into a ridiculous character in his own right. The list of alleged vices is long. Peacock finds him prolix, overly rhetorical and cowering. Fargher thinks he is unimpressive, cowardly, and inept. For Herzel, he is self-important, long-winded; “a ridiculous meddling bore”. Eustis is emphatic that Cleante is a ‘comic figure.’ (79)<br/>Cleante, according to the critics in the quotation above quote, is not a perfect man himself. He is seen as a mere clown who attacks Tartuffe simply to protect his own relations. Hawcroft, however, concludes his study of Cleante’s characterization by saying  that:<br/> The critical dichotomy between eloquent sage and foolish bore, to which discussion of Ariste and Chrysalde have accustomed us, is once again evident in the case of Cleante. But since critical views of Cleante are also coloured by the various modern attitudes to the controversy which Tartuffe provokes, it is important to understand Cleante’s role in the context of this controversy. (79)<br/> The personality of Cleante is controversial and this explains why scholars view him differently. While Hawcroft sees him as a redeemer, others like Peacock, Fargher, Herzel and Eustis are of the opinion that Cleante is merely a clown whose argument cannot sway that of Tartuffe, the crafty impostor. <br/>    From the available critical comments on Shaw’s Arms and Moliere’s Tartuffe, it is clear that no work has been done on the concept of emancipation. For Arms, scholars have mainly studied it from the angle of war and militarism and somehow from the socio-political point of view. No critic has studied the minor characters’ quests for emancipation. In the case of Moliere’s Tartuffe, scholars have mainly dwelt on its religious contents. In other words, the works found on the text are based on how Moliere uses Tartuffe to satirise religious hypocrisy of his time. Consequently, this study offers a fresh literary investigation which focuses on the concept of emancipation as explored in the text. As a departure from other studies, Freud’s Psychoanalytic criticism is employed to offer a new insight into the study of our primary texts. Therefore, this study presents itself viable as nothing has been done in this direction. This is to the best of the researcher’s knowledge which is based on the available literature reviewed above.<br/>1.6 Thesis Statement:<br/>Self-determination, the pursuit of financial empowerment and freedom of expression are fundamental to the quests for socio-political, intellectual and economic emancipation in Bernard Shaw’s Arms and Molere’s Tartuffe.<br/><br/>\n\nEMANCIPATION IN BERNARD SHAW’S ARMS AND THE MAN AND MOLIERE’S TARTUFFE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EMANCIPATION IN BERNARD SHAW’S ARMS AND THE MAN AND MOLIERE’S TARTUFFE", "id": 5}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CHINWETALU AGU’S ECPHONESIS: ITS RELEVANCE TO THE THEMATIC PREOCCUPATION OF THE SELECTED MOVIES<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The ecphonesis Chinwetalu Agu employs in movies are not just mere phrases, clichés, slangs or mere hilarious comments but are of immense relevance to the realization of the theme of the movies where he employs them. This research discusses the various roles which the ecphonesis play in realizing the theme of the selected five Nollywood movies to include; message transmission, cohesion marking and incitement of emotions. In the second chapter where the role of ecphonesis in the transmission of messages is treated, societal background and context are identified as necessary tools that contribute to the effective transmission of the messages encoded in the ecphonesis. In the third chapter, Chinwetalu Agu’s ecphonesis is established as a unifying device in the movies where they are employed. Whereas the themes of the movies are broader and stretches through the entire movie, the ecphonesis which Agu utters repeatedly stitches the plot of the movie together, for the purpose of the realization of the themes. The third chapter of this essay explores how the ecphonesis incites emotions through the diction of the ecphonesis and the tone of the actor.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>Purpose of Study    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>Scope of Study    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>Research Methodology    -    -    -    -    -    - <br/>About the Actor    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>Theoretical Background    -    -    -    -    -<br/>Literature Review    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>Thesis Statement    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.1 Cultural and Societal Significance    -    -    -    -<br/>2.2 Ecphonesis and Context    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.1 Unity of Ideas    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>3.2 Emphasis through Repetition    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.1 Tone and Diction as Emotion Facilitators    -    -    -<br/>4.2 Facilitating Catharsis through Situational Irony    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>Conclusion    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>Work Cited    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1 PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>This research is undertaken for several reasons. Firstly, it sets to find out whether the ecphonesis Chinwetalu Agu employs in movies have any relevance to the thematic pre-occupation of the movies. Since elements of art are meant to enhance the over-all engagement of the particular piece of art. Chinwetalu Agu's ecphonesis is not an exception. Are they merely catch-phrases or do they serve as any form of enhancement to the themes? And if they are truly relevant, what are the various functions they perform? This research brings to fore the unsung creativity in the Nollywood industry. Such knowledge will change people's negative perception about the industry and make more researchers interested in working on other areas of creativity in Nollywood.<br/>1.2 SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>Movies that starred Chinwetalu Agu constitute materials for this study. Five of such movies are selected at random for this research. This is because it is too ambitious studying each of the about seven hundred and seventy-two movies that the actor has acted. The five selected movies provide an insight on the actor’s use of ecphonesis. This is as a result of the actor’s employment of different ecphonesis at different instances in them. The movies employ in this study are selected because Chinwetalu Agu had played major roles in them and so had applied ecphonesis in them. As it is discovered in the course of this research that some movies, where he played minor roles are devoid of them. Furthermore, the five movies are the ones accessible for this research through YouTube, as getting them in VCD format proved to be a bad idea. This is because the motion pictures are usually cracked by misuse or use of substandard materials in their production. Hence, the movies used in this study include: Village Dreamers, Spiritual Mama, Goal Goal, Trouble Husband and Catechist.<br/>1.3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>The methods employed in carrying out this research involve a qualitative and subjective study of the five selected Nollywood movies. Firstly, the movies are viewed attentively. This allows for familiarization with the text. Secondly, the ecphonesis and the instances where Chinwetalu Agu has employed them are extracted onto paper. Thirdly, a subjective analysis is undertaken by relating a particular ecphonesis to the context and to the overall plot, in order to arrive at their functions in delivering the themes of the movies.<br/>1.4 ABOUT THE ACTOR<br/>A brief account of the life of the actor is deemed necessary as this research involves studying a work of art through the personality of the actor involved.<br/>According to Wikipedia, Chiwetalu Agu a native of Enugu state, Nigeria was born in 1956. As a Nollywood veteran, he combines acting, comedy and movie production. In 2012, he won the Nollywood award for 'best actor in indigenous movie'. He is unique and endeared to his fans both in Nigeria and abroad through his use of specific language slang in his films. Some other persons may choose to call those slangs, phrases or clichés or even hilarious exclamations. However, in this long essay I have chosen to call them- ecphonesis, for reasons which is subsequently explained. While asserting that comic genres is a unique means in projecting Nigerian culture and image globally as well as establishing the Nollywood brand, Prof Femi Shaka of the University of Port Harcourt lists Agu as one of the outstanding comedians who have contributed to the development of Nollywood comic genres. Agu is happily married to Nkechi and they have three sons and two daughters.<br/>Wikipedia provides an account of the actor’s early years, acting career, filmography, nominations and awards.<br/>Early years<br/>“Agu's ingenuity is evident from his early beginning at Nigerian television soap operas to his pioneering role in Nollywood. Some thirty-one years ago, television soap opera dominated television performances in Nigeria and Agu featured in many of them including: Nigerian Television Authority Channel 8 Enugu's Ikoro, produced by Joe Onyekwelu, Others include ETV Channel 50, now ESBS, soaps like BabyComeNow and Ripples (in Lagos), produced by Chico Ejiro's brother, Zeb; in the latter he played the character of Chief Abunna.”<br/>Acting career<br/>Wikipedia attest to Agu’s creative use of wit, humour, invention of specific clichés, customized slangs or phrases in every film as his contribution as one of the foremost actors in Nollywood. For his numerous fans, he is fun to watch any day. “What amazes most watchers is how he combines his well-disciplined life with the wicked or devilish roles he acts in films. Even though Agu has the versatility to play the roles of comedian, wicked or tricky person, he sometimes finds it difficult to reconcile his lifestyle with the negative roles he plays, admitting that he sometimes shed tears for his characters.”<br/>Filmography<br/>Chinwetalu Agu has been cast in numerous movies that in one of his interviews he had put the number at 727. The figure must have increased at the time of writing this long essay. Such movies according to Wikipedia include: Last Ofalla 1-4, Taboo where he played the role of Ichie Ogwu, Ripples, Return of Justice By Fire in 2008, Traditional Marriage 1 &amp; 2, Fire on the Mountain 1 &amp; 2, Dr. Thomas, Burning kingdom 1 &amp; 2 in 2007,  The Priest Must Die, The Price of Sacrifice, The Catechist, Police Recruit, Sunrise 1 &amp; 2, Old School 1-3, Honorable 1 &amp; 2, Sounds of Love 1 &amp; 2, Nkwocha, Things Fall Apart in 1986, Across the Niger, The Plain Truth 1 &amp; 2, Sounds of Love 1 &amp; 2, Church Man 1 &amp; 2 where he acted Ukpabi, Battle of the Gods 1 &amp; 2. Others include: Holy Anger 1 &amp; 2, Evil Twin, Beauty and the Beast 1-3, Price of the Wicked, Royal Messengers 1 &amp; 2, Royal Destiny 1 &amp; 2, The Maidens, etc.<br/>Awards<br/>In 2012, Agu was the winner of the maiden Nollywood Movie Awards for the best actor in an indigenous movie: for his role in Nkwocha.<br/>Nominations<br/>For his role in Nkwocha, Agu was nominated for best actor in indigenous movie in first Nollywood Movie Awards in 2012: Earlier in 2011, Agu’s role in TheMaidens had earned him a nomination for ‘the best supporting actor’ at Zulu African Film Academy Awards (ZAFAA London). Likewise, Agu’s role in AcrosstheNiger earned him a nomination in fourth annual African Movie Academy Award for the best actor in a supporting role.<br/>1.5 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND<br/>An adequate presentation of the theories that will lead to better understanding of this long essay will require the explanation of the concept of ecphonesis and the Theory of Conceptual Metaphor. These are the two main theoretical strands that lend themselves to the framing of our task in this long essay.<br/>Ecphonesis<br/>This essay prefers the employment of the word, ‘ecphonesis,’ instead of ‘exclamation’ or ‘hilarious remarks’ or ‘slangs’ or ‘clichés’ in referring to Chinwetalu Agu’s ‘catch-phrases’. Though those tags are related and can be used inter-changeably the definition of ecphonesis by authorities seems to fit Chinwetalu Agu’s catch-phrases better.<br/>According to Wikipedia, “ecphonesis is an emotional, exclamatory phrase used in poetry, drama and song. It is a rhetorical device that originated from ancient literature”. Example is when Homer Simpson said, “Oh Joy! Rapture! I got a brain!” in The Wizard of Oz.<br/>Chinwetalu Agu’s catch-phrases qualify for this definition as they are usually stretches of words that are coined to perform several functions. However, the difference is slight as Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia asserts that the two words are interchangeable and defines an ecphonesis as “a figure which consists in the use of an exclamation, question, or other form of words used interjectionally to express some sudden emotions such as joy, sorrow, fear, wonder, indignation, anger or impatience, also called exclamation”.<br/>Zimmerman in his study of Allan Poe’s works defines ecphonesis as “the rhetorical term for a vehement exclamation expressing emotions” (20). He points out that Poe’s use of ecphonesis in “The Tell-Tale Heart” is a conscious attempt to achieve a prominent artistic effect. The use of an ecphonesis in that instance enables Poe to bring to fore at least two features of his protagonist’s mental sickness: mood shifts as a lack of insight.<br/>In a study of Shakespearean drama ecphonesis is defined as, “a note of exclamation: when some great passion of mind is pathetically uttered whether it be admiration, indignation… or the like. E.g “O wretched man that I am! How unsearchable are his judgements”.  <br/>Conceptual Metaphor Theory<br/>This long essay employs the Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) in analysing the relevance of Chinwetalu Agu’s ecphonesis to the realization of the themes of the movies where they are employed. According to Wikipedia, a conceptual metaphor uses one idea and links it toanother. This is due to the belief that the language of conceptual metaphors shapes our everyday communication. CMT employ a concrete concept as target in explaining an abstract concept which is the source. This proves useful in applying to how Agu’s ecphonesis help to realize theme of the movies as the ecphonesis is concrete concept used in explaining the abstract concept of theme.<br/>The idea of a Conceptual Metaphor and a detailed examination of the underlying processes were first extensively explored by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in their work Metaphors We Live By published in 1980. The work explains how everyday language is filled with metaphors we may not always notice. An example of one of the commonly used conceptual metaphors is \"argument is war\". This metaphor shapes our language in the way we view argument as war or as a battle to be won. It is not uncommon to hear someone say \"He won that argument\" or \"I attacked every weak point in his argument\". The very way argument is thought of is shaped by this metaphor of arguments being war and battles that must be won. Argument can be seen in other ways than a battle, but we use this concept to shape the way we think of argument and the way we go about arguing.<br/>A conceptual domain can be any coherent organization of human experience. The regularity with which different languages employ the same metaphors, which often appear to be perceptually based, has led to the hypothesis that the mapping between conceptual domains corresponds to neural mappings in the brain. <br/>There are two main roles for the conceptual domains posited in conceptual metaphors:<br/>Source domain: the conceptual domain from which we draw metaphorical expressions (e.g., love is a journey).<br/>Target domain: the conceptual domain that we try to understand (e.g., love is a journey).<br/>Conceptual metaphors typically employ a more abstract concept as target and a more concrete or physical concept as their source. For instance, in the above example the concrete concept ‘journey’ (source domain) is employed in explaining the abstract concept ‘love’ (target domain). Metaphors such as 'the days [the more abstract or target concept] ahead' or 'giving my time' rely on more concrete concepts, thus expressing time as a path into physical space, or as a substance that can be handled and offered as a gift.<br/>In the analysis of Chinwetalu Agu’s ecphonesis relevance to the theme of the selected movie, the ecphonesis is the source domain which is used in realizing the theme of the movies which forms the target domain. The ecphonesis like the source domain in conceptual metaphor is a more concrete concept, for example, ‘mgbirimgba na ogene,’ which literally means ‘bells and gongs’, whereas the theme of the movies is generally an abstract concept for example, themes of religious manipulation in Village Dreamer and so on. The role the ecphonesis plays in the realization of themes of movies becomes a typical instance of the employment of a concrete concept to realize or simplify an abstract one. This approach enables an understanding that Agu’s ecphonesis are not necessarily reference to the entity or relation in some real or possible world. Instead, meaning corresponds with a concept held in the mind based on personal understanding.<br/>Lakoff’s Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) is based on cognitive semantics which holds that language is part of a more general human cognitive ability, and can therefore only describe the world as people conceive it. It is implicit that there is some difference between this conceptual world and the real world.<br/>The main tenets of cognitive semantics are very helpful in gaining an insight into Chinwetalu Agu’s ecphonesis. According to Wikipedia, cognitive semantics postulates:<br/>-That grammar manifests a conception of the world held in a culture- this helps in understanding why Agu’s ecphonesis like ‘mgbirimgba na ogene’ which literally means ‘bell and gong’ in the movie, Village Dreamer, will be taken as the actor’s free use of words by someone who does not share, either by descent or knowledge’ the African cultural and religious background. This ecphonesis applies to the concept of religion in Africa whose symbols remain the ‘gong’ for the African traditional religion and ‘bell’ for its Christian counterpart. This very ecphonesis does not apply to religion elsewhere but only has a defined territorial significance.<br/>-That knowledge of language is acquired and contextual- tells that meaning is not fixed but is acquired through the context of usage. Agu’s ecphonesis ‘ewu anwu m alulu n’isi’ not only has a different meaning when considered outside the context of the movie, Spiritual Mama, but also becomes a remark devoid of direction when considered outside the context of a father’s fear of losing his investment in his sons as a result of realizing that they are becoming irresponsible individuals in the society.   <br/>-That the ability to use language draws upon general cognitive resources and not a special language module- here cognitive semantics explains that the human mind is a bank of meaning. An understanding of Agu’s ecphonesis necessitates the utilization of the resources available to the mind through experience and imagination. If one’s life experience has always involved grown-ups and reputable men in the society washing plates for money, one would not interpret the ecphonesis ‘nma sakwa efere ozo’ in the movie Goal Goal as a remark in rejection of poverty and as embodying status uplift.   <br/>Meanwhile, cognitive semantic theories are typically built on the argument that lexical meaning is conceptual. That is, meaning is not necessarily reference to the entity or relation in some real or possible world. Instead, meaning corresponds with a concept held in the mind based on personal understanding. A trait of cognitive semantics is the recognition that meaning is not fixed but a matter of construal and conventionalization.It combines analysis of cognitive structure, conceptual structure and semantic structure. Thus cognitive semantics is by definition a cross-disciplinary approach to language where related knowledge from psychology, neurology and biology is a necessity. One immediate consequence of this redefinition is that truth cannot be described as an absolute measure but as a relative one, as pragmatic entity, which is dependent on the users and the situation. Thus meaning is no longer a function of satisfied truth-conditions, i.e., that a proposition is false does not mean that it has no meaning.<br/>If one lacks the extra lexical information surrounding the ecphonesis- nma sakwa efere ozo- that is the semantic properties brought to the surface by the words which are not usually fitted into dictionary definitions but are essential for comprehending the statement, there will be a breach of the intended transmission.<br/>If a person does not know that washing plates are for kids, servants and person of low cadre in the society, he or she will not see a full-grown father and husband performing the task as out of place and will fail to see the function of the ecphonesis. Similarly if the audience of the movie belong to a culture or society where a man sleeping with a woman for money is deemed socially fit. That very audience won’t find any link between the act and the derogatory ecphonesis of washing plates (no pun intended).  For there to be a communication to the hearer of the ecphonesis there should be a derivation in culture, institutions, attitudes, beliefs, typical practices and characteristic artefacts.<br/>1.6 LITERATURE  REVIEW    <br/>There is an insignificant research going on in Nollywood films. This is responsible for several reasons. Jonathan Haynes in an essay titled, “Literature Review: Nigerian and Ghanaian videos” in Haynes review and annotated bibliography points out that academic literature on Nigerian films are but few, he reveals that scholars on films in Nigeria hardly make reference to others but however admitted that the comatose in Nollywood industry over the decade negatively affected academic criticism of Nigerian films (111).<br/>The conspicuous neglect of Nollywood is as a result of what these intelligentsias termed the “exhaustible nature” of Nollywood films. They argued that for criticism to worth its salt, the text must be inexhaustible, having the ability to have multi-dimensional approaches to it, and most importantly must be able to generate arguments and controversies.<br/>Biodun Jeyifo said, “For everything in Nollywood is cheap to the point of excess. In plain terms, and as far as I am aware and in well documented comparative profiles of the national film traditions of the planet, Nollywood leads the rest of the world in how cheaply, how quickly and how effortlessly films are produced and released.”<br/>Film critics such as Akande and Iroh have condemned the overall quality and narrative value of Nigerian films for several additional reasons. Iroh, for instance, condemns the “poverty of creativity, ideas, innovation and a coordinated strategic plan” in the industry. Akande, on the other hand, believes that the content of Nollywood film is predictable and always revolves around topics like, “conflict between mother-in-law and their son’s wives, scenes dealing with police battling criminals, burial and consultations with native doctors and so on”. However, most of these comments rest on personal references rather than an objective evaluation of the industry.<br/>Speaking with Uyi Etiosa, an English and Literature under-graduate student of the University of Benin, the scholar admitted that he has never thought of doing any research on Nollywood because he does not see Nollywood as a veritable area that will yield good research results. When asked if he has been following Nollywood or patronising them recently, he concluded he could not bring himself to watch Nollywood films for what he calls nauseating production. This reveal the fact that most of the scholars have lost touch with Nollywood owing to its formal reputation for recklessness; and are unaware of the revolution going on in Nollywood industry.<br/>Anotherschool of thought believes that the industry has done remarkable well and should be patronized. Tayo Elesin remarks that “I think Nigeria movies are getting better and better every day. That is an industry that is about 20 years and it has recorded remarkable progress in time frame. However he admonished and hopes that “…with more training for actors, producers, directors and structure put in place, the industry has the ability to make more progress in future. For instance, we need agents and managers who will deal with contracts so that artistes don’t have to be bogged down by these things”. <br/>Furthermore, John McCall in his study of Nollywood movies wrote that “it’s hard not to get excited about the Nigerian video industry,… the video industry has laid the groundwork for what might be called the Nigerian Dream- a genuine opportunity for legitimate financial success and even celebrity, open to just about anyone with talent and imagination” (103). Nollywood filmmakers have applied their talent and imagination to both historical and contemporary issues as reflected in diverse themes of their movies. The themes range from religion to governance, from crime to adventure and from rural/urban living to campaigns against social vices like AIDS, corruption, prostitution, etc. These are produced as common video genres like horror, comedy, urban legend, mythic parable, romance, witchcraft, melodrama, Christian morality tale and historical epic.<br/>Agoola Odesanya, a lecturer in Lagos State University’s Mass Communication Department who recently worked on Ije and MrandMrs revealed that he changed his mind on Nollywood after seeing Ije and Mr and Mrs. According to him “I use to believe all Nigerian movies are heaps of rubbish and nothing good can come out of them, though this position is right when you look at Nollywood‘s recent past, but this orientation has changed. I worked on Ije and Mr and Mrs and it was published in an international journal. I feel sanity is gradually returning to Nollywood and I think it’s high time they took leverage of this new reputation”. Apart from these two movies, there are a whole lot of Nigerian films with deepened or improved qualities according to film critics reviews. LastFlighttoAbuja, Figurine, October1, PhoneSwap, and Dry are just few from the long list of films with deepened quality. Odesanya noted that this improvement will surely attract the academic scholars who ab-initio were discouraged from engaging in scholarly enterprise with Nollywood films.<br/>Jonathan Haynes noted the importance of scholarship ventures in Nollywood when he averred that film impacts almost all sectors of the society from language, to health, ecology, politics and even economy (114). Nigerian scholars’ continuous neglect of Nollywood, as widely believed by critics imposes great danger on the life span of Nollywood. But again, Nollywood film makers must sustain the tempo of quality film making which according to Moradewun Adejunmobi must be charted towards local and global appeal.<br/> According to Adejunmobi “Audiences for Nigerian video film, as for other commercially driven texts, respond above all to perceptions of substantive relevance, that is to outcomes presented as having implications for the interests or concerns of viewers, and presented as having implications for the interests or personal, social and political circumstance of viewers. Paradoxically, both the desires for escape from everyday life and the desire for relevance to everyday concerns are high on the list of reasons why people consume commercial fiction” (52). This also applies to the academic critics who are looking for inexhaustible materials for their criticism.<br/>In conclusion, Nollywood and Nigerian literary scholars must have a symbiotic relationship as proposed by Ernest Emenyonu whereas literary critics are giving Nollywood in-depth attention, Nollywood must reciprocate by adapting creative works into motion pictures in order to sustain the interests of these scholars.<br/>1.7 THESIS STATEMENT<br/>Ecphonesis plays very essential roles in realization of the theme of movies where Chinwetalu Agu employs them.

This is possible because of the inherent elasticity or malleability of language as a communicative tool</p> <p>which can be shaped or conditioned by the social or discourse situation. With M.A.K Halliday’s Systemic</p> <p>Functional Grammar as the analytical template, this study, therefore, discusses the paralinguistic devices such as</p> <p>length of the text, paragraph structure, punctuation marks, topography, etc, utilized by Chimamanda Adichie to</p> <p>complement verbal signifiers and foreground critical and strategic aspects of meaning in relation to context of</p> <p>situation and textual function in her Purple Hibiscus. The study adumbrates the fact that paralinguistic resources</p> <p>of language have pragmatic force, in the sense that they help writers to capture contextual or stylistic meaning,</p> <p>enhance textual appeal, and also aid scholars/readers to conveniently comprehend and interpret the ideological</p> <p>contents or propositions contained in their texts. It, therefore, concludes that any explication of the meaning of</p> <p>literary texts without due and careful recourse to the subtle nuances of graphological patterning, is less than</p> <p>adequate.</p> <p>Keywords: Graphological foregrounding, Purple Hibiscus, Systemic functional grammar, Stylistic meaning,</p> <p>Social context</p> <p>Introduction</p> <p>Essentially, writers deploy diverse ways not only to encode and disseminate their artistic vision and message, but</p> <p>also to achieve formal beauty in their texts. This is because the hallmark of a good writer, that is, what makes him</p> <p>to stand out from the crowd, is contingent both on the ideological content and propositions of his work as much as</p> <p>his stylistic peculiarities or distinctions and the extent to which both aspects (i.e content and container) relate.</p> <p>This thesis explains why writers take advantage of the elasticity of language in sundry ways in their discourses, in</p> <p>the sense that “language implies the availability of an internal structure which makes it possible for the writer or</p> <p>speaker to construct texts that are not only coherent but also situationally appropriate” (Adeyanju, 2008:87). In</p> <p>addition, the thesis also explains why writers employ various paralinguistic devices to complement linguistic</p> <p>choices, make meaning more precise and graphical, as well as enhance the aesthetic texture and appeal of their</p> <p>texts.</p> <p>Amongst the latter set of stylistic resources highlighted above (i.e paralinguistic devices), are graphological</p> <p>elements or patterns which are of the visual dimension of language use, such as italicization, capitalization,</p> <p>punctuation, indentation, etc. These paralinguistic resources help writers to capture particular pragmatic senses in</p> <p>texts and aid the readability, comprehension and interpretation of linguistic forms in given situational or textual</p> <p>contexts. According to Adegoju (2008:160), Graphology concerns such matters as spelling, capitalization,</p> <p>hyphenation, a text’s layout, lists, font choices, underlining, italicization, paragraphing, colour, etc which can all</p> <p>create different kinds of impact, some of which will cause the reader to react differently.</p> <p>Published by Center for Promoting Ideas, USA www.ijllnet.com Copyright © The Author(s)</p> <p>10</p> <p>Ngara (1982:17) echoes a similar viewpoint when he observed that graphology covers such areas as the layout of</p> <p>the text, colour, shape of the printed marks, punctuation, paragraphing and spacing, etc. Short (1996:54-57) adds</p> <p>that splitting of a word to separate letters, writing all words together without orthographical spaces, etc, are also</p> <p>graphological patterns or symbols. Etymologically, the term has Greek roots-‘grapho’ meaning writing and</p> <p>‘logos’ meaning word and, in its more known sense, it focuses on or deals primarily with handwriting. The term</p> <p>has, however, become very crucial and strategic in linguistic circles, particularly in descriptive stylistics and its</p> <p>use has extended to the study of all subtly meaningful symbols and signs, including pictorial devices, which help</p> <p>authors and writers to communicate messages. It is apparently most effective and applicable to an ideophonic</p> <p>language like English whose writing system largely depends on a set of symbols and signs.</p> <p>According to Alo (1998:5), the descriptive study of style rests on the analysis of language resources which can be</p> <p>found at the various levels of language description including the following:</p> <p>i. Phonology (sounds/sound effects)</p> <p>ii. Lexis (word usage and diction)</p> <p>iii. Grammar (word and sentence structure)</p> <p>iv. Semantics (units of meaning)</p> <p>v. Graphology (orthography or writing system)</p> <p>vi. Pragmatics (language for action or getting things done).</p> <p>Graphology is, thus, a level of linguistic analysis which focuses on the layout of texts, the size or shape of words</p> <p>and any other feature that is graphical or orthographical. It is a fundamental and crucial way of paying close</p> <p>attention to the visual images and diagrams in a text which help to encode, extend or modify its signification. In</p> <p>other words, it is a paralinguistic approach to the explication of textual meaning, since it focuses essentially on</p> <p>non-verbal aspects of texts, such as form and visual appearance which carry pragmatic force, that is, which yield</p> <p>their meaning by distinctive situational use within a particular social framework.</p> <p>Foregrounding, on the other hand, refers to any attention-catching device in a text, including lexical or structural</p> <p>repetition, coupling, collocation etc, which makes parts of a text to stand out in specific contexts. The term</p> <p>traverses the entire gamut of discourses and presupposes any deliberate device, linguistic or paralinguistic, which</p> <p>authors and writers deploy to emphasize or make prominent a particular aspect of a text. It is a major component</p> <p>of arts criticism, helping arts scholars to distinguish between the background and foreground of paintings.</p> <p>According to the Online Wikipedia, the term was first associated with Paul Garvin in the 1960s, who used it as a</p> <p>translation of the Czech word ‘aktualizace’, a concept that was introduced by the Prague School structuralists of</p> <p>the 1930s. Instructively, the latter see it as the major distinguishing element between poetic language and nonpoetic</p> <p>language, in the sense that it makes a text to be unique and catchy. According to Leech (1969),</p> <p>foregrounding manifests in linguistic parallelism and linguistic deviation and can be studied from lexical,</p> <p>grammatical, phonological, semantic and graphological angles. Leech and Short (2007) are of the view that there</p> <p>are essentially two kinds of foregrounding viz: quantitative foregrounding, which deals with frequency of</p> <p>occurrence of a particular textual feature; and breaking the language code or rule. Yankson (1987:3) alludes to the</p> <p>latter kind of foregrounding (i.e violation of language codes) when he defined the concept as “… the aesthetically</p> <p>intentional distortion of the linguistic components of a text.” According to this scholar (Ibid), “the normal</p> <p>language code is the background. Any deviation from the norm-the code- is the foreground, because it brings the</p> <p>message to the forecourt of the reader’s attention”. In the same vein, Halliday (1973:98) describes the term as</p> <p>“motivated prominence” given to a particular textual feature, in the sense that it covers all the linguistic and</p> <p>paralinguistic strategies used by literary artists or other authors to make parts of a text prominent which contribute</p> <p>substantially to their cumulative meaning, and attract the attention or close scrutiny of scholars and readers alike.</p> <p>According to this scholar (Ibid), there are two main types of foregrounding: parallelism can be described as</p> <p>unexpected regularity while deviation can be seen as unexpected irregularity. As the definition of foregrounding</p> <p>indicates, something can only be unexpectedly regular or irregular within a particular context. This context can be</p> <p>relatively narrow, such as the immediate textual surroundings (referred to as a ‘secondary norm’).</p> <p>No doubt, foregrounding is a relevant, even indispensable, strand of textual texture, particularly of literary texts,</p> <p>by its very nature and function, as outlined above. Babajide (2000:131) highlights the relevance of foregrounding</p> <p>in graphological analysis inter alia: Foregrounding is a major device in the graphological aspect of a text. This</p> <p>simply means bringing a certain item to the fore. Foregrounding manifests in different forms such as</p> <p>capitalization, italicization, asterism, underscoring and all sorts of signs and symbols used to demand attention.</p> <p>International Journal of Language and Linguistics ISSN 2374-8850 (Print), 2374-8869 (Online) Vol. 1, No. 2; December 2014</p> <p>11</p> <p>Specifically, therefore, the present study focuses on graphological elements which have been deliberately</p> <p>deployed by Chimamanda Adichie to draw attention to critical and strategic aspects of meaning in her Purple</p> <p>Hibiscus. The idea or rationale, as we have highlighted above, is to demonstrate the fact that there is an “intrinsic</p> <p>connection between visual appeals and meaning interpretation” in texts and that, The appropriation and</p> <p>interpretation of meaning in discourse are not entirely dependent on the use of formal linguistic elements.</p> <p>Graphological elements also serve as visual aids to the encoding and decoding of the meaning of linguistic units.</p> <p>(Adegoju, 2008:157).</p> <p>In other words, the present study discusses the graphetic patterns deployed in Adichie’s text to show their</p> <p>communicative or stylistic value as elements of foregrounding, in the sense that there is a semantic link or bond</p> <p>between linguistic elements and the visual or graphological elements used in the text, as both complement each</p> <p>other.</p> <p>Theoretical Foundations</p> <p>Over the years, the linguistic style of writers has been a subject of intense enquiry by scholars. The Russian</p> <p>formalists and Prague school of the 1920s, for instance, saw style in literature as linguistic foregrounding i.e. they</p> <p>placed a high premium on the language of literary texts (Hawkes, 1977; Bennet, 1979; Lemon and Reis, 1965).</p> <p>The structuralists of the 1960s also emphasized the various linguistic devices used by writers to foreground</p> <p>aspects of meaning. According to Fowler (1990), linguistic formalism promotes the view that there is a special</p> <p>poetic language which is distinct from “Ordinary” or “scientific” language. Chomsky’s (1957) Transformational</p> <p>Generative Grammar (TGG) also delineates the peculiarity of the style of writers in terms of deviation i.e. the</p> <p>style of a writer or speaker is marked by constant violation of linguistic norms.</p> <p>However, since this study focuses on a functional use of language, we shall adopt M. A. K Halliday’s systemic</p> <p>functional grammar as the theoretical model for analysis. The interest of this grammar is not only in describing</p> <p>the structure of language, but also in explaining the properties of discourse and its functions. It revolves around</p> <p>the work of J.R. Firth in general and M.A.K. Halliday in particular. In Hallidayan (1971) perception, a formal</p> <p>feature is stylistic if it has a particular meaning, effect or value. This notion emphasizes how language functions</p> <p>in texts and the nexus between language and what it is used for, or to achieve. The critical point here is that,</p> <p>whatever linguistic resource that is worth describing must be put to use, in the sense that the description and</p> <p>interpretation are necessarily based on the situational variables that prompted its use. Hence Oha (1994:730)</p> <p>posits that the approach recognizes the interdependency of style, meaning and context of situation and that the</p> <p>latter should not be subjected to second fiddle position, or ignored, in the analysis of style.</p> <p>In Systemic Functional Grammar, language structure is analyzed along semantic, phonological, lexical and</p> <p>grammatical lines. Language function, on the other hand, is examined from three angles viz: ideational,</p> <p>interpersonal and textual. These are referred to as the metafunctions of language. The ideational metafunction of</p> <p>language is synonymous with the field of discourse i.e. the subject matter or propositional content of the text and</p> <p>the context of language use i.e. is it a religious or socio-political subject? According to Adeyanju (2008:86), it “…</p> <p>implies that language serves as an instrument for the encoder (speaker, writer) to express and articulate his idea</p> <p>and experience internally”. The interpersonal or interactional function, at another level, refers to the tenor of</p> <p>discourse i.e. the social relationship that exists among participants in a specific discourse situation, which can</p> <p>influence or shape language use. According to Ogunsiji (2001:77), it “… helps to establish and sustain social</p> <p>relations”. The textual aspect is particularly germane to the present study. It is concerned with the mode; the</p> <p>internal organization and communicative nature of a text. Leech and Short (1985:209) see Halliday’s textual</p> <p>functions of language as “… ways of using language to organize, understand and express information for effective</p> <p>communication”. In Adeyanju’s (2008) view, it suggests “… the availability of an internal structure which makes</p> <p>it possible for the writer or speaker to construct texts that are not only coherent but also situationally appropriate”</p> <p>(p.87). The main point is that, the textual metafunction relates what is said in a text to ideas outside the discourse,</p> <p>as we shall demonstrate in the present study.</p> <p>Brief Biography of the Author</p> <p>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie was born 15th September, 1977 in Enugu, Enugu State, Nigeria and was educated at</p> <p>the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN) secondary school; her father was a Professor of Statistics and later</p> <p>Deputy Vice Chancellor of the University.</p> <p>Published by Center for Promoting Ideas, USA www.ijllnet.com Copyright © The Author(s)</p> <p>12</p> <p>She was a student of Medicine and Pharmacy at UNN for a year and a half before leaving for Drexel University,</p> <p>Philadephia, Eastern Connecticut State, University, and John Hopkins University, Baltimore.</p> <p>Chimamanda Adichie is one of the most universally acclaimed and decorated African writers of her generation.</p> <p>Her works include Purple Hibiscus, Half of a Yellow Sun, The Thing Around Your Neck and Americanah. Purple</p> <p>Hibiscus won the Hurston Wright legacy award for best debut, fiction category (2004); Commonwealth Writer’s</p> <p>Prize for best first book (Africa) 2005 and Commonwealth Writer’s Prize (Best first book, Overall) 2005. It was</p> <p>also shortlisted for the Orange Prize for fiction (2004) and longlisted for the Booker Prize (2004), among others.</p> <p>Synopsis of the Text</p> <p>Purple Hibiscus is a story of Kambili, a fifteen year-old girl growing up in a stifling Catholic household in Enugu,</p> <p>Nigeria. Her wealthy father, Eugene Achike, with strict Catholic doctrine, dictates to and oppresses Kambili, her</p> <p>brother, Jaja and their mother Beatrice. While generous and politically active in the community, he is repressive</p> <p>and fanatically religious at home. Eugene’s religious fanaticism, mercantile attitude and over-bearing nature end</p> <p>up confining, incapacitating or stifling those whom he professes to love the most. He has even repudiated his own</p> <p>father for refusing to convert to Catholicism and turns his grand children against him, allowing only fifteen</p> <p>minutes a year with him at Christmas; but things change when Nigeria begins to fall apart under military coup.</p> <p>Eugene sends his children to stay with his sister, Ifeoma, a University Professor. Here, Kambili and Jaja meet</p> <p>their cousins, learns what it means to be free to speak their minds, laugh and argue. They discover a life and love</p> <p>beyond the confines of their father’s authority. This new knowledge and awareness challenge their values and lift</p> <p>the silence and shadow from their world and in time, give rise to devotion and defiance.</p> <p>Contextualizing the Text</p> <p>Purple Hibiscus captures the complex political and religious struggles occurring in Nigeria. It highlights the</p> <p>country’s history and cultural experiences from her independence times. Nigeria attained her independence in</p> <p>1960. This was followed by instability and series of coups which caused a great turmoil. The turmoil in the</p> <p>country resulted in corruption which caused further instability and successive coups. Political unrest, chaos and</p> <p>violence rage as military coups unfurl subjecting the society to tyranny. This is highlighted in the text under</p> <p>“leader, Big Oga” which echoes the atmosphere of the time, symbolized by the reign of General Sani Abacha,</p> <p>who took over Nigeria in 1993. During this time, there were incessant arrests and jails of critics and activists and</p> <p>foremost intellectuals and educators fled the country to avoid rising autocratic rule, intimidation and deteriorating</p> <p>social services. It was at this time that a celebrated writer, Ken Saro Wiwa was executed with other human rights</p> <p>activists and Nigeria was suspended from the commonwealth of Nations. This is the backdrop or context against</p> <p>which the story of “Ogechi Nwankiti” in the text is crafted. Abacha died in 1998 and was succeeded by General</p> <p>Abdul Salam Abubakar, who attempted to restore democracy. A former General, Olusegun Obasanjo became the</p> <p>elected President of Nigeria and was inaugurated in 29th May, 1999.</p> <p>Adichie also touches on the rich diversity of her people and their traditions, the variety of their religious beliefs</p> <p>and philosophy. She explores Western versus African cultures by contrasting the legacy of colonization – its</p> <p>religions, language and customs with traditional cultural values. Devout Africans (traditionalists) who are</p> <p>unfamiliar with the peculiar religious practices of others (especially |Christians) tend to be seen from a detached,</p> <p>ironic point of view in Nigeria. The contemporary Nigeria has a variety of religious beliefs – christians, muslims</p> <p>and practitioners of traditional religion. These are the relevant contextual situations which inform linguistic</p> <p>patterning in the text.</p> <p>Textual Analysis</p> <p>We have already established that, in its broadest sense, graphology refers to the visual medium of language. It</p> <p>describes the general resources of the written system of language, including punctuation, spelling, typography,</p> <p>alphabet, paragraph structure, etc. Apart from this, as we have earlier mentioned, it can also be extended to</p> <p>incorporate any significant pictorial and symbolic devices which supplement the written system. Specifically, the</p> <p>present study investigates the length of the text, paragraph structure, punctuation, and typography as a result of</p> <p>their strategic stylistic value as elements of signification, aesthetics and foregrounding in the text.</p> <p>International Journal of Language and Linguistics ISSN 2374-8850 (Print), 2374-8869 (Online) Vol. 1, No. 2; December 2014</p> <p>13</p> <p>Length of the Text</p> <p>In Adichie’s text, the consecutive sequence of four parts is three hundred and seven pages. The first part,</p> <p>“BREAKING GODS: Palm Sunday,” and the last part, “A DIFFERENT SILENCE: The Present” are the smallest</p> <p>parts of the four sections, and both have equal pages of sixteen each. The second part, “SPEAKING WITH OUR</p> <p>SPIRITS: Before Palm Sunday” is the largest part of the text with two hundred and thirty seven pages; and the</p> <p>third part, “THE PIECES OF GOD: After Palm Sunday” has thirty eight pages. What immediately attracts</p> <p>attention in this graphological device is the manner in which Adichie uses key synonymous phrases i.e. “breaking</p> <p>God’s …” and “ the pieces of God…” and the antonymous words and concepts: “speaking” and “silence” in the</p> <p>heading as the backdrop against which actions are delineated in the novel. The obvious fact is that this mode of</p> <p>graphological patterning depicts the kernel of meaning and the contradiction or conflict that pervades the entire</p> <p>text, a contradiction that borders on repression, hypocrisy and freedom. The aim of this justaposition of</p> <p>antonymous lexemes is clearly to foreground the battlefield of social-cultural and socio-political values and</p> <p>events in the text which is rife with abuse and despair, for as Mullany and Stockwell (2010:46) put it,</p> <p>“foregrounding can be analysed stylistically as a feature of textual organization”.</p> <p>Paragraph Structure</p> <p>Adichie’s text also overtly uses paragraph structure and development for stylistic effect. The best or most visible</p> <p>creative use of this device lies in her deformation of standard paragraphing. Adichie, in the opening paragraph of</p> <p>the text, begins with the indenting of the first two lines; where the indenting of the first line of a paragraph is the</p> <p>norm. Subsequently, all of her topic sentences begin with the indenting of the first two lines of the paragraph.</p> <p>This device clearly reflects what has been referred to as a deliberate distortion of language or textual conventions</p> <p>or codes (see Leech, 1969; Yankson, 1987; Leech and Short, 2007). The following excerpts from the beginning of</p> <p>the first three chapters of the text confirm this pattern of paragraph structuring:</p> <p>i. Things started to fall apart at home when my brother, Jaja, did not go to the communion and Papa flung his</p> <p>heavy missal across the room and broke the figurines on the etagere. We had just returned from church. Mama</p> <p>placed the fresh palm fronds, which were wet with holy water, on the dining table and then went upstairs to</p> <p>change….(3)</p> <p>ii. I was at my study desk when Mama came into my room, my school uniforms piled on the crook of her arm.</p> <p>She placed them on my bed. She had brought them in from the lines in the backyard, where I had hung them to</p> <p>dry that morning. Jaja and I washed our school uniforms while Sisi washed the rest of our clothes. We always</p> <p>soaked tiny sections of fabric in the foamy water first to check if the colors would run, although we knew they</p> <p>would not….(19)</p> <p>iii. In the following weeks, the newspaper we read during family time sounded different, more subdued. The</p> <p>Standard, too was different; it was more critical, more questioning than it used to be. Even the drive to school</p> <p>was different. The first week after the coup, Kevin plucked green tree branches every morning and stuck them</p> <p>to the care lodged above the number plate, so that the demonstrators at Government Square would let us drive</p> <p>past….(27)</p> <p>Another interesting part of this device is the use of upper case for the first few words of the opening sentence of</p> <p>most of her paragraphs which should normally have been restricted to only the first letter of the opening word.</p> <p>This is obviously a violation of the graphological convention or practice. One significant stylistic effect of this</p> <p>technique is that it gives deliberate prominence to those words in the upper case. The analysis of the extract below</p> <p>will amplify the underlying point:</p> <p>THE POWER WENT OFF that evening, just before the sun fell. The refrigerator shook and shivered and then fell</p> <p>silent. I did not notice how loud its non-stop hum was until it stopped. Obiora brought the kerosene lamps out to</p> <p>the verandah and we sat around them, swatting at the tiny insects that blindly followed the yellow light and</p> <p>bumped against the glass bulbs (220/221).</p> <p>Relating the use of upper case in written language to the spoken form, though, never absolute, will project the</p> <p>speaker (narrator) as loud. The clear point is that Adichie deploys capitalization, what Davy (1969:174) refers to</p> <p>as “ graphetic highlighting”, to imbue or invest key aspects of meaning in the text with the appropriate or required</p> <p>prominence or emphasis. In the passage above, emphasis is then laid on such words with upper case which</p> <p>decidedly makes them louder and thus, more attention is naturally focused on them than the others in the same</p> <p>passage.</p> <p>Published by Center for Promoting Ideas, USA www.ijllnet.com Copyright © The Author(s)</p> <p>14</p> <p>It is, therefore, a design by Adichie to emphatically and strategically capture the deteriorating infrastructure in the</p> <p>country which are recurring experiences and characterize the social fabric in Nigeria. Adichie liberally employs</p> <p>this device throughout the text. For exemplification, see below three more extracts selected randomly from the</p> <p>text that depicts that this design:</p> <p>i. WE LEFT ABBA right after …. The wives of the Umunna took the leftover food, even the cooked rice and</p> <p>beans that Mama said were spoiled, and they knelt in the backyard dirt to thank Papa and Mama. The gate man</p> <p>waved with both hands over his head as we drove off …. (103)</p> <p>ii. THE PHONE RANG EARLY, before any of us had taken a morning bath. My mouth went dry because I was</p> <p>sure it was about Papa, that something has happened to him. The soldiers had gone to the house; they had shot</p> <p>him to make sure he would never publish anything again…. (147)</p> <p>iii. I DID NOT GET a chance to tell Jaja about the printing until the next day, a Saturday, when he came into my</p> <p>room during study time. He wore thick socks and placed his feet gingerly one after the other, as I did….(197)</p> <p>Punctuation</p> <p>Punctuation marks generally make for organized structure as well as effective thought flow in any piece of written</p> <p>text, which facilitates meaningful and efficient reading. Our analysis in this section, therefore, demonstrates that</p> <p>punctuation is also a marked or significant graphological feature in the text, as it helps in foregrounding the</p> <p>overall or cumulative meaning of the work. In other words, the mode or pattern of punctuation in the text is</p> <p>meaning-laden in the sense that it is suggestive or reflective of the given content or proposition in specific</p> <p>contexts. The full stop, for instance, is a technique generally used at the end of a sentence in writing. In the text,</p> <p>we notice that there is a deliberate investment of this technique to create the background for specific and general</p> <p>meanings. As a grammatical pause, Adichie employs this technique throughout the text which is significant for</p> <p>meaning, especially, through the use of declarative sentences and to mark longer pauses. The extract below</p> <p>illustrates the point:</p> <p>You have to do something with all these privileges. Because God has given much, he expects much from you. He</p> <p>expects perfection. I didn’t have a father who sent me to the best schools. My father spent his time worshipping</p> <p>gods of woods and stone. I would be nothing today but for the priests and sisters at the mission. I was a houseboy</p> <p>for the parish priest for two years. Yes, a houseboy. Nobody dropped me off at school (47).</p> <p>Used as a grammatical pause, it inevitably slows down the reading pace. The underlying idea of the passage</p> <p>above is that the road to success is tasking or demanding and compels hardwork and focus if we are to make any</p> <p>meaning out of life. Thus, the slow process of reading imposed on the passage by the full stops matches the idea</p> <p>of the passage and foregrounds the meaning of the text. This pattern or punctuation and its effect beautifully</p> <p>matches form with message. In other words, the text is clearly constructed to relate content to form.</p> <p>The comma is another punctuation mark that is deployed to foreground stylistic meaning in the text.</p> <p>Conventionally, it is used for a variety of purposes – separate main clause from subordinate clause; introduce a</p> <p>direct speech, etc. In the words of Adeyanju(2008:89), a comma “is a graphological device used to separate items</p> <p>in a list and to create a slight pause in the unit of thought…” Its main function in the text is essentially to show</p> <p>where Adichie would naturally pause so as to allow her message to be absorbed and also, to separate items in a</p> <p>list. The extract below illustrates this technique which is a prominent part of Adichie’s stylistic choices:</p> <p>At Ninth Mile, Papa stopped to buy bread and okpa. Hawkers descending on our car, pushing boiled eggs, roasted</p> <p>cashew nuts, bottled water, bread, okpa, agidi into every window of the car, chanting: “Buy from me, oh, I will</p> <p>sell well to you.” Or “Look at me, I am the one you are looking for”. (54)</p> <p>The critical point is that a grammatical pause like the full-stop, the comma forces the reader to pause nine times in</p> <p>the extract; and would naturally force down the pace of reading. The theme of the extract is the struggles for</p> <p>survival. One must go to the roadside, wait, approach car owners, go round and round the car windows, and then</p> <p>chant in order to make a living. It is a difficult and a slow process; and it is this slow process of eking out a living</p> <p>that is enacted by the slow pace of reading the text through the use of commas. The critical fact that emerges from</p> <p>this style is that grammatical pause serves as a technique for foregrounding the meaning of the text.</p> <p>The question mark is used to suggest that an expression is a question meant to elicit information from the</p> <p>addressee. The use of the question mark in the text is, apparently, also stylistically significant.</p> <p>International Journal of Language and Linguistics ISSN 2374-8850 (Print), 2374-8869 (Online) Vol. 1, No. 2; December 2014</p> <p>15</p> <p>In other words, Adichie’s deployment of question mark in this text has intrinsic stylistic value in the sense that it</p> <p>is deliberately used to foreground or draw attention to crucial aspects of meaning and to create directions in the</p> <p>mind of the reader. This extract exemplifies this point: “Sole administrator must go… head of state must go…</p> <p>Where is running water? Where is light? Where is petrol?” (228). The critical point to note in this context is that</p> <p>question marks carry with them a rising intonation, and the natural attitude associated with a rise in tone suggests</p> <p>the semantic feature/ + critical/. The design in the context is, therefore, to reflect the critical social conditions</p> <p>under corrupt leaders and which the people are forced to protest against. The central concerns in the passage are</p> <p>serious and the contradictions curious. The question marks are, therefore, a deliberate effort to mean, to</p> <p>interrogate the system: why the so much lack of basic amenities in Nigeria or any post-colonial African country,</p> <p>when there is so much resources and potential?</p> <p>The stylistic technique of quoting conversation is also stylistically foregrounded in Adichie’s text. It is mainly</p> <p>used to know characters by what they say especially in the novel genre which is inherently narrative. This is</p> <p>clearly in tandem with Campsall’s (2008) observation that graphological features of a text determine subtle and</p> <p>important aspects such as genre and ideology. Adichie’s novel is, in fact, replete with this style marker and it is</p> <p>achieved graphological through the use of quotation marks. The most significant or critical point about the use of</p> <p>this device is the shortness of most of the quoted speeches of conversations and, in fact, its liberal use in the text</p> <p>makes it almost a drama piece in format:</p> <p>“… I talked to Philipa the other day, She said.</p> <p>“Oh? How is she, how is oyinbo land treating her?”</p> <p>“She is well”</p> <p>“And life as a second-class citizen in America?</p> <p>“Chiaku, your sarcasm is unbecoming”.</p> <p>“But it is true. All my years in Cambridge, I was a monkey who had developed the</p> <p>ability to reason”</p> <p>“That is what they tell you. Everyday our doctors go there and end up washing plates</p> <p>for oyinbo because oyinbo does not think we study medicine right. Our lawyers go and</p> <p>drive taxis because oyinbo does not trust how we train them in law” (244).</p> <p>As can be gleaned from the extract above, the fundamental stylistic point here is that, through this device, Achidie</p> <p>makes her characters express critical opinions that are critical and strategic to our understanding and interpretation</p> <p>of the text. The short speeches make the points sharp, pungent and penetrating - they make the points to sink in</p> <p>seamlessly and thus, the reader can artistically relate to a common bitter experience of the blacks i.e. “I was a</p> <p>monkey who had developed the ability to reason” portrays an existing but sensitive racial phenomenon which</p> <p>continues to confront the black man in the white man’s land.</p> <p>Typography</p> <p>This is the outline of how words and letters are printed in a text. The print type of Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus is a</p> <p>significant graphological device through which foregrounding has been achieved and sustained throughout the</p> <p>text. Whereas the type is of the normal fonts; some have been italicized either for meaning or to show foreign or</p> <p>local words or phrases, and others capitalized to catch the attention of the reader. The passage below illustrates the</p> <p>point:</p> <p>“This is what our people say to the High God, the Chukwu”, Papa- Nnukwu said. “Give me both wealth and a</p> <p>child, but if I must choose one, give me a child because when my child grows, so will my wealth.” Papa-Nnukwu</p> <p>stopped, turned to look back towards our house. Nekenem, look at me. My son owns that house that can fit in</p> <p>every man in Abba, yet many times I have nothing to put on my plate. I should not have let him follow those</p> <p>missionaries” (83).</p> <p>Adichie makes use of native (Igbo) words in order to strengthen her point about Nigerian roots and culture, for the</p> <p>text itself is a essentially a cultural or sociological artifact. This technique tallies with Mullany and Stockwell’s</p> <p>(2010:45) view that “foregrounding depends on a sense that the particular feature that you have noticed is doing</p> <p>something noticeably different from the previous co-text or from what you might ordinarily have expected in that</p> <p>context.” The beauty of the extract above lies in the use of a native or transferred word “nekenem” to introduce a</p> <p>heartfelt dismay over the missionaries (i.e. when we are genuinely troubled or seek to introspect or go deep into</p> <p>ourselves, we go back to our native language or cultural roots).</p> <p>Published by Center for Promoting Ideas, USA www.ijllnet.com Copyright © The Author(s)</p> <p>16</p> <p>This transference of native words (i.e. Chukwu) into the English language or code-mixing is also to reflect the</p> <p>theme of cultural conflict or of transferred (alien or foreign) culture; that is, the alien religious system brought by</p> <p>colonialism into the traditional religion of ancestral worship which regards ‘Chukwu’ as too high up there: farfetched</p> <p>and unreachable. This specifies the meaning of the text which Adichie seeks to establish – forcible</p> <p>imposition of foreign religious beliefs brought by the missionaries which adulterates the traditional cosmology.</p> <p>The point is that the imposition of Igbo on English kind of satirizes the imposition of foreign religious/cultural</p> <p>beliefs on African culture or religion. There is also the underlying conflict of the stupendous wealth of a son (i.e.</p> <p>represented by the house he built) and the grinding poverty of the parent. Thus, what makes such words in italics</p> <p>notable is that they serve as devices for stylistic foregrounding and within the context of Purple Hibiscus, they</p> <p>serve as pointers to the themes explored in the novel. The following context from the text lends further credence</p> <p>to this thesis.</p> <p>Of course, Papa told us, the politicians were corrupt, and the Standard had written many stories about the cabinet</p> <p>ministers who stashed money in foreign bank accounts, money meant for paying teachers’ salaries and building</p> <p>roads. But what we Nigerians needed was not soldiers ruling us, what we needed was a renewed democracy.</p> <p>Renewed Democracy. Papa read one of the articles in Nigeria Today aloud out, an opinion column by a writer</p> <p>who insisted that it was indeed time for a military president, since the politicians had gone out of control and our</p> <p>economy was in a mess (24/25).</p> <p>The idea of “standard”, though the name of a newspaper, in the passage above, is what any society needs i.e. the</p> <p>standard form of government – democracy. In the same manner, the idea of “renewed democracy” encapsulates</p> <p>the atmosphere of transparency and stability which constitutes the undertone of the passage. “Nigeria Today”,</p> <p>another newspaper, captures the contemporary Nigeria and its deteriorating political situation, in which even a</p> <p>public opinion is mischievously or craftily manipulated against pure democratic ideals, which has subjected its</p> <p>economy to a complete state of shambolic mess. In this text, Adichie thus liberally makes use of italics to</p> <p>underline words with deep and far-reaching semantic context, in order to draw the attention of readers and</p> <p>scholars alike to their strategic relevance. What is particularly important here is that these graphological resources</p> <p>of language have contributed to the overall meaning of the work and etched the linguistic style of the author.</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>This study has discussed the graphetic resources deployed by Chimamanda Adichie to foreground aspects of</p> <p>meaning and achieve aesthetic ends in her Purple Hibiscus, using M. A. K Halliday’s Systemic Functional</p> <p>Linguistics(SFL), as the theoretical template. It is clear from the discussion so far that graphological techniques</p> <p>play a major role in communicating the message of a text, as it enables writers and authors to highlight aspects</p> <p>which are markedly and strategically important to the cumulative meaning of a text. Though Leech and Short</p> <p>(1981:131) have averred that “graphological variation is a relatively minor and superficial part of style,” the study</p> <p>of textual length, paragraphing, punctuation and topography in Adichie’s work demonstrates that an explication of</p> <p>textual meaning without due and careful recourse to the subtle nuances of graphological patterning in a text is less</p> <p>than adequate. This view is hinged on the fact that discourses contain “salient graphological features that appeal to</p> <p>the reader’s visual imagination and assist his understanding of the writer’s message” (Adeyanju, 2008:88). As</p> <p>Adegoju (2008:160) aptly observes, “… the meaning generated at the graphological level in some cases could be</p> <p>more significant than that generated by verbal signifiers.” To lend credence to this view, the scholar refers to</p> <p>Hodge and Kress’s position as cited by Locke (2004:23) that “… in contemporary society, meaning resides</p> <p>strongly and pervasively in systems other than the verbal, especially the visual.” The key point is that, as the</p> <p>present study demonstrates and as Campsall (2008) observes, graphological elements are very key in critical</p> <p>textual analysis, as they are the first qualities of a written and printed text that we notice and “carry certain</p> <p>pragmatic force that is central to the interpretation of discourse” (See Adegoju, 2008:160).</p> <p>Perhaps we need to restate that, as the study also shows, the importance of foregrounding in stylistic analysis in</p> <p>general cannot be overemphasized. Mullany and Stockwell (2010:43) have drawn our attention to the fact that “all</p> <p>texts, whether spoken or written, display style, which can loosely be defined as the recognizable linguistic and</p> <p>discoursal patterns in the text”. The implication of this viewpoint is that not all linguistic or paralinguistic features</p> <p>of texts can be useful or relevant for stylistic analysis, thus, bringing up the imperative of style markers or</p> <p>recognizable features in style study. This is the whole idea of foregrounding; hence Mullany and Stockwell</p> <p>(2010:45) further aver that, “… an important concept in stylistics is the notion of prominence or foregrounding.</p> <p>International Journal of Language and Linguistics ISSN 2374-8850 (Print), 2374-8869 (Online) Vol. 1, No. 2; December 2014</p> <p>17</p> <p>Texts are not even; some parts are more noticeable than others. This unevenness of texture is a consequence of</p> <p>different choices, it underlies the existence of style itself, and it is what allows stylistics its validity and power.”</p> <p>Essentially, the study also demonstrates that context plays a strategic role in the analysis of graphological</p> <p>elements in Adichie’s text and in any given discourse for, as Leech and Short (1981:208) observe, “discourse is</p> <p>linguistic communication seen as transaction between speaker and hearer, as an interpersonal activity whose form</p> <p>is determined by its social purpose.” This is clearly in tandem with the Hallidayan Systemic Functional</p> <p>Linguistics(SFL) adopted for the explication of textual meaning in this study, particularly as it highlights the fact</p> <p>that language use is conditioned or constrained by sociological and psychological factors. Hence Adegoju</p> <p>(2008:158) argues that, the analysis of stylistic features of a discourse at the graphological level without linking</p> <p>such features to the contextual background that underlies them would undermine the social character of language;</p> <p>for language is socially determined and it varies according to the social situation. The overt implication of this</p> <p>fact is that any worthwhile analysis of graphological features as style markers in a given text must foreground or</p> <p>pay due attention to the role the wider social and cultural context plays.</p> <p>References</p> <p>Adegoju, A.

Semantics is made an anchorage of the branch of linguistics that studies meaning making in communications. Further researches by scholars have however shown that there is more to the ordinary, literal meaning of sentences got from string of utterances. Often times we mean more than we say as much as we say more than we mean. Our words are constantly redefined by the context of usages. Pragmatics has thus been able to explain the mechanics of meaning making over and above the wordings of a text or a spoken conversation.</p> <p>The mere fact that communication is an essential part of human living makes pragmatics and meaning making a daily and constant phenomenon. Humans continuously and unconsciously engage in the negotiation of meaning in every conversation. Failure in negotiation of meaning is often the cause of linguistic conflict in conversation. For a peaceful and successful coexistence in the human community as far as language use is concerned, pragmatics is most needed.</p> <p>Nowhere in the field of human discourse is the business of meaning making most revered than in the world of politics. Knowing how to give out orders or having the support of the masses does not make one a good Politician. What makes one a good politician is how to find ones way language. Being a good language user means one is able to negotiate ones way out of conflicts and successfully through language use,turning the table against others when needed. It also</p> <p>means manipulating others through the use of language. Such is the business of politics where language is needed to persuade, manipulate, accuse, and sometimes incriminate other political actors. One would not argue the fact that it is usually the function of spokespersons to successfully manipulate language to the benefit of their group.Politicians see language as a very essential tool in political aspect due to the fact that language helps in identifying the ideological perspectives of politicians. That is why it is possible to have a language which favours some particular group of people or party while such type of language does not favour other groups or parties.Opeibi (2009) emphasizes the fact that no matter how good a candidate’s manifesto is; no matter how superior political thoughts and ideologies of a political party may be, these can only be expressed and further translated into social actions for social change and social continuity through the facilities provided by language.</p> <p>Egbewole and Etudaiye (2010) state that for a party in opposition, it is its function to engage in constant criticisms of governmental policies which are formulated by the majority, to scrutinize carefully the manner in which these policies are administered, and to keep thepossibility of alternative legislative policies and administrative practices constantly in the view of the electorate.</p> <p>It is this peculiar curiosity as to the ways in which language is specially used by political actors that informs this research. It has been discovered that euphemisms and dysphemisms make up a larger percentage of the features of political language.</p> <p>Opposition started in Nigeria in the First Republic by the popular Chief ObafemiAwolowo who was the leader of the opposition. The opposition that was practiced in the First Republic was in line with the opposition that was practical in the United Kingdom then<strong>(</strong>Egbewole and Etudaiye (2010). Opposition is muffled in many parts of Africa because of colonial legacies and cultural factors. Democracy in Nigeria will develop if the opposition appropriately appreciates its role and adequately carries out same with the expected altruistic motives(Alabi 2009 cited in Egbewole and Etudaiye, 2010).</p> <p>Political opposition is one of the basic features of liberal democracy. In this context, opposition denotes organized partisan movement dedicated to opposing and possibly changing an incumbent government (Okoli, 2001).Okoli further argues that “in parliamentary democracies, opposition is formally institutionalized in the process of public governance. In this context, the opposition party works to position itself as a “shadow government” by over-sighting the incumbent government in-between elections and offering itself as an alternative platform in the next election”. In the same vein, Robertson (1985:357) stated that “an opposition is a political grouping, party or loose association of individual who wish to change the government and its politics”. Okoli (2001) finally concludes that “in advanced democracies of the world, political opposition is operated along inter-party lines”.</p> <p>Opposition in politics is carried out in form of inter-party competition. Competition is one of the features of modern democracy in which political parties engage in the battle for power. In Nigeria, opposition is actively practiced among political parties but sometimes, it is done in an unlawful manner because it often leads to violence. Opposition is better practiced if it is done with the aim of improving the governing process of the country. Opposition should be seen by the politicians as an act of competition which aims at improving the administration of the country but not as an opportunity to fulfil their personal aims.</p> <p>The 2015 general election in Nigeria provides a fertile ground for the application of features of pragmatics to the study of meaning making in the war of words of politicians on the Nigerian political scene. Such is the reason this study focuses on analysing, pragmatically, the linguistic features of selected political speeches of one of the most active participants in the build-up to and after the 2015 general election in the person of Barrister Olisa Metuh. Metuh, the national publicity secretary of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), other than doing his primary job of airing the views of the PDP on national issues, could not hide his distaste for the flag bearer of the APC, General Muhammad Buhari (rtd). Buhari eventually won the 2015 general election, defeating the incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan, thus marking the first time in Nigeria’s history that an incumbent President was defeated in an election by the leader of the opposition. He was sworn in on 29 May 2015. Of course, this aggravated different criticisms and comments from the electorates in which Olisa Metuh is part of.</p> <p>Olisa Metuh, national publicity secretary of People’s Democratic Party (PDP), born to a fourth generation law officer, Chief J.N Metuh, is from OtoloNnewi in Anambra State. Olisa Metuh attended the Ivy League University of Nigeria Nsukka, Enugu campus where he graduated with a degree in Law and was called to the bar in 1988. In 1996, he started his own Law Firm, Olisa Metuh and Co, and provided many young lawyers the opportunity to provide services in legal practice, real estate and share acquisitions and other investments in the capital market. He is a member of Nigeria Bar Association, and Association of Business Lawyers of Nigeria.</p> <p>Olisa was made a National Auditor in 2007 and automatically became a member of the National Working Committee. It is important to note that Olisa Metuh is the longest and the youngest serving elected member of the National Executive Committee of the PDP.</p> <p>Olisa Metuh has in different manners addressed President MuhammaduBuhari’s administration in somewhat dysphemistic ways, and being the publicity secretary of the PDP his words could and would be taken to be that of the PDP.</p> <p>Dysphemism comes from the Greek word, ‘dys’ ‘mis’ and ‘pheme’, meaning speech, voice, and reputation respectively. It is an expression with connotations that are offensive either about the subject matter or to the audience, or both. It is sometimes motivated by feelings such as, fear, distastes, hatred and contempt<em>(Wikipedia, 2015</em>). In speeches, dysphemism is an evident feature which expresses the natural state of the speaker in relation to sociological factors.</p> <p>President Muhammadu Buhari was born on December 17, 1942, in Kastina state, Nigeria. He served as the military ruler of Nigeria (December 31, 1983 – August 27, 1985).  In 1985, Buhari was overthrown in a coup led by General Ibrahim Babangida on August 27th, and other members of the ruling Supreme Military Council (SMC) ostensibly, because he insisted on investigating allegations of fraudulent award of contracts in the Military of Defence. Buhari contested the Presidential election as the candidate of the All Nigeria People’s Party in 2003. On 18th December 2006, Gen. Buhari was nominated as the consensus candidate of the All Nigeria People’s Party. His main opponent in the 2007 April polls was the ruling PDP’s UmaruYar’Adua, who is from the same state –Katsina state, however, he lost. In March 2010, Buhari left the ANPP for the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), and was the Presidential candidate in the 16 April 2011 general election, running against the incumbent president Goodluck Jonathan of People’s Democratic Party (PDP), they were the major contenders amongtwenty contestants.</p> <p>Buhari won the 2015 general election, defeating the incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan, thus marking the first time Nigeria’s history that an incumbent President was defeated in an election by the leader of the opposition. He was sworn in on 29 May 2015.</p> <p>Of course, this aggravated different criticisms, comments and effects on the readers and listeners (that is, Nigerians open to the mass media). For the purpose of the research, however, the concern shall be to analyseOlisa Metuh’s selected speeches in its different varieties, employing the method of pragmatic theories.</p> <p>This research is conceptualized as a result of personal urge to determine the motive of Olisa Metuh’s use of dysphemism, the supports given as basis for inference by the reader and the pragmatic significance.</p> <p>1.2            Statement of Research Problem</p> <p>After the successful Presidential election of March 2015, Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressive Congress (APC) emerged as the winner of the Presidential election winning over the incumbent President, Goodluck Jonathan of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in an election widely adjudged free and fair election. This loss caused ill expressions from the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) which was spoken and written by the National Publicity Secretary (Olisa Metuh) who has been vested with the power to do so. Unfortunately, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has not forgotten this defeat and has successfully portrayed President MuhammaduBuhari’s administration in a dysphemistic manner, and many of these speeches has caused uproar in the country.</p> <p>A number of scholars have worked on the Pragmatic analysis of speeches and other related essays:</p> <p>Ayeomoni and Akinuolere (2012) worked on the “Pragmatic Analysis of Victory and Inaugural Speeches of President Umaru Musa Yar’Adura”, where they noted in their findings that the “Overall Relative Frequency Percentages (ORFP) results showed that Umaru Musa Yar’ Adua relied more on sentences that performed assertive acts than other speech acts.</p> <p>Josial and Johnson (2012) also worked on “Pragmatics Analysis of President Goodluck Jonathan’s and President Barack Obama’s Inaugural Addresses”results in their findings shows that the speeches are relatively alike because each speaker speaks for his entire nation, regardless of his political party.</p> <p>However, little or no research has been done on the Pragmatic Analysis of Olisa Metuh’sDysphemisms against President MuhammaduBuhari’s Administration and this is the gap this research hopes to fill with a view to unraveling the meanings embedded in the dysphemistic expressions against Buhari’s administration.</p> <p>1.3  Aim and Objectives</p> <p>The aim of this study is to do a pragmatic analysis of Olisa Metuh’sdysphemisms against President MuhammaduBuhari’s administration with specific objectives as follows:</p> <p>        i.            toidentify the dysphemism

class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 Introduction</strong></p> <p>Feminism has continued  to dominate  the temporary literary discourse as african societies are becoming increasingly of the urgent necessity t o liberate and fully exploits the potential of women to enhance peaceful co-exisence  and socoi-economic development .as an introductory chapter  the focus here is to provide the background to the study, outline the problem as well as the aim and objective of the study .it also specifies the scope ,limitations, and also the method the research employs for its analyses and its benefit to the society and scholarship .additionally ,the authors biography is briefly captured.</p> <p><strong>1.1 Background to the Study                                                                             </strong></p> <p>Women in Africa, to a large extent, are virtually regarded as ‘second class’human beings who are meant to be seen and not heard. Their lives revolve solely around  procreation, motherhood, merging into the man’s world without protesting, and “brainwashed into accepting their slavish status” (Fonchingong, 136). Acholonu (217) opines that the African woman is “trapped in the claws of the  taboos and the restrictions that only help to propel male chauvinism.” The  oppression and suppression of women is not peculiar to the African woman  alone. It is a worldwide phenomenon that women have had to grapple with in  the last few centuries. Katrack (163) has further stated that “as a female child  grows from childhood to womanhood to motherhood, she is controlled and  owned by her father, her husband, then her sons”, thereby ensuring the  continuation of the subjugation of women in the patriarchal society. </p> <p>According to Judith Astellara, quoted in Azuike “feminism is a  proposal for social transformation as well as a movement that strives to end  the oppression of women.” (3). The passive, docile and insignificant woman  is thus replaced by an assertive, strong willed, courageous and hardworking  woman who is ready to take her destiny in her own hands and to decide her own fate. Women are, in this changing role of social consciousness, refusing gtobe “somebody else’s appendage” (Palmer 39). The writer therefore has the responsibility of shaping the minds and social  awareness of members of every society in order to ensure the emergence of a society that does not discriminate on the basis of one’s gender. </p> <p>MolaraOgundipe-Leslie’s STIWANISM, an acronym for Social Transformation Including Women in Africa, seeks the transformation of the society that fully  integrates women. This is aimed at changing and reshaping the minds of  people, especially men, with regards to gender discrimination and inequality.  Female writers are therefore concerned with the amelioration of the  unfavourable condition of women by trying to change all political, economic, societal beliefs, norms and values that are detrimental to women. In other  words, there is the need for reforms that can change the mindset of men and  their prejudiced notions about women. These reforms and their enforcement  will help reduce and eventually eradicate the subjugation of women that  drives them to such extremes of anguish and despair that some even resort to  murder as the only option for the attainment of freedom. </p> <p>In a bid to liberate themselves from male oppression and dominance and also  to better their lot in the society, women have tended to organize themselves  into socio- political groups. This later metamorphosed into feminist  movements. Through this process, they strive towards emancipating themselves and ensuring the attainment of equal social status and access to opportunities with the men. It is in the context of this feminist-reformist theoretical background that Zulu Sofola’s<em>Sweet Trap </em>and Ola Rotimi’s<em>Husband Has Gone Mad Again</em> are analysed. In these plays, the stifling and oppressive social environments that women live in are aptly portrayed. </p> <p>Indeed, Ngugi has rightly put it that “Literature does not grow or develop in a  vacuum; it is given impetus, shape, direction and even area of concern by  social and economic forces in a particular society” (15). This statement lends credence to the fact that literature is a mirror of the society and draws  from human experiences in order to give the true reflections of realities in the  society. This social context thus explains why the term ‘verisimilitude’ aptly  defines literature; for it is basically an imitation of life, as is lived in the physical world. The oppressive and dehumanizing situations women undergo in these plays seem extraordinary, but these are real life stories that have been  modified and recreated for the society’s awareness. The plays, in effect, is a  dramatic indictment of the oppressive attitudes of men towards women and children that they are supposed to love and care for. It therefore has direct relevance to our contemporary society.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Feminism has remained a topical issue in literary criticism with widespread implications for gender equality and human development across sectors. Increasing attention  is being accorded the negotiation of women liberation in contemporary African literature. However, there has been a limited success in the struggle for gender parity in Africa. Negative stereotype of women as docile, passive and weak still prevail in most male-dominated societies. Despite the growing body of works on feminism, there is of prevalence of violence, subjugation and oppression and of women in African society. Consequently, this study investigates the depiction of feminism in the Nigerian novel and the different forms of gender-based role, violence and how Zulu Sofola and Ola Rotimi treat these issues in their plays. The strategies employed by the author for the liberation of female gender is also examined.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>This research explores the subjugation, oppression and discrimination of women in a patriarchal African society. Zulu Sofola's<em>Sweet Trap </em>and <em>Ola </em>Rotimi's<em>Our Has Gone Mad Again </em>are analysed from the feminist point of view as to critically investigate the oppressive expriences of women in Africa. The focus of the study is to analyse how patriarchal oppression and suppression of women encourages discriminatory treatment and infringement of women's right. also the various established norms and cultures that relegate women to subordinate positions are examined. In addition, the research explores the strategies adopted by women to battle with patriarchal oppression as portrayed in the plays. </p> <p><strong>1.4 Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>Although the plays can be interpreted from different perspectives, this research interrogates various dimension of feminism as depicted in Zulu Sofola's<em>Sweet Trap </em>and <em>Ola Rotimi's Our Has Gone Mad Again</em>. The study cross examines the treatment of  in the plays. Furthermore, the research explores how Zulu Sofola and Ola Rotimi use characterization to depict the sterotype view, discrimination and marginalization of women in African society. The two plays treat different dimensions of feminism in Africa and they form the primary texts that will be used for analysis. In addition, articles and journals with related contents to the study will be analysed. Consequently, womanism will be used as analytical framework.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Methodology</strong></p> <p>This research follows a textual and descriptive method based on a combination of traditional library research and textual analysis. The primary sources include Zulu Sofola’s<em>Sweet Trap </em>and Ola Rotimi’s<em>Our Husband Has Gone Again,</em> while secondary sources include several academic articles, e-books, journals and books related to feminism. The two plays form the basic material for this research. In addition, an interdisciplinary approach was used while drawing views on feminism from the fields of Literature, Philosophy, History and Sociology. The analytical framework for this study is the feminist literary criticism.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>Since the 1970s, patriarchal domination and marginalisation of women has been a central concern of literary studies in Africa, as feminist theory precipitated a critical debate around the representation of African women. Literature and society have strong relationship, and it is for this reason that this research becomes an imperative at this time. To this end, the research becomes of great significance to all who work for the liberation of women in Africa. Organizations and institutions working for the subversion of cultures and laws that oppressive women and the entrenchment of law to protect and guard against the violation of the right of the female gender will find support from a study devoted to the issue of feminism. It is, most importantly, believed to make significant contribution to the body of knowledge and serve as reference material for researchers in the field of literature as well as gender studies in the universities in Africa and elsewhere. It, therefore, helps to enrich current perspective on feminism in Africa.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>2.0 introduction</strong></p> <p>This chapter reviews the concept ,kind and brief  history of feminism as well as African literary works on feminism it also review feminist literary criticism and survey feminism in Nigeria literary scene.in doing this ,the research builds on and acknowledges previous works on feminism.</p> <p><strong>2.1 The Concept of Feminism</strong></p> <p>Feminism is derived from the word “femina” which means woman. Therefore, it will be pertinent to state that feminism is women-oriented and concentrates on issues that concerns women. It is a literary movement that tends to bring about a change in the society especially on how women are treated; it tries to discourage discrimination and humiliation on women; it focuses its attention on emancipation of women. </p> <p>Lots of emphasis has been made on feminism and its stand in the African novel. Women are often relegated to the background and decisions made by men without their consent. Most African novels present female characters as sex objects, inferior beings, and those who must obey the rules made by men. Feminism has been described as having many faces based on the fact that it varies with circumstances surrounding it which can be cultural or historical. Whatever stands one takes, it will revolve around the gap between men and women.</p> <p>Ogunyemi is among the scholars that would not want to be associatewith feminism and they coined their own words. She prefers using womanism. She defined feminism as movement that: smacks off rebelliousness, fearlessness, political awareness of sexism and an unpardonable (from the male view point)drive for equality and equity between sexes. It therefore instills fear in men though it thrills many women. The radical feminist can go as far as doing without the macho male to enjoy her liberty. She posits that: </p> <p>Womanism, with its myriad manifestations, is therefore a renaissance that aims to establish healthy relationships among people, despite ethnic, geographical, educational, gender, ethical, class, religious, military and political differences (123).</p> <p>On the same note, she describes Womanism as the Nigerian woman writer who is constantly aware of the negative connotations of feminist; the fear of being accused by the Nigerian males of allying with the white outsider has turned most Nigerian women writers towards womanism; a black outgrowth from feminism. (124) She further states that Womanism is black centered, it is accommodationist. It believes in the freedom and independence of women like feminism; unlike radical feminism, it wants meaningful union between black women and black men and black children and will see to it that men begin to change from their sexiest stand. (65)</p> <p>By defining both terms, she tries to take a stand on where shebelongs.Similarly, Alice Walker prefers to use womanism and defines it as:</p> <p>a black feminist or feminist of colour…committed to survival and wholesomeness of entire people, male and female…not a separatist, except periodically, for health…love struggle, loves the folk, loves herself…(xi-xii)</p> <p>ObiomaNnaemeka also presents her version of feminism which she prefers to be called “Nego-feminism”and contends that:</p> <p>Nego-feminism is the feminism of negotiation; second, nego-feminism stands for no-ego feminism. In the foundation of shared values in many African cultures are the principles of negotiation, give and take, compromise and balance…African feminism (or feminism as I have seen it practiced in Africa) challenges through negotiations and compromise. It knows when, where, and how to detonate patriarchal land mines. In other words, it know when, where, and how to negotiate with or negotiate around patriarchy in different contexts. (Nnaemeka, 377-378, as cited in Walker,1984)</p> <p>Acholonu (3) uses the term “Motherism” as “Africa’s alternative to Western Feminism”. She believes that a motherist is a humanist and environmentalist. She recognizes that women fell in love and “respects the interconnectedness of all life, the ecosystem and the entire human race” (112).Alice Walker prefers to be called a womanist and upholds that “a womanist is a black feminist or feminist of</p> <p>colour-committed to the survival and wholeness of the entire people, male and female… (but who) loves herself. Regardless” (Davies &amp; Graves 5, as cited in Walker, 1984).</p> <p>Ogundipe-Leslie views that African feminism for me, therefore, must include issues around the woman’s body, her person, her immediate family, her society, her nation, her continent and their locations within the international economic order because those realities in the international economic order determine African politics and impact on the women. There is no way we can discuss the situation of the African woman today without considering what the IMF policies and World Bank are doing to her status and her conditions. (Ogundipe-Leslie, 228) She later disassociates herself from the word “feminism” and prefers using STIWANISM because the issues that revolves around using feminism. It means Social Transformation Including Women in Africa and she postulates that it “is about the inclusion of African women in the contemporary social and political transformation in Africa” (230).</p> <p>It is obvious from the above that most women writers do not want to associate themselves with feminism but there are some that accepts it, to the extent of calling themselves “happy feminist” in the likes of ChimamandaAdichie and Ama Ata Aidoo in a keynote address in which they gave the opinion that when people ask me rather bluntly every now and then whether I am a feminist, I not only answer yes, but I go on to insist that every woman and every man should be a feminist- especially if they believe that Africans should take charge of African land, African wealth, African lives and the burden of African development. It is not possible to advocate independence for the African continent without also believing that African women must have the best that the environment can offer. For some of us, this is the crucial element in our feminism. (Adichie, 47)</p> <p>Elizabeth Fox-Genovese in her essay, “<em>Placing Women’s History in History</em>” argues that feminism places women at the center of history by recognizing their peculiar roles and contribution in the shaping of history (29). Filomena Steady views that feminism is about the issues that affect the African women and they are out in liberating themselves in order to be free. Charlotte Bunch in his opinion states the importance of theory in feminism when he states that:</p> <p>Theory enables us to see immediate needs in terms of long-range goals and an overall perspective on the world. It thus gives us a framework for evaluating various strategies in both the long and the short run and for seeing the types of changes that they are likely to produce. Theory is not just a body of facts or a set of personal opinions. It involves explanations and hypotheses that are based on available knowledge and experience. It is also dependent on conjecture and insight about how to interpret those facts and experiences and their significance. (Hooks, 30)</p> <p>Nnolim (248-261) took a different stand in his definition of Feminism and sees it as an image of “a house divided”. He views that women are fighting themselves through the ways they present their female characters in most of their novels. M. J. C. Echeruo makes a critical assertion to the task that lies ahead for African Feminism when he states that the task that remains is for African Feminism to establish the general and theoretical bases for making the hard choices which Dr. Acholonu says lie ahead between a radical dismantling of patriarchy and a zealous movement or reconciliation and compromises. It is a task to keep African women and all those others who write on the African condition busy for a long, long time. Udumukwu in his book Signature of women affirms: Women’s distinctive approach to various situations and problems posed by life and living in Africa has drawn increasing attention in recent times. </p> <p>The latter part of the twentieth century witnessed the growth of an enormous volume of literature written by women and for women. This literature has underscored the view that the images of women usually found in literature have been created by men without any true reference to the peculiarity of women’s experiences. In African literature, for instance, men have mostly written of women in their own context as sexual objects, as mothers of children as daughter and as mistresses and goddesses. These female stereotypes turn out to conform with the traditional patriarchal view of the woman as inferior to man. (Udumukwu, 5)This was the situation in Africa before women started writing and concentrated on a common theme which Udumukwu refers to as “the recognition of the need to place women at the Centre rather than at the periphery” (Udumukwu, 5).</p> <p>Kate Millet, who is a radical figure in second war of feminism, views that Patriarchy subordinate the female to the male, it treats the female as inferior to male and this power is exerted directly or indirectly, in civil and domestic life to constrain women…Millet recognizes that women as much as men perpetuate these</p> <p>attitudes and the action out of these sex roles in the unequal and repressive relations or dominations and subordination in what Millet calls “sexual politics” (Millet, 173). Nnolim sees feminism as an image of “a house divided”. He views that women are fighting themselves through the ways they present their characters in their novels “With so many African female writers unsure of the future of feminism and of their rebellious female characters that they often destroy or make mad, one could predict a bleak future for the movement” (Nnolim, 19). Chukwuma in response to the above assertion by Nnolim affirms “Nnolim’s fear of equality between the sexes as a result of such female exposure and push is natural for one who all his life has been on the supremacy ladder, and is now in defense of his gender” (Chukwuma, 22). </p> <p>She further states “the women turn out to be the foundation on which the house rests” (Chukwuma, 13). In the same vein, AkachiEzeigbo in response to Nnolim’s assertion posits: “the beauty of existence is seen in controversy, contention, even in discordant voices which would definitely end harmoniously, after everyone has probably had a say. If it does not, then people will have to ‘agree to disagree’” (Snail–Sense, 40, in Ezeigbo, 1991). An example of “a house divided” can be found in Onwueme’s “<em>Tell It To Women</em>” when Yemoja, a female character laments on how she is treated: “If I am not trapped in a husband’s chain or father’s chain, I’m trapped in another woman’s chain. Where is the way? Where is the free—free—freedom that these women talk about? (Onwueme,13).</p> <p>Similarly, Adichie affirms an integrated house constructed on a foundation, consisting of a myriad of African feminist thoughts, is expected to weather the raging storms and robustly play out amidst panoply of concepts and dialectics. And the feminist current remains relevant in this female phase as the women struggles with the stress-related thing around their neck that nearly chokes her before she falls asleep. (Adichie,119, 125)</p> <p><strong>2.2 Feminist Criticism</strong></p> <p>Feminism criticism entails the advocacy of women’s rights on the grounds of sexual equality through literary works. Feminist critics analysis literary works from the perspective of feminism, which shows that women are united with a common notion that male domination is oppressive and there is a need for liberation from all forms of women’s oppression. While feminism emphasizes the inequalities between men and women, black feminists emphasize the diversity within the concept of ‘woman’, which for much feminist analysis is construed as a unitary category. Black feminists claim that the interests of all women should be represented, pointing to profound class differences and antagonism among women. Grown, Cagatay, and Santiago argue:</p> <p>Feminism constitutes the political expression of the concerns and interests of women from different regions, classes, nationalities and ethnic backgrounds. There is, and must be, a diversity of feminisms responsive to the different needs and concerns of different women, and defined by them for themselves. This diversity builds on a common opposition to gender oppression and hierarchy which, however, is the first step in articulating and acting upon a political agenda (1986: 41).</p> <p>The point of departure of radical feminism has been captured in the slogan, ‘The personal is political’ (Hartmann 1997: 63). </p> <p>Radical feminists see patriarchy as the political imperative for structural domination over women. The pervasiveness of male domination is reflected in the labour force and career market. Men maintain their control over women by excluding them from some labour and career markets. They do this by occupying positions of power in the labour force, which enable them to dominate in decision-making processes. Hence controlling the labour force gives them power over woman. Millet portrays this type of control:</p> <p>Our society … is patriarchal. The fact is evident at once if one recalls that military, industry, technology, universities, science, political offices, finances -in short, every avenue of power within the society, including the coercive force of police, is entirely in male hands. (1970: 25)</p> <p>Although men differ, especially along racial and class lines, the patriarchal system nonetheless unites them in their dominance over women, by reducing the latter to economic dependency. Hartmann corroborates this dependency by noting that the social relations amongst men have a social base, which promotes interdependence and solidarity amongst men and enables them to dominate over women (1997: 101).</p> <p>Women’s biological (physical) ‘weakness’ is upheld by patriarchy. In comparison to men, women are seen as physically weak. The nature and social role of women is defined in relation to the norm: white heterosexual male. Women are accorded secondary status which is seen by Weedon thus:</p> <p>Patriarchal power rests on the social meanings given to biological sexual difference. In patriarchal discourse, the nature and social role of women are defined in relation to a norm which is male. This finds its clearest expression in the genetic use of the terms ‘man’ and ‘he’ to encompass all of humankind(2).</p> <p>Radical feminists argue that patriarchy creates the conditions for women to be systematically dominated, exploited and oppressed (Hartmann 1997). The verydifference between men and women which allow men to exploit the situation todominate women and rule the ‘world’ is the very difference that concerns radicalfeminists on a political level. Even though men and women may be viewed as ‘equal’, the differences between them accords a new meaning to the word ‘equal’.</p> <p>Radical feminism promotes womanhood rather than aspiring to integrate and assimilate into the male-dominated social arena. It is focused upon sexual oppression as a manifestation of women’s oppression and social order. Radical feminism is premised on the solidarity of women that transcends class, race and ethnicity. This sisterhood of women is expected to enjoy bonds that are stronger than other existing bonds amongst men and women. Men who have empathetic overtures towards the plight of oppressed women are accommodated.</p> <p><strong>2.4 Review of Related Literature</strong></p> <p>Feminism and women liberation has generated a lot controversy globally due largely to revolutionary literary works of feminist writers in African and beyond. TsitsiDangeremba’s<em>She No Longer Weeps </em>and Ezeajughi’s<em>Nneora:  an African Doll’s House </em>are among influential African plays that depict gender politics and patriarchal domination of women in Africa. TsitsiDangeramba hails from Zimbabwe, which happens to be the setting of the play. The play, written in 1987 during the post-colonial period of Zimbabwe, deals with the marginalization and subjugation of African women, which reign in most African. As portrayed in the play women oppression has deep roots in Zimbabwe. This becomes a great tool of Freddy, the antagonist in the play, as he exploits it to his advantage. However, </p> <p>Women emancipation was promised by independent Zimbabwe, especially in the passage of the legal Age of Majority Act, giving women the right to contract their own marriage, represent themselves in court, and be guardians of their children. Despite such laws, many legal rights of women were not honoured (Shaw, 8)</p> <p>The play, <em>She No Longer Weeps, </em>centres on a female character, Martha, a university graduate who gets pregnant. She is rejected by her parents and the man that is responsible for the pregnancy. She pleads with Freddy to accommodate her as very soon, they would both be earning money from which would enable them take care of their child: “You’ve got a good job and if things work out, I’ll have finished my degree by this time next year. Just think, we’ll be family already. Oh, Freddy, it’s not so bad. It’ll be alright, everything will be just fine”. (108)</p> <p>In this dialogue, the playwright projects the view that women should be empowered through education so that they can be emancipated from male subjugation and fully utilize their potential. Martha makes effort to secure her future, that of he child and that of her potential family by ensuring that she finishes her education. Her pleato Freddy gives the picture of a woman taking responsibility and refusing to be relegated to the position of a second-class citizen. She seeks partnership considering the circumstances surrounding the unborn child, implications of dropping out of school and her rejection by her family. This is an example of Social Transformation and Partnership  thatOgundipe-Leslie advocates for with her stiwanism theory. </p> <p>          Martha appreciates the sacrifices of her mother and women of her generation to keep the home intact, but she decides not to follow the same path, as she the years of servitude of women to men is long overdue:</p> <p>To be a woman is no longer a crime punishable by a life-time   of servitude to men. I know that in your day there were many pressure that prevented a woman who could be independent because they couldn’t work for a wage or salary, but people saw to it that women remain dependent because that was the only way of thing that people know then … I don’t have to be a tied by those beliefs because I can support myself and I will not sacrifice myself to a man’s eye just because society says I ought to. I’m as much as part of the society as anyone of you (123-124)</p> <p>Martha draws attention to the changing phases associated with generation transitions of womanhood. She emphasizes that hers is the phase where it is not only men who are regarded as humans, and that women have dreams to pursue too, irrespective of whether they are single or married, mother or not. She says: “I don’t believe that just because I’m a woman I must sacrifice potential to looking after some idiotic man and his offspring”. (122)</p> <p>          Motherism, an African feminist theory, which centres on mother and child bond, also plays out in <em>She No Longer Weeps. </em> Martha pampers her daughter and gives her the best of care. She clearly exhibits the “motheistic” nature, as opposes to what her mother and other women of her generation showed her.Therefore, she sends the message that a mother’s true pride is her children: “Remember one thing, my love, my daughter is mine, mine. She’s all I have, the one thing I love”. (129)</p> <p>          After child birth, Martha takes her destiny into her own hands. She furthers her education, gets employment and moves to stay on her own. The general view and perception of feminist as women who are independent and assertive is evident at this stage in Martha’s life. She puts on a new assertive and defensive attitude and runs her own life irrespective of other people’s opinion of her: “I don’t want you thinking that just because I let you sleep in my bed you can come here and tell me how to live my life”. (129) She goes on to the extent of instilling similar value in her daughter to be strong no matter the circumstances.From the above analysis and Martha’s specific resolve not to be Freddy’s wife and to take care of her daughter single-handedly, it is true what Anku (15) says that African women can detach themselves from marriage but not from the aspect of motherhood. Motherhood and womanhood form integral part of a woman that even the African feminist cannot detach from.</p> <p>          Martha, during her encounter with MrMutsika and MrsChiwara, indulged Martha to take their girls, but she refused. The two characters are symbolic of western feminist believe and their expectations of the African women. The western feminist believe that as the African has embraced feminism, she is ready to let go of everything and follow their beliefs, but Martha proves otherwise. She would not be used as a tool in their hands to manipulate people in situation she once found herself.</p> <p>          In using Martha, who is a pivot character, the playwright effectively coordinates both sexes and two generations. “Martha strives effectively for equality between the sexes in relation to both her lover and her father”. (Shaw, 27)</p> <p>She serves as a voice for African feminist who is striving for a place in all spheres of global development: economic, social and political. Fredd says: “You don’t know your place in this world, which is underneath. You thought you should be on top” Martha’s response to him is in line with feminist advocacy, because all they want is equality. Therefore, she says:  “No, what I wanted was side by side”. (135)</p> <p>          In <em>Nneora: an African Doll's House</em>, UtoEzeajughi portrays the African men’s predilection to oppress and suppress the female gender. Nneora, a hardworking business woman gives up her all for the sake of marriage to be the wife that her husband wants her to be. Ikenna her husband does not want a working woman but rather a housewife so he can take care of the house: “And I love the way take care of the house. That is the difference between a working wife and a housewife.  A housewife has an edge over the working wife”. (30) Ikenna does not miss out any opportunity in making Nneora know that she is solely his. This exemplifies male chauvinism and how women are marginalized by some men.</p> <p>          Nneora confirms the subservient nature of the woman to her husband in her conversation with Linda: “we are women and once we marry, we must stay under our men”. (70) Linda draws attention of Nneora to the fact that time have changed; gone are the days a man determines what women do and encourages Nneora to take charge of her life.</p> <p>LINDA: Nneora wake up! We actually have right! It is just that we have been brought right up in a hypocritical society, where men gang up to steal everything that belongs to us, including our God-given rights of existence.

She tells Linda: “I don’t think so. Because if you have struggled and succeeded, I believe that there must be other women who have done the same”.

They have also advanced the struggle for women liberation by calling on women to repudiate the negative stereotypes of them and their inferior position as second-class citizen only live to fulfill the dreams of the husband.

It may be described as treating actions themselves as abstract objects, putting value to them. It deals with right conduct and good life, in the sense that a highly, or at least relatively highly, valuable action may be(Adjectivregardedsense),and anasactionethicallyoflow, or   at   least   relatively   low,(Wikipedia)value   may   be   rega Values are important and lasting beliefs or ideals shared by the members of a culture about what are good and desirable. Values have major influences on people‘s behaviours a serve as broad guidelines in all situations. (BusinessDictionary.com)</p> <p> Tradition</p> <p>Tradition can be defined as pertinent, lasting beliefs, culture and rituals among a society, passed down from one generation to another imbued with the concrete or abstract qualities or injunctions that are regarded as supernatural from God, gods, goddesses, heroes, legends, humans, animals and plants. They include symbolic representations and activities in events, festivals and rituals comparable with the sacred activities of the –Asaa Traditional Festival of Nkpologue (Ezugu 6).</p> </div> <p>Traditional Values:</p> <div>Traditional Values are those physical or abstract qualities possessed by particular elements, events, rituals or phenomena held in high-esteem, respect and obedience by individuals. Such values govern and regulate the physical and psychological behavior of individuals living in a particular culture or a geographical area.  <p>Africans as we know are a resilient people, and over time they have developed value systems and ways of coping with life and maintain their communities and to survive great hardships either in the African continent or in the Diaspora. The traditional life of the clan in most tribes of Africa has, as its core value, protection of the family and perpetuation of the tribe. In his traditional life the African holds certain things to be of great value. It is these values which give him a distinct cultural personality and enable him to make some contributions to world knowledge, history, philosophy and civilization. It is not my task in this study to articulate all the cultural values of the African, but only the dominant ones.</p> <p> Large Family:</p> <p>One of the foremost traditional values of the African is having a large family. Children are of supreme value to the African. His primary purpose for marriage is children and to have as many of them as possible. This is the reason why polygamy or the union of one man with several women still holds great attraction for him, and also why the birth rate in Africa is among the highest in the world. The fact is that the African still counts his blessings by the number of children he has, whether they are educated or not, rich or poor, healthy or sick, well-fed or hungry. The African smiles at the sight of his numerous children and is unmoved at the turmoil at his gate as he has a lot of arrows in his quivers.(Seo Ogbonmwan, 2008).</p> <p>Respect for elders:</p> <p>Another great value in traditional Africa is one‘s parents, grandparents and relatives.

Even the children look forward to old age unlike now when hormones are being taken to remain forever young. (Seo Ogbonmwan, 2008)</p> <p> Morning Salutation:</p> <p>As part of the respect for elders, the Benin people of southern Nigeria have a unique way of respecting their elders and identifying their family of origin people say La tose (Edohen of Benin), La emore (Eni of Uzae(Ijare) , La Umogun (Royal blood from Eweka 1) La Ogiesan (Ezomo of Benin) of which there are 56 of them in total.

(Ezugu 12-13).</p> <p> The worship of our ancestors is the basis for the honour and respect accorded to old people in the traditional Africa culture is their closeness to the ancestors, for in his, ontological conceptual scheme the African places his old relatives on his great hierarchy of beings.</p> </div> <div>It must be noted that in the African universe the living and the dead interact with one another. Life goes on beyond the grave for the African and is a continuous action and interaction with dead relatives. <p> These unseen ancestors called ―the living dea invited to partake though spiritually in the family meals. The ancestors are not just ghosts, nor</p> <p>are they simply dead heroes, but are felt to be still present watching over the household, directly concerned in all the affairs of the family and property, giving abundant harvests and fertility and warding off enemies at the village gate.</p> <p>Extended Family Unit:</p> <p>Another important traditional value of the modern African is love for, and practice of, the extended family system.</p> <p>This extended family system is widely odypractic is linked with all the other members, living or dead, through a complex network of spiritual relationship into a kind of mystical body‖ c values,-with-―beingothers‖ or ―being equallyrootedimportantinexistentialkinship characteristic of the African.

Misuse of government power for other purposes such as repression of political opponents and general police brutality is considered political corruption. Most economic political and social problems in under developed societies like Nigeria emanate from corruption. Some of these problems include lack of accountability, diversion of public resources to private ownership, different types of discriminations, ethnicity. Lack of competence, inefficiency etc.<br/>There are many causes of political corruption such as ineffective political processes, ineffective political financing, and poverty. Ethnic and religious difference.<br/>A lot of secrecy still pervades government document and this underlies the need for the passage of the freedom of information bill presently before Nigeria‟s National Assembly, also law public participation in Government to mention a few.<br/>The pervasive corrupt practices have been blamed on the colonial masters. According to this view, the nation‟s colonial history may have restricted any early influences in an ethical revolution.<br/>10<br/>Throughout the colonial period most Nigerians were struck in Ignorance and poverty.<br/>The level of corruption raised serious alarm that attracted the concern of both Nigerians and international community which rated Nigeria as one of the most corrupt countries.<br/>Although, the government embarked upon anti-corruption measures but were not sincerely and properly implemented such that the expected objective and goal were not achieved. The problem was rather aggravated. Since then, corruption has continued to militate against national development.<br/>In Nigeria corruption is a problem that has to be rooted out.<br/>Owusi (2002), however in his book, The Root Causes of Corruption in West Africa, was of the view that;<br/>Corruption is made up of opportunist manipulation or branches of existing laws and regulation for advantages.<br/>He emphasized that;<br/>Our inordinate desire for wealth, power prestige and high status and its desirous consumption of scarce, expensive and prestigious import commodities is no doubt one of the roads to corruption in the society”.<br/>11<br/>Over the years, the country has seen its wealth withered with little to show in living conditions of the average people.<br/>As with many other African nations, Nigeria was an artificial structure initiated by former colonial powers which had neglected to consider religious linguistic and ethnic differences.<br/>The causes of Nigeria Civil War were diverse although, in his memoir, journalist Alex Mitchell blames involvement of the British, Dutch, French and Italian oil companies whose battles for the rich Nigerian oil fields started the Civil War and kept it going.<br/>Nigerian‟s political problems also started from the manner in which the British took over power, administered and abandoned government and people of Nigeria. The British administrators did not make effort to weld the country together and unite the heterogenous group of people. Though many technologies we have today are due to their enlightenment.<br/>Northern leaders however, fear that independence would mean political and economic domination by the more westernized elites in the south, preferred the perpetuation of British rule. As a condition for accepting independence, they demanded that the country continue to be divided into three regions with the North having a clear majority.<br/>12<br/>On January 15, 1966, major Kaduna Nzeogwu and other junior Army officers (mostly majors and captains) attempted a coup d‟etat. It was generally speculated that the coup had been initiated by the Igbo and for their own primary benefit, because of the ethnicity of those that were killed. The two major political leaders of the North, the Prime Minister Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and the Premier of the Northern region, Sir Ahmadu Bello was executed by major Nzeogwu. Also murdered was Sir Ahmadu Bello‟s wife<br/>The coup was not only generally carried out in the Northern region, it was most successful there. The fact that the officer, Lieutenant Connell. Arthur Umegbe was killed can be attributed to the more fact that the officers in charge of implementing Nzeogwu‟s plans in the East were incompetent. The coup, also referred to as the coup of the five majors, has been described in some quarters as Nigeria‟s only revolutionary coup. This was the first coup in the short life of Nigeria‟s nascent democracy. Claims of electoral fraud was one of the reasons given by the coup plotters. This coup resulted in General Johnson Aguyi-Ironsi, an Igbo and Head of the Nigerian Army, taking power as General becoming the first Military Head of State in Nigeria.<br/>13<br/>By the late 1960s the literature of disillusionment was taking form as a reflection of the widespread violent conflict and political corruption which had began to take hold throughout African societies. Such conflicts inevitably threw the nationalist project into turnoil: how can one speak of a nation or even Pan-African identity when a national is at war with itself? In terms of the novel as genre, Gikandi states that in the mid-1960s the form and function of the novel changed almost overnight, moving the reader away from the sometimes celebratory and utopian tone of earlier novels to a grim critique of the narrative of cultural nationalism. This was a generation of writers who are consciously distancing themselves from the project of cultural nationalism.<br/>This interventionist reading of the contemporary problems regarding ethnic conflict in Africa is one that is shared by writers as diverse as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Ngugi Wa Thion‟o. Discussing Nigeria Adichie takes the view that the idea of the tribe has, its roots in colonialism as people did not consciously identify themselves as Igbo, Yoruba or Hausa until the involvement of the British.<br/>The British governed Nigeria indirectly through their traditional rulers, as a result the true leader of the masses were hamstrung and held down. Just because Africans were given authority to rule over her own<br/>14<br/>people. They saw it as means to maltreat those that have more than them and sell his or her brother and sister, mother to gain favour from the superior leaders. The British (Adewale Ademoyeya:why we Struck).<br/>These actions by the local and foreign leaders made the people to seek for independence. Many of them were not thinking straight anymore. The present leadership blame the colonial masters and fore runners of independence for their actions for not doing what is expected of them and also for the embezzlement and stealing of public fund. The political elicits in other to become rich and influential in the society, steal and blame it on the economy and leaders. No one takes responsibility for his own crime and actions.<br/>The politicians and military rulers blame one another for a bad government no one agrees that the other is better than himself.<br/>Emeka Nwabueze is of the opinion that, the question is not weather we should wage war against corruption or not, my quarrel is that the fight should be waged within the context of the constitution.<br/>Several opinions hold that Nigerian political and economic underdevelopment since independence has been as a result of pervasive<br/>15<br/>corrupt practices in both private and public fields: Nepotism which means favouratism granted in politics or business to relatives regardless of merit.<br/>Bribery which is an act of giving money or gift giving that alters the behaviour of the recipient.<br/>Political Scandal is a kind of political corruption that is exposed and becomes a scandal, in which politicians or government officials are accused of engaging in various illegal, corrupt or unethical practices.<br/>Electoral Fraud is the illegal interference with the process of an election. Acts of fraud affect vote counts to bring about an election result whether by increasing the vote share of the rival candidates, or both. Embezzlement, abuse of office etc.<br/>Arnold saw corruption as receiving or offering of money or other advantages in return for contract, acquiring an opportunity, unqualified favor, pervasion of Justice, leading ahead of a queue and the likes. He saw corruption as poverty in juxtaposition to great wealth and luxury or crook in order to live big.<br/>A symbol is an object that represents, stands for or suggests an idea, belief, action, or material entity. Symbols take the form of words, sounds gestures or visual images and are used to convey ideas and beliefs.<br/>16<br/>It‟s also a sign, shape or object which is used to represent something else.<br/>Symbol is seen in every culture, religion and society. This makes symbol universally acceptable in the sense that it does not exist in one society and is absent in another. There are cultural and religious symbols. Cultural symbols are seen in language, traditional attire, and tribal marks, sacred objects of ancestral qualities; like “ofo” in Igbo culture as the communion of the ancestors. In Igbo culture, grey hair is a symbol of old age and should attain contesy and respect, proverb also in Igbo society are symbolic because they are embodiment of wisdom and tradition.</p>\n\nPOLITICAL CORRUPTION AND SYMBOLISM IN ADICHIE CHIMAMANDA NGOZI'S HALF OF THE YELLOW SUN AND OKEY NDIBE'S ARROWS OF RAIN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " POLITICAL CORRUPTION AND SYMBOLISM IN ADICHIE CHIMAMANDA NGOZI'S HALF OF THE YELLOW SUN AND OKEY NDIBE'S ARROWS OF RAIN", "id": 12}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This paper duels on women’s lamentation over male subjugation.

Chapter five summarizes and concludes the work.</p> <p> CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Using the dual perspectives of post-colonial and neo-colonial studies, this paper portions the traumatizing impact of the neo-colonialist leadership on Africa and Africa’s creative writers, as a strand of the continent’s intellectual class striving for genuine independence. It shows the African writer as frequents site for the classless in the struggle by post-colonialist Africans, to wrest true independence from the grip of neo-colonialist leadership. It further traces this rift to the realities of Western capitalism’s predatory dominations of Africa, which began with the brutalizing commodification of Africans as slaves, was followed by the arbitrary creation of unworkable states, and now has reincarnated in neo-colonialism’s garb, and submits that the true and lasting peace and harmony can be achieved by the human race, only if Western capitalism and advances in science and technology are aligned with the pre-industrial, pre-capitalist and pre-racialist human values.</p> <p> The Concept of Neo-Colonialism- Definition of Terms</p> <p>Concept</p> <p>The term, “Concept” is traced back to 1550 – 1560, derived from a Latin word, conceptum, meaning something conceived. But what is today termed “Concepts” is used in mainstream cognitive science and philosophy of mind. It is an abstract idea or a mental symbol, sometimes defined as a unit of knowledge, built from other units which act as a concept’s characterizes.</p> <p> It can also be defined as a general idea derived or inferred from specific instances or occurrences something formed in the mind, a thought or notion.</p> <p>Neo-Colonialism</p> <p>Neo-Colonialism is a term which is commonly used in a variety of academic literature, dealing with the history of the capitalist system, its expansion and contemporary world affairs.</p> <p> The term is originally derived from a contrast made by V.I. Lenin in a pamphlet entitled “Imperialism”, which was originally published in 1939. His contrast was between direct political domination through force of arms and “domination by extra political means”. Early colonialism characterized the period from the beginnings of the age of European exploration and expansion to the gaining of granting independence to former colonies. It essentially involved the imposition of centralized political rule upon non-western peoples, using various means of direct political compulsion.</p> <p> Neocolonialism refers to the continued domination of former colonies using extra political or commercial means. In other words, though is a continuation of the same process of exploitation and assimilation, it operates not through the application of military might or legislative power, but through economic compulsion.</p> <p> On the other hand, neocolonialism (which means new colonialism), does not only rely on the continued domination of former colonies, it is also within the colonies. This is to say that, some Africans (precisely high officials) impose or enforce powers over their fellow Africans, by controlling the political and economic sector of the country.</p> <p> Critics adherent to neo-colonialism contend that multi-national corporations continue to exploit the resources of post-colonial states, and that this economic control inherent to neocolonialism is akin to the classical, European colonialism practiced from the 16th to the 20th centuries. In this sense, neo-colonialism implies a form of contemporary economic imperialism, that powerful nations behave like colonial powers of imperialism, and that this behaviour is likened to colonialism in a post colonial world.</p> <p>The term Neocolonialism first saw widespread use, particularly in reference to Africa, soon after the process of -decolonization, which followed a struggle by many national independence movements in the colonies. Upon gaining independence, some national leaders and opposition groups argued that their countries were being subjected to a new form of colonialism, waged by the former colonial powers and other developed nations, and even amongst the dictatorial leaders in the colonies. Kwame Nkrumah, who in 1957 became leader of newly independent Ghana, was one of the most notable figures to use the term. A classical definition of neo-colonialism is given in his, <em>Neo-Colonialism, the Last Stage of Imperialism</em>. In the book, Nkrumah says; “the neo-colonialism of today represents imperialism in its final and perhaps its most dangerous stage”. He goes further to say that development of the less developed parts of the world and investment under neo-colonialism increases rather than decreasing the gap between the rich and the poor countries of the world. The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed countries operating in less developed countries, it is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries, being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.</p> <p>Nkrumah’s work is self-defined as an extension of Lenin’s imperialism; <em>The Last Stage of Capitalism (1916)</em>, in which Lenin argues that “19th century imperialism is predicated upon the needs of the capitalist system”. Neo-colonialism like colonialism is an attempt to export the social conflicts of the capitalist countries. Che Guevara, Maxist Revolutionary, 1961; says,</p> <p>We politely referred to as ‘underdeveloped’ in truth are colonial, semi-colonial or dependent countries. We are countries whose economics have been distorted by imperialism, which has abnormally developed those branches of industry or agriculture needed to complement its complex economy. ‘Underdevelopment’ or distorted development, brings a dangerous specialization in raw materials, inherent in which is the threat for all our peoples. We the ‘underdeveloped’ are also those with the single crop, the single product, the single market. A single product whose uncertain sale depends on a single market imposing and fixing condition. That is the great formular for imperialist economic domination. (41)</p> <p>Statement of the Problem</p> <p>For many Africans, the formal end of colonial rule did not produce an end to social injustice and drastic economic imbalance. The contention is that colonizers have aimed to control their colonized through indirect means; that in lieu of direct military political control, neocolonialist powers employ economic, financial and trade policies to dominate less powerful countries. They contain a continuing presence in the economies, especially where it concerns raw materials of former colonies.</p> <p> In this context, Joy Chininwokwu’s novels are dominated by a desire to spell out what has been going on in her society, as regards to neocolonialism. Joy Chinwokwu, as well as other African writers yield to a critical examination of post-colonial African societies, seeking neither to embellish nor to discredit them, but to simply depict a reality.</p> <p> Purpose of the Study</p> <p>The main purpose of this study is to find out;</p> <p>-             To what extent the African writers, especially Joy Chinwokwu, have highlighted the problems faced by Africans in line with the neocolonial powers;</p> <p>-             To what extent these writers contributed in spelling out the concepts of neocolonialism and its negative impact on Africans;</p> <p>-             To what extent have these writers tried to change the impression of Africans towards neocolonialism, and how it can be resolved, by the way they reconstruct experiences in their work.</p> <p> Scope of the Study</p> <p>The researcher will focus on the concept of neocolonialism, as depicted in Joy Chinwokwu’s novels, and the roles played by each character as regards to neocolonialism. The project will shed light on the societal influence as shown in the two novels being examined.</p> <p> Significance of the Study</p> <p>The society is going to gain from this study. The pre-occupation of this project is to examine the concept of neo-colonialism, and in this regard, a critical examination of the sociology of neo-colonialism in Africa will be analyzed.</p> <p>The society will be enlightened on the negative aspects and impacts of some of the policies imposed on them by the neo-colonialists, all in the name of development. More so, to seek for a total independence, not only from the external neo-colonialist, but also from the internal.</p> <p>Research Methodology</p> <p>The primary sources of data for this project are, Joy Chinwokwu’s <em>Clouds at Sunrise</em> and <em>After Midnight</em>.

Thus this paper is a comparative study of J.P Clark’s The Raft and Femi Osofisan’s Another Raft as a literary adaptation the study brings out adaptations used in Femi Osofisan’s Another Raft from J.P Clark’s The Raft.</p> <p><strong>1.1     INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Cassell’s Encyclopedia of Literature describes adaptation as an attempt to achieve medium of expression through the medium of inherited material”. Thus the source material in itself is a raw material used as by the artist to practice his creativity on. It is important to note that adaptation should ote be used as tool for plagiarism especially by literacy artist.</p> <p>Adaptation is undoubtedly the means of relocating the context of an existing story to an entirely different setting or period to update the initial story, change its ideological purpose, create an entirely new perspective to the story etc. The use of adaptation by literary scholars can be use for cultural or historical references just as we see in Osofisan’s Another Raft He adapts The Raft by Clark which discusses the socio-political diriftedness of the Nigerian society towards doom and goes beyond by creating a possible way of solution which for him is (UNITY and TOGETHERNESS). Adaptation is universal and has been carried out by several playwright all over the world for various reasons. Bertolt Brecht's The Threepenny Opera (1928) is an adaptation of john Gay's The Beggar's Opera  (18 Century), and was later adapted by wole Soyinka and he called it Opera Wonyosi  (1977). the bacchae of euripides by wole Soyinka is an adaptation of The Bacchae by  Euripides, so also is The gods are Not to Blame by Ola Rotimi an adaptation of Sophocles’ King Oedipus.</p>\n\nA COMPARATIVE STUDY OF J.P CLARK'S THE RAFT AND FEMI OSOFISAN’S ANOTHER RAFT <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF J.P CLARK'S THE RAFT AND FEMI OSOFISAN’S ANOTHER RAFT ", "id": 16}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Study of the comic elements in Wole Soyinka's \"The Trials of Brother Jero andThe Lion and the Jewel.

It began as representation of ideas on rocks, in caves, in motifs and other means of conveying ideas. But inspite of the diversity of communicating devices, they all talked about situations. This continued and evolved through the years to the broad category we now team \"Literature\".</p> <p>Literature as mentioned is a vast but succinctly. We can view it as a body of writing by a people or by peoples using the same language. It has received different definitions from various writers.</p> <p>Literature has been described as anything written as an interpretation of life. It has also been defined as the best word in the best order. Another definition see literature has an expression the temper of an age in terms of imaginative art.</p> <p>Literature as terms emerged from the Latin word \"Littera\" which means letter of the alphabet. This of course means writing as an art, started with the Egyptians (Hieroglyphics) before it became adopted in other cultures like the Greek and French symbols were the initial forms of writing. Situations and activities were highlighted in caves in form of symbols. Paintings and line etching as means of communication and like literature of today, this means of communication was used to inform us and depict real life situations which is the essence of literature.</p> <p>Over the years literature has continued to play this role effectively. To this effect it has been segmented into three major genres: Drama, Poetry and Prose of this three, drama is the most relevant to this paper.</p> <p>Drama captures real life situations and displays them on stage for corrective purposes. A Greek term which means \"action\" drama can be described as a form of literature intend to be interpreted to an audience by actors who impersonate the characters, recite the speeches and perform the actions of the story.</p> <p>Drama has been defined as a literary composition that tells a story usually representing human conflict by means of dialog and action to be performed upon the stage yet another description of drama is that it is the creative creation of authors, actors and audience.</p> <p>Because drama is used to portray real situations, these are usually highlighted to an audience who are the real people. The beginning and the end of the business from the author's point of view is the art of making the audience believe that real things are happening to real people (Bernard Shaw).</p> <p>Drama was necessitated by the fact that it had a more potent impact on an audience. The ear\\test forms of drama were tragic because they portrayed the particular era in which they were performed and therefore were more relevant as tragic.</p> <p>Two types of drama are generally acknowledging comedy which can briefly be described as any play which ends happily and tragedy which ends unhappily.</p> <p>The drama seems to have originated in religious tribal dance such as existed among primitive peoples today. There is a controversy as to the origin of drama: Egypt or Greece. But the first crude drama, whether Egyptian or Greek, told stories and legends of some gods, having originated in rites of worship held in the god's honour.</p> <p>Drama is a form of expression peculiar to no race or epoch. Some form of drama or the other is found in every society-primitive and civilized and has served wide variety of functions in the society.</p> <p>The dramatic pieces capture a particular time-frame of human existence because they tend to document h6tory a peculiar to a people. In achieving this, they employ different plays can satirize society, or they can gently illuminate of human weaknesses; they can define the greatness and the limitation of man in tragedy, or as in modern naturalistic playwriting probe man's mind.  </p> <p>In summary, drama is aimed at either one or more of entertainment ritual celebration and promulgation of an idea. Drama has the widest range of all arts. This is because it not only represents life but is also a way of seeing life. There are some common features in drama the play tells its tales by migration behavior a situation must be represented or the stage often play describes its style up which the mood quality of illusion degree of fantasy or realism are embedded. The languages of drama ranges from intensely theatrical to an almost exact reproduction of real life. Another major component of drama is conflict which is clash of ideas and will. The resolution of the conflict usually marks the ends of the plays.</p> <p>The deeper and more important the conflict is to the spectators. The greater the worth of the drama. As a matter of fact, intensity through concentration is an absolute law of the stage. A good drama or play does three basic things: entertainment instruction and exultation.</p> <p>As mentioned earlier there are two main categories of drama of which comedy is one. The other tragedy.</p> <p>Although tragedy IS often used loosely used to describe any sort of disaster or misfortune, it is actually a work of art that probes with high seriousness questions concerning the role of man in the universe. Tragedy deals with the rebellious spirit in man which resist the limitations of being human.</p> <p>The history of tragedy can be traced to the Greek Dionysian festivals of the 5th century BC. In the Aristotelian view, tragedy imitates men who are better than the average and deals with personages of high estates and matters of great public importance. Tragedy on the whole deals with issues that affect man in a serious manner.</p> <p><strong>1.1     COMEDY</strong></p> <p>Eons ago comedy was merely an art form for entertainment coined from the Greek word komoidia which means merry making.  According to modern tradition, comedy was type of drama whose chief objective was to amuse.  But in the midst of laughter comedy can raise surprisingly serious questions.  We see therefore, that comedy can be both critical and playful.</p> <p>The term comedy has passed through various shades of meaning.  In the middle ages, it simply meant a story with a happy ending; subsequently, the term was applied to mystery plays with a happy ending.</p> <p>Comedy has been defined as many comic or ludicrous incident or series of incident of a form of dram that deals with humorous or ridiculous aspects of human behavior of a dramatic piece of pleasant or humorous character a story with a happy ending an incident suggesting comic treatment.</p> <p>Deeper definitions of comedy have however produced statements describing comedy as vehicle of corrective satire.</p> <p>Comedy (says Aristotle) is an imitation of the worst sort of people in respect to their manners.  They must be exposed after a ridiculous manner.  For men are to be laugh out of their vices in comedy.</p> <p>The business of comedy, according to Sir Richard is to render vice ridiculous, to expose it to public decision and contempt, and to make men ashamed of vile and sordid actions.  James Drake also agrees that the business of comedy is to recommend virtue and discountenance vice.</p> <p>The origin of comedy date back to the rituals in honour of the Greek god of vegetation.  Dionysius’ Comus ode’ which was the term used to refer to the songs sung during the festivals was what was later called comedy.  The term then became applied to the satire plays of Aristophanes and writes like Plautus and Terence.</p> <p>Comedy as a word can be concerned by derivation to the Greek verb meaning to revel which enable as to bind up the origin of comedy with vegetation rituals.</p> <p>As an art form however, comedy has a lot of devices as its disposal to achieve effectiveness in exploring the concept of didacticism because there is always a moral behind all the laughter.</p> <p>Some views of the aims of comedy claim that comedy criticizes the finite for not being infinite. Comedy provoked laughter at the world which man has made himself in his conscious activity. Hegel Comedy consists of the indirect affirmation of the ideal logical order by means of derogation of the limited orders of actuality.</p> <p>Chief among these device for didacticism are comic effects and \"epigrams\" which are comic situations in the actions of the dramatists and witty remarks in their speeches respectively. These devices make it distinct. Though comedy's message is usually subliminal, that is not easily seen on the surface level because its comical effects temporarily hide it, it is one of the most powerful literary tools didacticism today.</p> <p>Comedy has been associated with laughter but the Idea behind all the laughter varies according to the attitude of the author. The author's attitude towards the subject of discussion can be for different purposes to ridicule a person, satirise a society or conventional way of doing things; it can be on love or romance and so on. Laughter as a common criterion in comedy is therefore just a means to an end. The aim of most writers of comedy is to present situations concepts and lines apt to excite their audience's facility of laughter.</p> <p>Sir Philip Sidney observed that in higher forms of the comic there is more delight than laughter.</p> <p>The comic artist's purpose is mirror the society's follies and vices hoping that they will, as a result be mended. The comic drama takes on the features of satire as it fixes on professions of virtue and practice that contradict them.  Satiric comedy dramatizes the discrepancy between the ideal and the reality the pretensions that would mask reality’s hollowness and viciousness.</p> <p>The most important English renaissance statement concerning comedy is that of Sir Philip Sidney in The defense of posies (1595)</p> <p><em>Comedy is an imitation of common errors of our life, which (the comic dramatist) represents in the most ridiculous and scornful sort that may be so as it is impossible that any beholder can be content to such a one.</em></p> <p>Comedy in Africa began a while ago as a ritualistic and royalty tool.</p> <p>In ancient African civilization, festivals, fiestas and yearly rituals to gods took place. Processions were also a part of the lives of these people. The activities were spiced with dance, music and folklore. Mime was also an important part the festivals. Mimesis was meant to be a span of bout five to ten minutes or more showing life in a light way. Because it is a silent act, it depends on rhythmic body movement and gesture to give information and messages. It was from this mimetic form that comedy sprang up as a form of drama.</p> <p>Today comedy in African context as with the past reflects the peculiar aspects of a society. It looks at the society through an intellectual microscope, discerns its ills and puts it forward in a laughable manner.</p> <p>There are different media of comedy, mimesis as earlier mentioned is one of such it parodies the good or bad events in the society, highlighting them to an audience. It is mainly silent and more descriptive. It ushered in theatre groups and itinerant entertainers.</p> <p>Comedy could also be written for performance on stage. Here action is combined with speech. Some plays are also published by notable authors the satire work parade themes ranging from good to evil. Some note worthy authors in this include Ola Rotimi, Femi Osofisan and Wole Soyinka.</p> <p>The establishment, in 1948, of University colleges at Accra (Ghana) and Ibadan (Nigeria) gave impetus to poetry, the novel and drama in the 1950's and 60's. The most intense activity was in Nigeria, the Igbo proving particularly profile with writers like Cyprian Ekwensi- Jagua Nana (1961). Onuora Nzekwu with Wand of Noble wood, (1961) and Nkem Nwankwo ­Danda (1964) Wole Soyinka is however the main playwright for this paper.</p> <p>Akinwande Oluwole Soyinka was born on the 13th of July 1934 In Abeokuta, Nigeria. He is a playwright, poet, novelist and critic. He received the Noble prize for literature in 1986 (the first African to win it). Soyinka attended Government College and University College in Ibadan before graduating in English in 1958 from the University of Leeds in England.</p>                                                           \n\nAN EXAMINATION OF THE COMIC ELEMENTS IN WOLE SOYINKA'S THE TRIALS OF BROTHER JERO AND THE LION AND THE JEWEL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN EXAMINATION OF THE COMIC ELEMENTS IN WOLE SOYINKA'S THE TRIALS OF BROTHER JERO AND THE LION AND THE JEWEL", "id": 17}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Literary style, the meeting point between literary criticism and linguistic analysis, is the focus of this project.

Achebe portrays in the novel a society that is \"infused by its multiplicity of races and of values, and by the bewildering search for a workable compromise\" (Emenyonu 1987: xix).  <strong><em>Arrow of God</em></strong>and Anthills of the Savannah, that are studied in this ~ are set in post-independence Africa.</p> <p>Achebe's writings bear traits of his society while still communicating in a second language. The experiences he reflects relate to the customary practices of his people, the Igbo of Eastern Nigeria 1be immediate exigencies of intelligibility and realistic representation would therefore determine the language he adopts. A multilingual context often demands the integration of languages or dialects. It is natural then that Igbo, the mother tongue of the writer and that of most of his characters., should feature in Achebe's texts, especially when such traditional practices as story-telling, as we have in Anthills of the Savannah, are to be encountered. Proverbs, communal properties in traditional African societies, equally condition the communicative process m this context.</p> <p>When Achebe reports life in Igbo society, he integrates into English the Igbo similes, wise sayings, proverbs, riddles, songs and other traditional art features. Proverbs, in particular, constitute the spine of language use in (traditional) Igbo society. The Igbo describe it as 'the palm oil with which words are eaten'. In the words of Ernest Emenyonu (1987: 156), the proverb \"serves to emphasize and deepen the force of what is said ... and [also] allows intent to emerge without having to resort to bare and blunt words\". For the Igbo man, it is absolutely impossible to display it, wisdom and skills in language use without a good knowledge of proverbs. The linguistic situation is further complicated by the existence of Pidgin English which a large number of people in the society adopt.</p> <p><strong><em>Anthills of the Savannah</em></strong> provide a logical sequel to <strong><em>Arrow of God</em></strong>because it focuses on a phase in the political development of Africa when politicians had been replaced by 'corrective' military regimes. It explores tile climate of mis­-governance, opportunism and alienation which marks this phase, using the fictitious West African state of Kangan as the focus. It also prescribes radical reformism. The story is told by multiple narrative voices, ranging from the first­ person point of view of Chris and Ikem to the third-person point of view.</p> <p>Consequently, there is an inconsistency that hinders comprehension on the part of the reader. The story begins Oft the note 1hat a military government assumes power following a coup in Kangan.  Sam, as the Head of the State is called, then becomes the leader while also assuming the title of president. He surrounds himself with schoolmates and friends.  But he soon begins to suspect them and this degenerates into a chaotic situation. But he soon begins to suspect them and this degenerates into a chaotic situation.  Like any typical African leader, he sets the security machinery in motion to apprehend the 'subversive elements' in the midst of growing social discontent and mounting tension among the radical student-activists.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>The positive portrait of women in the story aligns with the radical inclination of Achebe in the novel. It is possible to establish a link between Achebe's concerns in the two novels. While <strong><em>Arrow of God </em></strong>mirrors tile disappointment of the period immediately after independence, which necessitated the intervention of the military,<strong><em>Anthills of the Savannah</em></strong>carries this indictment to the present by denouncing the failure of the military which has been aided by the self-seeking, educated elite. What we therefore have in his latest novel is merely a reiteration of an old problem. If<em>Arrow of God </em>adopts a recognizable setting, <strong><em>Anthills of the Savannah</em></strong>is set in a fictitious West African State. This makes the relevance of the story transcend a particular socio-political environment as it depicts the dilemma of emergent African states in general.  Ojinma (1990: 90) suggests that \"Achebe's <strong><em>Anthills of the Savannah</em></strong> scrutinizes what the military in power in the new nations of Africa, who came ostensibly to correct the political excesses and muddles of the civilian politicians ... to clear up the men left behind by the corrupt civilian government that preceded them, are making of their intervention\". It has been necessary to establish this link between the texts because they were written at different times. This could then be sufficient background insight into the texts as we proceed to provide some information on linguistic stylistics.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Africa, as an exotic place filled with \"unknowable\" people, has figured prominently in European literature and in the European imagination. Achebe has distinguished himself as a writer by presenting Africa from an African perspective and by pointing out the ways in which European cultural prejudices have affected not only the way Africa and Africans have been portrayed in literature and popular culture, but how Africa and Africans have been treated by imperial powers.</p> <p>This research work intends to analytically compare Chinua Achebe's early and current literary works using the stylistics study of <strong><em>Arrow of God</em></strong>and <strong><em>Anthills of Savannah.</em></strong></p> <p><strong>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of this study will be to compare the early literary works of Chinua Achebe to his current literary works taking into consideration the stylistic approach(s) he used in both literary works.</p> <p><strong>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Chinua Achebe has been considered as one of the fathers of literature in Nigeria. This study therefore, intends to research into the stylistic approach of the man, Chinua Achebe, used in these books, <strong><em>Arrow of God</em></strong>and <strong><em>Anthills of Savannah</em></strong><em>.</em></p> <p>This study also aims at helping other researchers who intend to research further on this work and other books by Chinua Achebe know the current trends in literary works of New Nigerian writers vis-a-vis pioneer Nigerians writers' literary products.</p> <p><strong>1.5    DELIMINATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work will be limited to two books of Chinua Achebe.

Indigenous or colonial language) to adopt for literary expression, has lingered on. This has precipitated the use of various devices by African writers to contextualize aspects of indigenous meaning in the L2 text. Against this background, the present study examines lexico-semantic aspects of transliteration in Gabriel Okara's The Voice (1964), using the parameters of Robert Lado's contrastive analysis. The study explores the various sociolinguistic constraints which determine appropriate lexical choices in the text. The main aim is to enhance understanding and appreciation of the language of Okara's The Voice in particular and African literature in general. The study also highlights the importance of lexis and meaning, as distinctive levels of language, to the construction of any literary discourse. Keywords: Nativization, African literature, lexico-semantic, transliteration,Gabriel Okara,The Voice Introduction Every Literary text is constructed with language. Therefore, it is imperative to determine how a particular writer has utilized the potentials of language to negotiate meaning(s) for his text This thesis is anchored on the premise that, as Brumfit and Carter (1986) put it, we need to show \"how what is said is said and how meanings are made\" within the psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic ambience of the text. As a bilingual and bicultural text, the structure of language use in Okara's The Voice \"calls attention to itself” (Murakarovsky, 1964:58), in the sense that the author manipulates and adapts the rhythm, register, syntax and semantics of the English Language to the linguistic and cultural nuances of his native ijaw Language. Specifically, the peculiarity of Okara's linguistic style in the text under study is a product of, or direct response to, the lingering problem of language in African literature. This problem borders on whether or not the colonial linguistic media (i.e. Portuguese, English, French etc), would be able to adequately and authentically express the socio-cultural and linguistic realities of the African continent. Scott (1990) refers to it as: ….the long-standing debate among critics of African literature over the relation between African authors and the colonial linguistic legacy. This debate which has dominated Africa literature in the past fifty years (Osundare, 2004), stems from the recognition among African scholars/writers of the centrality of language to literature, and the close connection between political independence and cultural emancipation. As literary works are cultural artifacts, the basic thinking is that, the use of colonial languages in African literature is a willing perpetuation of imperialism. Significantly, there has been a sustained polarity of opinion about the appropriate attitude the African writer should adopt to this phenomenon. These range from the fervidly nationalist to the stridently compromising. Osundare (2004) identifies three \"attitudes\" viz: (i) accomodationist, (ii) gradualist, and (iii) radicalist. According to this scholar, the first group (i.e. accommodationist), which has as its chief promoter, Leopold Sedar Senghor of Senegal, favours an outright use of imperialist languages; while the \"gradualists\" are \"the dwellers of the middle of the road\", prominent among whom is Ali Mazrui who advocates a de-Anglicization and re-Africanization of the English language, to authentically convey Africa's literary sensibilities. The third group, on the other hand, is the “radicalist” composed of writers who call for an immediate adoption of indigenous African languages as the media of literary expression. Obi Wali and Ngugi Wa Thiongo are proponents and exponents of this attitude. Instructively, majority of African writers belong to the \"gradualist\" group identified above (i.e. indigenizing the colonial language).</p> <p>The Special Issue on Social Science Research © Centre for Promoting Ideas, USA www.ijhssnet.com</p> <p>203</p> <p>Gabriel Okara, Chinua Achebe, Amos Tutuola, Elechi Amadi, J.P. Clark-Bekederemo, Kofi Awoonor, etc. all fall into this category. In the main, this linguistic constraint would have informed the device of \"transliteration\" adopted in Okara's The Voice. On his part, Ushie (2001), summarizes some of the major positions canvassed by scholars on the problem of language in African literature as follows:</p> <p>a) Those who, following Obi Wali, have continued to advocate the use of African indigenous languages, e.g. Ngugi Wa Thiongo and Immeh Ikiddeh.</p> <p>b) Those who have followed the sophisticated formal English expression e.g. Okigbo, Soyinka, Dennis Brutus, J.P. Clark-Bekederemo, e.t.c.</p> <p>c) Those who, following Janheiz Jahn, have suggested that European languages, for instance, English, be used in such a way that languages bear the African cultural experience while remaining intelligible internationally. Chinua Achebe‟s novels, especially Things Fall Apart and Arrow of God, and the poetry of Okot P „Bitek and Kofi Awoonor illustrate this category.</p> <p>d) Those who advocate transliteration as a way of keeping intact African cultural heritage while using foreign words, e.g. Gabriel Okara, AS illustrated in his novel, The Voice</p> <p>e) Those who may be described as following a plural code e.g. Ken Saro Wiwa (whose literary oeuvre is a pot-pourri of linguistic codes with which he has experimented in his work. His novel, Sozaboy, for instance, comes in Nigerian pidgin English; his poetry collection Songs in a Time of war, is in both Nigerian “Standard” English and in Nigerian pidgin English; while several of his biographical works are in sophisticated Nigerian English, just as his posthumously published novel.</p> <p>Generally, it is germane to note that African scholars who advocate the use of indigenous languages are goaded on by nationalist sentiments, while their counterparts who favour colonial languages place a high premium on the global intelligibility and outreach of a work of art. Bilingualism and African Literature We have established Gabriel Okara's text as a bilingual text. It is, therefore, pertinent to shed some light on the term “bilingualism”, in relation to African literature. Bloomfield (1933) defines the term as “the native-like control of two languages\". Lambert (1977) sees it as \"the existence of two languages in the repertoire of an individual or a speech community\". The significant thread that runs through both definitions is that the term reflects a situation where two languages are used side by side, whether by an individual or a given society. Bilingualism is a product of language contact. Appel and Muystan (1987:1) confirm inter alia: “Language contact inevitably leads to bilingualism.” The inference of this is that, at least, two different languages with distinctive features (i.e. lexical, semantic, phonological and syntactic) must come into contact for bilingualism to occur or manifest. Akindele and Adegbite (1992) identify factors such as colonialism, commerce, conquest, annexation and war, etc, as having the potentials to precipitate such language contacts. The bilingual situation in Africa is traceable to the historical accident of colonialism, which was a by-product of the Berlin conference of 1885, where African nations were balkanized among imperial powers (i.e. Britain, France, Portugal), for administrative purposes. The corollary is that African countries are either Anglophone or Francophone, etc. in addition to the sundry local languages spoken by the compatriots. As literature is an expressive art, the consequent complex linguistic situation is reflected in the literature of these African countries, as explored above. Alo (1998) has outlined some devices used by African writers to reflect local or indigenous nuances in their styles viz:</p> <p>i. Coinages, borrowing, etc.</p> <p>ii. The use of native similes and metaphors</p> <p>iii. The transfer of rhetorical devices from native languages</p> <p>iv. The translation of native proverbs, idioms, etc.</p> <p>v. The use of culturally dependent speech styles</p> <p>vi. The use of syntactic devices and deviation</p> <p>vii. Code-switching and code-mixing</p> <p>viii. Transliteration</p> <p>International Journal of Humanities and Social Science Vol. 1 No. 13 [Special Issue – September 2011]</p> <p>204</p> <p>It is important to note that, the foregoing devices are adopted, in varying degrees, by different writers to reflect aspects of indigenous meaning. This gives a distinctive African cultural identity to the texts. Literature Review/Theoretical Foundation According to McAthur (1992), contrastive linguistics is a branch of applied linguistics that \"describes similarities and differences between two (or more) languages at such levels as phonology, lexis, grammar and semantics\". This concept is relevant to the present study because it enables us to compare and contrast the two languages in question i.e. Ijaw and English. Based on behaviourist and structuralist theories of the 1950's, Lado's (1957) contrastive analysis, which we adopted for the analysis, operates on two broad principles. The first is that both languages are described separately. Secondly, only patterns form the basis for comparison and not whole languages, for, as Olabode (2001) observed: ... each language is a complex of a large number of patterns at different levels and at different degrees of delicacy. Therefore, there can be no single general statement accounting for all of these patterns. In his introduction to Okara‟s text, Ravenscroft (1969) remarks that, the text had a mixed reception and that some African reviewers found its unconventional use of the English language uncomfortable. The scholar adds that reviewers abroad were also partly nonplussed by the language and curious about its strange symbolism. This situation could have engendered the initial cold feet developed by critics, and the awful misunderstanding of the linguistic and cultural value and significance of The Voice in African literature (Iyasere, 1982). However, Duruoha (1992) observes that, “a growing volume of critique on this novel is emerging”. Previous linguistic works on the text include: shiarella‟s (1970) “Gabriel Okara‟s The Voice: A Study in the Poetic Novel”, Burness‟ (1972)” The Voice: Stylistic Innovation and the Rhythm of African Life”, Okiwelu‟s (1987) “ Gabriel Okara: The Voice and Transliteration”, Scott‟s (1990) “Gabriel Okara‟s The Voice: The Non-Ijo Reader and the Pragmatics of Translingualism”, and Duruoha‟s (1992) “ Form as Metaphor in Gabriel Okara‟s The Voice”. The Significant point is that none of these works focuses mainly on how lexis and meaning have been organized to help the author achieve the target of transliteration in the text, using the tools of contrastive analysis. Transliteration and Translation Alo (1998) defined “transliteration” as the “process whereby the units of one language, e.g. words, structures, are replaced by those in another language e.g. from a Nigerian language into English ...” Hornby (2000) says it is “to write words or letters using letters of a different alphabet or language\". These definitions imply that the term involves the replacement of each source language word or other units with the units of the target language. Thus, words or structures in the Ijaw language could be converted to the English Language, as is the case in Okara's The Voice. Translation is a related concept. It refers to the neutral term used for all tasks where the meaning of expressions in one language is turned into the meaning of another language, whether the medium is spoken or written (Catford, 1965), without recourse to the structures or rules of the source language. In ranking translation, Catford identified three levels of the term:</p> <p>(i) Word-for-word translation; i.e. every word in the source language is replaced by the equivalent in the target language.</p> <p>(ii) Literal translation i.e. the structure of the source language is adapted to the rules of the target language.</p> <p>(iii) Free translation i.e. the translator has nothing to do with the linguistic structures of the source language.</p> <p>(see Olabode, 2001) From the foregoing ranking, it is clear that \"transliteration\" is an aspect of “translation”. A Brief Biography of the Author To fully appreciate the significance of the linguistic experiment in Okara‟s The Voice, it is imperative to peep into the background of the author. This will expose us not only to the linguistic and socio-cultural or ancestral origins of the writer, but also to his distinct personality, interests, and place in modern African literature, which are crucially relevant to our understanding and appreciation of the linguistic experiment in the text. Born in 1921 in the Ijaw area of Bayelsa State of Nigeria, Gabriel Imomotimi Okara is one of the earliest exponents of African literature in English. After obtaining a Higher School Certificate (HSC) at Government College, Umuahia, he became a book-binder, autodidact, administrator, and Biafran nationalist. K.E. Senanu and T. Vincent (1976) comment that from this point in his life:</p> <p>The Special Issue on Social Science Research © Centre for Promoting Ideas, USA www.ijhssnet.com</p> <p>205</p> <p>…okara developed a remarkable personality by dint of personal tuition, reflection and deep interest in literature generally and in the language and culture of his people. From the foregoing comment, we can observe that, though he later studied journalism at Northwestern University, USA, Okara had developed interest in literature generally and his linguistic and cultural roots in particular at a very early age. This interest must have motivated him to do extensive research into these two areas of study. There is no doubt that this would have equipped him with the intellectual resources to fashion out a new linguistic idiom to interpret his bilingual and bicultural environment. It is, therefore no coincidence that the most significant thing that marks out Okara in African literature is the experiment with language (i.e. transliteration) in his The Voice. Apart from this novel, the writer is also one of the earliest and foremost poet in Africa. His poetry has won major local and international awards, including the Commonwealth poetry prize (1979) and the Nigeria (NLNG) prize for literature (2005). Socio-cultural Context of the Text It is imperative to establish the socio-cultural context of Okara's text. This is because the emphasis of a linguistic study of a bilingual text is on the functional or pragmatic use of language which must reflect the socio-cultural typology in which it grows. In other words, the study is a survey of situated speech, with the context serving as a significant background. Okara's The Voice is set in the socio-political context of post independent Africa. Specifically, it highlights the moral corruption in high places, as represented by Chief Izongo and his Cohorts. Okolo, on the other hand, represents the handful of genuine moralists and social crusaders who fight for the restoration of sanity and rectitude. The fact that the epidemic of corruption and moral decay spreads to everywhere in the text (i.e. both Amatu and Sologa), underscores its pervasiveness and persistence. The conflict of the text is thus, that between LIGHT and DARKNESS. Essentially, it is against the background of this grim struggle between forces of light and darkness, that linguistic choices in the text are patterned. Textual Analysis With the foregoing preliminary insights, we shall now examine aspects of lexical and semantic transliteration in Okara's text. The focus on lexico-semantics is, itself, significant. Apart from delineating both concepts as distinctive levels of language, the point is that words are only functional in semantic contexts. This much is echoed by McCarthy and Carter (1988) when they posited that: Much of what has been written concerning lexis over the years has assumed that the proper place for discussion of the subject is within semantics. However, in this discourse, we shall restrict our exploration to verbal forms which are culled from the L1 of the author for the expression and contextualization of indigenous meaning, under the following sub-headings:</p> <p>i. Coinage or neologism</p> <p>ii. Collocation</p> <p>iii. Linguistic borrowing</p> <p>iv. Semantic extension/shift</p> <p>v. Contextual meaning of Lexical transliteration</p> <p>Coinage/Neologism In Okara's The Voice, we find a preponderance of lexical coinages that reflect the linguistic milieu of the source language. Apparently, this is a product of the author's strategy of transliteration. This strategy precipitates a phenomenon of multi-word units or compound neologisms, which abound in the text With the L2 + L2 structure of these compound neologisms, we observe that meaning is traceable to the source language, though the constituent lexical choices are English. Below are some illustrative examples from the text:</p> <p>i. You know-nothing people (p. 121)</p> <p>ii. The caring-nothing feet of the world</p> <p>iii. We are know-God people (p. 32)</p> <p>iv. Wrong-doing filled their insides (p. 31)</p> <p>v. These happening-things (p. 48)</p> <p>vi. Man-killing medicine (p. 37)</p> <p>vii. Black-coat-wearing man (p. 37)</p> <p>viii. Surface-water things (p. 34)</p> <p>International Journal of Humanities and Social Science Vol. 1 No. 13 [Special Issue – September 2011]</p> <p>206</p> <p>ix. Surface-water laugh (p. 36)</p> <p>x. Questioning-word (p. 53)</p> <p>xi. Teaching-word (p. 37)</p> <p>xii. Meeting-place (p. 48)</p> <p>xiii. Know-nothing footsteps (p. 34)</p> <p>We may not bother to explain the lexical items underlined above, since their textual meanings are very clear. However, we need to emphasize that, although compounding itself is a lexico-semantic device deployed by writers to encode or foreground textual meaning, they are discussed under neologisms because their inference and usage is unusual and novel, even though the author has used the English code. They are clearly a product of word-for-word translation from the source language (ie. Ijaw), to the target language (ie. English) (see Catford‟s 1965) ranking of translation above). Hence Alo (1998) contended that word coinage or neologism occurs \"\"when a new word is made up or created in order to express a cultural concept, object or institution\". This scholar explains the nature and purpose of innovations in language use inter alia: There is the natural human tendency to innovate in language, either for the sake of being creative and original or as a result of the need to express new objects, things or ideas. People are always creating new expressions or altering old ones to fit new ones. Innovations in language are chiefly controlled by the necessities of communication…Innovations in non-native English occur as a result of new cultural identities Collocation Collocation is a type of syntagmatic lexical relation which refers to the habitual co-occurrence of individual lexical items. Halliday (1964) sees it as “the company lexical items keep ... their propensity for particular neighbours and environments\". In Okara's The Voice, we find this \"co-occurrence” of words as a result of transliteration from the author's native Ijaw to English. Importantly, these collocations are deliberately and systematically reiterated to establish the cumulative meaning of the text. Collocations such as \"straight things”, “good bottom\" and \"open inside\", for instance, etch the theme of truth and integrity as championed by Okolo; while “turned world”, stinking things” and “spoilt world” purvey corruption and moral decadence, as orchestrated by Chief Izongo and his aides. The critical point here is that these collocations can only be decoded or interpreted according to the mode of signification in the author's native Ijaw language. Linguistic Borrowing As the term indicates, this phenomenon is basically concerned with the borrowing of linguistic devices from the LI in order to transmit the intended indigenous meaning in the target language or L2. Bloomfield (1933:44) saw it as: “The adoption of features which differ from those of the main tradition”. The implication of this definition is that, linguistic borrowing is essentially engendered by the non-availability of a lexical equivalent(s) of a native concept in the L2. This seems to be informed by Yule‟s (1944) hypothesis in his The Statistical Study of Literary Vocabulary that\"... the colour and flavour of a text... are determined by the common words used by the author ...\". However, in this text, Okara appears to have used the device indiscriminately (i.e. even where there are lexical equivalents in the L2). Quite apparently, this is in keeping with the technique of transliteration, which is the hallmark of the work. In our exemplification, therefore, we shall show</p> <p>i. L1 borrowings which have no S.B.E. equivalents and</p> <p>ii. L1 borrowings which have ready S.B.E. equivalents.</p> <p>For the latter, we shall bolster our hypothesis by providing the S.B.E. equivalents. Borrowings without S.B.E. Equivalents</p> <p>a. Things of the soil (p. 61)</p> <p>b. Things that follow me (p. 62)</p> <p>c. Things of the ground (p. 65)</p> <p>d. One with black face (p. 63)</p> <p>The meaning of all the lexical constructs presented above can only be decoded in the LI sense. This is because they are not available in the L2 code. Specifically, they concern the African belief in ancestors and gods. This religious philosophy is directly opposed to the monotheism of the west. While (a) and (c) above, for instance, refer to the ancestors and gods of the land, (b) refers to guardian gods/spirits and (d) refers specifically to the sea god known as “Benikurukuru\" whose face is always being referred to as being charcoal-black.</p> <p>The Special Issue on Social Science Research © Centre for Promoting Ideas, USA www.ijhssnet.com</p> <p>207</p> <p>Borrowings with L2 or S.B.E. Equivalents</p> <p>S/N</p> <p>Source Language (LI)</p> <p>S.B.E.

The critical point is that, the author ignores the S.B.E form, and uses the source language (L1) form, in line with the technique of transliteration adopted in the text. Semantic Shift/Extension In this situation, the meaning of standard English words are extended to accommodate local sentiments or concepts. It is pertinent to observe that, in Okara's The Voice, semantic extension is a product of transliteration. Let us illustrate this phenomenon with the following two examples:</p> <p>i. What I do with my money does not touch you (p.92)</p> <p>ii. Did he no part of your body touch? (p. 65)</p> <p>In S.B.E., \"to touch\" suggests physical contact. Hornby (2000) defines it as \"to be or come so close together that there is no space between\". In the context of (i) above, Okara has extended it to mean \"concern\" i.e. \"what I do with my money is not your business\". In the context of (ii) above, on the other hand, the term has been extended to mean \"a deliberate, sensual or lustful contact”. In the LI of the author, the term could also suggest copulation or sexual intercourse i.e. \"have you touched her?\" The major point here is that, the term carries semantic properties of the LI of the author which extend beyond their native English uses. Contextual meaning of Lexical Transliteration Having delineated aspects of lexical transliteration in the text, our next task is to show that these lexical items are only meaningful within the context of the author's native cultural values and environment. The contextual theory of meaning is associated with systemic linguists and constructs can only be decoded against the background of the pattern of signification in the source language. According to Brumfit and Carter (1986:145): ...the more culture-bound the style becomes, the more distance is created between the native varieties of English and the non-native varieties. The fact is that, apart from culture-bound lexical constructs such as \"spoilt world\" (which means corrupt world); 'surface-water things' (hypocrisy) \"search with all his inside\" (spiritedly); \"had no chest\" (lacks courage); \"day's eye\" (weather), etc, Okara's transliteration in his The Voice is foregrounded by his use of forms for which options are readily available. For illustration, let us examine the table below:</p> <p>S\\N</p> <p>L1</p> <p>Transliteration Options in the L2</p> <p>I</p> <p>Teme</p> <p>0) Spirit (ii) Shadow</p> <p>Ii</p> <p>Gomu iye</p> <p>Straight thing\\true, honest, genuine</p> <p>Lii</p> <p>Gesi iye</p> <p>True \\ honest thing</p> <p>The table above shows that (i) teme which is the LI form, is an ambiguous word. The two meanings are shown in the L2 code.</p> <p>International Journal of Humanities and Social Science Vol. 1 No. 13 [Special Issue – September 2011]</p> <p>208</p> <p>The point is that Okara deliberately opts for \"shadow\" when, in the actual sense, \"spirit\" is closer to the L2 code in the following context, for instance: He was in search of it with all... his shadow (p. 23) The inference is that okara could have used \"... with all his spirit\", which is actually more contextually appropriate. For (ii) and (iii) on the table above, let us examine the following context: I could have been a rich man be ... if the straight thing I had not done. (p. 105). Though the line between \"straight\" and \"honest/true\" is very thin, quite obviously, \"true\" or \"honest\" thing would have bee closer to the S.B.E. or L2 code. In a similar vein, the use of \"standing moment\" (p. 53), which we have earlier identified among borrowings with L2 or SBE equivalent in section 6.3.2, is too ambitious i.e. done without regard to the constraints of transliteration. In the original Ijaw form, it is \"tie kiri\" i.e. 'Standing ground\". Obviously, Okara reckoned that the latter (i.e. \"standing ground\") would be meaningless in the L2 code. Our contention is that, faced with this transliteration constraint, he should have left it at the SBE or L2 form i.e. \"from this moment\", instead of opting for a form that makes no sense in both codes. Conclusion In this study, we have shown how a an African writer has nativized the English language to interpret his native sociolinguistic environment. Specifically, we have established that Gabriel Okara's The Voice is a bilingual text in the sense that it renders the sociolinguistic features of the writer's L1, in the target language or L2, by exploring the various lexico-semantic resources that reflect its hybrid character. Importantly, we have also shown that the author's linguistic experiment of \"transliteration\" is a valid and relevant response to the persistent problem of language in African literature. The implication of this phenomenon is that a lot of socio-cultural and even historical variables come into play in the construction of an African literary text for, as Adekunle (1987:1) put it, for effective communication of textual meaning to take place, there must be \"additional knowledge of the socio-cultural variables present in the context of situation.\" Thus, our finding in this study is that, to fully appreciate the use of words and their meanings in Gabriel Okara's The Voice, or other African literary texts, there is the need to situate them in the proper sociolinguistic context.

Introduction</p> <p>There is no doubt that J.P. Clark-Bekederemo is one of the leading lights of Nigeria’s</p> <p>first generation of writers. This thesis springs from his historicity, the quantity and</p> <p>quality of his literary procreations and the prodigious critical attention and acclaim these</p> <p>works have attracted across the globe. However, unlike other Nigerian writers such as</p> <p>Soyinka and Osundare, there is an acrite dearth of critical works on the language of the</p> <p>poet. Eyoh’s (1997) J.P. Clark’s Poetry: A Study in Stylistic Criticism remains the only</p> <p>full-scale linguistic investigation of the writer’s poetry. The critical fact is that this work</p> <p>is limited by its triadic focus on the phonostylistic, lexical and paralinguistic affective</p> <p>aspects of the poet’s idiolect.</p> <p>There is no doubt that language is very crucial to literary procreation and</p> <p>discourse. Todorov (1977) highlights this view when he defined literature as a verbal</p> <p>work of art. The implication is that, to fully grasp the meaning and aesthetics of a literary</p> <p>text (or any text for that matter), there must be recourse to language at all levels of</p> <p>linguistic description, because it is the singular medium of its expression. Dada (2004)</p> <p>explains:</p> <p>A literary work contains a lot of codes and information that must be decoded in</p> <p>order to fully grasp the meaning of the work; it has sound patterns, semantic</p> <p>relations and syntactic organization. All these must be taken into account when</p> <p>reading a literary text.</p> <p>The present study, therefore seeks to fill the gap left by Eyoh’s (1997) work in the area of</p> <p>lexis and grammar, by investigating the role deictic words play in encoding the meaning</p> <p>Yeibo: Deictics and Stylistic Function in J.P. Clark-Bekederemo’s Poetry 2</p> <p>and aesthetics of the texts. Dever (1998) posits that, in creating any text, literary or nonliterary,</p> <p>we must combine words to express complex ideas or relationships in sentences</p> <p>Lyons (1977:249) echoes a similar viewpoint when he averred that “… the function of</p> <p>language tends to be reflected in its grammatical and lexical structure…” Against this</p> <p>background, the study demonstrates that lexico-grammatical patterning in a text is as</p> <p>crucial as any other level of linguistic description in encoding the message and aesthetics</p> <p>of literary discourse.</p> <p>2. Theoretical Foundation/Literature Review</p> <p>Stylistics is the branch of linguistics that focuses on style, particularly in works of</p> <p>literature. Cluett and Kampeas (1979) refer to it as the judgment of “the tangible</p> <p>manifestation of style”. According to Allan et al. (1988), the concept</p> <p>.... studies the characteristics of situationally distinctive use of language and tries</p> <p>to establish principles capable of accounting for particular choices made by</p> <p>individuals and social groups in their use of language.</p> <p>From the foregoing preliminary statements, we can see the water tight relationship</p> <p>between style and stylistics. It is the workshop of stylistics; the soil on which stylistics is</p> <p>sown. Hence, Babajide (2000) observes that where there is no style, there is no stylistics.</p> <p>What then is style? Basically, it refers to the way we do things – dress, talk, pray, dance,</p> <p>walk, etc. in a linguistic sense, the concept infers the specific manner a particular speaker</p> <p>or writer expresses himself. Leech and Short (1981) see it as “the way language is used in</p> <p>a literary text, with the aim of relating it to its artistic (or aesthetic) functions” (p.14-15).</p> <p>According to Tomori (1977), “there is a style in everything we say; so style cannot be</p> <p>isolated from language itself; but it is a distinctive aspect of language” (p. 53).</p> <p>Through the ages, different scholars have come out with various theories to</p> <p>explicate the concept of language and its use, particularly in literary circles. This fact</p> <p>underscores the critical place of language in human existence, as it constitutes the</p> <p>bedrock of human socialization and civilization. The Russian formalism of the 1920s and</p> <p>the structuralist school of the 1960s postulate the existence of a special “poetic</p> <p>language”, as distinct from “ordinary” or “scientific” language. Wellek and Warren</p> <p>(1963) also distinguishes a poetic use of language, in the sense that, it is non-referential,</p> <p>non-practical, non-casual, etc. This implies that “poetic language” is unique as a result of</p> <p>its conscious use of linguistic and imagistic devices to foreground aspects of meaning.</p> <p>Another fundamental aspect of the language of poetry is its deviant character. The</p> <p>language of poetry inherently and overtly deviates from linguistic conventions or norms,</p> <p>at all levels of its use i.e. semantic, phonological, lexical, syntactic, etc, because poets</p> <p>enjoy what has been referred to as poetic license. Hence Widdowson (1984) contends</p> <p>that, “it is common to find instances of language use which cannot be accounted for by</p> <p>grammatical rules,” in poetry (p.162). According to Crystal (1987), it is this deviant and</p> <p>abnormal feature of the language of poetry that stylistics focuses on. Chomsky’s (1957)</p> <p>Transformational Generative Grammar (TGG), is also germane to the present discourse,</p> <p>3 Yeibo: Deictics and Stylistic Function in J.P. Clark-Bekederemo’s Poetry</p> <p>as it postulates the disparity and relations between deep and surface structures. The</p> <p>relevant point in Chomsky’s TGG is that the meaning of surface linguistic constructs like</p> <p>poetry is retrievable only in the deep structure. This point also underscores the fact that</p> <p>meaning in poetry texts is multi-layered and multi-faceted.</p> <p>However, since the primary concern of the present study is on the functional</p> <p>aspect of language, we shall adopt M.A.K. Halliday’s Systemic Functional Grammar</p> <p>(SFG), as our analytical model, in the sense that it focuses not only on the structure of</p> <p>language, but also on the properties of discourse and its functions in specific social and</p> <p>cultural situations. Specifically, the study adopts Halliday’s three meta-functions of</p> <p>language viz.: ideational, interpersonal, and textual for the textual analysis. The</p> <p>ideational metafunction focuses on the subject matter or field of discourse, while the</p> <p>interpersonal meta-function refers to the tenor of discourse i.e. the social relationship that</p> <p>exists among participants in a given discourse situation, which has the potentials to</p> <p>influence or shape language use. The textual meta-function is particularly relevant to our</p> <p>study, as it focuses on the internal organization and communicative nature of a text. The</p> <p>pre-occupation of this study is to show how deictic words are organized with contextual</p> <p>considerations in J.P. Clark-Bekederemo’s poetry, to foreground aspects of meaning and</p> <p>aesthetics in the texts.</p> <p>Thus, our adoption of Halliday’s Systemic Functional Grammar for textual</p> <p>analysis, is necessitated by its sociological and functional appeal. According to Opara</p> <p>(2005), Halliday’s claim in this theory is that language structure reflects the social uses to</p> <p>which language is put. In other words, we agree with Osakwe (1995) that “the language</p> <p>of the poet mirrors the function and purpose of a poem – like any other linguistic text</p> <p>which is also dependent upon major situational factors” (p. XIV). The critical point is that</p> <p>the linguistic-stylistic approach that we have used in the study enables us to examine and</p> <p>characterize the structural and functional aspects of a writer’s idiolect. Ayemoni (2004)</p> <p>posits that the approach offers three major benefits. Firstly, the analyst will be aware of</p> <p>the structural pattern of language permeating a text, to enable him identify the prominent</p> <p>or foregrounded stylistic features of the text. It also enables the analyst to be consciously</p> <p>aware of the kind of social variations, which the inherent linguistic features are identified</p> <p>with. Finally, the approach also enables the analyst to know the technique of putting</p> <p>down these features systematically in order to reveal the internal patterning of texts.</p> <p>3. The Concepts of Deictics and Stylistic Function.</p> <p>Deictic elements (also called shifters), which are particular words whose referential</p> <p>meaning shifts with every new speaker or occasion of use are very critical in the analysis</p> <p>of referential items in stylistics and pragmatics. Generally, pronouns function as deictic</p> <p>words, i.e. personal pronouns such as I, me, you, she, he, it, and pronouns that refer to</p> <p>places and times such as here, there, now, then, respectively. Deixis that indicate the</p> <p>position or environment of the speaker in relation to spatial location such as locative</p> <p>adverbs (i.e. here, there) and demonstratives (this/that) are called “spatial deixis”, while</p> <p>temporal adverbs such as now, then, which place a speech event in a specific or</p> <p>Yeibo: Deictics and Stylistic Function in J.P. Clark-Bekederemo’s Poetry 4</p> <p>approximate time frame, are referred to as “temporal deixis”. Personal pronouns such as</p> <p>I, me, you, she, it, etc., are called “person deixis”.</p> <p>Deictic words are important in stylistic and pragmatic analysis of texts as a result of their</p> <p>absolute dependence on context, for their explication or interpretation. The situational</p> <p>context from which the reference is made constitutes the “point of view” that must be</p> <p>understood to interpret the statement (Wikipedia online Encyclopedia, 2009) Wikipedia</p> <p>(Ibid) illustrates this point inter alia:</p> <p>If Tom is speaking and he says “I”, he refers to himself,</p> <p>but if Tom is hearing Betty say “I”, then the Origo is</p> <p>with Betty and the reference is to Betty.</p> <p>In most languages, deictics function in two ways. These are termed proximal and distal</p> <p>deictic references. The first refers to things and places that are closer to the speaker; the</p> <p>other refers to things and places that are far from the speaker and/or closer to the hearer.</p> <p>Thus, the English language, for instance, has pairs such as this/that, and here/there. Some</p> <p>other languages have a three-way deictic system viz.: proximal, medial and distal i.e. near</p> <p>the speaker; near the hearer; far from both. Romance languages generally function in</p> <p>three ways.</p> <p>Stylistic function, on the other hand, is an aspect of language function. According</p> <p>to Alo (1998), language function can be explained in two ways. Firstly, it refers to the</p> <p>specific use to which a writer or speaker puts the language (i.e. description, explanation,</p> <p>argument, persuasion, humour, etc.). Secondly, in stylistic description it refers to the</p> <p>communicative value or role of specific language categories (i.e. sentence, clause, word</p> <p>group, collocations, word and morpheme), in given social situations. Language function,</p> <p>therefore, implies varieties of language that are defined according to use. Halliday (1978)</p> <p>labeled language as a “social semiotic” in the sense that it evolves in a context and the</p> <p>environment in which people deploy language to serve communicative needs can shape</p> <p>its form and meaning. The analysis of the texts would demonstrate that J.P. Clark-</p> <p>Bekederemo’s poetry under study is dense with deictic words which not only preserve</p> <p>and project the expressive beauty of the works, but also help to capture intentions more</p> <p>vividly and produce desired meanings and effect on the audience or readers.</p> <p>4. Brief Biography of the Poet</p> <p>Born December 6, 1933 in Kiagbodo in the Ijaw area of present-day Delta State of</p> <p>Nigeria, to Ijaw and Urhobo parents (His father was Ijaw and mother Urhobo), Johnson</p> <p>Pepper Clark-Bekederemo had his primary school at Okrika (1940-1948) and Jeremi</p> <p>(1948), before proceeding to Government College, Ughelli, for his secondary education</p> <p>(1948-1953). He attended the University of Ibadan between 1955 and 1960. At Ibadan,</p> <p>together with a handful of other writers, he played a prominent role in establishing</p> <p>Nigeria and the continent of Africa as one of the major centres of Literature in English in</p> <p>the twentieth century. Of his Ibadan years, Wren (1984) remarks that Clark-Bekederemo</p> <p>5 Yeibo: Deictics and Stylistic Function in J.P. Clark-Bekederemo’s Poetry</p> <p>“showed the most precocious talent that West African literary history had yet seen.” The</p> <p>poet has worked as an information officer, journalist, and University professor. Apart</p> <p>from his poetry, Clark-Bekederemo is also a frontline African dramatist and scholar. He</p> <p>has also written a novel (travelogue) America, their America (1964), which is an account</p> <p>of his sojourn in America as a Parvin fellow at Princeton University (1962-63).</p> <p>5. Contextual Issues in the Poetry</p> <p>That language and context are two inseparable phenomena is a fact that has been long</p> <p>standing and established (see Leech, 1983:13). Morley (1985: 4) points out that, “context</p> <p>serves to itemize those aspects of the situation which have a bearing on the form used”.</p> <p>The critical point in that, context is an important aspect of language use. As we shall</p> <p>demonstrate in the analysis of the texts, the true meaning of a text can be thought of as a</p> <p>relationship between its linguistic elements and whatever contextual evidence is available</p> <p>for clarifying it. In J.P. Clark-Bekederemo’s poetry, certain variables constitute the</p> <p>context of situation. These include: genre type, background experiences of the poet,</p> <p>socio-political realities, and subject-matter.</p> <p>6. Textual Analysis</p> <p>The analysis in this section is based on poems purposively selected from A Decade of</p> <p>Tongues (1981, contains poems written between 1958 and 1968), State of the Union</p> <p>(1985), Mandela and other poems (1988), A Lot from Paradise (1999), Of Sleep and Old</p> <p>Age (2003) and Once Again A Child (2004), in order to strike a temporal balance between</p> <p>the writer’s early, later and latest poetry.</p> <p>The critical point is that, in J.P. Clark-Bekederemo’s poetry, the use of the</p> <p>personal pronouns ‘I’ me’; the locative adverbs ‘here’, there/elsewhere’; and the temporal</p> <p>adverbs ‘now and ‘then, is a significant discourse strategy. These deixis run through the</p> <p>entire texts and help the poet to relate his propositions to specific persons, places and</p> <p>times, respectively, which is absolutely relevant for their understanding and</p> <p>interpretation. In other words, they help the poet to relive his experiences and register his</p> <p>visions within specific spatial or temporal frameworks. We shall now discus each of these</p> <p>aspects of deixis in the following sections, to show their stylistic and pragmatic</p> <p>significance in the texts under study.</p> <p>6.1 Person Deixis</p> <p>In the words of Cornish (1986:1), a pronominal involves the avoidance of redundancy or</p> <p>repetition by the use of a semantically attenuated expression in place of a full lexical</p> <p>expression initially used. In English grammar, there are three levels of pronominalization</p> <p>viz: first person pronoun (singular: I, me; plural: we, us); second person pronoun</p> <p>(singular and plural: you); and third person pronominal (singular: she, he it; plural: they,</p> <p>them). The reference of a pronominal could be inclusive (as in we and us) or exclusive</p> <p>(as in he, she, it, they, and them). Brown and Yule (1983:214) point out that pronominals</p> <p>are used to refer to already given entities but their presence in texts brings about cohesive</p> <p>relationships. One stylistic feature of the poems under study is the preponderance of</p> <p>Yeibo: Deictics and Stylistic Function in J.P. Clark-Bekederemo’s Poetry 6</p> <p>inclusive pronominal expressions in the writer’s latest poetry (i.e. 1999-date). Over 90%</p> <p>of the 29 poems in A Lot from Paradise, 44 in Once Again a Child and 58 in Of Sleep</p> <p>and Old Age contain or are dense with such pronouns as ‘I’, ‘we’, ‘me’, ‘us’ and</p> <p>adjectives such as ‘our’. This stylo-statistics clearly indicates that these collections or</p> <p>volumes are biographical materials other than volumes containing texts of creation.</p> <p>Hence Osofisan (2011:260-261) observes that Clark-Bekederemo’s “new poetry” is a rich</p> <p>assemblage of the spirits and sounds of his native kiagbodo, “… evoking now</p> <p>autobiographical details, now the family’s general genealogy, and now some significant</p> <p>but forgotten fragments of history …” We shall now draw specimens of features from the</p> <p>texts in tabular form, to illustrate these views for further clarification (all underlinings</p> <p>mine):</p> <p>Exponent of Specimen texts Source</p> <p>i. I find the photograph of an old man. “A Photograph” (Of Sleep and Old Age)</p> <p>ii. Sleep for me is now the active state… “A Time to Sleep” (Of Sleep…)</p> <p>iii. How can I string out… “Untold Story” (Of Sleep…)</p> <p>iv. My grandmother, konomo, into whose</p> <p>arms I was delivered</p> <p>“My Grandmother konomo” (Once Again a</p> <p>Child)</p> <p>v. When my mother woke us up…….. “The Mainly Rite” (Once Again a Child)</p> <p>vi. My father took the tough line. “A Night Act in the Day” (Once Again …..)</p> <p>vii. A woman of my own blood “A Night Act in the Day” (Once Again …..)</p> <p>vii. We were playing in an outer courtyard….. “A Witch’s Touch” (Once Again….)</p> <p>ix. For three days and three nights, we stood</p> <p>in turns around your bed.</p> <p>“Two Loves” (A Lot from paradise)</p> <p>x. You who gave me a lot from paradise. “Land of the Gods” (A Lot from Paradise)</p> <p>xi. You wondered who I was within my house on the</p> <p>lonely cliff across our river.</p> <p>“Icon in the Library” (A Lot from Pradise)</p> <p>As we can glean from the table above, the repetitive use of the pronouns ‘I’, ‘me’ and</p> <p>‘my’ particularly foregrounds this aspect of meaning, as it continually draws our attention</p> <p>to the autobiographical character of these poems, as the pronominal referent centres on</p> <p>the poet. The implication of this strategy is that the poems give a more or less personal</p> <p>story of J.P. Clark-Bekederemo, thus fulfilling his pledge in “A pledge” (Once Again a</p> <p>Child), to write “a poem of every matter of interest” he could “salvage” from the stream</p> <p>of his life. Based on this strategy, it can be further said that Bekederemo’s latest poetry is</p> <p>a documentation of his life. The strategy makes these poems overtly experiential and</p> <p>realistic.</p> <p>6.2 Spatial or Locative Deixis</p> <p>As we have earlier mentioned, locative adverbs such as ‘here’ and ‘there’ are</p> <p>predominant deictic forms found in J.P. Clark-Bekederemo’s poetry. Specifically, they</p> <p>help to locate the distinction, even dichotomy, between the land of the living and the land</p> <p>of the dead; between Africa/Nigeria and the Western world; or between specific towns,</p> <p>tribes and cities, in Nigeria and the outside world. These deictic words essentially help</p> <p>the poet to differentiate or contrast his propositions about these specific locations which</p> <p>7 Yeibo: Deictics and Stylistic Function in J.P. Clark-Bekederemo’s Poetry</p> <p>constitute the core of his poetry. The significant point here is that, the subject,</p> <p>phenomenon or place the author is writing about or commenting on, determines whether</p> <p>he uses ‘here’ or ‘there’. In other words, the closer or nearer the subject, phenomenon or</p> <p>place, to the author, he uses ‘here’ (i.e. proximal), while the farther the subject,</p> <p>phenomenon or place from the author, he uses ‘there’ (i.e. distal). Proximity, in this</p> <p>sense, could be determined either by the poet’s physical position or mental or imaginative</p> <p>position. The latter implies that the poet could imagine himself to be in a specific place</p> <p>and write from that perspective. As we have mentioned earlier, it is this inherent</p> <p>variability in usage, or meaning, in response to situational or contextual constraints, that</p> <p>etches the importance of deixis in stylistic and pragmatic analysis.</p> <p>In “The Company of the Dead” (A Lot from Paradise), for instance, the deictic</p> <p>locative adverb “here” refers to the land of the living, while “there” refers to the home of</p> <p>the dead i.e. the world beyond. In this poem, J.P. Clark-Bekederemo wonders aloud about</p> <p>the great number of his friends and relatives that have died, suggesting that, if there is,</p> <p>indeed, life after death, there would be more of his friends and relatives in the world</p> <p>beyond than he has alive. For clarity and easy reference, the entire nine-line poem is</p> <p>presented below:</p> <p>I think of all those who are gone,</p> <p>Between relatives and friends</p> <p>Across the world, at a dead loss</p> <p>To their own, and none ever</p> <p>Known to have come back for all</p> <p>That held them here, and I smile</p> <p>Somewhat to myself it couldn’t</p> <p>Be greater company than there</p> <p>If indeed there is such a state. (Emphasis mine) (p. 229).</p> <p>The critical stylistic point here is that, the locative adverbs “here” and “there”, enable the</p> <p>poet to locate and contrast his thoughts and conjectures concerning life and death. This</p> <p>pattern of signification is also found in “The Court Beyond” (A Lot from Paradise),</p> <p>where the poet wonders how his father was faring in the world beyond, after holding</p> <p>court and being the supreme overlord of his compound on earth:</p> <p>Where are you holding court now, old man?</p> <p>The chair you adorned here in a square, sprang</p> <p>Fourteen generations out of the soil</p> <p>As the tree of your birth…</p> <p>Now that you have entered there with the one</p> <p>You called prime Minister of your court … (p. 226)</p> <p>(Emphasis mine)</p> <p>Yeibo: Deictics and Stylistic Function in J.P. Clark-Bekederemo’s Poetry 8</p> <p>For a similar use of the locative adverbs ‘here’ and ‘there’ (i.e. to contrast the physical</p> <p>world and the world beyond, see also “Debris of Day” (of Sleep and Old Age), “Rain in a</p> <p>Basket” (Of Sleep and Age) “A Time to Sleep” (Of Sleep and Old Age), A Hymn for a</p> <p>Friend in His Losses” (State of the Union), “Herons at Funama” (State of the Union), “A</p> <p>Song for Harlem” (A Lot From Paradise).</p> <p>Another strategic stylistic use of the deixis ‘here’ and ‘there’ in the texts, has to do</p> <p>with a contrast between Nigeria and the rest of the world, particularly the western world.</p> <p>In other words, J.P. Clark-Bekederemo uses these locative adverbs to express his views,</p> <p>thoughts and propositions about contrastive socio cultural events and experiences in these</p> <p>places. In “Here Nothing Works” (State of the Union), for instance, Clark-Bekederemo</p> <p>highlights the substandard infrastructure and services provided in Nigeria, in contrast to</p> <p>the perfect functionality of these same infrastructure and services “elsewhere”, apparently</p> <p>the western world or advanced countries. Specifically, the poet laments the worrisome</p> <p>contrast in the standard and quality of water supply, telephone services, the motorway,</p> <p>airways, etc, and wonders whether there is something inherent in our nature or times that</p> <p>prevents these things from functioning in our soil.</p> <p>In “The Patriarchs at the Return to Civilian Rule” (State of the Union), the deictic</p> <p>word “here” also refers to Nigeria, in contrast to “other lands”. In this poem, Clark-</p> <p>Bekederemo laments the return of first republic politicians such as Zik, Awo, Waziri,</p> <p>Aminu Kano, etc. to the political trenches during the second republic, instead of giving</p> <p>way to a new breed of politicians to pilot the political destiny of the nation, like what</p> <p>obtained elsewhere. In this situation, we find that the contrast highlighted by the locative</p> <p>adverbials “here” and “there”, enables the poet to expose the general infrastructural</p> <p>inadequacy and moral decadence of Nigerians which have remained perennial clogs in</p> <p>the wheel of progress of this nation. In fact, Clark-Bekederemo insists that this is the</p> <p>reality of our being. The poet’s attitude to all of this is overtly that of worry and</p> <p>frustration. For a similar use of the deictic words “here” and “there”, see also</p> <p>“Handshake” (State of the Union), “A Time to Sleep” (Of Sleep and Old Age),”Debris of</p> <p>Days” (Of Sleep and Old Age), “Rain in a basket” (Of Sleep and Old Age), etc.</p> <p>In Bombay” (Casualties), Clark-Bekederemo uses the deictic locative adverb“</p> <p>here” for this Indian city: “Here nothing seems new: the rising /Estate is cancelled out by</p> <p>septic slums…” (emphasis mine). This confirms our earlier view that, the poet uses</p> <p>“here” for subjects, places or phenomena that are closer to him, depending on the context.</p> <p>The use of the deixis “here” in this context, tells us that the poet visited the city and wrote</p> <p>the poem on the spot. It is a product of the poet’s physical experience and assessment of</p> <p>the highs and lows of this Indian city. Obviously, “Here nothing seems new” is a</p> <p>comparison with what obtains in Lagos in the poet’s native country where the glow of</p> <p>Victoria Island or Ikoyi is “cancelled out” by the “Septic slums” of Ajegunle and</p> <p>erstwhile Maroko.</p> <p>The poem “Last Rights in Ijebu” (State of the Union) also confirms our earlier</p> <p>view that the proximal “here” is used by the poet to relate actual experiences in specific</p> <p>places he has visited. This poem refers to the customary burial rites (or rights?) accorded</p> <p>the old in Ijebu, where sons-in-law play prominent roles. Clark-Bekederemo confesses</p> <p>9 Yeibo: Deictics and Stylistic Function in J.P. Clark-Bekederemo’s Poetry</p> <p>that: “I had no idea, until I did the rite…” (p.157). Of course, the poet’s wife Ebunola, is</p> <p>from Ijebu in South Western Nigeria. See also “A Song of New England”, for a similar</p> <p>use of the proximal locative adverb “here”.</p> <p>In “Land of the Gods” (A Lot from Paradise), Clark-Bekederemo uses the distal</p> <p>“there” to refer to his native Kiagbodo Community. Two possible explanations are</p> <p>applicable here: The first is that the poet could have written the poem from a distant</p> <p>physical or geographical location from home i.e. Lagos. Secondly, he could have decided</p> <p>to imaginatively or mentally distance himself from the setting of the poem. This</p> <p>suggestion becomes plausible when we find that in “The Order of the Dead” (Mandela</p> <p>and other Poems), the poet refers to the same kiagbodo, his ancestral home, as “here”</p> <p>“… in a land/where the dead without blemish/Are buried in their homestead…”, in</p> <p>contrast with “the dead in other lands” (p.204, emphasis mine).</p> <p>6.3 Temporal Deixis</p> <p>In J.P. Clark-Bekederemo’s poetry, the temporal adverbs “now” and “then” help the poet</p> <p>to situate the event and issues highlighted in the poems within specific time frames or</p> <p>periods. This is very strategic to the cumulative meaning of his texts because, whether a</p> <p>poet documents events, reflects on or recalls his experience, or comments on sociocultural</p> <p>or political phenomena, poetry derives more relevance, concreteness and social</p> <p>appeal if specific time boundaries are clearly delineated. Specifically, in J.P. Clark-</p> <p>Bekederemo’s poetry, the temporal deixis “now” and “then”, are used to highlight</p> <p>present/past, old age/youth and life/death, respectively. A careful study of these</p> <p>contrasting temporal phenomena shows that the essential or core issues that the poet</p> <p>explores in his poetry, revolve around them.</p> <p>In “The Traffic Now and Then” (Of Sleep and Old Age), for instance, the poet’s</p> <p>use of the temporal deictic words “now” and “then” is very strategic. As the title of the</p> <p>poem depicts, the poet is able to capture and contrast the past pastimes of youths in the</p> <p>Niger Delta (i.e. then), to what obtains now. Using the river as the centre of activity and</p> <p>oil as the economic commodity around which the activities revolve, the poet tells us that,</p> <p>in the past (i.e. then) “when oil in the land was of another kind” (i.e. palm oil), on</p> <p>sighting a big stern-wheeler boat in the river, youths</p> <p>“…With no sense of wrong</p> <p>…Rushed to the beaches</p> <p>And swam out to the ships,</p> <p>…Offering a hand</p> <p>It was lively fair and traffic. (p. 31)</p> <p>In contrast, the poet writes that, in the present times (i.e. now),</p> <p>Youths, now with guns, go for tankers</p> <p>Today taking away before our eyes,</p> <p>The new oil of a sinking delta. (Emphasis mine) (p. 31).</p> <p>Yeibo: Deictics and Stylistic Function in J.P. Clark-Bekederemo’s Poetry 10</p> <p>No doubt, the temporal deixis “now” and “then” here, help the poet in contrasting the</p> <p>peaceful disposition of youths in the past, to the violent and daring disposition that youths</p> <p>in the Niger Delta exhibit today.</p> <p>In “I Wake to the Touch” (A Decade of Tongues), the poet uses the deictic word</p> <p>“now” to contrast what happened the previous night in a dream, and what happened the</p> <p>next morning. Specifically, he recalls his sight of “a snake/slithering in the field,</p> <p>livid/where the grass is parched…” in a dream “last night”, and the fear and anxiety that</p> <p>this experience evoked in the morning. By using the temporal deictic “now”, the poet is</p> <p>able not only to demarcate the two events but also show the emotional and psychological</p> <p>chain that links both.</p> <p>Also in “Aburi and After” (Casualties), the poet uses the deixis “now” and “then”</p> <p>to situate his doubts about General Gowon’s firmness and capacity to withstand pressure</p> <p>or contain crisis, before the Aburi accord was struck in Ghana in 1967:</p> <p>I thought for a long time</p> <p>They were winging jack Gowon’s hand</p> <p>Wringing his hand for use of a rule</p> <p>Too broken then in the sand</p> <p>To flog a fly. (Emphasis mine)</p> <p>But his doubts vanished after Aburi, with the implacable posture of the government:</p> <p>“And a keeper now at attention” (Emphasis mine). See also “Niger Delta Burning” (Of</p> <p>Sleep and Old Age), “A Dying Breed” (Of Sleep and Old Age), “Return of the Heroes”</p> <p>(State of the Union), for a similar use of the temporal deixis “now” and “then”.</p> <p>“One Country” (State of the Union) is another poem where temporal deixis is used</p> <p>by the poet to effectively situate his comments. In this poem, J.P. Clark-Bekederemo</p> <p>highlights the contradictions within the Nigerian nation where proceeds of oil wealth</p> <p>from the Niger Delta, are used to transform “waste regions” into “garden cities”</p> <p>upcountry while the Niger Delta, the source of the wealth, remains barren and</p> <p>undeveloped. The poet contrasts what happens then in the historical past when Niger</p> <p>Deltans “kept the stranger at bay”, to “now” when the people are only anxious over their</p> <p>economic and political rights which majority tribes unjustly seized, in the name of one</p> <p>country.</p> <p>In “The Plague” (State of the Union), the poet laments the upsurge of armed</p> <p>robbery in the country, ten years after the civil war. The use of the deictic word “now”</p> <p>relates the present times to the civil war and suggests that it is as perilous and</p> <p>unpredictable as the Nigeria civil war era. See also “Concerning My Command by</p> <p>General Olusegun Obasanjo and other Accounts of the Nigerian Civil War” (State of the</p> <p>Union), “Birthday at Wesleyan, Middletown, cf.” (State of the Union), “The Coming of</p> <p>Age” (State of the Union), etc., for a similar use of these deixis.</p> <p>In Clark-Bekederemo’s poetry, the temporal deictic words “now” and “then” are</p> <p>also used to contrast life and death. These are very serious and fundamental timesensitive</p> <p>human phenomena and J.P. Clark-Bekederemo uses these deixis to effectively</p> <p>11 Yeibo: Deictics and Stylistic Function in J.P. Clark-Bekederemo’s Poetry</p> <p>delineate the different periods and raise vital socio-cultural and moral questions. For</p> <p>instance, in “Family Meeting for the Disposal of the Wreck” (State of the Union), the</p> <p>poet questions the rationale for holding extended family meetings and levying each</p> <p>member of the family, to bury the dead, when the deceased was not taken care of when</p> <p>he was critically ill. This poem highlights the petulant neglect of the living and the</p> <p>bloated sense of obligation for the dead that characterize the social life of Africans. The</p> <p>repetition of the temporal deictic word “now” in both stanzas (i.e. the poem is made of</p> <p>two stanzas) of the poem, is, itself, a significant discourse strategy which foregrounds the</p> <p>needless and misplaced care for the dead which is the subject matter of discourse. See</p> <p>also “My Father’s House” (Of Sleep and Old Age), “The Last of the Wives” (of Sleep and</p> <p>Old Age), “Homecoming” (Mandela and Other Poems), etc, for a similar use of the</p> <p>deixis “now” and “then”.</p> <p>In the two-stanza poem “Dressing the Dead” (Mandela and Other Poems), this</p> <p>same discourse strategy is adopted by the poet. The temporal deictic word “now” is</p> <p>repeated three (3) times, to foreground the preoccupation of the text (i.e. death) and</p> <p>contrast it with life. For clarity and easy reference, we present the entire first stanza and</p> <p>the relevant lines of the second stanza of the poem inter alia:</p> <p>All indigo now as the dye in his veins,</p> <p>He looked no different from the friend</p> <p>His wife had often had to help</p> <p>Out of his clothes, when flush with the gift</p> <p>Of an additional day, he came home</p> <p>At dawn, barely made it to bed,</p> <p>And promptly asked for coffee. Only now,</p> <p>He had to be helped into his best,</p> <p>After receiving a good cold bath…</p> <p>And now they were interlaced in white</p> <p>Across his chest perfectly at rest,</p> <p>Hands that, at a simple touch, could tell</p> <p>A mother why her child cried all night (p. 185,</p> <p>Emphasis mine).</p> <p>We find a similar mode of signification in the one-stanza poem “A Passing at New Year”</p> <p>(Mandela and other Poems). In fact, the one-stanza structure of the poem reflects its</p> <p>mono-thematic nature (i.e. the theme of life and death). The critical point is that, in this</p> <p>poem, there is a clear demarcation between life and death with the deixis “now” and</p> <p>“then”. The unfeeling and helpless state of death is conveyed in the line:</p> <p>Now the white sheet he objected to</p> <p>When he came out of a day-long coma</p> <p>Was spread fully over his face (p. 193, emphasis mine).</p> <p>Yeibo: Deictics and Stylistic Function in J.P. Clark-Bekederemo’s Poetry 12</p> <p>This state clearly contrasts with the fact that, when the subject of the poem was alive, or</p> <p>came to be after the “day-long” coma, he could react with anger and disgust:</p> <p>Then he would get up,</p> <p>He swore, and go home, regardless of cost</p> <p>Before they got him. (p. 193; Emphasis mine)</p> <p>See also “A Royal Welcome” (Mandela and Other poems), “The Court Beyond” (A Lot</p> <p>from Paradise), etc.</p> <p>In J.P. Clark-Bekederemo’s poetry, the deictic temporal adverb “now” also</p> <p>indicates the distinction between youth and its attendant energy and activity, and old age</p> <p>with its associated inertia and general sense of foreboding and anxiety that death is just</p> <p>around the corner. For instance, in “The Last Wish” (Mandela and Other Poems), the</p> <p>poet uses “now” to indicate the period of old age, in contrast with the period of youth or</p> <p>adolescence. It is actually a prayer for a peaceful death, and purveys the anxiety over the</p> <p>shape or colour of the end, associated with old age. Here is the entire four-line poem:</p> <p>Now that where I am going</p> <p>Is nearer than where I began,</p> <p>May I be like the emerging child,</p> <p>If the arrival is into light (p. 203).</p> <p>It is no coincidence that the deployment of the deictic temporal adverbs “now” and</p> <p>“then” to perform the discourse function of delineating the contrast between youth and</p> <p>old age, is predominant in J.P. Clark-Bekederemo’s of Sleep and Old Age. This is clearly</p> <p>as a result of the preoccupation of the text i.e. a reflective and contrastive journey through</p> <p>his youth and old age. “Of Things Past” (Of Sleep and Old Age) clearly captures this</p> <p>preoccupation:</p> <p>Old age truly is the time</p> <p>To look back at events in the past,</p> <p>Not to retrieve anything for some archive,</p> <p>But I find, out of fear, the old try all</p> <p>They can to fill the void</p> <p>They see clearly in front. (p. 33).</p> <p>For instance, in “A Woman Special to Me” (Of Sleep and Old Age), the poet ruminates</p> <p>over how a step mother who was a bride then, had saved him from a merciless beating</p> <p>from his father who wrongly thought that he had absconded from school. The crucial</p> <p>point here is that, the poet contrasts the reticent disposition of the woman in her old age,</p> <p>as against her active and vocal disposition in her youth (i.e. when she was a bride), “Now</p> <p>13 Yeibo: Deictics and Stylistic Function in J.P. Clark-Bekederemo’s Poetry</p> <p>I too am old” (P.5). The implication here is that, age enables him to see this contrast</p> <p>clearly.</p> <p>In “A Time to Sleep” (Of Sleep and Old Age), Clark-Bekederemo observes that, at</p> <p>old age, sleep “… is now the active state,/As I have nothing more here I care to do” (p.</p> <p>8). Here the poet confesses that, when he is asleep as an old man, images and scenes</p> <p>crowd his mind “… sharper than all/I see in day time, if I stay awake” (p.8). In “A Gift of</p> <p>Age” (Of Sleep and Old Age), the poet also highlights the same attribute of old age:</p> <p>Now that I sit back</p> <p>In the shadow of myself</p> <p>I can see dizzy before me</p> <p>The black hole down which my days</p> <p>Disappeared… (emphasizes mine)</p> <p>For the relationship between old age, sleep and death, see also the title poem “Of Sleep</p> <p>and Old Age” (p. 26).</p> <p>In “Rain in a Basket”, (Of Sleep and Old Age), Clark-Bekederemo makes the point</p> <p>that, age endows on man a deeper understanding and mastery over life itself, and his</p> <p>environment. This is a universally accepted truism because, through experiences over the</p> <p>years, man by his very nature, becomes more philosophical and contemplative. This</p> <p>attribute of old age is conveyed by the poet, with the deictic temporal adverb “now”:</p> <p>… now I am awake</p> <p>To the fact that this thing we call</p> <p>Life belongs to none of us here (p. 17; emphasis mine)</p> <p>Hence, the poet remarks that, at old age, it has dawned on him that life is highly</p> <p>unpredictable. According to the poet, now, he has known that no one can predetermine</p> <p>how he would live or end, as life itself is by chance and God’s grace.</p> <p>In “Time and Tide” (Of Sleep and Old Age), Clark-Bekederemo also highlights the</p> <p>contrast between youth and old age, in terms of energy and vitality and general weakness</p> <p>and strains associated with the two age groups/brackets, respectively, by deploying the</p> <p>deictic temporal adverbs “now” and “then”. On his youthful age, the poet writes:</p> <p>Then I could drive from one border</p> <p>Through several custom-posts,</p> <p>And at the end of the day, still take a tour of night clubs</p> <p>To Resume the beat at break</p> <p>Of day (p. 20 emphasis mine)</p> <p>This was certainly Clark-Bekederemo’s “season of surge” In contrast, with the coming of</p> <p>old age or his “season of dust”, for instance, the poet admits:</p> <p>Yeibo: Deictics and Stylistic Function in J.P. Clark-Bekederemo’s Poetry 14</p> <p>Now, Just to be driven</p> <p>On poufs across town creates</p> <p>For me such a stress, it brings on</p> <p>A cold, that puts me back some</p> <p>Weeks in bed, if not for months. (p. 20 emphasis mine)</p> <p>Note also the repetition of the deixis “now” in the second stanza, which performs the</p> <p>discourse or textual function of emphasizing or etching the contrast between old age and</p> <p>youth.</p> <p>Also, in “To be or Not To be” (OF Sleep and Old Age), Clark-Bekederemo</p> <p>confesses that, “This life I lead I now find a load” (p.32). This assertion is obviously</p> <p>related to the strains and stresses associated with old age. However, the poet is still</p> <p>anxious and actually fears the end. This reality also enables us to pry into the</p> <p>psychological make-up of the old. Specifically, we now know that the fear of death is</p> <p>inherent in humans and cuts across all ages- whether young or old. No one actually</p> <p>contemplates “letting go”, however stark the odds.</p> <p>7. Conclusion</p> <p>In the foregoing discourse, we have shown the stylistic value of deictics in the poetry of</p> <p>J.P. Clark-Bekederemo. Specifically, we have shown that deictic words run through the</p> <p>entire texts and that the poet deploys these lexico-grammatical patterns of language use to</p> <p>relate his propositions to specific persons, time and place which not only makes the texts</p> <p>experiential and realistic, but also enhances their understanding and interpretation.</p> <p>15 Yeibo: Deictics and Stylistic Function in J.P.

This is with a view to identify some long observed peculiarities in the use of redundancy in the students' use of English.</p> <p>In the context of language studies, semantics occupies the end continuum. Semantics is at the top level because it deals with communication and interpretation. The major problem is with the definition of the subject simply as the study of meaning. Meaning is the target/goal in language. In whatever we do, we try to get meaning. The challenge is trying to find the meaning of meaning itself</p> <p>Ogden and Richard (1923) said the major problem in semantics is trying to control \"what is meaning\".</p> <p>This project work is concerned with the repetitions made by students while speaking.</p> <p>However, any issue raised here would be considerably discussed and illustrated with adequate examples. Thus the findings of this work will on the other hand add to the existing literature(s) on semantic redundancy as a localized contribution to knowledge.</p> <p><strong>1.1 AIM AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The aim of this project is to identify and analyze the features of redundancy in the speech of students of the Department of Mathematics of the Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto.</p> <p>The specific objectives of this project are to:</p> <p>i.            Determine the linguistic motivation for redundancy.</p> <p>ii.            Establish a clear demarcation between samples of data taken and their Standard English version.</p> <p><strong>1.2 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The importance of clarity and correctness in communication cannot be over emphasized. Therefore, this work on semantic redundancy is desirable because it provides some insights into the prevalence of redundancy in the verbal interaction of the students selected as the subject of the project.

Black, consciousness has to do with the revolutionary consciousness which occupies most Afro-American writing. This concept places emphasis on the Afro-American search for self-esteem in a hostile social environment and the search for a language to affirm a \"black selfhood\" as well as express the richness of an oral culture. These elements are examined in Richard Wright's Native Son and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. These works marked a high point in the Black-American literary tradition. Both novels are protests against the hatred, injustices and racism in the America society.</p> <p>The racial prejudices and the American racial dilemma inform the choice of themes by these authors. Wright's novel represents what has been described as protest to black fiction. Wright is a central figure in Afro-American literature.  Ellison's novel is indebted to Native Son for certain themes i.e. the social invisibility of black Americans and the blindness of the whites to their individuality.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    The Afro-American tradition</strong></p> <p>Racial freedom in the face of white oppression and injustice is a social necessity of black life. The Afro-American novelist as a spokesman for his people places his art at the disposal of the course of freedom. These writers possess a sense of commitment to racial justice and racial freedom. The Afro-American literature of the last couple of decades witnessed remarkable transformations. The artistic ambition of the black writers in America. Thus, history provides and impetus for current black writing. The efforts to define the Afro-American experience have influenced the choice of theme and the literary traditions of Afro-American literature. It then follows that the basic themes and literature traditions of Afro-American writing is associated with black experience.</p> <p>The dominant themes of Afro-American literature have been identified as the search for freedom. The theme has been explored by several Afro-American authors who often believe they have a commitment towards the liberation of the generality of the Afro-American people. This issue is explored in such novels as Ellison's Invisible Man whose protagonist embarked on a journey to achieve self-knowledge in order to gain his freedom. This trend is repeated in other Afro-American novels like Jean Toomer's Cane, Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God, Richard Wright's Native Son, James Baldwin's Go Tell It On The Mountain and Toni Morrison's Sula. The protagonists of all these novels have one thing in common; they are all involved in the struggle to achieve freedom.</p> <p>The literary traditions of the twentieth century Afro-American literature are committed to the task of delving into the complexity of the Afro-American experience. The diverse kinds of black experience referred to here are characterized by racial prejudice and oppression as well as their political struggle for freedom. The importance of black literature in America may be considered from the point of view of the fact that most literary works by Afro-Americans address such issues as the question of personal identity and the meaning of freedom as well as the humanity of the blacks. The benefit of addressing issues of this nature as that it assists in the process of a deeper understanding and self­-discovery for the blacks and the nation at large.</p> <p>The much talked about Afro-American literary tradition is a complex term. There is no gainsaying that certain themes and tropes recur in Afro-American fiction. The Afro-American writers like other writers have literary antecedents. Over the years, Afro-American fiction has changed the artistic achievements if the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s remains a crucial factor in Afro-American literature.</p> <p>More so, when it has been argued that the 1980s is the continuation of the Harlem Renaissance and that his Renaissance of the 1920s and the slave narratives of the nineteenth century are at the heart of the 1980s renaissance in black letters. The Afro-American literary tradition may be identified in terms of the peculiarities of literary styles, themes, myth, folk culture as well as the structures. A definition the Afro-American tradition is a complex issue. Louis Gates Jr. suggests that \"The basis of a tradition must be a shared pattern of language use'\". The Afro-American literary tradition may be considered in terms of the existence of rhetorical tropes in black literature. The concept of an Afro-American tradition offers a framework for viewing the works of contemporary Afro-American writers in relation to the intertextuality of various texts. There is no gainsaying that several texts that belong the Afro-American canon are related to other black texts. Hence, we find such texts as Ralph Ellison'sInvisible Man, Richard Wright's Native Son, Jean Toomer's Cane, Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God, and a host of others, related to one another in terms of substance and contents. This relationship may be identified in terms of race, the author's choice of theme as well as the existence of black consciousness and identify as suggested by these authors' use of what has been described as the language of blackness as represented in the rhetorical strategies used by these authors in rendering the much talked about black experience.</p> <p>The language 'used by the Afro-American writer has been described as that which is created, refined and tested by centuries of racial oppression and racial assertion. The language used reflects the reality of the Afro-American history. This language may equally be regarded as a testimony to the Afro-American experience of slavery and racial oppression the rhetorical skill of the American blacks offers stylistic resources to 'the black writers. The Afro-American writer is given to the use of slave narratives, black oral tradition and folklore as a representation of their blackness and experience. The Afro-American narratives strategies invariably become the tool with which the black writers achieve a black consciousness.</p> <p><strong>1.2    Black consciousness and the Afro-American writer</strong></p> <p>Black consciousness in Afro-American literature has formed the basis of what may be regarded as a theory of Afro-American literature. Consciousness of blackness has become a sort of revolutionary consciousness which has occupied most Afro­- American writing. Charles T. Davis (1981) is of the opinion that:</p> <p>Awareness of being black is the most powerful and most fertile single inspiration for most black writers in America. It is ironic that blackness so long regarded as a handicap - socially and culturally, should be an artistic strength 2.</p> <p>Blackness has been identified as the recurring and controlling trope of all Afro-American literary tradition. Blackness has become some kind of creative element in Afro-American literature. This is evident in the choice of theme and language. The importance of the recognition of blackness in Afro-American literature has to a large extent influenced the artistic endeavor of most black writers. It has been pointed out that:</p> <p>Consciousness of blackness has brought an especial intensity to the statement of the Afro-Americans as in Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man; a distinction and beauty of language evident in the poems of Langston Hughes; an unusual ways of rendering scenes as observed in the work of Jean roomer3.</p> <p>What is suggested here points to the fact that, the definition of freedom and the search for an identity in Ellison's invisible man, Langston Hughes' use of language and racy colloquial in his poems as well as Jean Toomer's style of writing result (rom these authors' awareness of their blackness. Perhaps one may equally suggest that since blackness is woven into the texture of the black writer's art, the aesthetics of the Afro-American art is expected to reflect these authors' acceptance of their blackness, black pride and black solidarity.  All of these are related to the objectives of the Black Power Movement of the 1960s which has affinity with Black Consciousness Movement. Most black writers of this period wrote for black people, what they often chose as their subject matter revolves around their blackness. Thus, their blackness is regarded as an absolute theme and necessity.</p> <p>Folklore, jazz and blue songs served as major source of inspiration for most black authors . The identification of blackness as a priority therefore distinguishes black writers in America. This is reiterated in the words of Charles T. Davis:</p> <p>For nearly all black writers in America, that sense of difference was the recognition of blackness. But for most, blackness was the spur, the barb or the spirit or pain that moved artist to achieve distinction.4</p> <p>It is important to acknowledge the role and the achievements of the proponents of the, Black Consciousness Movement. W.E.B. Du Bis was the leader of the twentieth century political and aesthetic thought. He devoted himself to the task of uplifting the black race through literature. He believed that the black writer has a duty not only to uplift his race but also to elevate the rest of the world's opinion about the generality of the black man. He abhorred and discredited negative portrayal of blacks in white American literature. As the editor-in-chief ofThe Crisis: a journal Of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP). He wrote various articles through which he projected his idea on such issues as the concept of racial pride which became a forceful concept in discussions and works by black writers.</p> <p>The Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s is crucial to this discourse on contemporary Afro-American writing in order to show how the past prefigured the present. The 1920s was a period when Afro-American art and culture flourished. The Afro-American literature was viewed by many intellectuals as a means for a direct confrontation of white American racist practices and its effects on Afro.</p> <p>The period witnessed the production of numerous texts of art by Afro-American writers who had moved to the Harlem City enmasse in an attempt to escape from the lynching and segregation which was prevalent in the South. The result of this settlement was the creation of what has been described as \"a progressive international black consciousness and culture\"5 In essence, there was Afro-American creation of a collective consciousness of black identity. The writers of the Harlem Renaissance wrote to define the culture and exhibit a sense of pride in their racial heritage.</p> <p>Charles S. Johnson was equally instrumental to the course of the Harlem Renaissance.  His achievement is summarized in the words of Langston Hughes as someone who \"did more to encourage and develop Negro writers during the 1920s than anyone else in America.6</p> <p>Alain Locke was one of the 'godfathers\" of the New Negro Renaissance. He was the one who coined the phrase \"New Negro\". He is submission on the question of race pride is summarized in his essay The New Negro (1925) as follows:</p> <p>The day of aunties, uncles and mammies is equally gone. Uncle Tom and</p> <p>Sambo have passed on .... .in the very process of being transformed.7</p> <p>In this essay, Locke registers his misgiving with the unjust and negative stereotypes of blacks in American literature. He equally announced the beginning of a new development in Afro-American literature, i.e. literature which is concerned with blacks who are proud of their race. He actually suggests that black writers like Langston Hughes, Claude Mckay and other young writers of the Harlem Renaissance should use black folklore as the source of their inspiration. The publication of Jean Toomer's Cane (1923) is also an important development in Afro-American literature. This book was regarded as \"the first full length book by a black writer to come out of the period\".8 Jean Toomer is regarded as one of the authors who have helped in shaping the fiction of the 1980s.</p> <p><strong>1.3     Contemporary Afro-American writers</strong></p> <p>The most important thing to the Afro-American writer of this century, both the old and the younger generations is the idea of using their artistic talent to make things better for, themselves and the generality of the blacks. The writers of the contemporary Afro-American literature like their predecessors of the Harlem Renaissance are devoted to the task of examining the social and political forces that have shaped: the America culture. The centuriesof racial oppression and racial assertion has influenced the Afro-American literary tradition. The whole range of racial experience is entrenched in the oral traditions of the Afro-American and since most black writers derive their sources from the Afro-American culture and oral tradition, oral traditional and culture continues to reflect and shape the Afro-American literary traditions.</p> <p>Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison have won critical recognition and acclaim as major America authors. Their works are regarded as outstanding part of a literary tradition created by Afro-American intellectuals. Their works are regarded as significant apart of a distinct form of literary expression i.e. Afro-American fiction.</p> <p>Wright's ascension to a major rank among American writers of this century is a significant issue in Afro-American literary history. His literary achievements have been described as that which represented a triumph of the human personality. Native Son (1940) is regarded as one of the most important novels in contemporary American literature. The literary achievements of both Wright and Ellison have been described in term of top level performance. Wright is credited for the establishment of a new naturalist school of black literature. His establishment of a protest tradition protest tradition which influenced a host of other black writers like Chester Himes and James Baldwin drew a lot of attention from critics like Robert Bone who acknowledged the existence of Wright School of thought. Protest stands out as a distinctive character of Richard Wright's art. He is regarded as the first black novelist to depict the plight of urban masses and the first black novelist to address the subject of racial oppression from the point of view of the naturalistic tradition; a tradition which was hitherto untapped by black American novelists. Native Son is regarded as Wright's pioneer effort in this regard. His works are said to have \"exerted an immense gravitational pull on subsequent Negro fiction\".9Wright's disciples like him were preoccupied with protest. Chester Himes is one of his notable- disciples. His novels If He Hollers Let Him Go (1945) and Lonely Crusades (1947) were written in Wright's protest tradition.</p> <p>Ellison stands out as a writer of the first magnitude in Afro-American literature. He has been described as \"one of those original talents who has created a personal idiom to convert his personal vision\" 10 His novel only Invisible Man won the National Book Award as the best American novel of 1952. He occupies a prominent place in the Who is Who of Contemporary Black American Literature.</p> <p>He repudiates Wright's naturalism and turns to the broad tradition established by Joyce, Kafka and Faulkner.</p> <p>His literary achievement is closely linked with his imaginative use of black folk culture and folklore materials. This has influenced other major Afro-American writers of recent times like Ishmael Reed whose popular novel Mumbo Jumbo is describes as being related to Ellison's Invisible Man in terms of specific use of language and his imaginative use of black American oral tradition and folklore.</p> <p>The importance of Wright an Ellison lies in the fact that with the publication of such novels as Native Son and Invisible Man, they have set a high standard in contemporary black fiction.</p>                                                          \n\nA STUDY OF BLACK CONSCIOUSNESS AND RACISM IN RICHARD WRIGHTS NATIVE SON AND RALPH ELLISON’S INVISIBLE MAN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A STUDY OF BLACK CONSCIOUSNESS AND RACISM IN RICHARD WRIGHTS NATIVE SON AND RALPH ELLISON’S INVISIBLE MAN", "id": 22}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This work is titled \"study of some syntactic problems of English usage among university undergraduates in Lagos State University (LASU)\" was set up to investigate the drift from Standard English among University undergraduates using Lagos State University (LASU) Ojo, Lagos State, as a case study.</p> <p>One of the syntactic problems is the problem of linguistic interference which is the inability to separate the two systems that brings about linguistic interference. Linguistic interference is an inevitable feature in every bilingual or multilingual society. There is also the problem of inadequate knowledge of the rules of English grammar which is found among university undergraduates. Another problem is the pre-university academic background and the influence of Pidgin English as a means of communication in the society because of the non-speakers of vernacular which is also a problem among the university undergraduates especially in Lagos State University (LASU).</p> <p>This research work was conducted among the Lagos State University Students from the faculty of arts, department of English, Literature, and African Languages.</p> <p>The data analysis from the questionnaire was given to about forty students from the Lagos State University (LASU). The respondents consist mainly of the final year students who are believed to have thoroughly delved into the syntactic features of either both languages in contact.</p> <p>It is therefore concluded that there should be means of re-educating the university undergraduates on the world linguistic situation, and to also adopt positive attitude in learning and practicing the English Language.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>In communities where the English Language is used as a second language (E.S.L), there is bound to evolve a variety which is peculiar in lexicon, phonology, semantics and even syntax to that community. Studies in error and contrastive analysis have shown these varieties to be sometimes innovative and at other times, deviant. This innovation has led to the phenomenon called Nigerian English or the Educated Nigerian English (E.N.E). There has been a persistent departure from even the Educated Nigerian English among university undergraduates.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The problem is used in a technical sense to refer to this linguistic phenomenon. \"English has ceased to be the property of the English people and wherever the language has taken root, it has shown a remarkable resilience in handling ideas and concepts alien to the way in which meaning is expressed in the English structural system\".  (Dadzie, 2009)</p> <p>Nigerian English simply means the English language as it is used in Nigeria. Educated Nigerian English refers to the English used by educated Nigerians, university products. It is the latter that has often been chosen as Standard Nigerian English (S.N.E). It is however doubtful whether the so - called standard Nigerian English has as much stability and sophistication as any other variety of English. Ideally, the English of university undergraduates should approximate to the standard Nigerian English. Random variations from this local standard occur among undergraduates as a result of poor linguistics background and insensitivity to the internal rules operating in the English grammar. The English used by university undergraduates is replete with this.</p> <p><strong>1.3     BACKGROUND STUDY</strong></p> <p>The variation manifests in all levels of language (syntax, phonology semantics, and the lexicon). On the lexical level, there is the borrowing of words, formation of calques and code - switching which has been attributed to mental laziness. These concepts arise in a bid to make the English language do bid to make the English language do business in our indigenous societies. Consequently, words like 'invites', 'squander mania', 'bush meat', 'head tie', 'chewing stick', etc abound in English used in Nigeria. They therefore, feature in the English of undergraduate students.</p> <p>On the semantic level, some lexical items have been invested with meanings which differ, albeit slightly, from their original connotations. They have either widened or narrow down in semantic fields. Some examples include 'customer' and 'earth'. The word customer in the native speaker context is used by the seller to refer to the buyer, but in Nigeria, the term is mutual, referring to both seller and buyer. It has thus broadened in semantic field. \"Earth\" also is supposed to mean not only on the planet in which we live but also the \"land surface of the world\" or <em>\"soil\" </em>but in Nigerian usage, the word is seldom used to cover the second meaning. This is a limitation of semantic coverage.</p> <p>Phonology is about the most affected because Nigerian speakers of English generally tend to substitute sounds in the indigenous language for the original sounds in English. This is because of the wide difference in the phonemic inventory of the languages. The English dental fricatives /θ/ and /ʠ/ do not occur in any Nigerian language.  Whenever they occur in English, many speakers tend to replace them with the sounds closest to them - /t/ for /θ/ and /d/ for /ʠ/.</p> <p>Most if not all, university undergraduates are meeting points of at least two languages, usually English and one indigenous language. No two languages are exactly the same in syntax and most of these undergraduate students find it difficult to separate two systems in speech and in writing. This will be treated in the chapter on linguistic interference. The syntax of every language is the least prone to change of all other levels. The English usage to be recognized as non­random variation will necessarily conform to the standard of English Syntax. This is to say that it must be grammatically correct. It is the non-random variety that Bernard (1981) refers to as \"local variety markers\". It is the deviation from this standard that constitutes the bulk of the problem. Different undergraduate users of English subject the same standard to diverse deviant variations.</p> <p>Perhaps, a certain degree of uniformity in the grammatical errors of these undergraduates would lend some credence to their acceptance as linguistic features of second language situations or even Educated Nigerian English. But the complete lack of it only serves to increase the chaotic linguistic situation. This is another disturbing aspect of the syntactic peculiarities of English used by university undergraduates in this country.</p> <p>Generally speaking, the English used by university undergraduates in Nigeria is a departure not only from the native speakers' standard but also from standard recognized as Educated Nigerian English. It is bedeviled with deviant forms and is continuously declining in conformity to the grammar of Standard English. The vicissitude in the standard of English used in Nigerian universities is rather rapid and indeed unfortunate.</p> <p><strong>1.4     RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>This study is a multi-purpose one. Based on the area of syntax, it aims at establishing the presence and influence of the so-called deviations from standard English. This aspect will entail an examination of a few essays written by university undergraduates.</p> <p>There are often a distinction made between random and non-random variations. The latter is an acceptable natural linguistic trait. The former, on the other hand, is responsible for those deviations from Standard English which are not creative.</p> <p>Both are features of English used by university undergraduates in Nigeria. This work will separate features of the two in a bid to introduce some uniformity in the variety of English used by university undergraduates. This is based on the observation that the problem of random variation arises from the speakers' inability to distinguish between the accepted and non-accepted variants. The seeming acceptance of random variation and its wide usage have prompted linguists to describe the Nigerian society as hostile to the English Language.</p> <p>The project also attempts to identify and further account for the drift from Standard English among Nigerian university undergraduates. Some of these problems are rooted in the syntax of the speakers Ll. A list of some sentences is provided and from this the possibility or likelihood of interference is determined. If interference is identified, then the speakers do not take cognizance of structuralisms' assertion that language is sui generis. The grammar of one is independent of and non referable to another. But in fairness to reality, however, two different languages may be, when they exist in the same society, they tend to converge and interfere with each other. This is a necessary feature of bilingualism.</p> <p>It should be noted that this is not a contrastive analysis of the English syntax and that of any other indigenous language. It does not intend to examine all syntactic similarities or differences between the languages but the aspects which interfere prominently in the speakers' use of the second language, which is English Language. Not all differences between the English and Yoruba syntax, for instance will be given attention. In the Noun phrase (NP) of a Yoruba sentence unlike that of English, the noun-head often precedes the adjective (except in 'Ika' as in \"ika eniyan\" or \"ika <em>eda\"</em>etc). This does not mean that Yoruba speakers of English often transfer this indigenous feature to realize nouns before adjectives in English (man - wicked or boy wicked). Attention will therefore be given only to some of those of those aspects of the Ll syntax which affect the L2 usage among university undergraduates.</p> <p>Some other sources are identified which account for certain syntactic features' that are peculiar to university undergraduates. These include the inadequate grasp of the grammatical rules operating in English. Language is rule-governed and for any user of a language to be described as linguistically competent, he has to internalize the rules that govern the language. Nigeria is not an E.N.L. (English as a Native language) community and being non -native users of the language, these students do not have the rules innate in them. They therefore have to learn what is inborn in the native speaker. The research also tries to examine to what extent this has affected the syntax of Nigerian undergraduates' English.</p> <p>Closely related to this is the characteristic illogicality involved in the grammatical rules of English. The plural formation in English nouns, for instance, takes about six different forms</p> <p><em>-         ‘s’ </em>as in house – s  </p> <p><em>-         </em>'es' as in hero – es  </p> <p><em>-</em>         'a' as in strat – a  </p> <p><em>-         ‘ae' </em>as in ameb – ae  </p> <p><em>-         </em>‘l’ as in radi – i</p> <p>There is scarcely any rule that stipulates which root should take which is ZI morpheme. Also in the simple preterit formation (D1), no rule accounts for why the past tense of bake should be baked while that of wake is woke.</p> <p>Bake + D1 = Baked</p> <p>Wake + D1 = Woke</p> <p>This lack of consistency in the rules of the language poses a lot of problem for the undergraduate users of English in Nigeria. The basic discrepancy between linguistic competence and linguistic performance as it affects the students will also be discussed latter in the research.</p> <p>There is also the extra - linguistic factor of social and pre-university academic background of the undergraduates' users. These factors are examined in detail in the main body of the work.</p> <p>The traditional grammarians had mainly prescribed rather than described the grammatical rules of English. This work is not a renascent attempt at prescribing the rules for the undergraduate users of English. Granted that language is in a constant state of flux, deviations in syntax which do not have \"universal recognition\" should not be foisted on the grammar of English. At the risk of being prescriptive, variations in syntax should be regulated and guided along the path of grammaticality. Simply put, the language should be meaning fully dynamic. There is, therefore, the need to check this constant drift from the standard among university undergraduates in Nigeria lest Educated Nigerian English (E.N.E.) becomes internationally unintelligible. To this extent, the work is pedagogic.</p> <p><strong>1.5    SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The grammatical errors which characterize the undergraduate usage of English, as we have seen, are traceable to three main causes. These are problems of linguistic interference; inadequate knowledge of the internal rules of English grammar and the short comings of linguistic performance; and the social and pre­-university academic background of the students.</p> <p>This study is based on the data collected from articles written, by undergraduate students in Campus magazines, departmental journals and essays written for the purpose of this research. However, the campus magazines and departmental journals and essays written for the purpose of this research. However the campus magazines and departmental journals are more dependable sources since in writing these ad hoc essays, the students are likely to pay extra attention to their grammar. Questionnaires have also been administered to students in Lagos State University, to determine the currency of some deviant sentences in their English usage. The paper will also be based partly on the spoken English of some university communities to avoid over - concentration on the written medium. There will also be references to write-ups and texts on this and related subjects.</p> <p><strong>1.6    DEFINITION OF TECHNICAL TERMS</strong></p> <p>Syntactic term in English is known as the first thing that is binding of different words together depends not upon their linear position in the sentence, but on their underlying syntactic relationships. The processing of syntactic relations cannot be completed until the whole sentence is finished.</p> <p>Syntactic problems are sequence of words whose first word starts with a capital letter and whose last word is followed by an end punctuation mark (period/full stop or question mark or exclamation mark). It also includes examples of common sentence problems in written or spoken in English.</p> <p>To write or speak a correct sentence, you need to have a good understanding of what a sentence is. Students who don't have this understanding, or don't take care, often include problem sentences in their writing or while communicating. Native English speakers are just as likely to write and communicate in problem sentences as ESL students.</p> <p>It is helpful to read your written work aloud. When you speak, you will make natural pauses to mark the end of your sentences or clauses. If there is no corresponding end punctuation mark in your writing, you can be almost certain that you have written a run-on sentence.</p>                                                          \n\nSTUDY OF SOME SYNTACTIC PROBLEMS ON ENGLISH USAGE AMONG UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATES STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STUDY OF SOME SYNTACTIC PROBLEMS ON ENGLISH USAGE AMONG UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATES STUDENTS", "id": 23}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Most of the theories on the origins of language have all shown that language arose of man's desire to adapt to his environment. For instance, the cooperation and contact theories show that language (speech) came into being out of the human instinct for survival and contact.</p> <p>One of the basic conditions that must be fulfilled before an individual can claim membership of any society is the ability to communicate effectively in the language of that society (community-social group). The norms and traditions of a society are transmitted through specific linguistic codes (language). This view is in consonance with Hallowell's (1953) claim that:</p> <p>                        “A necessary condition for socialization in man is the learning</p> <p>                   And use of language and by the way, a socially conditioned</p> <p>                   Aspect of it, to be relevant in that social group of which he is a</p> <p>                   Member.</p> <p>No matter how primitive a society is, its cultural values and beliefs are presented in well defined linguistic forms and nuances. Among the various functions of language in our society, specialization is perhaps one of the greatest. It gives a distinct exclusivity and pride to a group. This is perhaps why the military and police personale will call those who do not understand their peculiar meta-language as \"bloody, civilians\". This is echoed in Sapir's view when he noted that: \"Language is a great force of socialization probably the greatest\" - Edward Sapir: Culture Language and Personality: University of California press (1956) page 1.</p> <p>Perhaps, Bell's opinion is even more apt when he says:</p> <p>                        “Language is a set of culturally transmitted behaviour</p> <p>                   patterns shared by a group of individuals.</p> <p>Roger Bell, sociolinguistics: Goods, Approaches and. problems: London, B. T. Batsford Ltd (1976) P.l4. In Bell's view, language cannot be divorced from culture and society. A member of any society who does not know well, when and how to use the language peculiar to his society is a social outcast\". The ability to use the specialized and predominant languages of a society enhances social mobility, way, competence, reviewing and professionalism.</p> <p>Having established that the French or language use of a group society sensitizes members to the orderly society. It has equally been established that language mobilized in entirety, the personalities of members to more effectively interact with the philosophy and codes of conduct of their societies.</p> <p>In conclusion, language can be used to social solidarity and group infirmity. That is the reason a member of a security agency would probably not need any formal identification, when out of uniform, when he discusses with another officer of the law in the specialized security and police language. We will immediately experience a reality of, \"he talks as us; he is one of us\"</p> <p>On the strength of the above lies the basis of this essay - an analyses of a special variety of language used by a special group in furtherance and advancement of their set objectives; hence, the Linguistic stylistic Analysis of Nigerian security Agencies use of language, with emphasis on the Nigeria Police Register.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1.</strong><strong> BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The truth, of course, is that it is precisely the multiplication of meanings which makes language the powerful and flexible tool that it is. The possibility of selecting adopting, standardizing of a selected set of vocabulary and specialized intended meanings for use by a society, the effectiveness and intelligibility of same have elicited a study in varieties and functions of language (English).</p> <p>It is pertinent at this point to stress that in as much as uniformity in the use of language is desirable, it is not possible. Even if it were possible, it would not be in the best interest for the growth and effectiveness of the language; certain groups have peculiar sensibilities and needs. These peculiar realities must by necessity be addressed and furthered by a peculiar variety of language (English) which might be exclusive to this selected group but at best, vaguely intelligible to people outside the select group.</p> <p>So far, we have seen that certain social factors have by no means acted as influence on language. While some have worked for greater clarity and efficiency, others have tampered with the adequate functioning of language.</p> <p>Basically therefore, varieties of language in our study of English language, have emerged, distinguishing races, classes, occupations, etc.</p> <p>This multiplicity of a compendium of varieties of one general language has considerably and unconsciously provided very powerful tool of identification uniqueness and exclusivity to certain groups in one larger general linguistic community. In the subsequent sections, it will examined how these specialized varieties have been able to satisfy the peculiar needs and sensibilities of the various linguistic groups such as the security agencies, the Nigeria Police, etc.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Language - \"any language is a code\"; a set of rules for generating what generative transformational grammarian call \"well-formed sentences.\" A breach of the standard code could therefore result in an \"ill-formed\" utterance (sentences).</p> <p>Basically, many if not all social varieties of English are derivations from the standard normative features of the language. Our case study is the Nigeria police force's Register.</p> <p>The security agencies register especially the police thrive on a long established alterations of the syntactic\" semantic and to some extent, the phonological components of the English language. Some of such alterations which have combined to give a unique identity to the Nigerian Police register are:</p> <p>category rule violation, linguistic foregrounding,</p> <p>avoidance of technical verbiage, paradigmatic</p> <p>association, semantic compounding, neutralization of</p> <p>semantic opposition double extender, taboo expressions,</p> <p>tedious legal verbiage, etc.</p> <p>The question which immediately arises is: Does this peculiar variety with all its peculiarities hamper the effective use of language for communication? OR better put, what are the socio-linguistic advantages, benefits, challenges and short­comings of this variety?</p> <p>In summary, it has been established that the tenets of socio linguistics accepts that the peculiarities of every linguistic group present a varitable ground for the growth of distinct register. Now, the Nigerian Police has a recognizable and identifiable official variety of English. How effective it is in the advancement of the organization, its intelligibility and grammaticality are basically the problem this essay will address.</p> <p><strong>1.3    PURPOSE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to carry out a stylistic analysis (basically semantic and syntactic), towards identifying the components of the Nigerian Police register. This analysis will be the background the emergence of the register, its linguistic and communicative effectiveness and overall, why and how this peculiar variety is suitable and has advanced the collective vision of the Nigerian police.</p> <p>In summary, the objective of this study will be a comparative analysis of the intelligibility of the police register to members of the force vis-a-vis the civilians and the basic/standard deviations of the police register from standard formal English language expressions.</p> <p><strong>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Our exhaustive analysis will reveal the mutual interaction that takes place between some of the structural components or standard everyday English language and the specialized if you like, close aspect (police register) of the language.</p> <p>The study will furthermore open vistas on the extent and influence of socio­linguistic factors that come to play when a group of people develop and standardize a suitable English language diction that will reflect the syntax and semantics appropriate to their peculiar realities, while yet retaining the basic elements of the language (English language)</p> <p><strong>1.5    SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of the research will not extend beyond the analyses of isolated expressions which contain linguistic elements that could be designated the Police register. Some of such peculiarities have combined to acquire the description - Police register are repetitions lexical items in a structure, Linguistic foregrounding, semantic compounding, taboo expressions, tedious legal verbiage, etc.</p> <p>The project will also examine the semantic components that consist of the use of martial and specialized scientific expressions.</p> <p>However the phonological components of the police register which is the least affected will however not be examined in details.</p> <p><strong>1.6    RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>Our data will be gathered from primary reference texts such as standard books on Linguistics, Socio-linguistics, Syntax and Semantics. Materials for analyses will be sourced from the Nigerian Police manuals, operational correspondencies and the documented everyday expressions of Police officers in their offices and on the field.</p> <p>The information gathered from the police manuals and interactions will be analysed and standardized, using appropriate reference texts. An establishment of the peculiarities of the police register coupled with a rigorous analysis will reveal the linguistic and stylistic effectiveness of same and help to appreciate the existence of peculiar registers.</p> <p><strong>1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Language:</strong> This is the act of speaking, writing or signing, in a given situation; often referred to by the French term, parole (2) The Diagnostic system underlying a person's use of speech writing or sign (often refereed to as competence); more generally, the system underlying the shared spoken, written or sign behavior of a whole community often referred to by the French term language (3) The biological faculty enabling individuals to learn and use speech, writing or sign - a defining feature of human behavior. (4) A particular variety or level of speech writing or sign - as encountered in such phrases as religious language and gutter language\" (5) An artificially constricted system used to expound a conceptual are a (e.g. computer language) or to facilitate communication (as artificial language/), in this sense, the term contrasts with a natural language.</p> <p><strong>Syntax</strong>: The study of the rules governing the way words are combined to form sentences and other constructions in a language. In this use, syntax is opposed to morphology, the study of, structure. More generally it is the study of the interrelationships between all elements of sentences structure (including morphemes), and of the rules governing the arrangement of sentences in sequences. In \"generative grammar\" the syntactic component contains rules for the generation of syntactic structures.</p> <p><strong>Semantics</strong>: A branch of linguistics related to the study of meaning in languages. In particular, the approach called structural semantics applies all the principles of structural linguistics to the study of meaning through the notion of semantic relations between lexical items (such as synonymy and antonym). In \"generative grammar\", the semantic component is a major area of the semantic representation to a sentence and analyses lexical times in terms of semantic features.</p> <p><strong>Sociolinguistics</strong>: To start with, linguistics is the scientific study of language.  Several approaches can be distinguished, according to the linguistics focus, range and interest. Socio-linguistics is a study of the influence of one's society on his use of language whether his first language (mother tongue) second language or foreign language</p> <p><strong>Register(s):</strong> Variety according to the subject matter or social group involved in a speech act (in this case English language speech act) is known as the register of that Linguistic group. The presumption is that it is possible that an individual or a group can adopt one distinct variety peculiar to them as their permanent form of English.

The.' knowledge is important both for educational, economical and national development of a country.</p> <p>The importance of English language as a school subject derives mainly from its utilitarian value to the larger Nigerian society, English is the officia1 language of administration and commerce, It is major language of science. Above all, Salami (2002) had emphasized the importance of tile USC of English language in improving communication among, the various ethnic groups in, Nigeria, He further highlighted the need for improving the quality of spoken and written English .language among school children.</p> <p>However, one of the current educational problems of public interest is that of poor level of achievement especially in public examinations (Kolawole1998) Kolawole and Dele 2002). This problem of underachievement among school children has persisted in many subject areas such as Mathematics, English and Science (Ivowi, Okebukola, and Oladorun, 1992; Falayajo, 1997). This poor level of achievement in many subject areas may -be due to poor foundation in English Language at the primary school level. There are also several research reports, which support the view, that language inefficiency invariably leads to poor academic performance (Ayodele, 1988; Falayajo, 1997). No wonder why today, according to Iroegbu (2006) much emphasis is placed on the passing of English language at credit or distinction Level in addition to other subjects to enable any candidate gain admission into any Nigerian Higher Institution of learning or be placed well in a good white collar job.</p> <p>In recognition of the importance of English language for enhancing educational attainment as well as for improving communication ability of citizens, the government had made the subject a core subject (FGN, 2004). It is also compulsory for students to have credit in English language before entering the university. This also explains why many parents go off their way to see that their children pass at credit level or above in English language.</p> <p>The importance of English language as a school subject derives mainly from, its utilitarian value to the larger Nigerian society. English is the official language of administration and commerce. It is major language of science. Above all, Salami (2002) had emphasized the importance of the use of English language in improving communication among the various ethnic groups in Nigeria. He further highlighted the need for improving the quality of spoken and written English language among school children.</p> <p>However one of the current educational problems of public interest is that of poor level of achievement especially in public examinations (Kolawole .1998, Kolawole and Dele 2002). This problem of underachievement among school children has persisted in many subject areas such as Mathematics, English and Science (Akpan, Ivowi, Okebukola, and Oladotun, 1992; Falayajo, 1997). This poor level of achievement in many subject areas may be due to poor foundation in English language at the primary school level. There are also several research reports, which support ·the view that languageinefficiency invariably leads to poor academic performance (Oluikpe, 1979; Ayodele, 1988 Falayajo, 19.97 Onukaogu and Arua, 1997; Onukaogu, 2002).</p> <p>Okoro (2000) has stated that the problem of poor level of achievement of primary school. children was a serious one in Nigeria and this was in spite of the fact that Nigeria had set up goals for increasing minimum level of learning by 1995. The author had observed that ample evidences of poor performance were still observed as the pupils move up the system. Attempt was therefore made to find out the extent to which Okoro's (2000) observation applies to primary school English. Language beyond the year 2000.</p> <p>Perhaps the way English language is taught in schools and colleges may be blamed for some of the observed lapses in English language achievement and skills of learners. Ubahakwe (1991), Ohia (1997) and Duff (1997) had criticized the traditional teaching strategy for use in</p> <p>English language classrooms. Kolawole (1991,1998) had blamed the Use of traditional teaching strategy for lack of good grasp of basic skills in writing. Williams (1990) had described this teaching strategy as a hit and miss affair. Oglan (1997) had criticized the domineering nature of traditional teaching strategy which renders learners passive in class. He therefore recommended an activity classroom where learners especially at the primary school level, can make learning a fun: Such learning activities may include learning with objects, things, photographs, films etc.</p> <p>Kolawole (2002) also confirmed that the performance of the primary school pupils in English language was very poor. They stressed further that the standard was poor due to a number of other .reasons such as:</p> <p>1.                     The use of tribal language in the lower classes of the primary school;</p> <p>2.     Some pupils do not understand the grammar because their teachers themselves do not know it; and</p> <p>3.                 In most cases English language teachers in the senior primary schools resort to these of mother tongue to teach and explain the English language even up to the secondary school level.</p> <p>These researchers are of the opinion that there should be a review in the language policy on education. The review according to them should contain recommendations that will make pupils to have exposure to the subject quite early from the primary school' irrespective of the advantages of mother tongue, They further suggested that teaching and learning of English should be more practical in our schools, and also the number of years of study and. teaching periods should 'be increased. Finally, materials for learning the subject should be supplied.</p> <p>This will be the time when the problem of failure in the subject will hopefully be overcome. So a firm foundation in English language is very important for better performance.</p> <p>Ogunsanwo (2003) has a different view on the use of English language in the early years of the primary school. He opined that the use of mother tongue .in the process of teaching and learning in the early years helps, not only to preserve and value ones culture but also to develop it lexically. According to the author, the use of English language in the early primary school makes the average primary school child unable to be sufficiently literary in either the mother tongue or English language.</p> <p>He felt that to use English language at that level will lead to the children having a mental translation of a1l concepts presented in English language to their mother tongue in order to gain sufficient meaning of the concepts presented. The researcher believes that a citizen that is literate even only in the mother tongue will be sufficiently equipped to live a useful life in the fast changing world. So if permanent literacy is to be promoted in the primary schools the use of the mother tongue as the medium of instruction in schools ought to be encouraged.</p> <p>Harker (2000) investigated gender differences in achievement of boys and girls in schools in New Zealand. The study which employed a large sample of 5300 pupils showed that the achievement of girls in English language was significantly higher than that of boys both in terms of mean curriculum coverage and examination learning outcomes. The results however showed.that boys achieved significantly better results than girls in Mathematics. The result further revealed that <em>there </em>were no significant difference in the achievement of boys and girls in Science (Okeke, 2004). Iyowi, Okebukola, Oludotun and Akpan (1992) showed that English language and literature achievements by Nigerian Junior Secondary School Students is very poor (Ivowi, et al, 1992; Okoro, 2000). Primary schoolchildren in the age range of (6-1lyrs) need to improve level of their achievement or at least the number achieving minimum standard. This target has not been met (Okoro, 2000).</p> <p>Although English language retains its dominant position in the education. Delivery system in Nigeria, the thrust of our educational language policy is the use of the. Mother tongue or the language of the immediate community in pre-primary and primary education. Interestingly, private educational entrepreneurs provide pre-primary education exclusively through the medium of English language. The mother tongue medium education at the primary school level is provided in less than twenty Nigerian languages throughout the country. English is the exclusive medium of instruction at the junior and senior levels of secondary school education.</p> <p>It was in recognition of the importance and contributions of mother tongue to education that made the, Federal Ministry of Education in Collaboration with other educational statutory agencies include in the National Policy on Education published in 1977, revised in 1981, the use of mother tongue as a medium of educating pupils at the pre-primary and primary level throughout the country.</p> <p>According to the National Policy on education published in 1977 revised in 1981, Section 2(u) which stated that “Government will ensure that the medium of instruction will be principally the mother tongue or the language of the immediate community” also in section 3 of the same National Policy on Education stated that:</p> <p>“Government will see to it that the medium of instruction in the primary school is initially the mother tongue of the immediate community and at a later stage English”.</p> <p>The importance of Nigerian language in the educational process is stated in section.</p> <p>“In addition to appreciating the importance of language in educational process, and as a means of preserving peoples’ culture, the government considers it In the best interest of national unity that each child should be encouraged to learn one of the three major languages other than his mother tongue”.</p> <p>The mother tongue therefore, is a part of the Nigerian culture; it conveys or transmits culture and itself in subjects to culturally conditioned attitudes and beliefs (Awoniyi, 1975). The positive results of the experiment in Mother Tongue Medium in Yoruba carried out at the then University of Ife empirically demonstrated the great advantages, of mother tongue in primary education for scholastic attainment (Bamgbose, 1984) and even in the successful mastery of English as a second language.</p> <p>At this juncture, it is very imperative to look at whether mother tongue has bearing on the English language stage among the secondary school students. It is important to draw attention to the presence of the problems and on the basis of what will be found out recommend what could be doneto reduce them if they cannot be totally eradicated.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The study is designed to examine the influence of mother tongue on Students performance in English language in Junior School CertificateExamination. The study investigated if mother tongue is solely the cause of the student’s woeful performance in English Language, in Junior School certificate Examination or if there are other complementing factors.</p> <p>Several scholars have addressed the core problems of communicative competence in the use of English language as L2 and its use as the main language of instruction in Nigeria's education delivery process. It is unfortunate that most school leavers (apart from the products of elite private schools) do not possess the required competence in the four language skills for both cognitive and communicative functions.</p> <p>Statistics released by the West African Examination Council, which conducts the West African Senior Secondary Certificate Examination, show that less than ten percent of secondary school leaver passes in English language at credit level. At the tertiary level of education students have so much difficult with their communicative skills In English that they cannot function effectively in the academic use of English (Okoro, 2000).</p> <p>There is no doubt that there is a great diversity of varieties and functions of English in Nigeria. For example, it is extensively used in both the electronicand the print media, in the judiciary, the police, the armed forces, the legislative, etc. and as a lingua franca in political mobilization, ethical orientation and population education. This confirms the entrenchment of English as the dominant official language of Nigeria. The nagging problem however concerns the quality of English that is taught and used in the system. The concern being expressed in informed educational circles is .the extent to which the variety and quality of English being learned and usedthe school system can serve in achieving Nigeria's educational goals and the objectives.</p> <p>It is therefore generally accepted that in teaching .and learning processes the mother tongue of the child is of utmost importance. For one thing, it categorizes a large part of the child's environment, that is, it has names for most of the objects, actions, ideas, attributes and so on that are so important to him, as well as to any society. In many developing countries today, this is either local language or the language of the previous colorizing power. The mother tongue.is the child's environment and is the natural basis on which verbal skills can be built, children learn through communicating in a language, which they understood, hence the need for this study: Impact of mother tongue on students’ performance In English Language.</p> <p><strong>1.3         Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions will be used in:</p> <p>(i)         Is there any way that teachers can motivate students to speak English in the school?</p> <p>(ii)  Are there adequate teaching materials for teachers to teach the students?</p> <p>(iii) Is there sufficient period to teach the subject on the    school time-table?</p> <p>(iv)   Are there specialized teaches to teach the subject?</p> <p>(v)   Are there anyway students are exposed to correct pronunciation of words?</p> <p><strong>1.4         Hypothesis</strong></p> <p><strong>HO</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>:</strong>There is no significant relationship between mother tongue and students' performance in English Language.</p> <p><strong>H0</strong><strong>2</strong><strong>: </strong>There is significant relationship between mother tongue and students' performance in 'English Language.</p> <p><strong>HO</strong><strong>3</strong><strong>:  </strong>There is no significance difference in male student performance and female students' performance in English Language.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Significance or the Study.</strong></p> <p>This study would provide a thresholds for proper understanding of the impacts of mother tongue on students' performance in English Language. It will also serve as a rich source of data for consultation by teachers and students on how to improve the performance of students in English Language. The project will form an invaluable material for the academia and the public in general.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Delimitation or the Study</strong></p> <p>The study essentially covers Nigerian secondary schools but with specific reference to secondary schools in Okota/lsolo Local Government Area. This choice is made to cover both private and public schools. The schools were selected randomly based on students’ population and enrolment strength. Also the presence of a WAEC marking centre within the Okota Secondary Schools Complex makes for easy access to data, hence the choice of Okota.</p> <p><strong>1.7         Limitations of the study</strong></p> <p>The chief limitation faced by the researcher was the inability to reach the target audience to conduct interview as well as to administer the questionnaires amongst teachers of the target secondary schools. To mitigate this and other shortcomings, the researcher had to rely much on mail questionnaire as well as the few people that could be interviewed and those who willingly completed the questionnaires to corroborate her personal experience in the industry.</p>                                                          \n\nIMPACT OF MOTHER TONGUE ON STUDENTS’ PERFORMANCE IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF MOTHER TONGUE ON STUDENTS’ PERFORMANCE IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE", "id": 25}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This paper duels on women lamentations over male subjugation. Women's lamentation over male subjugation has in years filtered into a determination to abnegate sexism. With this stance, their former conciliatory position becomes superseded by a current of revolt against men and tradition as highlighted through semantic compounding and linguistic parallelism in<em> So Long a Letter</em>.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Background of the Study</p> <p>The struggle for women’ right began in the 18th century during the period of intense intellectual activity known as the Age of Enlightenment.</p> <p>In traditional Africa the woman is an object of constant scorn, degradation and physical torture. In the past, women did not exist as individuals with personalities to defend. They rather existed as mere docile and exotic accompaniments to the males. Throughout that period, women lacked a voice to articulate their dilemma and their points of view. They, thus, accepted their fate without resistance. Such passive stance results from societal conditioning through questionable cultural practices. From birth, through childhood and adolescence, to adulthood, Africans receive from society and others around the messages and feedbacks which launch them into roles and behaviors considered appropriate for males and females respectively. Most often, female are accorded inferior roles and such long years of cultural suppression and intimidation, unfortunately, misled the women into an underestimation of their capabilities and self-worth. Encased in such a cultural mystique, the African women were particularly driven by a community sense since culture obviates individualism. In those days, these women, in addition to experiencing the same oppressive social condition as their male counterparts in a developing world, were subjected to extra repressive burdens arising from the socio-cultural structures of patriarchy and gender hierarchy. These years of subjugation have, however, produced in today’s women relentless questioning of the status quo. They protest against dehumanization, political enslavement and social oppression. They rationalize that the running of the Africa world is not the preserve for males and thus there should be absolute equality of both sexes in all spheres of life. Such a reaction is termed feminism, which is an ideology that urges, in simple terms, recognition of the claims of women for equal rights with men. For instance Cora Kaplan Literary text are constructed from within ideology, and reality They are dependent on the historical culture which surrounds them; so  are the literary critical claims about their truthfulness or authenticity determined by the culture from which they arise. Helen Chukwuma specifically contends that African feminism is dedicated and informed from within, the social realities that obtain. One of such realities is the persistence of sexist socio-psychological paradigm despite the efforts to overcome “the rocentricism which informs social life”.</p> <p>The persistent sexism in Africa is, however, matched with women’s continued aggressive demand for equal places in men’s former citadel of power and privilege. The chorus African women say to men “whatever the case maybe, you will never again hear us pronounce the words of the Virgin Mary, ‘thy will be done’ while smiling at your despotic power”. (Josephine Felicite in Moses, C.G. and Rabine, L. They argue that it is better for men to desire from them those noble and generous feelings which must exist between equals than those mercenary feelings which a slave has for his master. Consequent upon this quest and argument, there is a recent definition of womanhood in the context of the African cosmic order: “A human being endowed with all the capabilities and talents required to effectively function and make impact on all levels of life within society” (Adeife 1996).</p> <p>Notwithstanding the above stance, there still abounds in Africa, evidence of gender stereotypes which simply means a collection of commonly held beliefs or opinions about what are “appropriate” behaviors and activities for males and those that are “appropriate” for females. As a result of this, even though men support women’s condemnation of their (women) societal deprivations, men’s language still betrays subtle inclination to sexist socialization.</p> <p><em>The New Lexicon Webster’s Encyclopedic Dictionary of the English Language</em>, defines Sexism is  as attitudes and institutions, often unconscious that judge human worth on the grounds of gender or sex.</p> <p>It also explained as prejudice or discrimination usually against women, based on their gender. Sexist socialization, therefore, refers to the process by which infants and children are brought up to imbibe attitudes and practices that discriminate against one based on gender.</p> <p>This work examines <em>So Long a Letter</em> with a view to highlighting its characteristic language use as well as the psychological disposition that informs such use of language. Research findings by anthropologists, educationists and sociolinguistics show that traditionally, males use non-standard language; females use the language of rapport while males use the language of report; discursive language style is meant for women while men are given to the language of theories and abstractions; females use polite language meant to maintain harmony and strong relationship as well as to keep conversations open whereas males use the language of assertiveness and insistence. Women use the language of solidarity but men use the language of the expert.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Men in Africa make women understand that they, the men, are the head of the family that is, they are superior to women. They see women as being weak mentally and physically, this women have no say in the activities of the family community. They have no rights and are subjugated to do whatever the men want them to do especially in Africa. Women are made to feel inferior and this generate some ill feelings in women.</p> <p><strong>Aim of the study</strong></p> <p><strong>The aim of the study is to identify how Mariama Ba uses language to portray feminism - the reaction of females against the oppressive and discriminatory cultural practices.

In spite of the fact that most Nigerian hip-hop singers use English, they still try to identify with their roots by mixing English with their indigenous languages. We present code-switching inf.--, the lyrics of five Nigerian hip-hop musicians: Sunny Nneji, Weird MC, D'Banj, P Square and Styl Plus. The objectives are to examine the nature of the phenomenon of code-switching, to examine the reasons for code-switching, to discuss the stylistic effects of this trend, and to examine the implications of this practice for communication through music. Our findings reveal that while most code-switching is done in three languages - English, Nigerian Pidgin and Yoruba - Yoruba plays a prominent role. This makes the language the vehicle for the elaboration of themes within the songs. We also observe two major kinds of code-switching; ones in which chunks of ideas in different languages feature in turns, (inter-sentential code switching) thereby producing switches at discourse boundaries; and ones in which expressions from other languages are sandwiched between those of a dominant language (inter-sentential code switching). The study concludes that the unique identities created by code-switching in Nigerian hip-hop have positive local and global influences for music and artists, and reflect the ethno linguistic diversity of the Nigerian nation.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Any keen observer of the Nigerian Music screen will readily agree that much innovation has been introduced by the new hip-hop groups whose brand of music is very popular with Nigerian Youths and Adults alike. These young Nigerians entertainers demonstrate creative ingenuity in the way they have blended Nigerian Language or another with English or its Pidgin variety. In some of theses pieces almost half of the music is composed and sung in a Nigerian Language, and the other half in Standard English or Pidgin variety. This phenomenon in language use has been described in socio-linguistics as code-switching and code-mixing.</p> <p>Although this socio-linguistics concept has been widely studied, its investigation has largely been restricted to speech or conversational situations and most within formal settings Nigeria (if any) have been carried out on its use in other domains of language use, including music. Although music can be regarded as a kind of speech performance, it is a genre clearly different from any informal conversational exchanges.</p> <p>This paper will examine new trend of code switching and code mixing Nigeria's indigenous languages with English, with a particular focus on hip pop in Nigeria music.</p> <p><strong>1.1    AIM AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The objectives of this research \"<strong>The use of code switching and code mixing in Nigeria music\"</strong> is to show and analyze why musicians in Nigeria code switch and code mix their indigenous language into their music for proper expression and the use of their indigenous language shows where they hail from as in part 7 the states they come from. Aside that indigenous language is used to give better meaning and explanation of their mind.</p> <p><strong>1.2    SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This project being a unique work will really contribute to our understanding of the music industry in Nigeria in particular. It will showcase and educate us why musicians in Nigeria code switch and code mix their indigenous language along side with English Language in their music. It will as well stand as a guide for the upcoming researchers or students who intend to write from this perspective. It is also important to know that communication is a key way of interaction of code mixing and code sw3itching ones indigenous language in music is a means of communication.</p> <p><strong>1.3    SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The researcher hopes to reveal and examine the nature of these phenomena, to find out the extent of this practice, to examine the reasons for this practice, to discuss the stylistic effects of this trend and to discuss the implications of the practice for communication in or through music across the globe. The youths and adults are the most beneficiary of this study because they are young at heart and interested in entertainments in general especially the music industry.</p> <p><strong>1.4    THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</strong></p> <p>Socio linguistics, as the scientific study of society and the behaviour of people in the society are regards language use.</p> <p><strong>1.5    HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>This research projects will explain to us why musicians in Nigeria code switch and code mix their indigenous language in their music. Also, some musicians' code switch and code mix in three languages- English, Nigerian Pidgin and Yoruba - Yoruba plays a prominent role. This makes the language the vehicle for the elaboration of themes within the songs.</p> <p><strong>1.6    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>There has been a growing concern on the negative impact of the hip-hop music on youth in the Country and in spite of the seeming financial success and popularity of the musicians; hip-hop culture has been frequently condemned for its exploitation of women on duty. Most of the Hip-hop artistes have a lot of vulgarity, sexual, resonance preposterous violence, drugs and good time symbolism.</p>                                                               \n\nTHE USE OF CODE SWITCHING AND CODE MIXING IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE USE OF CODE SWITCHING AND CODE MIXING IN NIGERIA", "id": 27}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>This study examined the Semantic Analysis of T-Shirt Inscriptions under the following perspectives: education, politics, advertisement and religion.

The method and procedures involved in the evaluation of the stated objectives of the research work included random sampling with the use of questionnaires which were distributed to twenty people who wear T-Shirt's with educational, politics, religion and advertisement inscriptions in Lagos State - (Ifako-Ijaiye Local Government). The results of the findings of the four hypotheses generated were tested and the results were positive responses. This research work has therefore revealed the salient features of T­-Shirt inscriptions in human endeavor. To this end, T-shirt with inscriptions under the aforementioned fields are recommended to be produced in high quality as they serve various purposes ranging from enlightenment, information, moral enlightenment and advertisement.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Linguistics can be broadly broken into three categories or subfields of study: Language form, language meaning and language in context. Language form refers to the surface features of language and how these are arranged according to the grammar of the language. According to Adebanjo X2008) in \"Basic Issues in Discourse Analysis\", language in use which cannot be restricted to the description of linguistic forms independent of the purpose or functions which their forms are designed to serve in human affairs. Our main focus in this study is on language meaning which is known as \"Semantics\", the study of language meanings deal on how language employ logical structures and real world references to convey, process and assign meanings as well as to manage and resolve ambiguity. Language is essentially a social phenomenon, the assertion is clearly foregrounded in the definition of M.A.K. Halliday cited in Bloor guage can be `woven' to express the intention of a writer. When people use language to express meanings, they do so in specific situations and the type of language that they use is usually influenced by the complex elements of those situations (pg. 14).</p> <p>People who wore T-Shirt with inscriptions just like every other human being normally use T-Shirt inscriptions to express themselves. According to Babajide (2000), \"Every human being is naturally endowed with capacity for language use for the expression of self and reception of others expressed messages. T-Shirt inscriptions could be seen as an informal way of non-verbal messages to its readers. and Bloor (1995) that Semantics according to Titi Adejumobi (2007) is the study of the meaning of words, phrases and sentences (pg. 32).       Crystal (1980) defines semantics as the study of the meaning of linguistic forms (pg. 315). Lyons (1981) also defines it as \"the study of meaning\". Oladipo L. et al (2000) defines ‘semantics' as the study of the word and morpheme meanings as the study of rules combining meanings.</p> <p>We can then infer from the different definitions above that Semantics is the branch of linguistics dealing with meanings of words and sentences.  In semantics analysis, there is always an attempt to focus on what the' words</p> <p>conventionally mean, rather than on what a speaker might want the words to mean on a particular occasion. This technical approach to meanings emphasizes the objectives and the general. It avoids the subjective and the local.</p> <p>Semantics shows how the speech community of a particular language gives meaning to its speech sounds or vocal noise or-the representatives of the vocal noise in writing. It investigates and describes how each human language arrives at a system of a given meaning to its peculiar vocal</p> <p>noise. Semantics as a science of meaning comes in readily to and establish the problem. Creative writers can be very good, powerful, effective or sometimes ineffective in their use of languages in their surface and deep levels of creating different meanings to suit their goals. Semantic explains the various types of meaning that exist within T-Shirt inscriptions.</p> <p>Therefore, semantics is the science that studies the meaning of T-Shirt inscriptions. .</p> <p>Most scholarly works on text like this have been on newspapers, headlines, speeches, semiotics and car stickers in purview of pragmatics and critical discourse analysis. However, this paper intends to consider a vital concept in linguistics. \"Semantics to analyse T-Shirt inscriptions\". This will serve as a theoretical framework to enhance our understanding of meanings with different T-Shirt inscriptions used by people. It will reveal the importance and effects of these T-Shirt inscriptions. It will also add to the few existing scholarly works on semantics.</p> <p>T-Shirt inscription as Graphology is a branch of linguistics that studies writing and printing as systems of signs.         It is the study of the writing system of a language, the orthographic conventions that have been devised to turn speech into writing using any available technology (e.g. pen d ink, typewriter, printing press, electronic screen) . In modern English, the core of the system is the alphabet of 26 letters, in its lower case (a, b, c ... ) and upper case (A, B, C ... ) forms, along with rules which govern the way of spelling and capitalization which govern the way these letters are combined to make words. The system also includes the set of punctuations marks and the conventions of text positioning (such as headlines and indents), which are used to organize text by identifying sentences, paragraphs and other written units.

T-Shirt with printing is an easy way to make a common week day colorful or to present an original gift for the holiday.</p> <p>Printing inscriptions on T-Shirts involve the process of heating to produce the inscriptions.</p> <p>In making high-quality printing on T-Shirts and fabrics, you apply print which is a thermal transfer using ordinary iron. The basis of this technology consists of placing the image on the fabric, using strong pressure and temperature.</p> <p>Home-made printing involves buying a heat press to improve the quality. Digital printing on textiles (T-Shirt printing) allows the application of a variety of fabrics from natural to mix up.</p> <p>Professional printing companies provide digital printing on black, white, colored and multi-colored t-shirts, sweater, shirts, etc. and the picture looks bright and realistic regardless 44 the type of textile type and its color.

The origin of pidgin could be traced to 1850, when it first appeared in print. Shaibu (2013) describes Nigerian Pidgin English as a combination of indigenous languages and English. It basically uses English words mixed into Yoruba, Benin or Igbo grammar. Nigerian Pidgin English used to be seen mainly as the code of the non-literate as well as a bastardization of English, therefore, was considered as indicative of academic proficiency in English. In the case of Nigeria however, Akande (2008:37) notes that, the social linguistic reality in Nigeria today is such that Nigerian Pidgin English is spoken by university graduates, professors, lawyers and journalists.<br/>Holm (1988) considers language contact to be nearly as old as language itself. To support this idea he points out that in the ancient Egypt there was a trade language developed among several Hamito-Semitic languages in contact in the Nile Valley, which can be considered a pidgin. A pidgin, or pidgin language is a simplified version of a language that develops as a means of communication between two or more groups that do not have a language in common. It is most<br/>2<br/>commonly employed in situations such as trade, or where both groups speak languages different from the language of the country in which they reside. Major language changes usually occur over centuries, but the language contact that forms pidgins results in ‘rapid language change and evolution’ (Patrick. 2006). A pidgin language is a variety created by combining two or more existing languages through the process of ‘pidginization’. When people need to communicate but speak different native languages, they may combine their own languages to create a new ‘pidgin language'. This language is then transferred by word of mouth to others and becomes the acknowledged way for the different speaking communities to communicate.<br/>Pidgin is a wide term covering a range of regional hybrids, which evolved through historical events such as the spread of Empires, settlement, migration and international trade. Found in Africa (West African Pidgins include Nigerian Pidgin, Cameroonian Pidgin, Sierra Leone Krio), Indonesia (Tok Pisin, spoken in Papua New Guinea), parts of Asia and the Caribbean, English derived Pidgins are inventive, innovative, and often quite literal. For example in Tok Pisin, 'gras bilong het' (or grass belong head) simply means 'hair'. Because of their spontaneous adaptability, Pidgins are unlike other languages in that they can be as structured or as unstructured as needed - there are no strict rules as such. Pidgins are also not used as mother tongues, though over time and generations, the language evolves, is adopted and changes to gradually become a first language for new generations. Historically, Pidgin occurs in situations where native language is seen as subordinate, or banned in the case of slavery, and is the point where Pidgin arguably moves to become a Creole, or a stable, 'nativised' language. Scholarly debate remains however, as to what point a Pidgin language can evolve to become a Creole and replace a native language over the generations.<br/>3<br/>As an idea of how language evolves, from 'no common language' between English and native groups, to 'Pidgin' languages to 'Creole', the tongue follows four main stages of development -<br/> Restricted - The beginnings of Pidgin, used as a fundamental necessity when contact between language groups (English and native) is limited.<br/> Extended - If contact is more prolonged, Pidgin develops, and may be situationally encouraged to be used between natives themselves (i.e. natives of differing native tongues), as well as between other language groups.<br/> Creole - If Pidgin survives, and if inter-native use evolves enough, it can develop into a Creole language to become a next generation mother tongue in place of the native language.<br/> Standardization/decreolization - Increasingly standardized and structured, over time, the Creole becomes more rigid, developing into a standard, stabilized language (And very different from the original loose Pidgin structures)<br/>Nowadays, Pidgin English is in extensive use and is well-recognised around the globe, especially in parts of West Africa and Oceania. In 2012 for example, for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, Prince Charles visited Papua New Guinea, introducing himself as the \"Numbawan pikinini bilong Misis Kwin\", (or 'number one child belonging to Mrs Queen') proving the resilience and longevity which Pidgin (despite its modest roots) can have - if royalty can speak it, Pidgin has really gone a long way. However, to be considered pidgin it must be stable and have norms of meaning, grammar and pronunciation. Some of its characteristics are: limited vocabulary; elimination of many grammatical devices - such as number and gender; lack of inflectional and derivational morphemes; lack of verbal inflection; loss of prepositions and indicators of time, aspect and mood; lack of locative prepositions and plural indicator; movement rules among others.<br/>4<br/>1.1.2 Pidgin in the 21st Century<br/>It has been discovered lately, that most people especially students in various Nigerian tertiary institutions, find it easier to communicate with pidgin whenever they are in an informal setting. It is also important to mention that Pidgin has been able to secure a place in the corporate world. People switch to Pidgin in the middle of a formal conversation either to explain themselves better or to cite an instance to juxtapose the message they are trying to pass across. Obafemi Awolowo University, a typical example of a multilingual setting; people from different cultural backgrounds live together in a room, and communication has to take place. This set of people prefer to use pidgin as a means of communication whenever they engage in conversations in any informal environment because there are no standard rules guiding its usage unlike the Standard English where you have to abide by the rules of concord, syntax, phonology, and semantics among others. In other words, they feel more convenient when they express themselves in pidgin because they is always the tendency of being careful not to break the rules of concord, syntax, grammar, among others.<br/>Akande and Salami (2010) assume that the urban characters of the university environments are strong factors influencing the students’ use and attitudes to Nigerian Pidgin English (NPE). They hold that apart from their education, living within the university communities, the students are likely to enact more urban networks that are usually made up of multilingual and multicultural contents. It is noteworthy to emphasize that the university communities have a large number of users of the Nigerian Pidgin English. Basically, it could be argued that Nigerian Pidgin English plays a unifying role among its users, as it is the language of the educated and the uneducated irrespective of their linguistic backgrounds. Akande (2008:38) argues “it could be regarded as a<br/>5<br/>marker of identity and solidarity. It is an inter-ethnic code available to Nigerians, who have no other common language.<br/>1.2 Statement of Research Problem<br/>After various research procedures, it is evident that students of Obafemi Awolowo University feel more comfortable whenever they are expressing themselves in Pidgin, this study examines the degree Pidgin is used, the various types, the gender involved, and the cultural undertone. Previous studies on pidgin have focused on the origin and characteristics of Pidgin. Studies on how it performs its unifying role among its users in a multilingual setting such as Obafemi Awolowo University halls of residence has not received adequate scholarly attention. This type of study would also highlight the positive roles of pidgin in Nigeria.<br/>1.3 Aim and Objectives<br/>The aim of this study is to describe how pidgin unifies the residents of the selected halls of residence in Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, who are from diverse linguistic backgrounds. The objectives of this study are to:<br/>a. analyse the forms of conversations peculiar among the residents of Moremi and Fajuyi halls of residence.<br/>b. highlight how pidgin fosters, unifies and brings about the ease of communication among selected respondents, and<br/>c. analyse the recorded conversations in the context of time, mood and situation accompanying them, in order to show how pidgin unifies them.<br/>6<br/>1.4 Significance of the Study<br/>Pidgin is an important code for communication in a multilingual society, where many cultural differences are in existence and have in one way or the other dominated the day-to-day conversations of the students of Obafemi Awolowo University, this study would examine the frequency at which pidgin is used, the syntactic groups, and the cultural undertone reflected in the kind of pidgin used among the students, and the purposes for which pidgin is used. The importance of this study is not just to describe how pidgin is used, but to provide a deep insight of how pidgin serves the unifying role among the students of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife.<br/>1.5 Assumptions Underlying the Study<br/>a. Students adopt various forms of expressions ranging from the use of their local dialects, British English, and the use of Pidgin.<br/>b. Students have diverse ways of using Pidgin.<br/>c. Pidgin makes communication easier in a multilingual speech community.<br/>1.6 Scope of the Study<br/>There are various forms of languages in the world, and it is impossible for an individual to be proficient in all these languages. In Moremi and Awolowo halls of residence in Obafemi Awolowo University, which are typical examples of multilingual societies. Pidgin is commonly used during conversations among students because most of the conversations done in the academic environment are usually formal thereby creating some restrictions for the students as they tend to carefully select words in order not to bypass the rigorous processes of the Standard British English.</p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF PIDGIN AS A MEANS OF COMMUNICATION IN UNIFYING STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF PIDGIN AS A MEANS OF COMMUNICATION IN UNIFYING STUDENTS", "id": 29}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong><em>Abstract</em></strong></p> <p><em>This research examines the dilemma of the girl child in African culture and the fundamental problems confronting her existential being.

Market women who were native of Mushin and who have been doing business in Lagos market were sampled. Phonological approach was adopted using snowball sampling technique. It was discovered that phonological features of Nigeria English such as substitution, under-differentiation, spelling pronunciation, epenthesis and simplification of consonant cluster were the common features found in the oral English of the samples. The English of the sample has been affected by their L1.</p> </div> <p> CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION 1.1     Background to the Study </p> <p>This study is carried out to examine the effect of Yoruba on the spoken English of Mushin market women in Lagos state. The need to examine and correct the wrong pronunciation of English words in many Nigerian market women, particularly among the Mushin market woman in Lagos demands extra effort and great attention. This is because, it is observed that this problem is the result of the features found in their indigenous languages which are transferred to the sound system of the English language. Their English phonetics reflects the structure of the sound system of their mother tongue (Osisanwo 2009). With respect to this, we shall discuss the term phonology.</p> <p>          Phonology is the sound system of a language. It is the study of the properties of the sound system of a given language. It is the systematic study of how the speech sounds function and are organized in human languages. Hyman (1975:1) cited by Osinanwo (2009:3) asserted that, the goal of phonology is to study the properties of the sound system which speakers must learn and internalize in order to use their language for the purpose of communication. According to Oyebade (1998:2) phonology is the scientific study of the arbitrary vocal symbol used in human speech and the pattern into which these symbols produce intelligent, meaningful utterances.</p> <p>Akmajian <em>et al</em> (2008:109) asserted that ‘phonology is the subfield of linguistics that studies the structure and patterning of sound in human language’. Hence, speakers of Nigerian English are still facing a lot of pronunciation problems as a result of their L1 influence on their spoken English (Alabi, 2007). So many works have been done on the segmental features of the phonology of Nigerian English such as Utin (2009) based on the Anang accent of English language.</p> <p>          Mushin lies on the railway from Lagos and at the intersection of roads from Lagos, Shomolu, and Ikeja. After the 1950 independence from the Great Britain, there became large migrations to the sub-urban areas. This led to intensive overcrowding as a result, poor sanitation and inadequate housing lead to poor living conditions.  However, since the rise of industrialization in Nigeria, Mushin has become one of the largest beneficiaries of the industrial expansion. Their local commercial enterprises include spinning and weaving of cotton, shoe manufacturing, bicycle and motorized-cycle assembly, along with the production of powdered milk (Jowith, 1991).               </p><p> 1.2   Statement of the Problem                                                        </p> <p>Despite the fact that various studies has previously been conducted on the phonology of Nigeria English, Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba languages respectively, however, research gaps exists in the area of the effect of Yoruba on the spoken English of Mushin Market women in Lagos which this study sets to bridge.  It is obvious that language has gain a lot of ground among the Nigeria languages, however it is one of the major indigenous language in Nigeria. Therefore this study is set out to find the effect of Yoruba language particularly the Mushin Yoruba dialect on the phonology of English.  That is, it is to check the influence of the Mushin Lagos Yoruba dialect on the sound system of the English language at the segment level. In other words, this work will find out the English phonemes which are mispronounced by the Mushin indigenous Yoruba market women.</p><p> 1.3    Purpose of the Study </p> <p>          The aim of this study is to find out the effect of Mushin Yoruba dialect on the phonology of standard British English (SBE). That is, the changes that may likely occur as a result of the contact of the Mushin Lagos Yoruba dialect and English. In other words, this work is to search for the features that distinguish the phonology of Nigeria English variety from the received pronunciations. These features shall be identified from the recorded speech collected and analyzed. We hope to provide solution to bridge the gap in the differences.</p> <p><strong>1.4      Justification of the Study</strong></p> <p> A lot of research works have been done on phonologic interferences. This work is to add to the efforts that have been made. Our concentration is on this topic because much has not been done particularly on the phonological interference of Mushin Lagos Yoruba dialect and the English language. Also the cosmopolitan nature of Mushin Lagos Yoruba draws our interest. This work shall help the Mushin indigenous Yoruba market women and other readers on their spoken English.</p> <p><strong>1.5     Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>Phonology can be handled from different angles; for instance, segmental aspect can be treated, attention can be paid to only suprasegmental aspect  and the two levels can be jointly discussed. This research work shall direct its focus on the segmental phonology. Due to time, financial constraints and for effective result we shall limit our study domain to only Mushin market in Lagos. Twenty market women shall be tested, out of which ten shall be selected. The selection shall base on deepness in Yoruba language spoken.</p><p> 1.6     Methodology </p> <p>          This work shall make use of recorded speech of ten selected market women from Mushin market, Lagos. Samples are selected using snowball sampling techniques as a result of the limited number of accessible market women. Only market women that are native of Mushin in Lagos and have spent at least two years doing business in the market are sampled.</p> <p>A theoretical application shall be phonemic theory, a phonological approach will be explored to analyze the samples. In this regard, elements such as substitution, under-differentiation, spelling pronunciation, epenthesis and simplification of consonant cluster that constitute the phonological features of Nigerian English will be deplored. Each of these elements will be applied across the data and any deviation from the SBE will be under lined. Tabular form shall be used for the comparison.</p> <p>Finally the sound system of English and Yoruba shall be treated. This will enable us to know the differences between the sound systems. Also it will assist us to determine the causes of the effect of which may likely occur in the spoken English of indigenous Mushin Yoruba market women as L2 learners. The phonology of Nigerian English, phonetics and phonology shall be discussed in the next chapter.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF YORUBA ON THE SPOKEN ENGLISH OF MUSHIN MARKET WOMEN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF YORUBA ON THE SPOKEN ENGLISH OF MUSHIN MARKET WOMEN", "id": 31}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Literature across ages and continents have functioned as the embodiment and interpreter of a peoples’ culture, a conveyor of a people’s language as well as their philosophy, politics, psychology and national character.  Nwachukwu, (2005) notes that literature whether cast in the form of agitation, negotiation or based on historical reconstruction or mythological recreation has a touch of identity. According to Bayo (2003:1) opines that Literature is a discipline that attempts to depict man and his environment. The creative imagination and the use of a specialized form of communication medium-language and style make literature different form all other disciplines.</p> <p>Furthermore, literature deliberately aims at re-creating the human society via the exposition of human experiences, religious belief and socio-cultural motifs of that society within the imaginative framework of arts. Literature is also a librating force that frees us from the inherent ideas placed on us by society and it is categorized into three (3) generic forms; namely, drama, prose and poetry (Ibrahim and Akande 2000:3).</p> <p>The African experience of literature dates back to the pristine age of man and equally precedes the literature of some European countries (Dada 2003:36). In Africa the fact is established that there is the emergence of literature as part of cultural identity and revolutionary struggle against domination, marginalisation and political cruelty in African states like; Kenyan, Nigeria, Namibia, Mozambique, Angola, Uganda, Zimbabwe, South Africa Guinea Bissau etc. African writers in the decade of independence constituted the cultural nationalist movements with a view of treating African indigenous literature in its own right (Ojaide, 1992).</p> <p>Dada (2003: 36) maintains that “African literature refers to works done for the African audience, by Africans and in African languages whether these works are oral or written”. The debate of African literature over the use of language, diversity of culture and the question of literary identity indigenous to Africa are issues that has continued to generate significant interest ever since the emergence of modern African literary writings, thus, many scholars have made their inputs and positions.</p> <p>One of the major issues in modern African literature is language. The multi-cultural character of African language and the emphasis on the protection of individual people’s linguistic identity have emasculated the great dream of the total institutionalization of modern African literatures.  The question of identity and dignity in African literature in the writings of regional and national writers persists because of the prevailing socio-economic and political conditions in the continent and among the countries of the continent. Meanwhile, the language of African literature is another area of interests that has raised a lot of devastating issues among scholars and critics.</p> <p>According to Armah, (2005) Africa is vast and requires a vast language to put through all our ideals, and that language is not yet born”. Commenting on the language of African literature, Armah posited that “we are presently suspended in linguistic neocolonialism while awaiting a decisive breakthrough, if an African language is adopted, it will be a big solution. The demands of internationality, the question of communication with the world outside Africa and other issues such as accessibility and marketability of African literature in the global environment seem to have poisoned the dream of an African linguistic identity among African writers.</p> <p>Another issue to be considered in Modern African Literatures is the diversity of culture which is a dynamic phenomenon encompassing the totality of attitudes, behaviors, beliefs and world-views. It is an integral part of every human society and all social groups are characterized by it. In other words, it is that “complex pattern of behavior and material achievement which are produced, learned and shared by members of a community” (Ameh, 2002: 165). </p> <p>Another issue of discuss in modern African literatures is the attempt to create a racial identity. The role of ethnic pride and linguistic self-consciousness is not a quality of only majority ethnic groups. No matter how small the group, the sense of identity enshrined in the language of the group persists. For Yakubu, (2001) African literature is an enclave of freedom where the African re-conquers his lost identity and dignity.  This position seems to vividly capture the overwhelming impulses that characterize the motives of modern African literature writers.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>African literature emerged out of a need to fill a vacuum; that is the gap in African literature is centered on voicelessness. For many years, the discipline of comparative African literature has been overshadowed by the study of literary influences. This is because all African authors belonging to what is commonly called ‘Modern African Literature’ have come under the influence of Western – type schools of broadly two different categories namely; the study of analogy or literary affinities and the study of influences or indebtedness of diversity, language and culture has constituted a myriad of problem to African Literatures. It is against this background that the study seeks to find out the issues in modern African Literatures with particular reference to African diversity, language and culture using some selected African literary texts.</p> <p><strong>1.3     Aim and Objectives</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to examine all issues in every literary work. Specifically, the study objectives include the following;</p> <ol><li>to examine the Igbo Folklore of cultural matrix with reference to the creative works of Chinua Acbebe</li> <li>to evaluate male and female conflict as themes with reference to the works of Mariama Ba and Chiamanda Ngozi Adichie</li> <li>to analyze the hybridity of modern African Drama with reference to the works of Wole Soyinka and Sam Ukala</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4     Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>Over the years, many arguments have arisen on the existence of African literature. This study when completed will highlight the challenges facing African literatures from the pre-colonial past, to the colonial period, right to the present post-colonial age. It will describe the lives of the traditional Africans, their practices, ethos and mores, analyzes the conflicts that colonialism engendered in the system and discus the crises underpinning modern Africa literatures.</p> <p>Furthermore, it is hoped that when the study is completed, it will add to existing literatures and close knowledge gap with respect to background of African diversity, language and culture. It will also, educate, inform, entertain and document students, literary writers and educators researchers on the concept of the use of language and style in modern African literature. Finally, the findings that will be provided at the end of this research will be of great benefit to future researchers in this field of art and the humanities in general.</p> <p><strong>1.5     Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study is limited to examining some selected issues in modern African literature; specifically they include, the Igbo Folklore in Chinua Acbebe’s Things Fall Apart and Arrow of God. It examines also, male and female conflict as themes in Mariama Ba’s  So long a Letter and Chiamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus.

Technically put, posters are very important forms of visual communication. It presents picture(s) with meanings lying behind it. However, there exist some graphosyntactic errors, lexical, syntactic features and semantic features used in Christian handbills. The problem of grapho-syntactic errors contravene syntactic and graphological norms of the language and are not recognized as such by most people. The errors are gradually and unfortunately becoming standard forms of usage for most Nigerians. Ten (10) Christian handbills selected from ten (10) different churches were collected between January and May, 2016. The non-randomized method was used as the sampling technique while the research procedure employed analysis of linguistic aspects and features such as; graphological function, lexical, pragmatic tools, syntactic and semantic tools. Results obtained from this study revealed that Christian handbills play significant roles in effective communication. Hence, the findings from this study have become an instrument for achieving background knowledge in language of information as contained in Christian handbills.</p>\n\nDISCOURSE ANALYSIS OF CHRISTIAN HANDBILLS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DISCOURSE ANALYSIS OF CHRISTIAN HANDBILLS", "id": 33}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The paper carefully examines the effect of the Nigerian pidgin english on the academic performance of university students using University of Uyo as a case study.

British administrators did not make an effort to weld the country together and unite the heterogeneous groups of people. Though, many things we have today is due to their enlightenment, they still left us hanging. According to Adewele Ademoyega in his book Why We Struck 1981, he said that when the British came, they forcibly rubber-stamped the political state of the ethnic groups of Nigeria, and maintained that status quo until the left. According to him upon their departure nearly a hundred years later, the people resumed fighting for their political rights.</p> <p>        When the British came to Nigeria as an imperial nation to take over the rulership of the country from 1861 (with the cession of Lagos), they met the people of the south totally free, only observing and regulating their own monarchies and institutions (Adewele Ademoyega: Why We Struck). Chinua Achebe in his work or novel Things Fall Apart, 1958, tries to portray the life Africans lived before and during the arrival of the Europeans in Nigeria.</p> <p>        Things Fall Apart tells the tragic story of the rise and fall of Okonkwo and the equally tragic story of the disintegration of Igbo culture, symbolized by the agrarian society of Umofia, under the relentless encroachments of British Christian imperialism.</p> <p>        For Achebe, Mister Johnson represents the worst kind of portrayal of Africans by Europeans. To him, the portrayal was all the more disheartening because John Cary was working hard to achieve and accurate depiction, unlike many British authors during the imperial colonial period who deliberately, often cynically, exploited stereotyped of Africans and African society. It was precisely because John Cary was a liberal-minded and sympathetic writer, as well as a colonial administrator that Achebe felt the record had to be set straight. Achebe’s purpose then is to write about and for his own people. His first novels form a continuum over one hundred years of Igbo civilization. The Europeans have not yet penetrated Umuofia, the setting of the first novel, when Things Fall Apart beings. When the novel ends colonial rule has been established. His other novels talk about the different changes that took place before independence and after it.</p> <p>        The British governed Nigerian indirectly through their traditional rulers, as a result, the true leader of the masses hamstrung and held down. Just because Africans were given authority to rule over her own people, they saw it as a means to maltreat those that have wronged them, extort from those that have more than them and sell his/her own brother and sister for favours from the superior leaders - The British. (Adewele Ademoyega: Why We Struck).</p> <p>        These actions by the local and foreign leaders made the people to sort for independence. Many of them were not thinking straight any more. Many people now saw the need to transfer their faults to others using others as an excuse. The present leader blame the colonial masters and fore runners-for-independence for their actions for not doing what is expected of them well and also for the embezzlement and stealing of public funds. They claim that the colonial masters taught them to do so. The political elites in other to become rich and influencial in the society, steal and blame it on the economy and leaders. No one takes responsibility for his own crime and faults.</p> <p>        Between the politicians and the military they blame one another for a bad government no one agrees that the other is better than himself. In the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, people do all type of things just to steal from the petroleum companies they believe that it is their own right and bunkering which is a common business there is not stealing. That is why Tanure Ojaide uses his novel The Activist to enlighten the people of what is happening in the Niger Delta areas. He says those that claim to be literate in the society are the Chief Criminals sabotaging one another. Everybody in the country is in one way or the other suffering from the harms political corruption brought, we are psychosocial disordered.</p> <p>        Kole Omotoso in his fictions focuses on identifying the problems in Nigerian society and proposing solution. He lived his childhood and adolescence, sharing the nationalist dreams of peace, progress, and prosperity, as an adult and as a writer, he was forced to watch the systematic deferment of these dreams after independence for decades after freedom from colonial rule, Nigeria was cursed by civil strife, including a civil war (1967 – 1970) and incessant military coups d’etat. These events, together with undemocratic rule political chicanery and bureaucratic cynicism resulted in a steady decline in the quality of life in a nation that, because it is the most populous black nation on earth is often looked upon as representative of the black race. Omotoso tries to use fiction to talk about the decay and chaos in the society but he tries to make it less real like Armah did in his The Beautyful Ones are not yet Born.</p> <p><strong>1.1   Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>        Political corruption is the use of legislated powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain misuse of government power for other purposes, such as repression of political opponents and general police brutality is also considered political corruption.</p> <p>        Forms of corruption vary, it include: bribery, extortion, cronyism, nepotism, patronage, graft and embezzlement. While corruption may facilitate criminal enterprises such as drug trafficking, money laundering and trafficking, it is not restricted to these activities. While political corruption is an illegal abuse of power, psychosocial disorder is the mental reaction one gets from it.</p> <p>Psychosocial disorder is a mental illness caused or influenced by maladjusted cognitive and behavioural processes.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>        Due to the political dictatorship and the high rate of starvation and poverty in the country, many of the people are suffering from problems caused by the many ways they are treated and controlled.</p> <p>        Their manner of thinking have been blurred with the idea that if they steal or kill to survive, it is not a crime because their leader are also thieves who loot the national treasure and put is in their foreign accounts.</p> <p>        Again due to this, the citizens are psychosocially disordered and their minds corrupt. The key problem is the government. Because of the corrupt nature of the society, the government sells her pride and glory to foreign companies and enterprise. This people now treat the natural inhabitants of the areas where the companies are located like animals without dignity. Example is the Niger Delta area of Nigeria which is the oil producing state.</p> <p>The major problem is between the people and her government. Both are psychologically and socially sick. The pain of poverty and starvation in abundant money have destroyed the peoples mind that they no longer think or reason straight.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Aim and Objectives</strong></p> <p>The objectives of this research are;</p> <p>To identify the problems caused by political corruption and</p> <p>To provide suggestion to the prevention of political corruption and psychosocial disorder and find a way to eliminate it completely from the society in general.</p> <p><strong>1.4.

Importance should be attached to the level of performance of boys, girls school and co-educational secondary schools in English language. It is not often realized that the type of secondary school purely on the basis of sex can have a tremendous effect on student’s level of performance in English Language. This is more so, in a society like ours, where English is the language of instruction in schools. The language of trade and an accepted medium of communication in all facets of life.</p> <p>It is therefore, important to find out whether any relationship exists between secondary schools type, on the basis of sex and students achievement in English Language in West Africa School Certificate Examinations. This study considered schools in Egor Local Government Area.    </p> <ol><li>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</li> </ol> <p>It is common knowledge that some girl’s secondary schools are predominantly staffed by female teachers, while some boy’s secondary schools on the other hand are mostly staffed by male teachers. However, research has shown that female teachers pay greater attention to female students, while male teachers pay greater attention to male students in the process of classroom interaction. The findings in the area of mixed secondary schools are not at all clear. The fact that secondary school is purely girls or boys or mixed secondary school could affect student’s performance in English Language.     </p> <ol><li>DEFINITION OF RESEARCH PROBLEM</li> </ol> <p>Relationship between variables</p> <p>In a research of this type sex is a variable. Schools were broken down into three main categories.

Since this finding is consistent, other factors should be researched on in order to improve student’s level of performance of mixing staff and also mixing students of both sexes in boys as well as girls secondary schools.</p> <ol><li>DELIMITATION</li> </ol> <p>This study covers a population of thirteen secondary schools in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State.

Man lives in a hard and harsh environment where he struggles, toils and labours from day to day in order to survive. Every living thing on earth struggles for survival, both plants and animals. Plants struggle, searching for sunlight to survive. Even lower animals with low mentality struggle for survival. Human beings are not left out. A baby that is still in the womb struggles for food and searches for a way out during labour, to show that struggles of human beings start right from the womb.There are many types of struggles namely, political struggle, economic struggle, family struggle and so on. But all these struggles lead to one thing which is survival.The seventh edition of <em>Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary</em> defines struggle as “to try very hard to do there are a lot of problems”, while explaining s continuing to live or exist, often despite difficulty or dangers or something that       has   continued   to   exist   from   an the <em>Webster’s</em>enters<em>Dictiona</em>streuggle<em>y</em>greateffort to aslabor hard;“to us to strive; to contend forcibly; as Whereas all the above definitions are apt, we choose to align with an online posted material which adds to for food,   shelter,   clothing,   transport hand with success.</p> <p> Davil Salti, a Palestinian who lives in the Middle East says:</p> <p>The one who does not know the struggle of life is either an immature soul or a soul who has risen above the life of this world. The object of human being in this world is to attain to perfection of humanity, and therefore, it is necessary that one should go through what we call the struggle of life.</p> <p>Because life means a con success, failure, happiness or unhappiness mostly depends upon one‟s knowl Whatever be one‟s occupat one‟s knowledge,fonelackstheknowledgei of</p> <p>the battle of life, one lack the most important knowledge of all (www.goggles.com).</p> <p>As soon as man loses his courage to go through the struggle of life, the burden of the whole world falls on his head.   But he who goes on struggling through life, he alone makes his way.  One must study the nature of life; one must understand the psychology of this struggle.  In order to understand this struggle, one must observe that there are three sides to it:</p> </div> <p>struggle with oneself, struggle with others and struggle with circumstances. One person may be capable of struggling with himself, but is not sufficient; another is able to struggle with other, but even that is not enough. A third person may answer the demand of circumstance but that is not enough either. What is needed is that the three should be studied and learnt, and one must be able to manage the struggle in all three directions. The one who struggles with himself first s the wisest, for he has struggle with himself, which is the most difficult struggle. The other struggles will become easy for him.What is the nature of the struggle with oneself?  It has three aspects; the first is to make one‟s thought, one‟s own ideal,sametime givewhileexpression toatall thetheimpulses</p> <div>  <p> and desires which belong to one nature being. The next aspect of the struggle with oneself is to fit in with others, with their various ideas and demands. For this, a man has to make himself as narrow or as wide as the place that ask him to fill, which is a delicate matter, difficult for all to comprehend and practise. And the third aspect of struggle with oneself is to give accommodation to others in one‟ small as the demand may be.</p> </div> <p>When we consider the struggle with others, there are also three things to think about of which the first is to control and govern people and activities which happen to be our duty, our responsibility. Another aspect is how to allow ourselves to be used by others in various situations in life; to know to what extent one should allow others to make use of our time, our energy, our work or our patience and where to draw the line. And the third aspect is to fit in with the standards and conceptions of different personalities who are at various stages of evolution.</p> <div> THE CONCEPT OF THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST <p>This is a phrase originating in evolutionary theory as an alternative description of natural selection. The phrase is today commonly used in contexts that are incompatible with the original meaning as intended by its first two proponents, the British polymath Philosopher, Herbert Spencer (who coined the term) and Charles Darwin. Herbert Spencer first used the</p> <p>phrase “survivalt”afterof thereadingfittes<em>OntheOrigin</em>Charles <em>of Species. </em>In his<em> Principle of Biology </em>(1864), he draws parallels between his own economic theories and Darwi survival of the fittest which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called natural selection or the preservation of favored race in the</p> <p>In Amanda Ripley‟s<em>TheUnthinkable Who</em>book,<em>Survives When</em> <em>Disaster Strike –and Why</em>? Is outstanding account of real life scenario of</p> <p>people‟s struggle to survive diffe disasters. It also provides psychological reason why they act the way they</p> <p>do in this situation. The author discusses that during any type of disaster, a person travels through three phases: denial, deliberation and decisive moment. Reality is full of unforeseen events. The end results of these unforeseen events depend on the choice the person makes during the three phases the disaster occurred.</p> <p>Tess Penniston outlines three survival concepts he thinks could save</p> <p> life on his<em>Ready</em>web<em>Nutrition</em>”page(May“ 2010) as f responsibility for your own survival, second, sorely relying on someone else to save you is foolish and naïve, and third, train yourself to act without fear.</p> <p> Statement of Problem:</p> <p> At the moment, there exist innumerable literary assessment by scholars, especially the literary critics, on the creative works by African writers. The   volumes   of series“Africanandother   Liavailable critical works attest to this. Many books from the stable of many renowned creative writers have been given some levels of attention by critics.</p> <p>Nevertheless, much has not been done, at project level on themes of Binwell Sinyangwe‟s<em>ACowrie of Hope</em>. This informs the desire to work on this project, hence the theme of struggle and survival in Binwell</p> <p>Sinyangwe‟s<em>ACowrieofHope</em> and   Bessie<em>TheCardinals</em>Head‟s<em>.</em></p> <p>Purpose of Study:</p> <p> The main objective of this project work is to take a critical look at themes of struggle and survival in our primary texts namely, Binwell </p> <p>Sinyangwe‟s<em>ACowrieofHope</em> and Bessie<em>TheCardinals</em>Head‟s<em>.</em>Struggle for survival is what the organism goes through in order to survive in his chosen environment. This project is subjected to critical examination of how the characters struggle to wriggle themselves out of the harsh realities life bestowed on them.</p> <p> Significance of Study:</p> <p> The problem of struggle for survival is as old as the human race. The issue presents myriad of questions such as: Are we having pity against ourselves? Why must man struggle in order to survive? Why must there be much suffering and injustice? Many erudite scholars have dealt with these questions over the years. Different view and debates on the subject have tried often to offer a reasonable solution to the problems.</p> <p>Apart from adding to the already existing literature, this work through its illuminating insight is very significant especially in our contemporary time, where there is quest for breakthrough. It will serve as a veritable source of material for future researchers. It is hoped that it will continue to give a critical evaluation for better understanding of the nature of struggle and survival, especially as articulated in the two novels explored here. </p> <p>Scope of Study:</p> <p>The problem of struggle and survival is very complex. Its complexity is to the extent that a single researcher cannot be exhaustive. It is, however noteworthy that while acknowledging that there are other evaluations and appraisal of problem by other authors which can help in understanding and solving the problems of struggle and survival as it were, we shall limit our analysis and critical evaluation in this research work to the two novels, <em>A</em> <em>Cowrie of Hope </em>and<em> The Cardinals </em>by Binwell Sinyangwe and Bessie Head respectively.</p> </div> <p>Research Methodology:</p> <div> The basic sources of information for this project are the novels, <em>A</em> <em>Cowrie of Hope </em>by Binwell Sinyangwe and<em> The Cardinals </em>by Bessie Head.

In spite of this aberration, studies on the misuse of the English articles by Nigerian newspapers have been particularly rare. The aim of this is to assess the misuse of the English articles by Nigerian newspapers. The study attempts to answer research questions such as: In what manner do the print media deviate from established grammatical uses of articles?To what extent are the articles misused?To what extent does the misuse of the English articles inhibit effective communication in Nigerian newspapers?To what degree does the misuse of the English articles disconnect the relationship between nouns and articles? What are the reasons for the wrong use of the English articles by newspapers in Nigeria?In order to answer these questions, the researcher carried out an in-depth library research. The population for the study is all Nigerian newspapers, and the researcher selected a total of six editions from threenational newspapers: two of each. The data analysis showed that errors in the misuse of the English articles are prevalent in Nigerian newspapers, and these errors hamper effective communication. These findings suggest the necessity of employing better writers and editors on the part of the newspaper houses. The study concludes with suggestions for further research.</p> <p> Table of Contents</p> <p> CHAPTER ONE: Introduction</p>                 <p>1.1</p> <p>Background to the Study</p> <p>-</p>             <p>1.2</p> <p>Statement of the Problem</p> <p>-</p>             <p>1.3</p> <p>Purpose of the Study</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p>             <p>1.4</p> <p>Scope and Limitations of the Study</p>             <p>1.5</p> <p>Significance of the Study</p>               <p>1.6</p> <p>Research Questions</p> <p>-</p>               <p>CHAPTER TWO: Review of Relevant Literature</p>           <p>2.1</p> <p>Conceptual Framework</p> <p>-</p>               <p>2.1.1The English Articles</p> <p>-</p>               <p>2.1.1.1 Uses of the Definite Article</p>               <p>2.1.1.2 Uses of the Indefinite Articles</p>             <p>2.1.1.3 The Zero Article -</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p>             <p>2.1.1.4 The Stylistic Functions of the English Articles</p>         <p>2.1.1.5 The Role of Semantic Features in the Acquisition</p> <p>of the English Articles</p>                 <p>2.1.2 A Brief History of English in Nigeria</p>             <p>2.1.3 Writing and Newspapers in Nigeria</p>             <p>2.2</p> <p>Theoretical Framework</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p>             <p>2.3</p> <p>Empirical Studies -</p> <p>-</p> <p>-</p>                                     <p>CHAPTER THREE: Methodology</p>                  <p>3.1</p> <p>Research Design</p>                      <p>3.2</p> <p>Area of study</p>                      <p>3.3</p> <p>Population</p> <p>-</p>                      <p>3.4</p> <p>Sample</p> <p>-</p>                      <p>3.5</p> <p>Data Collection</p> <p>-</p>                    <p>3.6</p> <p>Method of Data Analysis</p>                    <p>CHAPTER FOUR: Data Presentation and Analysis</p>            <p>4.1</p> <p>Data Presentation</p>                      <p>4.2</p> <p>Data Analysis</p>                         <p>CHAPTER FIVE: Discussion of Results and Conclusion</p>            <p>5.1</p> <p>Discussion of Results</p>                    <p>5.2</p> <p>Summary</p>                    </div>\n\nTHE MISUSE OF THE ENGLISH ARTICLES IN SELECTED NIGERIAN NEWSPAPERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE MISUSE OF THE ENGLISH ARTICLES IN SELECTED NIGERIAN NEWSPAPERS", "id": 39}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Life is a battle for struggle and survival. Struggle and survival are as old as man. Every second, man is on the move, thinking of what to do and how to do it in order to survive. This project, therefore, examines the ways the two novelists presented their characters in their attempts to depict the various methods people adopt in their struggles for survival in this hard and harsh environment. This work also explores the artistic features as were conveniently deployed in their works by the novelists. (There are injustices in the world, because man is struggling for his survival and is important man should mind the way he go about this).</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><em><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></em><br/>Life is full of struggles. Man lives in a hard and harsh environment where he struggles, toils and labours from day to day in order to survive.<br/>Every living thing on earth struggles for survival, both plants and animals. Plants struggle, searching for sunlight to survive. Even lower animals with low mentality struggle for survival. Human beings are not left out. A baby that is still in the womb struggles for food and searches for a way out during labour, to show that struggles of human beings start right from the womb.<br/>There are many types of struggles namely, political struggle, economic struggle, family struggle and so on. But all these struggles lead to one thing which is survival.<br/>The seventh edition of Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary defines struggle as “to try very hard to do something when it is difficult or when there are a lot of problems”, while explaining survival as “the state of continuing to live or exist, often despite difficulty or dangers or something that has continued to exist from an earlier time” (1491). In a similar vein,<br/>the Webster’s Dictionary enters struggle as “to use great effort to labor hard; to strive; to contend forcibly; as to struggle to save one‟s life” (203).<br/>Whereas all the above definitions are apt, we choose to align with an online posted material which adds that “survival is meeting your basic needs for food, shelter, clothing, transport and health care”. Survival goes hand in hand with success.<br/>Davil Salti, a Palestinian who lives in the Middle East says:<br/>The one who does not know the struggle of life is either an immature soul or a soul who has risen above the life of this world. The object of human being in this world is to attain to perfection of humanity, and therefore, it is necessary that one should go through what we call the struggle of life. Because life means a continual battle. One‟s success, failure, happiness or unhappiness mostly depends upon one‟s knowledge of the battle. Whatever be one‟s occupation in life, whatever be one‟s knowledge, if one lacks the knowledge of the battle of life, one lack the most important knowledge of all (www.goggles.com).<br/>As soon as man loses his courage to go through the struggle of life, the burden of the whole world falls on his head. But he who goes on struggling through life, he alone makes his way. One must study the nature of life; one must understand the psychology of this struggle. In order to understand this struggle, one must observe that there are three sides to it:<br/>struggle with oneself, struggle with others and struggle with circumstances. One person may be capable of struggling with himself, but is not sufficient; another is able to struggle with other, but even that is not enough. A third person may answer the demand of circumstance but that is not enough either. What is needed is that the three should be studied and learnt, and one must be able to manage the struggle in all three directions. The one who struggles with himself first is the wisest, for he has struggle with himself, which is the most difficult struggle. The other struggles will become easy for him.<br/>What is the nature of the struggle with oneself? It has three aspects; the first is to make one‟s thought, speech and action answer the demands of one‟s own ideal, while at the same time give expression to all the impulses and desires which belong to one nature being. The next aspect of the struggle with oneself is to fit in with others, with their various ideas and demands. For this, a man has to make himself as narrow or as wide as the place that ask him to fill, which is a delicate matter, difficult for all to comprehend and practise. And the third aspect of struggle with oneself is to give accommodation to others in one‟s own life, in one‟s own heart, large or small as the demand may be.<br/>When we consider the struggle with others, there are also three things to think about of which the first is to control and govern people and activities which happen to be our duty, our responsibility. Another aspect is how to allow ourselves to be used by others in various situations in life; to know to what extent one should allow others to make use of our time, our energy, our work or our patience and where to draw the line. And the third aspect is to fit in with the standards and conceptions of different personalities who are at various stages of evolution.</p> <p><strong><em>THE CONCEPT OF THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST</em></strong><br/>This is a phrase originating in evolutionary theory as an alternative description of natural selection. The phrase is today commonly used in contexts that are incompatible with the original meaning as intended by its first two proponents, the British polymath Philosopher, Herbert Spencer (who coined the term) and Charles Darwin. Herbert Spencer first used the phrase “survival of the fittest” after reading Charles Darwin‟s On the Origin of Species. In his Principle of Biology (1864), he draws parallels between his own economic theories and Darwin‟s biological ones, writing “This survival of the fittest which I have here sought to express in mechanical<br/>terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called natural selection or the preservation of favored race in the struggle for life” (vol. 1 p 444).<br/>In Amanda Ripley‟s book, The Unthinkable Who Survives When Disaster Strike – and Why? Is outstanding account of real life scenario of people‟s struggle to survive different challenging situations, especially disasters. It also provides psychological reason why they act the way they do in this situation. The author discusses that during any type of disaster, a person travels through three phases: denial, deliberation and decisive moment. Reality is full of unforeseen events. The end results of these unforeseen events depend on the choice the person makes during the three phases the disaster occurred.<br/>Tess Penniston outlines three survival concepts he thinks could save life on his web page “Ready Nutrition” (May 2010) as first taking responsibility for your own survival, second, sorely relying on someone else to save you is foolish and naïve, and third, train yourself to act without fear.<br/>Statement of Problem:<br/>At the moment, there exist innumerable literary assessment by scholars, especially the literary critics, on the creative works by African writers. The volumes of “African Literature Today” (ALT) series and other<br/>available critical works attest to this. Many books from the stable of many renowned creative writers have been given some levels of attention by critics.<br/>Nevertheless, much has not been done, at project level on themes of Binwell Sinyangwe‟s A Cowrie of Hope. This informs the desire to work on this project, hence the theme of struggle and survival in Binwell Sinyangwe‟s A Cowrie of Hope and Bessie Head‟s The Cardinals.<br/>Purpose of Study:<br/>The main objective of this project work is to take a critical look at themes of struggle and survival in our primary texts namely, Binwell Sinyangwe‟s A Cowrie of Hope and Bessie Head‟s The Cardinals. Struggle for survival is what the organism goes through in order to survive in his chosen environment. This project is subjected to critical examination of how the characters struggle to wriggle themselves out of the harsh realities life bestowed on them.<br/>Significance of Study:<br/>The problem of struggle for survival is as old as the human race. The issue presents myriad of questions such as: Are we having pity against ourselves? Why must man struggle in order to survive? Why must there be<br/>much suffering and injustice? Many erudite scholars have dealt with these questions over the years. Different view and debates on the subject have tried often to offer a reasonable solution to the problems.<br/>Apart from adding to the already existing literature, this work through its illuminating insight is very significant especially in our contemporary time, where there is quest for breakthrough. It will serve as a veritable source of material for future researchers. It is hoped that it will continue to give a critical evaluation for better understanding of the nature of struggle and survival, especially as articulated in the two novels explored here.<br/>Scope of Study:<br/>The problem of struggle and survival is very complex. Its complexity is to the extent that a single researcher cannot be exhaustive. It is, however noteworthy that while acknowledging that there are other evaluations and appraisal of problem by other authors which can help in understanding and solving the problems of struggle and survival as it were, we shall limit our analysis and critical evaluation in this research work to the two novels, A Cowrie of Hope and The Cardinals by Binwell Sinyangwe and Bessie Head respectively.<br/>Research Methodology:<br/>The basic sources of information for this project are the novels, A Cowrie of Hope by Binwell Sinyangwe and The Cardinals by Bessie Head. Secondary materials are from the internet, library and journal articles.</p>\n\nSTRUGGLE AND SURVIVAL IN A COWRIE OF HOPE BY BINWELL SINYANGWE AND THE CARDINALS BY BESSIE HEAD<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STRUGGLE AND SURVIVAL IN A COWRIE OF HOPE BY BINWELL SINYANGWE AND THE CARDINALS BY BESSIE HEAD", "id": 40}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This studies an investigation into academic indiscipline and failure among secondary school students (English language mathematics, Igbo, Agric, Economics. period 2005-2011 (a case study of Nigeria) the population of the study consists of five subjects in senior secondary school in Nigeria. A total of nine thousand seven hundred and fifteen (9,7,15) students and about 200 members of the staff were involved. Ten students from each class (JSS1-SSIII) were selected by proportionate stratified random sampling techniques to ensure that relevant features of the population were adequately represented for the second set of sample (staff) the same techniques was used to selected five staff from each school. The instrument used for the data collection was a structured questionnaire section ‘A’ contained personal data of the correspondent eg Name, sex, qualification etc while section ‘B’ contained the structured questionnaire items. The items were structured to reflect four point rating scale of strongly agree (SA), Agree (A) strongly Disagree (SD), and disagree and others like response category. The researchers personally administered the questionnaire. The response code and values are shown below, used in calculating the mean using the formula. </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>Background of the Study </strong><br/>According to Oxford Advanced learners Dictionary (7th editions) failure is lack of success in doing or achieving something. It is pertinent (relevant) to know that everybody in every works of life is afraid of failure. According to America Heritage (R) Dictionary, failure is lack of discipline or restraint (control) while failure to fulfill promise is called indiscipline. <br/>Indiscipline is a rudimentary ingredient that plays a crucial role in school system, which Insist on upholding the moral values of students. It comprises a wide spectrum of meaning, well from the negative or positive perspective i.e a particular attitude towards something i.e view point. However, it is human immune to always focus on the negative smell and that would be considered a popular issue if it involves an individual or a group that claims an intimate relationship (close relationship) within a society. <br/>Schon, D. (1993) aptly states that every child has a need to attend school. Schools are seen as provider of education as education is an important process that each individual has to undergo in life today. Thus, education is seen as the key to unlock the treasure prove of knowledge i.e valuable things that are found hidden or whose owner is unknown student’s misbehaviour is a prevailing problem affecting schools not only in Nigeria but also across the many countries around the Africa. <br/>Students misconduct in the classroom interferes with teaching and learning and is thought to be precursor to later school dropout and similar negative social out-comes. Student’s behaviour problems are also thought to be a leading contributor to teacher’s stress and attrition (Making somebody weaker). Teacher’s subjected to abuse report experiencing fears for their intense feeling of anger, humiliation or shame, Isolation and depression. <br/>Some teenagers may never reveal the nature of the incident or it’s impact on them in such cases, the confidence of the teachers has been undermined, his/her sense of personal safety related and the perpetration has not been conditioned.<br/>Salvin, R.E (2003). One of the most wide-spread reasons for bad discipline however is usually students inability to cope with the task. The noisiest students will demonstrate their frustration by loud outburst (a sudden strong expression of an emotion), disruptive behaviour (causing problems, noise), will the rest of the class may remain passive (Stermbery, R.J &amp; Williams, W.W.(2002). Basically, discipline problems occurs when a students refuses to obey rules of the classroom or school. <br/>A close investigation on why our students fail in their Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (SSCE) especially on English language, Mathematics, Igbo language, Economics and Biology will reveal the fact that most of the students, susceptible i.e influenced or harmed to failure are those who indulge in academic indiscipline such as truancy, lateness to school, fighting, vandalism (crime of destroying or damaging something) and others. Sometimes, some school principals and class teachers will dabble (to take part in an activating) into malpractice just to help the students. However, they do it so that the society will see them as committed and hardworking teachers in their schools. The knowledge that the teachers will offer them helping during examination leads to students to relax, instead of being serious with their studies. <br/>The researchers are not happy because academic indiscipline is rapidly putting down the wall of education in our country. It ponders in the mind of the researchers the type of doctors, engineers, lawyers, accountants that will be produced in our nation in the next five-ten years. Onah, J. (2008). According to Dewey in philosophy of education he emphasized on learning, by doing’. <br/>The child has to do something”. He has to get involved in order for learning to be meaningful. <br/>Moreover, rules that deal with human actions will eventually be broken and require some sort of punishment. Rules must also relate to the stated function of education or the school process and again, common sense must prevail in establishing disciplinary action for breaking a rule.Furthermore all students must be aware and prudent of the rules before disciplinary action can be administered. Franken, R.E (1998) parent and schools share the responsibility of promoting values and standards which we hope will help younger people to establish sound behavioural codes for their lives.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem </strong><br/>Education is the bedrock of development of any country. This is the reason why the integral part of our budget goes to education. The government is fighting very hard to shake off the under-development. How much was voted for education budgets. <br/>Academic excellence is everybody’s wish for himself and his relations. During the colonial days some people know the efficacy in education. <br/>It is with dismay (a worried, sad feeling) to observe the damaged academic indiscipline has done to our schools even our secondary schools which the preparatory stage of higher education. <br/>Teachers are not coping well with the implementation of the curriculum, hence the low achievement of the product of secondary schools illiteracy, innumeracy (unable to court or do simple mathematics) and basic skills. <br/>The value system in the country has made everybody to be corrupt. Lack of adequate infrastructural facilities such as teaching aids, buildings, transport, water and power supplies etc have led to academic indiscipline and failure among secondary school students.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Purpose of the Study</strong><br/>It is ideal to investigate into academic indiscipline and failure among secondary school students based on these objectives:- <br/>a. To critically define indiscipline and failure in secondary schools. <br/>b. To investigate into the causes of academic indiscipline and failure into our schools.<br/>c. To recommend possible ways of cubing academic indiscipline and failure among secondary school students.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Significant Of The Study</strong><br/>This study would be of immense help to the secondary school students as it would investigate clearly why our students are involved in academic indiscipline and why they fail woefully in their examination. It will also want to find out positive and lasting solution towards their being made better examination candidates especially in compulsory subjects like English language, Igbo language, Agric Science,, Economics and Mathematics. <br/>The entire society also stand the chance to benefit immensely because the students in secondary schools will be equipped to take their Senior Secondary school Certificate Examination (SSCE) confidently which will in long them lead to sufficiency.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Research Questions </strong><br/>1. Does frustration cause academic indiscipline?<br/>2. Can failure cause the student to dropout from school. <br/>3. Is the teacher a role model to the students?<br/>4.Do some secondary school administration encourage examination malpractice? <br/>5. Does broken home make a student to be aggressive <br/>6. Have the child’s background have any contribution to his behaviour at school.<br/>7. Can lack of confidence lead to failure.<br/>8. Teaching the students with precepts (principles) and examples can it help to combat indiscipline? <br/>9. How did the students perform in these subjects from 2005-2010?<br/>10. Which one did they perform better or worse? <br/>11. What are the possible reasons for their performances?</p> <p><strong>1.6 Scope of the Study </strong><br/>The study is deliminated to five subject in senior secondary schools in Nigeria. <br/>These subjects are: <br/>1. English language <br/>2. Mathematics<br/>3. Igbo language <br/>4. Agriculture science <br/>5. Economics</p> <p><strong>1.7 Definition of Terms </strong><br/>Academic indiscipline involves all those undesirable attitudes exhibited by students in the schools. Examples; bullying, fighting, stealing, poor attitudes to schools activities, vandalism etc. <br/>1. Truancy: According to NTI, NCE (2001) Education cycle 4, truancy is an act of staying away from school without good reason or permission and students who involve in this act is called truant. A times, they leave the school to stay in a hide out playing, gambling (the activity of playing games of chance for money and watching movies. <br/>2. Bullying: A bully is someone who use his strength or power to hurt or frighten people. He enjoys oppressing others weaker then himself.<br/>3. Vandalism: According to oxford Advanced learners Dictionary) it is the crime of destroying or damaging something, especially public property, deliberately and for no good reason. <br/>4. Malpractice: The dishonest use of a position of trust for personal gain. It is an act of ommission or commission which comprises the validity, reliability and integrity of any examination. <br/>5. Failure: It is lack of success in doing achieving something. <br/>6. Indiscipline: Failure to fulfill promise.<br/>7. Rudimentary: Means basic clearing with only the most basic matters and ideas. </p>\n\nAN INVESTIGATION INTO ACADEMIC INDISCIPLINE AND FAILURE AMONG SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS IN (ENGLISH LANGUAGE MATHEMATICS, IGBO LANGUAGE, AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE, ECONOMICS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN INVESTIGATION INTO ACADEMIC INDISCIPLINE AND FAILURE AMONG SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS IN (ENGLISH LANGUAGE MATHEMATICS, IGBO LANGUAGE, AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE, ECONOMICS", "id": 41}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This study is focused on the causes of examination malpractice among secondary school students in Enugu Education zone of Enugu State. It had become a general view to accept that the last two decades have witnessed high rate of several incidents of examination misconduct; more especially at post primary education level. According to Olatunbosum (2009); every examination witness the emergence of new and tactful ways of cheating during examinations, contrary to the normal view which assumes that examination is a formal test of somebody’s knowledge or ability in a particular subject; especially by means of answering questions or practical exercises. For detailed analysis, the above topic had been discussed under various headings and sub-headings which are categorized into chapters. For instances, chapter one introduces the subject matter of the research work; chapter two is mainly literature review, in which, the interest of students towards their studies as well as availability of teaching facilities among other things were discussed. Chapter three discuss the research methodology, while chapter four and five were based on data analysis and representation, discussion on findings, summary of findings, conclusion, implications of the study, recommendation as well as suggestion for further study.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRDOUCATION</strong></p> <p>Background of the study<br/>Sulaiman (2008) opined that one of the objectives of education in Nigeria is to prepare the young one to face future challenges and develop them to meet the nation’s man power requirements. He also opined that schools need to conduct examinations as yard stick for assessment. According to him, examination is a formal test of some body’s knowledge or ability in a particular subject; especially by means of answering questions or practical exercises. Examination is also seen as the process through which students are evaluated or tested to find out the quality of knowledge they have acquired within a specified period of study.</p> <p>According to Olujuwon (2004), the Nigeria educational system is in a state of confusion and disarray. This is as a result of inconsistence and non-implementation of educational policies, corruption and corrupt practices perpetrated by the stake – holders. There had been a clarion call by all and sundry to re-examine and appraise the educational system in line with current trends.</p> <p>Aisha, (2009) is of the view that examination malpractices have consistently remained a bane of Nigeria educational system. Most foreigners say that the academic certificates being issued to graduates in Nigeria are no more valuable than the pieces of paper on which they are printed. In the opinion of Aisha (2009), Examination malpractice is an illegal behaviour by a candidate before, during or after the examination so that he/she attains success easily and cheaply. Sulaimon (2008) is of the view that examination malpractice is a kind of conduct that violates the acceptable laid down rules and regulations of Nigerian Institutions. He further explained that examination malpractice is any wrong doing before, during or after any examination.<br/><br/>According to Suleimon (2008), education, which is a very important tool of nation building, is not given the adequate attention it deserves; as the sector is not funded adequately, no proper plan and policies that will provide the kind of leadership that is required in the sector to enable the system achieve the desired objectives. Teacher’s welfare is not properly taken care of, public schools are left without basic infrastructural development needed to stimulate learning, no proper monitoring; as most of the examination bodies are not closely monitored. So, examination malpractice has become world- wide problem, for instance, a Ghanianian, Rex Annan, Kumasi of 13th April, 2007 explained that in recent times in Ghana, the occurrences of examination malpractice had assumed an alarming trend; and that was invariably due to candidate fear of failure, lack of confidence, laziness and inadequate preparation and most often their inability to apply themselves to their studies.</p> <p>However understood the examination malpractices had become a world-wide problem among students, the researchers are seriously concerned in making effort to discover the cause of this problem-especially among: secondary school students within Enugu educational zone of Enugu state, Nigeria.</p> <p>Oluyeba and Daramola (1992) in their own view believe that examination malpractice is an irregular behaviour exhibited by-Candidates or anybody charged with the conduct of examination inside <br/>Or outside the examination hail before, during or after such examination. This view was upheld by Azinge (1993) as well as Imogie (1993). Ahmed (1993) believed that an examination malpractice is any act of wrong doing or neglect that contravenes the rules of acceptable practices before, during, and after an examination by anybody in any way tantamount to malpractices.</p> <p>Shonekan (1993) sees it as irregularities, when are premeditated and perpetuated by the candidates or their agents with the intention of gaining undue advantages in the examinations. Afigbo (1993) opined that the problem of examination malpractices in Nigeria seems to be as old as the-introduction of formal system of education in Nigeria. According to him, the first major incidence of examination malpractices was in 1914, when the senior Cambridge local examination leaked. This scenario took an unprecedented surge in 1963, 1967, 1977, 1981 and 1987, when two public examinations leaked.</p> <p>These leakages then attracted the attention of the federal government, which led to the promulgation of Decree 27 of 1973, and miscellaneous Decree 20 of 1984 to curb examination malpractices; and later the Decree prescribed 21 years jail term for offenders.</p> <p>In the opinion of Olujuwon (2004), these and other measures put in places still do not deter people from engaging in examination malpractices. In WAEC conducted examinations in 1991, 30, 982 students were involved in examination malpractices while 35, 479 students were reported in 1992 as being involved in examination malpractices as published by national dailies then.</p> <p>With reference to Olujuwon (2004), investigations conducted by the national concord of Tuesday, June, 1998 revealed how teachers helped students to engages in examination malpractices by coaching them before examination day. This trend according to the report is being used by the schools involved to improve their position in the performance tables, which have become a key indicator for parents choosing a school for their children as WAEC examination centre.</p> <p>Infact, authorities had also suffered as a result of students involvement in examination malpractices; for instance, in the year 2002, during the University matriculation examination (UME) conducted by the joint admission and matriculation board (JAMB), the board cancelled the result of about 46, 448 candidates, allegedly involved in examination malpractices, as confirmed by (people’s choice magazine vol. 1 no 8 of 2002).</p> <p>Nwadiani (2005) opined that the value and functionally of any educational system lie in its ability to actualize the goals of education. </p> <p>In educational systems, world over, the examination process makes the difference. The goals of national education system and indeed national development become like a mirage, if examination ethics are not encouraged and instituted. According to him, till today, examination still remain the best tool for an objective assessment and evaluation of what learners have achieved after a period of schooling.</p> <p>Thus, any action that undermines examination poses a great threat to the validity and reliability of examination results and certification. Nwadiani (2005) opined that it is very unfortunate that the process of examination in Nigeria secondary schools has become a “contemporary shame.” He opined that this is because of the phenomenon of examination malpractice that has become endemic in the education system. He defined examination malpractice as a process in which students cheat in the examination hall.</p> <p>Additionally, the examination malpractice Act (1999) explains “examination malpractice as any act or omission or commission by any person who in anticipation of, before, during or after any examination, fraudulently secure any unfair advantages for himself or any other person in such a manner that contravenes the rules and regulations to the extent of undermining the validity, reliability, authenticity of the examination and ultimately the integrity of the certificates issued.</p> <p>Oluyebe and Daramola (cited in Alutu and Aluede, 2006) remarked that examination malpractice is any irregular behaviour exhibited by a candidate or any-body charged with the conduct of examination before, during or after the examination that contravenes the rules and regulations governing the conduct of such examination. In agreement with Omoluabi and Uzoka, citied in Atutu and Aluede, (2006) the value system in Nigeria has broken down completely and so adults and youths alike act without moral scruples. This is exactly why examination malpractices still thrives despite its grave consequences on the social, political and economic structure of the nation.</p> <p>The examination malpractice Act No. 33 of 1999 stipulates a minimum punishment of N50,000( Fifty Thousand Naira Only), and a minimum of five years imprisonment, without option of fine, for – violators of the offences stipulated in the act. The offences are: cheating at examinations, stealing of question papers, impersonation, disturbances at examinations, obstruction of supervision, forgery of result slip, breach of duty, conspiracy and aiding, etc.<br/>Government, examination bodies and other concerned citizens have made a lot of efforts to forestall the incidences of examination malpractice and the problems associated with the conduct of examinations in Nigeria.</p> <p>Although the efforts seem to be yielding some positive results, yet incidence of examination malpractice still feature prominently in the school system. Thus, in 2006, the federal ministry of education black listed and derecognized 324 secondary schools across the nation as centres for conducting public examination from 2007 to 2010 because of their involvement in examination malpractices. (Weekend times, 17th and 18th Feb. 2007 page 4). </p> <p>Distribution table of examination malpractice in Nigeria secondary schools.<br/>ZONE NO OF SCHOOL INVOLVED PERCENTAGE %<br/>North - Central 54 16.6<br/>North – East 08 2.5<br/>North – West 12 3.6<br/>South – East 48 14.8<br/>South – South 116 36.0<br/>South – West 86 26.5<br/>TOTAL 324 100</p> <p>SOURCE: Weekend Times, 17 &amp; 18th Feb. 2007 page 4. The above table shows the prevalence of examination malpractice in secondary schools in Nigeria. It could be observed that examination malpractice occurs in all geo – political zones in the country, with the south – East geo – political zone placed in the 4th Position of the zones with high number of schools involved in examination malpractice.</p> <p>And it is necessary to note that Enugu Education zone is one of the educational zones within Enugu States which is equally one of the states within the south – east geo –political zone of the country.</p> <p>However, it is very unfortunate that the phenomenon of examination malpractice seems to be aggravated by large scale of shameful involvement of dishonest and greedy teachers, school heads, parents and all those who take part in admission of examination (Ijaiya 1998).</p> <p>In the opinions of Badmus, (2006) and Aminu (2006) the phenomenon of examination malpractice is influenced by many factors which include lack of confidence as a result of inadequate preparation, peer-influence, societal influence, parental support and poor facilities in schools.</p> <p>Writing in the same vein, Awanbor (2005), Nwadiani – (2005), Okafor (2006) Ayua (2006) and Azara (2006) identified school programmes, teaching / learning environment, the teacher, over – value of certificates, decadence in the Nigeria society and parental support as some factors responsible for examination malpractice in Nigeria educational system.<br/><strong>Statement of problem:</strong><br/>The ever continued cry of increased examination malpractices in our secondary schools hall become a very serious problems to every reasonable and responsible – citizen. Lack of staff disciplinary measures coupled with commitment by parents in particular had become the major problem that is invariably threatening the survival of students’ academic excellence in our schools.</p> <p>With reference to Suleimon (2008), the examination bodies, to an extent constitute problems that cause examination malpractices in our secondary schools. According to him, W.A.E.C, N.E.C.O, JAMB and other examination bodies in Nigeria are major players in the perpetration of examination malpractice. He opined that most of the private schools which WAEC or NECO give centres are haven for the perpetration of examination misconduct.</p> <p>He is of the view that in most cases, some WAEC external invigilators are bought over and as a result, all sorts of illegitimate activities could be going on in those centers, all these activities really constitute to a very large extent; the problems which the researchers wish to unravel which underscores the need for the study.</p> <p><strong>Purpose of the study </strong><br/>In fact, the primary objective of this study is to discover the causes of examination malpractices among secondary school students in Enugu education zone of Enugu State. Therefore, bearing the above background in mind, the researchers are specifically interested in using the study to find:<br/>i. The interest of students towards their studies <br/>ii. Availability of teaching aids or teaching facilities.<br/>iii. The effect of parental influence as one of the factors that cause examination malpractices.</p> <p><strong>Significance of the study</strong><br/>The significance of the study manifests itself both practically and theoretically. For instance, Olatunbosu (2009) opined that a society that places exceptionally strong emphasis on goal achievement; without a corresponding emphasis on institutionalized means of achieving these goals, is bound to exert pressures on some members of the society that may eventually resort to the use of any technically expedient means in achieving these goals; irrespective of whether the means employed is legitimate or not.</p> <p>It is very significant to note that Olatunbosun’s ideology is the basic societal concept as far as examination malpractice is concerned. Presently, there has been nation-wide out cry of examination misconduct at all levels of institution of learning. These had been series of new paper reports as well as radio broadcast on the subject.</p> <p>Consequently, this study is very significant because the researchers are hoped to discover the major causes of examination malpractices; especially among secondary school students within Enugu Education zone of Enugu State among other things. They will also discover the general effects of the problem and will as well detect the expected remedy; of which there is strong hope that at the end of the research work, the findings and recommendations by the researchers should be of much benefit to the students and the post primary school management board (PPSMB) of Enugu State.</p> <p><strong>Scope of the study </strong><br/>It is the desire of the researchers to cover the whole secondary schools within Enugu Educational zone; but due to some financial difficulties and time constraints, they wish to limit the study to only (5) five secondary school within Enugu Education Zone.</p> <p><strong>Research Questions</strong><br/>In order to carry out this research work in respect of the cause of examination malpractices among secondary school students in Enugu Education zone very effectively, the following research questions had been put forward.<br/>i. To what extent the interest of students towards their studies lead to examination malpractices among secondary school students in Enugu Education zone?<br/>ii. To what extent lack of teaching aids or teaching facilities cause examination malpractice among the secondary school students in Enugu Education Zone?<br/>iii. How does the societal need for paper qualification and parental influence contribute to examination malpractices among secondary school students in Enugu Education zone?</p>\n\nCAUSES OF EXAMINATION MALPRACTICE AMONG SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CAUSES OF EXAMINATION MALPRACTICE AMONG SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS", "id": 42}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This study was on the factors associated with mass failure of students in the English language in secondary schools in Nsukka L.G.A of Enugu State. Using simple random sampling procedures, the researchers drew 128 students and 50 teachers from nine state owned secondary school of Enugu State.<br/>Questionnaires were used to elicit information from the respondents- Teachers and students on the problems associated with mass failure of secondary school student in English language in WAEC Examinations. The questionnaire items included qualification and experience of the English teachers, the methods they adopt in teaching the subject, the materials available to them foe use in teaching the subject, the influence of the vernacular language in student learning of the subject and home environment.<br/>In analyzing the data collected, means scores were used to answer the research questions. The results showed among other things, that the teachers knowledge of teaching the subject is not updated often times and that there is absence of teaching facilities in most of the schools while vernacular language and home environment have negative impacts, towards the students’ the findings, recommendations were made and implications were highlighted. This was followed by suggestion for further studies, summary of the study and conclusion. </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.1 Statement of the Problem </strong><br/>Perhaps not much attention has been given to the performance of students in junior secondary school subjects in recent years. This neglect, no doubt has relegated this junior subjects to the background in our junior secondary certificate examination. A close look at the 2004/2008 JSSCE result records, confirms that students’ performance has been very poor generally and the increase number of school dropout in the area of study is a clear pointer of the theme. The poor performance is caused by many factors such as; students ineffective study techniques, quality of teachers and method of teaching, the parent’s inability to provide useful materials like textbooks, exercise books and school fees and problem of inadequate instructional materials for teaching and learning of English language in schools.<br/>In philosophical view of these causes, this study therefore is specifically designed to assess the factors associated with mass failure of English language in junior secondary school certificate examination in Igbo-Etiti Local Government Area of Enugu State.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Purpose of the Study </strong><br/>The main purpose of this study is to find out the factors associated with mass failure of English language in junior secondary school certificate examination. The interests of the researchers are to examine critically and identify the factors associated with mass failure of English language in junior secondary school certificate examination specifically, the study sought to find out if:-<br/>1. There are sufficient numbers of qualified English language teachers and instructional materials for teaching of English language.<br/>2. The previous socio-economic background of the students affect them in studying English language.<br/>3. The attitude and interest of students towards the nature of English language contribute deeply to their mass failure in JSSCE especially in English language.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Significance of the Study</strong><br/>The student will be able to appreciate the importance of the effective domain like interest and motivation in improving their performance. With this awareness, the student might put up a positive attitude towards English language which will increase their performance and enhance higher grades in junior secondary school certificate examination. Teachers will also be able to adjust their teaching methods and offer remedial helps where they find out that students are putting up a low attitude. State government will also see the need of guidance and counseling in each schools, the ministry of education and curriculum planners for better organization of junior subjects in education.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Scope of the Study</strong><br/>The scope of this study was focused on the factors associated with mass failure of English language in junior secondary school certificate examination in Igbo-Etiti Local Government Area of Enugu State. Due to military factors such as time and other resources and the inconvenience of handling a large scope, the researchers focused only on junior English language.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Research of the Study </strong><br/>To carry out a detailed study of the research, the following research question will guide to study:-<br/>1. Are there sufficient numbers of qualified English language teachers and instructional materials for teaching English language?<br/>2.

The aim is to know how the mother tongue affects the learning of English language in Secondary school especially in four selected schools in Enugu North Local Government Area of Enugu State. The targeted population for the study was 500 but collection was questionnaires. The questionnaires were distributed to the four schools selected in Enugu North Local Government Area of Enugu State. The data were analyzed using percentage. The following were the researchers findings. That teachers of English language in Enugu North do not have teaching aids in their various schools visited. That students are hardly fluent in English language. That most of the English language teachers are not qualified that students are hardly buy books in English language. That most students are very poor in understanding some of the English language vocabularies. In view of the above, the researcher recommends that teachers should be made to make use of correct teaching method in teaching of English that mother tongue should be restricted as stipulated by the national policy on education 4th edition. That student should be taught and made to speak English language always. That teachers of the English language should be made to ensure that at least every student is carried along in the classroom lesson. That qualified teachers should be employed.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:<br/>Background of the Study.</strong><br/>Language is a creation which every human being is endowed with or blessed; a unique gift of language is used naturally as one tool of expression consisting of different sub skills. <br/>The English language is the official and native language of Britain, Ireland, North America, Australia, America and most of the British colonies, (for the colonies, it is regarded as the official language rather than native). It is commonly divided by periods into Anglo-Saxon, or old English (about 450-1100 Bc), Middle English (about 1100 to 15Bc) and modern English (from 1500 to date).<br/>Mother tongue is one’s native language. A language besides being the major distinguishing phenomenon between man and other creatures is evidently the most enduring of every people’s cultural heritage. It reflects the culture of a people and it is in extricable bound up with it.<br/>Language is an important tool that enhances human communication and interaction. It is a vital instrument in cultural transmission and preservation of a social group. It is in a fundamental sense, a crucial tool in the preservation and propagation of the human species. An examination of the linguistic content of a particular speech community can provide information about the life style, occupation etc. of a given people.<br/>The English language beings the national official language for the British colonies of which Nigeria is among makes it our second language. Hence, our respective mother tongue exists before colonization. This has necessitated the teaching and learning of the English language and its consequent interference in our mother tongue in various study points nation wide. It is therefore, glaring to state that, Nigeria is a linguistically complex society by the mere fact of the history of its creation. It is estimated that there are between 250 and 400 language spoken in Nigeria (INTER NET).<br/>This linguistic heterogeneity promotes the continued use of English in Nigeria. Ethnologic include English amongst its list of Nigeria language this hardly supervising since the role of English language in Nigeria diverse and ubiquitous, especially as a means of intra and inter national communication. It is as a result of the negative effects which the mother tongue had caused the study of English language on the educational structures of the attempt to determine the effect of the use of mother tongue on the teaching and learning process in secondary schools.<br/>Statement of the Problem.<br/>Before the advent of British traders, missionaries and colonialists, indigenous Nigerian language defined every aspect of the speech community from its religious, cultural, political, Economics, social to whatever else that can be through of the language functioned effectively to deal with every thing relating to the day existence of the people. The arrival of the British, concomitant with the English language provided a language contact situation with an attempt to a language shift in the population.<br/>New sets of ideas, concepts and values were introduced to the system where indigenous local language had previously been self-sufficient, rendering them inadequate to deal with the new concepts introduced by the British, particularly in the areas of formal education, Western law etc. the result was the initial subtle and later blatant intrusion &amp; influence of English language on domains that were the exclusive preserve of indigenous language.<br/>Now, the English language is generally an accepted language which was introduced into Nigeria through colonialism and missionary activities is now spoken, thought and learned in Nigeria.<br/>Where English language sentence are made, they are characteristically uttered with variation in pitch often referred to as intonation. This is often an area of difficulty for second language, users of English language who have tonal? Language as their first language. This is one of the major problems encountered by learners of English language. Other areas of problem encountered are’, Sentence and word stresses, vowel sounds and English suprasegmental of pitch. The study intended to identify the effect of mother tongue in the study of English language in senior secondary schools in Enugu North Local Government Area of Enugu State. <br/>Significance of the Study:<br/>This study will help to expose the numerous factors that influence the interference of the study of English language by the mother tongue or native languages. It will also identify the effects of this interference on other study area that are based on the use of the English language as the basic communication.<br/>This study will enable teachers to identify their problems in English language. This study will also enable student to understand how to make use of English words especially in pronunciation, intonation and phonetics. It will also enable the teachers to make more research on the use of English language. <br/>Since English language has been used as a second official and some times even as a foreign language in Nigeria for along time and give the inescapable behaviour of language in contact, it is normal to expect it to have factors which can identify it as bonafide subject, dialect, variely or idiom of world English. These may be seen as research findings relating to interference, derintation and creativity as are seen to obtain among speakers. In Nigeria. English is now the term Nigerian English is used to refer to the subject of English spoken or written by Nigerians, it is commonly known that the features of Nigerians English language, like those of other new English, are essentially inherent particularly at the early stages of learning by the mother tongue features.<br/><br/><strong>Purpose of the Study:</strong><br/>1. To find out the level at which mother tongue can interfere in the learning of English language in secondary school.<br/>2. To investigate the qualifications of English teachers in secondary school in Enugu North. <br/>3. To know how teachers makes use of correct methods in teaching of English language in secondary school in Enugu North <br/>Reasarch Question <br/>1.

This will go along way at giving direction to the research work.<br/>These includes:<br/>MOTHER TONGUE: The native language one first learns to speak before other language.<br/>INTERFERENCE: In this context, interruption of a language by another especially in pronunciation and intonations.<br/>ANGLO-XASON: A person whose an cestors were English.

Information was sought through primary sources such as questionnaires were used in data collection. The findings of the research work were presented in tabular form and analyzed using simple percentage. The purpose of the study is that, to find out if there are enough language laboratories available for effective teaching and learning of the English language in secondary schools. Their significance, is to provide invaluable information to the government, the Nigeria Educational Research center, the curriculum planners. The design of it is to determine the impact of the Language Laboratory on effective teaching and learning of English Language in secondary Schools. The population of the study were 25 teachers in number and there was no sampling. Administration of instrument and data collection are primary data and secondary data. The information instrument used for this research study. The supervisor approved the questionnaire before we used it. <br/>Everything was gotten as a result of hard work and since the Enugu North Local Government Area was interviewed by the researchers are reliable personal and their contribution has helped the researchers to carryout the research work effectively, method of data analysis, the researchers got their information from newspapers.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/>Background of the Study </strong><br/>In one sense, we are being educated all the time, to the extent that everything that happens to us may bring about some changes in the way we feel, think, act and obviously the way we speak. We learn from the things we hear, from the circumstances in which we live, the people we meet, ideas in books or papers. In fact everything that surrounds us and of which we experience is educating us and our children all the time.<br/>For the process of education to function effectively, the school curriculum is taken into consideration. Therefore, curriculum is the term used to indicate a group of subjects or field of study arranged in a particular sequence. According to Puckett (1979) Curriculum is the selection, organization and administration of a body of subject matter designed to lead the pupil on the same definite life objective.<br/>In spite of the fact that so many aspects of man’s knowledge compete today for inclusion as subjects in the school curriculum, at least one modern language continues to maintain the right to a place in the secondary school curriculum. All those who believe that the study of a modern language other than one’s own has an important part to play in the development of the adolescent, a part which perhaps today is even more essential than in the past, are content that this should be so. It has been observed that in theory and practice whenever circumstances allows the advantages inherent in such a study are beneficial to children in secondary schools.<br/>Language according to Webster’s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language: Is the body of wards and systems of use common to a people who are of the same community or nation, the same geographical area or the same cultural tradition. Language is human speech either spoken or written. Whenever there is a human society, there is language. Most forms of human activity depend on the co-operation of two or more persons. A common language enable human beings to work together in an infinite variety or ways. <br/>Lieberman (1984) argues that human language is built on a biological based that is present in other primates, and that both humans and animals have innate neural mechanisms which are matched to their respective sound producing mechanisms. Yet most linguists will readily agree that only human’s have language proper and that the possession of language put humans at considerable advantage compared with other species.<br/>English is one of the major languages out of about 5000 estimated language spoken in the World. About 200 years ago, English was simply the language of less than 15 million peoples. Today, however, English is used by more than 300 million people and second only to Chinese as regards the number of people using a particular language. English is one of the most influential and fast growing languages spoken across the globe. <br/>One fifth of the earth’s land surface use English either as native tongue or official language. Of the entire world’s languages, English is the most widely studied language; especially in areas where it is not native. Today, English is used in several countries in the American continent including the United States of America and Canada, New Zealand, Republic of South Africa, Australia and Canada, New Zealand, Republic of countries in the Wes African subcontinent. Though English was actually the language of colonization in these countries, like India colonized territories.<br/>In other countries including Japan and China English is usually taught as the chief foreign language. Equally about half of the world’s scientific and technical journals, as well as newspapers, are printed in English. The spread of English is further enhanced through the establishment of British Council and United States information service by the British and U.S. governments respectively with centers and libraries in various countries including Nigeria. All these factors have therefore made it easy for anyone who understands and speaks English, and moves around major cities in the world to communicate effectively with one another. <br/>According to Anibueze, (2007), English Language is a lingua franca. As lingua franca, it is the Language for unification. It is highly established so that the people of varied languages will have purposes to relate together mutually and work in union. For example, Hausa man may comfortably stay and effectively speak with a Yoruba man or an Igbo man, and vice versa. <br/>The English Language had remained a very important tool for socialization and bureaucratic activities in Nigeria, since the days of colonialism. It was only natural that emphasis was laid on spoken English only and either on written English or both of them. However, with the emergence of a new class of people, with time, the civil servants, and their new roles in the colonial administration, the teaching and learning of the language took another form. <br/>Today, English is the Language for the international community, according to Ezugu (1998), the English Language is the most widely spoken language in the world. It is used as either a primary or secondary language in many countries. It is the language of education, administration, law, world trade, international diplomacy as well as that of cultural. <br/>It is, therefore worth while acquiring mastery of this very important language for whoever does not, has deprived himself of access to the world’s brightest ideas and modern technologies. <br/>In Nigeria today, English remains the language of pedagogy, students can hardly make commendable progress in their studies without adequate mastery of English through which most of the course in primary, secondary and tertiary institutions are taught and examined. <br/>This calls for a system that would be both rudimentary and functional its approach.<br/>This is important for according to Umaru (2005) as a student learns a new Language, very often he does not know how to express what he wants to say in writing.<br/>Since the student uses a foreign Language as a medium of communication, he has to start from the scratch to learn the rudiments of the Language. It is natural then that this is the function where the various problem arising then that this is the function where the various problem arising from the teaching and learning of the Language meet the need to do so properly.<br/>Language Teaching, according to Oluikpe (2005) stated that the basic criteria for assessing students’ proficiency in writing and speaking are generally control of the basic grammatical categories such as punctuation, tense, number, gender etc. Language Teaching in Nigeria had fought with deficiencies. The major reason for these deficiencies is our English teacher who are not well-trine only but are also non-professionals. And even if they are somewhat trained, their training is rooted in to the work. A situation where a teacher of the language has no mastery of its grammatical categories, as we see today, does not mean well for the system. Also writing on these problems facing Language teaching, according Regner et al (2001) ascertained that “many good teacher are adaptive rather than rigid in their approach to teaching children and only loosely base on their instruction on a given method.<br/>Language is the official medium of communication of humans, it is one of the things that differentiate man from animals. Signs and symbols have no international understanding and may be difficult to understand. Picture, painting and sculptures cannot be read by all. This makes Language superior to all of them because it is easily understood and generally used. According to Ozohili (2007) Language literally means the “tongue” a human organ used in speaking. Traditionally, language is defined as system of arbitrary vocal symbols by which thoughts are communicated from one being to another. <br/>Language Learning; Human beings have the ability to learn and to understand and think about things. He has the capacity to gain and use knowledge. He can as well explore situations, collect information, plan and execute the plans. Man’s high intelligence has also enabled him to evolve a level of linguistic communication by which life can be regulated. Theodore (2001) stated that Language learning requires thoroughly time, patience and practice. It cannot be done solely in school with the large class but requires few minutes of daily practice for individual students.<br/>Therefore pupils, and students should be encouraged to practice this language in their leisure in order to master the language as required. <br/>Methodology: The methodology here refers to the method by which the teacher presents his materials to the learners and engages them in the task at hand.<br/>Methodology is very vital in every teaching-learning situation. For according to Robert (2003) for effective teaching and learning to take place, the skillful teacher needs to use the many different methods and techniques at his command. Even though there is a great diversity in teaching methods and techniques there is no one of them that can be regarded as the best for every teaching situation. This is however assumed that carefully designed teaching method can work wonders in making learning more effective. <br/>The teaching materials: The teaching materials involves the dominance of textbooks, dictionaries, chalk boards work books. (which are rarely used) and posters in the teaching of English Language in secondary schools in Enugu North Local Government Area of Enugu State has been counter-productive. Modern media such as: audio and video tapes, Language Laboratories, programmed texts, flash cards, computers, magazines and newspaper are not in use. These findings agree with those of Kolawole (2000) who found that with many problems, such as inadequate and useful resources. <br/>Modern language laboratory is really one of the newest media that is making a lot of impact in our educational scene. The language laboratory is an audio or audio-visual installation used as an aid in laboratory each student is able to replay one track of a tape and at the same time record his response on another track. He is then able to rewind the tape to listen to both the master track and the recording to his own response comparing the two recordings.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong><br/>The problem of this study is to find our f the language laboratory has an impact on effective teaching and learning of English Language in secondary schools. <br/>The most serious problem confronting learners of a second language is that the language is not widely used in their immediate environment. As a result, the learner has no exposure to the language of his immediate environment has many teachers made up of the people with whom he interacts daily. The second language learner has to make up for out-of-school opportunities to learn.<br/>In most cases, teachers who teach second languages are themselves not native speakers. So they neither speak the language fluently nor intelligibly. But they are not to be blamed because of the interference of the mother tongue.<br/>The researchers, therefore, deemed it necessary to find out the impact of the language laboratory n the teaching and learning of English language.</p> <p><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong><br/>The aim of this research is to highlight the impact of the language laboratory on effective teaching and learning of the English language. <br/>1. To find out if there are enough language laboratories available for effective teaching and learning of the English language in secondary schools.<br/>2. To find out the major inputs of the language laboratory on the effective teaching and learning of English language as it affects the teachers of the language in secondary schools.<br/>3. To find out the major impact of the language laboratory on the effective teaching and learning of the English language as it affects the teacher trainee of the language in secondary school.<br/><br/><strong>Significance of the Study</strong><br/>Findings from this study will provide invaluable information to the government, the Nigeria Educational Research centre, the curriculum planners, because through this research an awareness will be created for the installation of language laboratories. <br/>The research is expected to enable teachers of the English language to identify problems and becomes aware of the factor that hamper the teaching of English and how to deal with them. Students will also be aware of their major “road blocks” to speaking and be able to find means of overcoming them.<br/>Finally, findings from this study will be to all those involved in the teaching of English language in Enugu North and country at large.</p> <p><strong>Scope of the Study </strong><br/>This study is limited to investigating the impact of language laboratory on effective teaching and learning of English language is some selected schools in Enugu North<br/>The study is limited to the availability of language laboratories, the qualification of English teachers and the teaching methods, the impact of the language laboratory on students performance, and finally the mother tongue interference.</p> <p><strong>Research Questions </strong><br/>1.

In a good communication, there are three important aspects. These include the person giving the information, the message that is to be passed and the receivers.<br/>According to Wikipedia Encyclopedia, instructional refers to the practice of maximizing the effectiveness, efficiency and appeal of teaching and learning experiences. The process consists broadly of determining the current state and needs of the learner defining the end goal of instruction and creating some “intervention” to assist in the transition of knowledge. Instruction may be aimed at teaching learners problems solving skills, thinking and reasoning skills including perception memory, language etc. many would agree that people learn better when they can build on what they already understand known as “schemes” but the more a person has to learn in a shorter amount it is to process that information in working memory.<br/>Dick and Carcy (2004), presented an instructional model which addressed instruction as an entire system, focusing on the inter-relationship between contest, content, learning and instruction. According to Han, the component such as the instructor, learners, materials, instructional activities, delivery system, learning and performance environments interacts with each other and work together to bring about the desired student learning outcomes.<br/>Horaby (2001), defined problem as anything that is difficult to deal with or to understand, therefore the problem associated with the use of instructional materials in teaching and learning processes could be centered on its misuse with the set objectives. It could be regarded as obstacles against the smooth process of communication with the learners. According to Ashby (2001), performance refers to how well or badly somebody do something; meanwhile instructional problem affects the academic performance of the students. If the processes used in communicating with the students is not smooth or the instructional material is misuse with the set objective, then the students will perform negatively. Instructional problems therefore are those obstacles that pose difficulty in dealing with in the process of communicating skills, attitudes and values to the learner.<br/>These obstacles which among others include:<br/>Methodologies: According to Abdullahi (2009), methodologies employ in any teaching matters in that it acts as a driver that drives the instructions to the learner.<br/>Meanwhile if wrong methodology is employ to a particular instruction while teaching it present confusion to the learner.<br/>Wrong usage of the Instructional Materials with the set Objective: The set objective is a point of focus of the teacher while teaching. Akinsoba (2009) added that the usage of instructional material should be done in accordance with the set objective otherwise it leads the learners far from what they ought to understand on a particular topic. <br/>Improvisation of Instructional Materials: According to Dahar, M.A., Faize, F.A., Nywaz, A. and Dahar, R.T., (2010), improvisation is making something or someone using whatever is available usually because you do not have what you really need. It presents obstacle to communicating skills, attitudes and values improvisation does not suit the topic because improvisation are made when there is no instructional materials. Okeke (2009) stressed on the need to provide adequate instructions for the teaching and learning of English language.<br/>Lack of Instructional Materials: Some of the topics being treated or thought in English Language do not lend themselves to usage of instructional materials. Onuigbo (2003) outline some of the topics in English Language that do not lend themselves to instructional materials, these include word stress, sentence stress, intonation and the second system of English. Nelson-Jones, R. (1996) published an influential taxonomy of what he termed the three domains of learning; cognitive (what one knows or think), psychomotor (what one does physically) and affective (what one feels or the attitude one has). These taxonomies as stated by him are what instructional material touches, so any topic that does not have instructional materials cannot reflect to the cognitive, psychomotor and affective domain of the learners. Sweller (2006), measured the effects of working memory load, and found that lack of instructional materials has a direct effect on the performance of the learners.<br/>Language of Instruction: The language used while teaching with instructional materials matters. Langdon (1998) added that the outcomes of this instruction may be directly observable and scientifically misused or completed and assumed when it is used with wrong language. Languages of instruction have far reading implications on the performance of the students in various areas. One of the areas is in School Certificate English language. Poor performances have been recorded in School Certificate English Language in recent times. According to Richard (1999) the poor performance of students could be attribute to misuse of instructions, wrong application of methodologies to reflect to cognitive, psychomotor and Affective domains of the learners. It will not be out of place for one to blame these poor performances on the instructional process. Poor performance in school certificate English language is an unacceptable development in the students’ carrier.<br/>In this study, instructional problems associated with the poor performance of student in school certificate English language will be determine, with particular reference to those in Enugu North Local Government Area of Enugu State.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Problems</strong><br/>The aim of instruction is to inculcate into learners, the ability to build on what they already understand. Instructional problems are those obstacles that pose difficulties in dealing with in the process of communication skills, attitudes and values to the learners. The problems which among others include; the language of instruction, methodologies, lack of instructional materials with the set objectives and the problem of improvisation of instructional materials; These problems effect of the academic performance of the students. It was on this ground that the researchers choose to write on the instructional problems associated with the poor performance in school certificate English language by students in Enugu North Local Government Area, Enugu State.</p> <p><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong><br/>The purpose of the study is to find out, the instructional problems associated with the poor performance in English Language by students in Enugu North. Specially, the study aims to find out:<br/>1. The extent to which poor methodologies pose problems to instructions while teaching English Language.<br/>2. The extent to which lack of instructional materials pose problem in teaching of English Language.<br/>3. The extent to which wrong use of instructional materials contribute to poor performance in English Language.</p> <p><strong>Significance of the Study</strong><br/>The usefulness of this research work in the educational system cannot be over emphasized. If the result of the study is properly utilized, it is going to be of benefit to the students, teachers and policy makers.<br/>The research work will help to educate students on the instructional problems associated in teaching and learning English Language.<br/>The study will disclose to the teachers the obstacles that pose problem in dealing within the process of communicating skills, attitude and values to the learner.<br/>The study will also disclose the topics that do not have instructional material, so that the government can help and make provision of such materials.</p> <p><strong>Scope of the Study</strong><br/>The study focuses on the instructional problems associated with the poor performance in school certificate English language by students in Enugu North Local Government Area, Enugu State.</p> <p><strong>Research Questions</strong><br/>The following research questions were formulated to guide the study.<br/>1. To what extent does poor teaching methodology pose problems in instructions while teaching English language?<br/>2. To what extent does lack of instructional materials affect the teaching of English Language?<br/>3. To what extent does wrong usage of instructional materials contribute to the poor performance of students in school certificate English Language? </p> \n\nINSTRUCTIONAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE POOR PERFORMANCE IN SCHOOL CERTIFICATE ENGLISH LANGUAGE BY STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INSTRUCTIONAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE POOR PERFORMANCE IN SCHOOL CERTIFICATE ENGLISH LANGUAGE BY STUDENTS", "id": 46}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This research work focus on the investigation of the causes of student’s failure in Mathematics and English Language in West African School Certificate (WASSCE) Examination in Enugu Education Zone. Their possible remediations were also sought. In other words, this work is aimed at finding the factors that contribute to the student’s failure in Mathematics and English Language in West African School Certificate (WASSCE) Examination in Enugu Education Zone and suggesting solution on how to remedy them. Three research questions and four hypotheses were formulated and tested. Literature on all forms of services and teaching were extensively reviewed. The study employed survey design. A sample of hundred respondents including teachers and students were drawn for the study. Data collected were analyzed using percentages for the research questions and chi-square (X2) for testing the hypothesis. Using the results from the analysis, it was found out that some teachers of Mathematics and English language were not qualified. The number of periods allocated for the two subjects are inadequate. Based on our findings, we therefore recommended among others that; Government should employ qualified teachers to teach the students in secondary schools. The teachers should teach the students with enough teaching materials/ aids. There should be adequate periods allocated for the two subjects. Governments should award scholarship to all trainee teachers reading for degree courses in mathematics and English language. There should be constant teacher’s supervision in the schools to ensure teachers dedication to duty. </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>Mathematics is a field of study that comprises of various areas. Some of which deal with abstract concepts which cannot be easily related to our day to day experiences. These abstract concepts need to be clearly explained and followed step by step by the teachers to ensure a proper understanding of the said concepts. Mathematics like every other field of study is built upon fundamental laws and principles and once a student of mathematics has a weak foundation on the basic principles, it becomes difficult for such a student to understand the subject (Mohammed and Luka, 2009).<br/>The importance of mathematics cannot be over emphasized, in that mathematics is a central issue for educationists, and it is most applicable to every discipline. Everybody needs are involved in mathematics process everyday. Mathematics is already playing an important role in the filed of engineering, science, medicine, computer, infact in everyday life (Douglas, 2007).<br/>Mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields, natural science, social science etc. and this is one of the reasons why higher institutions in this country placed emphasis on credit pass in mathematics before they offer provisional admission to the students into a good number of disciplines. <br/>To all eminent scholars in the world over and Nigeria in particular, to all economic planners and politicians, to all potential employers and to the ordinary public, mathematics is a subject of articulate purpose and structure. Despite all the emphasizes placed on the importance of mathematics, one observes that students still perform poorly in the subject. Mathematics curriculum has suffered sudden shifts of emphasis between its traditional and modern aspect (Nwosu, 2007).<br/>Another all important subject is English Language. English Language is that set of grammatical and lexical forms which are typically used in speech and writing by educational native speakers.<br/>English Language is the principal means of human communication. It is a number one for the transmission or exchange of knowledge ideas and feelings. It is used for interpersonal, intergroup and international relationships and also provides better understanding among friends and co-operation. Without the knowledge of English Language, effective communication would be impossible once one leaves one’s region for another, mostly in Nigeria.<br/>English Language is invaluable to our lives and that is why it is taught and made compulsory in primary schools, secondary schools and higher institution in Nigeria.<br/>It is obvious that without the knowledge of English Language-it would be difficult to study other subjects such as history, geography and even mathematics. Despite all the emphasis placed on the importance of English Language. The researchers observed that students still perform very poor in the subject especially in West Africa Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE).<br/>According to statistics released by Federal Ministry of Education as was recorded in the Daily Sun of Monday, May 12 2009, one out of the ten students who took mathematics between 2005 and 2008 passed. In 2008, only 24, 366 or 11.44% of<br/>473, 534 passed mathematics and also in English Language, only 104,232 or 8.9% of 401.385 candidates of who wrote the English Language Examination in School Certificate Examination passed. Seeing the importance of these two subjects: Mathematics and English Language, then why the mass failure that are recorded in West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE). This is precisely the objects of this research to highlight the pros and cons therein. <br/><strong>STATEMENTS OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>The development of any nation depends on their scientific and technological advancement which can be built on a sound mathematical education capable of making effective function in nature (Edward, 2008). <br/>English Language is the principal means of human communication; it is a tool for the transmission or exchange of knowledge, ideas and feelings. It is used for interpersonal, intergroup and international relationships. Without the knowledge of English Language, effective communication would be impossible once one leaves a region for another (Lehamann 2007). <br/>The importance of mathematics and English Language cannot be over emphasized. It is due to the high esteem placed on mathematics and English Language that made them to be compulsory subjects for both Primary and Secondary Schools. A credit pass is one of the prerequisites for entering higher or tertiary institutions. So many students who fail these two subjects; mathematics and English Language are very hopeless today because they cannot go any further educationally and so cannot contribute to the development of our beloved state, Enugu Nigeria. Regardless of the importance of mathematics and English Language, Students in the secondary school still perform very poorly especially in West African senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE). This ugly situation has given the researchers much concern. The problem of this study therefore is to identify the root causes of this massive poor performance in these two subjects, mathematics and English Language and to suggest solutions on how to remedy the situation.<br/><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>The purpose of this project is to find out the factors that contributed to the student’s poor performance in Mathematics and English Language in West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) In Enugu Education Zone and to profer possible remedy.<br/>Specifically, the Researchers Sought to:-<br/> Determine whether teachers of the two subjects are adequately qualified.<br/> Determine whether teacher’s methods of teaching affect the learning of those subjects.<br/> Determine whether the students are taught with teaching aids/resources to quicken their understanding.<br/> Determine whether student’s attitude towards these subjects is poor. <br/> Determine whether the books recommended to the students are appropriate.<br/> Determine whether the school environment is really conducive for teaching and learning.<br/> Determine whether the educational curriculum is effectively and properly made. <br/> Determine whether the teachers who teach these subjects frequently give class exercise on it to know if the specific objectives are achieved at the end of the lesson.<br/> Determine whether government do provide adequate materials or facilities like computer, adequate text books etc. for better teaching and learning.</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>i) What are the problems teachers of mathematics and English Language encounter in teaching that relates to the present poor performance in mathematics and English Language in West Africa School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) in Education zone?.<br/>ii) What are the place of instructional materials in terms of teaching and learning mathematics and English Language? <br/>iii) What are the problems students of mathematics and English Language encounter in terms of teaching and learning as relates to the present poor performance in mathematics and English Language in (WASSCE)?</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS </strong><br/>1. Ho: There are enough and suitable facilities in schools for effective teaching and learning. <br/>H1: There are not enough and suitable facilities in schools for effective teaching and learning.<br/>2. Ho: All mathematics and English language teachers are professionally qualified for teaching. <br/>H1: All mathematics and English Language teachers are not professionally qualified for teaching. <br/>3. Ho: Mathematics is so hard that people do not like to study it.<br/>H1: Mathematics is not so hard to study<br/>4. Ho: Recommended textbooks for the student are difficult for them to understand at their level.<br/>H1: Recommended textbooks for the student are not difficult for them to understand at their level.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY </strong><br/>The research on the identification and remediation’s of the causes of students poor performance in mathematics and English Language in West African senior School Certificate Examination will be highly valuable and beneficial to everybody especially the present students in secondary school in Enugu Education Zone and also to other secondary schools in some other area who might have been facing similar problems. The teachers on the other hand would through this research know the best way of programming their students as to ensure that students grow up to the art and science of mathematics and English Language right from their tender years and also help the children to build a passion for these subjects. Thus, this would result to excellent performance in the field of mathematics and English Language. Also the government would through this research know the importance of providing teaching facilities like computers, adequate textbooks, projectors in the classrooms etc. to schools for adequate teaching and learning.<br/>Finally, the curriculum planners would through this research, identify some aspects of the curriculum to be revised or enhanced.</p> <p><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The research work is primarily concerned with identification and remediation of the causes of student’s poor performance in mathematics and English Language in West African senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) in Education zone. </p>\n\nIDENTIFICATION AND REMEDIATION OF THE CAUSES OF STUDENTS POOR PERFORMANCE IN MATHEMATICS AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN WEST AFRICA SENIOR SCHOOL CERTIFICATE EXAMINATION WASSCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IDENTIFICATION AND REMEDIATION OF THE CAUSES OF STUDENTS POOR PERFORMANCE IN MATHEMATICS AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN WEST AFRICA SENIOR SCHOOL CERTIFICATE EXAMINATION WASSCE", "id": 47}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Comparative study of student performance in WAEC biology, chemistry and English from 2004 – 2008 in Enugu North Local Government Area.<br/>In this study the researchers want to know to what extent the student performance in English varies from the student’s performance in biology and to what extent the student performance in English vary from chemistry. This has motivated the researcher towards reviewing all the related literature necessary on the performance of the student in WAEC. The population of the study is all the candidate that took chemistry, biology and English in WAEC from 2004 to 2008 in Enugu North Local Government Area in Enugu State, four (4) school were selected for this study which are:<br/>1.

Education ought to be growing as a profitable industry with prime objective of maximizing profit by delivering high quality education that produces well educated, skilled and manned student according to needs and requirement of the dynamically growing market. There are two group of student as generally perceived. That is those who improve and those who don’t improve. This student performance can be affected by different factors such as learning abilities because new paradigm about learning assumes that all student can and should learn at higher levels, but it should not be considered as constraints because there are other factors like race, gender, sex that can affect students performances (Hansen 2000).<br/>Meshiachoudis (2001) explained the effect of age, qualification and distance from learning place on the student performance. Qualification in his explanation concerns the readiness of student in joining a particular discipline in the school for instance a student that is not capable of doing science in the secondary school joins science because his/her friends are offering the subject.<br/>Kirby (2002) added that the academic performance of student is also affect by student impatience. Yronne (1998) further elaborated that student academic performance is very much dependent on SEB (Socio-economic background) as per his statement secondary school student performance is with satisfically significant different.<br/>Alexander (2001) explained that some of the practice adopted by secondary school administration can also influences their academic performance, such practice like club, media and culture clubs etc. Meanwhile, looking at the fact that our main focus of this writing is to compare how student perform or the performance of student offering biology, chemistry and English in Enugu North Local Government Area from 2004-2008. You find out that most of the subject are science subject (biology and chemistry), which involve student who are brain is sharp and hot, not student who’s I que is low and cannot perform or solve any mathematic problem rather they move to the simplest subject that they can perform better (i.e. English language etc). That is why when you go into all this clubs mention above you find out that most of the student there are not in science class. Science student don’t have time and chance for all this because of their mathematical involvement reflecting to point out that they do not have time for grammer”. But of a truth that they do not have chance of joining some of the above mentioned practice (clubs, cultural groups and media) which is of great help to passing English Language in WAEC as it is well known that most of the essay in WAEC are debts. Articles and letter writing of which the English student do well in the subject because they joined the practice.<br/>According to Bello an Abuja based educationist a member of all Nigeria Committee of principals of secondary schools ANCOPSS. The truth is that the reading culture in Nigeria is generally poor. To make it worse, these days most of our student hardly read listed they waste their precious time watching television or films, listening to music, playing video/computer games.<br/>Another educationist, MOhmud (2009) attributed the dismal performance in WAEC examination to the lactadaisical attitude of the government and its refusal to adequately fund the education sector. According to him on several occasion we clamoured for improved budgetary allocation to the education sector but all these have fallen on deaf ears. For instance UNESCO recommend that 26 percent of any country’s budget should be allocated to the education sectors, but instead what do you have in Nigeria? Government paying lip service to education sector, other countries who understand the importance of education have taken, proactive steps to adequately fund their education sector. For instance Ghana has allocated 29 percent to its education sector, even for more than the UNESCO recommendation. The same thing with South Africa and but ward who allocated 35 percent and 57 percent respectively to their education sectors. So until these thing are implemented we would continue to montage the future of our children.<br/>Comparative study refers to the comparism of different capabilities or abilities of different groups or individual of the same or different categories wikipedia (2009). Comparative study of the performance of student in WAEC in biology, chemistry and English language from 2004-2008 deals with comparing the performance ability of student in biology chemistry and English language.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong><br/>The comparision of student performance in WAEC has been a confusing issue even to WAEC body as the case may be taken a close instance as regard this confusion. WAEC could not present the highest or the best performed student in WAEC each year as they use to do formally as at 1990. This day results are released without comparism and grades to enable student really know their level of performance when compared to the subjects, that is why these study focuses on identifying the following;<br/>1. Comparing the performance of student in biology and English language in WAEC from 2004-2008.<br/>2. Comparing the performance of student in chemistry and English in WAEC from 2004-2008.</p> <p><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong><br/>The main purpose underlying the project is to investigate the performance of the secondary school student in WAEC taking their comparative performance on Biology, Chemistry and English Language from 2004-2008 in Enugu North Local Government Area. The study specifically seeks to determine.<br/>a. The performance of student in WAEC Biology and English from 2004 – 2008 in Enugu North.<br/>b. The performance of student in Chemistry and English language from 2004-2008.</p> <p><strong>Significant of the Study</strong><br/>The usefulness of this research work in education system cannot be over emphasized of the result of the study is properly utilized, it is going to be benefit to the student because it will enable them to really know their performance in WAEC in some subject like chemistry, English and biology etc to either improve on those subjects. The research work is of great importance to the WAEC officials themselves in that it will enable them to know the impact of taking a comparative study of the student performance in WAEC in years interval as this study tries to examine the performance of student in WAEC in biology, chemistry and English language from 2004-2008.<br/>It will also help the government to know the area which the student are lacking behind and to solve the problem that brings about such lapses.<br/>It will at the same time be of help to parent so that they know the subject area which their children perform more better.</p> <p><strong>Scope of the Study</strong><br/>The study was based on secondary school student performance in WAEC in biology, chemistry and English language and restricted to Enugu North Local Government in Enugu State from 2004-2008.</p> <p><strong>Research Question</strong><br/>1. To what extent do the students’ performance in English varies from their performance in biology in 2004 – 2008.<br/>2. To what extent do the students performance in English varies from their performance in chemistry in 2004-2008.</p> <p>Hypotheses<br/>The following hypothesis was tested for this study.<br/>1.

These authors include Greenwood (2001) Nwanna Nzewunwa (2003) and Adekeye (2008) more specifically; it was emphasized in the works of these authors that the use of instructional materials is a sine qua non in affecting behavior of learning’s of every field, especially basic science.It was equally shown by some of the authors that these materials are important catalysis of social re-engineering and changes; according to the researcher, it is found that basic science teaching and learning cannot be well accomplished without the use of instructional materials.Advanced in technology have brought instructional materials especially theprojected and electronic materials to the forefront as the most radical tools of globalization and social development which have affected the classroom teaching-learning situation positively. The availability of instructional material in teaching and learning of the student, have made both teaching and learning become very pleasant to basic science teachers. A study by Owolabi (2004) revealed that the performance of Nigerian students in ordinary level basic science was generally poor. This was attributed by the author to many factors of teaching strategy, teaching strategy itself was considered as an important factor. Jegede et. al (1992) reported factors responsible for students’ academic performance in learning of basic science. The factors can be said to be poor laboratory facilities, inability of the basic science teachers to put across ideas clearly to the students and inadequate number of learning facilities in school in Igbo Etiti local government area of Enugu state. Basic science cannot be fully taught without the availability of instructional material; the teaching of basic science without learning materials will certainly result to poor performance in the course. <br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The relevance of education in any society cannot be understood. It is regarded as the single potent factor that leads to the improvement of the individual as well as the society. The need to provide basic formal educational instructional material in teaching of basic science in secondary school in Igbo Etiti L.G.A of Enugu. The lack of availability and the credibility of instructional material in teaching of basic science in terms of effectiveness and appropriateness of instructional material have remained a major problems and issues of interest in Igbo Etiti local government area. <br/>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The objectives of the study are;<br/>1.    Assess instructional technology tools available to teachers at secondary school in Igbo Etiti local government area of Enugu state.<br/>2.    Determine instructional material used by teachers.<br/>3.    Determine instructional material used by student in learning.<br/>4.    Identify ways teachers used technology material for teaching of basic science in secondary schools in Igbo Etiti L.G.A.<br/><br/>1.4 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES<br/>For the successful completion of the study, the following research hypotheses were formulated by the researcher;  <br/>H0: there are no ways teachers used technology material for teaching of basic science in secondary schools in Igbo Etiti L.G.A<br/>H1:there are ways teachers used technology material for teaching of basic science in secondary schools in Igbo Etiti L.G.A<br/>H02:there are no instructional technology tools available to teachers at secondary school in Igbo Etiti local government area of Enugu state.<br/>H2:there are instructional technology tools available to teachers at secondary school in Igbo Etiti local government area of Enugu state<br/>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The research will be of significance to the entire secondary school in Igbo Etiti L.G.A. of Enugu, especially to the student in there learning field of study.It will help the educationalist in providing, utilizing and improving the use of instructional material in teaching of the student in schools. In the other hand, it will direct and encourage secondary schools on the use of instructional material in teaching and learning of basic science. <br/>The benefit of effective use of instructional material as a tool for teaching and learning of the student cannot be over emphasized, poor academic achievement of the student will be minimized.The study would also benefit the future researchers who would be interested in carrying out a further research work in the same field.Finally, this study has also been a source of inspiration and the researcher found it very helpful to her academic advancement it has exposed her to so many things. <br/>1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>The researcher confines the study to the five secondary school in Igbo Etiti local government area of Enugu state. Specifically designed for secondary school students who are engaged in basic science. This means that the application of the research findings is generalized with in secondary schools in Igbo Etiti local government area.The research will take duration of four months to complete. The researcher encounters some constrain which limited the scope of the study;<br/>a) AVAILABILITY OF RESEARCH MATERIAL: The research material available to the researcher is insufficient, thereby limiting the study    <br/>b) TIME: The time frame allocated to the study does not enhance wider coverage as the researcher has to combine other academic activities and examinations with the study.<br/>c) Organizational privacy: Limited Access to the selected auditing firm makes it difficult to get all the necessary and required information concerning the activities. <br/>1.7DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>AVAILABILITY: The quality of being able to be used or obtained<br/>INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL: Instructional materials are the tools used in educational lessons, which includes active learning and assessment. Basically, any resource a teacher uses to help him teach his students is aninstructional material.<br/>TEACHING:Define teaching. teaching synonyms, teaching pronunciation, teaching translation, English dictionary definition of teaching. The act, practice, occupation, or profession of a teacher.<br/>BASIC SCIENCE: Basic science principally refers to the scientific disciplines of Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Mathematics. The principal idea behind something being labelled as basic science is that study of basic science leads to a better understanding of natural phenomena.<br/>1.8 ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDY<br/>This research work is organized in five chapters, for easy understanding, as follows <br/>Chapter one is concern with the introduction, which consist of the (overview, of the study), historical background, statement of problem, objectives of the study, research hypotheses, significance of the study, scope and limitation of the study, definition of terms and historical background of the study. Chapter two highlights the theoretical framework on which the study is based, thus the review of related literature. Chapter three deals on the research design and methodology adopted in the study.

The population of the study is junior secondary schools in Enugu North Local Government area, which their results are been collected using random sampling to select eight(8) secondary schools in Enugu north L.G.A. Instrument used for data collection are JSSCE results of the students from 2008 and 2009.The study was analyzed and presented using tables and percentages. Four research questions were stated that was used in carrying out the study such as what have been the overall academic performances of the students in English language in JSSCE in Enugu north local government area. What have been the overall academic performances of the students in integrated science in JSSCE in the Local Government under study? Are the performance in Junior Secondary School Certificate Examination improving or declining in terms of quality pass, ordinary pass and failure in the two subjects under study. According to their results it was discovered that the performances of the students in junior secondary school certificate examination in English language and integrated science is declining. Some conclusion and recommendations were made that the government and all those involved should find all the possible means to improve on the students’ performances English language and integrate science since they are our feature hope.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Education is the process that brings about the development of intellectual, physical and emotional qualities of children so that they may grow into useful and intelligent citizens.<br/>He further described specifically general education as being designed to develop the functional understanding of the essential elements of life and society which people must posses to live. The social demand for education has brought about the increase in the enrolment of students in schools. This fact was confirmed by Nwaliani (2000) who pointed that the social demand approach considers education as service that is demanded by thee people just like any other goods or services. Thus, the free education at the primary and secondary school levels was a response to the social demand by he people. The free education has perhaps led to a considerable increase in student’s enrolment in the schools and has created demand for more equitable distribution of teachers to schools.<br/>Aheruta (2000) added that the enrolment of students increased from 80, 272 in 1996 to 142, 560 in 2006 an increase of 78% while the number of 142, 560 in 2006 an increase of 78% while the numbers of teachers in the schools rose from 3, 264 in 1996 to 5, 415 during the same period giving an increase of 66% (ministry of education).<br/>In 1878, sciences were taught to those who may not be able further in science. Question arose about the existence of the three separate subjects. Advanced countries were developing and we are doing science without proper study.<br/>After this work of separating science subjects, a just working section of representatives from the core science committee made effort to improve sciences. <br/>By 1920s the nature study was not effective and new development in curriculum of the basic science and some cultural values as well as intellectual stimulations were brought unto the curriculum.<br/>The National Science Foundation (NSF) Independent Agency of the Federal Government created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 as amended (Pub L.31-397). The agency is responsible for promoting the progress of science and advancing the nations health, prosperity, welfare and security by supporting research and education in field of science.<br/>With regard to Comparative Education Study and Adaptation Centre (CESAC) and educational development overseas that sponsored the (Integrated Science Workshop) and the working section through all British Council in Nigeria.<br/>United National Education Scientific and Cultural organization (UNESCO) gave material support while Nigeria limited Publishers published the handbooks introduced in the workshop.<br/>Adesina (1996) stated that this practice restricted science tending to only those in higher classes, however the period from 1968 to 1970 witnessed a series of joint effort by Science Teachers Association of Nigeria (STAN) and Comparative Education Studies and Adaptive Centre (CESAC) to redesign science to meet the need of less science oriented students and to be taught in secondary schools.<br/>According to Udemba and Oga (2007) poised that English language is one of the major language out of about 5, 000 estimated languages spoken in the world. It is one of the most influential and faster growing languages spoken across the globe.<br/>One fifth of the earth’s land surface use English language. It is the most widely studied language used by entire world, especially in areas while it is not native.<br/>English language as the major language makes transmission of integrated science effective and efficient.<br/>The survey of English language is an indisputable fact that language like every other subject has its history. It has undergone a lot of changes in its original structure. The old English is not appreciated by the modern speakers of English language unless such speakers have undergone some special training in that area. Butt inspite of this, through all the centuries the continuity in the development of the proper and sound system of English language has been ensured and maintained.<br/>According Jowith (1998), English language is known as Standard English from nineteenth century. This was the period in which British men began coming to the country in steadily increasing numbers as missionaries, traders, soldiers and government officials. Their presence helped to ensure that Standard British English has a prestige in Nigeria as in Britain.<br/>This was the model heed up in schools for Nigerian learners to emulate in primary secondary and higher education from Deignton (1997), the early modern period of English began in the late fifteenth century with the publican by William Carton of his first book printed in England with the end of the Wars of Roses. There was a great different a between the early modern English and the present day English in a bid to draw destruction sent day English in a bid to draw distinction among the various types of English language used in this period has emphasized that “Although the English language is considered to have entered into its moderns period after 1450, the language of Shakespeare (1564-1616) and the King James bible (1611) certainly differs in many ways from the English of the twentieth century “Accordingly, a distinction is usually made from 1700 on words. It must be emphasized at this point that English language continued to change in various forms ranging from the syntax, morphological, grammar, phonetic and phonology symbols to semantic and linguistic pattern.<br/>English language as a language is use in several countries and is widely studied. English language is used as an official language “Lingua Franca” it is the language for unification. In primary and Junior Secondary Education, it is used to teach other subjects and to pass information from the teacher to the students from new encyclopedia Britania Vol. 4p 500 2005) English language has flexibility of educations functions. This means that one word can function as various parts of speech in different context like in verbs, noun, adjective and give different meanings.<br/>According to Anibueze, (2007) view English language from the stand points that educational pre-requisite for advancement and career success in the country. It means a lot in the life and progress of students as it a key subject with profound influence in all the other school subject.<br/>According to Ozohili (2007) poised that English language has an important role because it is concerned with those abilities of speaking listening reading and writing that are required for learning in all areas of life chemistry, Biology and Physics therefore from all indication occupying very important position in Junior Secondary Education. Any amount of financial resource spent on their research versification, experimentations, drill, observations and study to improve effectiveness and productivity seem to be investigate in the right direction. English language and integrated science occupies a special position in the Junior Secondary School curriculum. The central focus of learning English language and integrated science is to produce skillful and science oriented individuals.<br/>In English language however, the procedure processes are syntax, semantic, structure, lexical, morphology, phonetic and phonology etc.<br/>According to Oladimeji in Ene (1991) defined integrated science as knowledge for nations process that are universe among mankind which has existed since the dawn of human existence. It is also the study of nature which includes man and his environment. The study of science is the effect to discover and increase human understanding of how the physical world works.<br/>According to Otiji (2008), the early modern science this period is believed to have started in 15543 when the revolution by the astronomer, Nicolaus Copernicus was first printed, which hinged on the assumption that the earth moves round the sun.<br/>The introduction of science as the Iron Age that set in metals such as bronze, copper and gold. It brought the transformation of local technology to modern technology which the Junior Secondary Students do as Integrated Science as a subject. The science and technology of today is said to have evolved gradually through the period of 300-500 BC to the present day advanced stage with the invention of very advanced cutting edge technologies. It is borne out of man’s desire and curiously to know more about himself, his environment and how to solve is problems to make life more comfortable. Ofuebe (2007) view science as a variety of information, abilities and operations about the natural environment. Science is more concerned with various investigate processes and activities with regard to developing, acquiring and controlling, knowledge, skills capabilities and attitudes about the natural factors of the environment from these processes, reliable and verifiable information are accumulated for use in science and other disciplines. Okebukola (2001) explain science as a human enterprises involving systematic study of an environment with a view to make logical and reasonable explanation about natural and fund solution to the problems that confront man. According to Ekere (2003) science is defined as the attempt by human beings to organize their experience about nature into meaningful system of explanation. These experiences include knowledge of human actions on things, events or situation and also the result of consequences of such action. Everett (1993) wrote that science is the kind of knowledge that is based on fact established by careful observation, experimentation. The scientists collects facts that seen to apply to his particular problem and can be tries to classify them to some kind of other system from these, science is the study of know ledge about the structure and behavior of the natural and physical world. Based on the fact that you can prove for example by experimenting the new development in science and technology. It can also be a system especially one concerned with aspects of human behaviour or society.<br/>Dott (2003) commented that science consists simply of the formulation and testing of hypothesis based on observation evidences experiments. It is concerned human effort to understand or to better to the history of the nature world and how the world works with observing natural phenomena and discovering new things.<br/>Dienye and Gbamaja (1990) poised that human survival is enhance by man’s ability to integrated several disparate realities for his use with aims of training the students in the process of scientific which eliminates and which does not recognize the traditional subjects boundaries when presenting topics. Ogbonna (1982) cited by Ene (1991) that Integrated Science by virtue of its name is the bringing together of different branches of science as a unified whole through the concepts and method which pervade the natural science.<br/>Integrated Science therefore defined as an approach to the teaching of science in which concepts in science discipline are combined and presented in such a way that the students learn. Science as a whole instead of learning it as a separate discipline. This helps the students to know the basic concepts and key ideas with proven opportunities for students to learn reasoning skills and a new way of thinking about their environment. Science can also be view as a method of obtaining knowledge. This can be achieved through many skills some of the process skill involved in scientific inquiry includes observation, verification and experimentation. Integrated science, its origin between 1957 and 1969 when growing awareness was generated and effort made low and developing functional and integrated science curriculum for junior secondary school all over the world curriculum.<br/>Integrated science as a system has been made compulsory in the Junior Secondary School. This therefore serves as a starting point for teaching of introductory part of other areas of science subjects. The survey of English language and integrated science put blame for poor academic achievements of the students should be opportune to principals, teachers and government agencies.<br/>Akabogu and Ndu (1992), puts the blame on the teachers, principals, students and governments agencies for low academic performances of junior secondary school students in the junior secondary school examinations certificate in the area of English language and integrated science.<br/>Again, Ukeje, Akabogu and Ndu (1992) views student’s low academic achievements in junior secondary and primary school “thus” a large number of principals of junior secondary school and headmasters of primary schools has become absentee school administrators. The classroom consequently have generally abandoned their teaching responsibilities lack of instructional materials like textbooks, computer, charts, diagram, apparatus for experiments etc, implies failure to the students for English language and integrated science which is taught in junior secondary school to be functional. It requires enough qualified teachers and teaching aids for teaching. Therefore, laboratory contributes immensely to the academic performance in integrated science students to achieve more when they receive education that will train their entire body.<br/>The classroom work takes care of the intellectual aspects of the students and practical brings out what they have. Therefore, in the school system it is necessary to ensure that all the variables relating to junior secondary school students academic performance in certificate in English language and integrated science are positively oriented so as to bring out the highest performance in their results.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong><br/>Students are no longer interested in study of science; it appears that there is a big decline of interest in study of science subjects especially in our junior secondary school, with this considerably decline in interest in the science and technologies development will continue to elude the country inspite of abundant resources at our disposal.<br/>A great nee therefore, is on how to award off this wrong attitude and stimulate our young scientists.</p> <p><strong>1.2.1 LACK OF APPROPRIATE TRAINING OF TEACHERS.</strong><br/>The researchers find out that the students performances in English language and integrated science is poor that is why we are writing on this topic to know, if government should rectify the problems.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The purpose of this study is to determine the overall performances of junior secondary school student’s academic achievement in their certificate in English language and integrated science to find out.<br/>1.

The result of the work will also show the government and curriculum planners the level of performance in Junior Secondary Certificate, so also the inspectors will be aware of the level of performance. It will also enable them know the qualifications of teachers in this field and to make any possible change where necessary, finally if decline in performance is dictated suggestions will be profane towards assisting students to change their habit and overall attitude towards the study of English language and integrated science. This study will provide the student with knowledge in the live of performance and encourage them to work harder if performance is low.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The scope of the study is delimited in the academic performance of Junior Secondary School Students academic achievement in certificate of English language and integrated science from the year 2008 and 2009 in Enugu North Local Government Area.</p> <p><strong>1.6 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>1.

Cross sectional survey research design was used. The population of the study were eighty (80) was sampled for the study. Five research questions were raised to guide the study. Structured questionnaire which was validated by lectures was the instrument used for data collection statistical means were instrument used for data analysis. The result of the study showed that; computerization has a great impact on microfinance bank, helps in documentation of the bank, helps improve customers loans interaction, and it helps in making preparation and processing of credit and makes work more reliable, it reduces the keeping of bulky documents in the bank, helps in having safer storage of information and helps in reducing the work load of staff in checking balance. Finally it increases the speed of banking system. </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>Background of the Study</strong><br/>Micro finance bank has impacted the Nsukka urban by using computer in preparing different types of account, processing of customer’s statement of account, money transfer and cash dispensing version. The banking transaction that were manually done before the advent of computer into the banking system is now practiced in microfinance banking.<br/>Akukwe (2003) pointed out that as early as 1950’s the magnetic in character recognition (M.T.C.R) system was used by bank chequ. Micro finance bank is still in use, in the banks today. However, the latest computer technology in the bank industry is found in the use of automated teller machines (A.T.M) and electronic fund transfer (E.F.T) system. Under the electronic funds transfer your pay roll cheques as work are despaisted to your account with ease and your regular monthly payment are automatically made on your behalf. Again fund can easily be transferred from your savings to cover the cheque you have issued to people or organization in respect of the purchase you made, or donations you announced. An A.T.M. is a specialized computer terminal installed at such place like the inside and outside of the banks, supermarket, shopping plaza , hotels for quick and faster deposits and withdrawals of funds. Customer use this arrangement to transfer fund between accounts without necessarily going to the bank. <br/>Robinson (2001) examines microfinance bank as small-scale financial services- primarily credit and savings provided to people who farm or fish or herd who operate small enterprises or who provide services: who work for wages or commissions who gain income from renting out small amount of land, vehicles draft animals or machinery and tools and other individuals and groups at the local levels of developing countries both rural and urban.<br/>Ndiaye (2005) opined that access to improved financial services and access to more and better ways of turning savings into lump sums help poor people from sliding deeper into poverty and helps Nsukka people lay foundation for their ambitions to better themselves and their families.<br/>In most developed countries the history of microfinance bank is yet to be written. In many countries it will be difficult to do so for want of written document. This makes it difficult to build on the existing ones, mostly informal foundations of microfinance and learn from past experience. For example Nigeria is the only African country south of the Sahara of which one knows that microfinance existed at least as early as 500 years ago mainly in the form of rotating savings and credit associations. They are called “Esusu” among the Yoruba in Nigeria. Now a lingua France term in many west African countries. Respondent claim that their close relation are easier to draw into group based association than people from other ethnic groups. This corroborates the finding of Zellers et al (2001) that nearly half of group members are related to each other. Substantial importance is placed on known information about potential member since point liability and group cohesion, served as collateral for group members to obtain microcredit from microfinance NGOs (Zellers et al, 2001).<br/>The distribution of respondents according to gender showed that there were more female (57percent) than male (43percent) this support the findings of UNCDF (1997), Adebayo (1997). Olomola (2001), Adyeye (2003) that members of microfinance NGOs are mostly women who, along with children form the group that is vulnerable to poverty, this makes NGO microfinance delivery in the area truly poverty alleviation initiative. <br/>C.F Strickland (1934) a British cooperative expert examined the Esusu as a possible basis for modern cooperative societies in western Nigeria. Having previously worked in India where he encountered rotating funds, he speculated that the Esusu must have been imported from India. Which he considered a superior culture at some unknown time and concluded that in this cause one might as well import cooperative from England instead of modernizing the Esusu/Strickland the co-operative society’s ordinance introduced in 1935 and modelled after British colonies in Africa.<br/>It was only in eastern Nigerian where financial co-operative flourished: encouraged by enlightened cooperative officer to build on the ubiquitous Esusu. The Igbo version of the Esusu: had a legal and supervisory framework been provided for the Esusu. Isusu, Adashi, Bam and whatever ROSCAS are called in 350 ethnic groups and had their origin not been misjudged.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Problem </strong><br/>In recent times there has been little or no satisfaction of customer from the services performed in microfinance banks. Before the invention of computer according to Akwkwe (2003) the accountant did their work spending many hours of tedious calculation and re-calculation. Today the electronic spread sheet page assumes the position of the proper, pencil and calculation for the accountant. The electronic formulation; the computer now enables the accountant to compute the entire accounting job like pay-roll income and expenditure recording etc. with ease <br/>However the use of computerization in microfinance bank in Nsukka urban is yet to be modernized for the benefit of Nsukka people.</p> <p><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong><br/>The primary purpose of this study is to find out the impact of computer on microfinance bank in Nsukka urban. <br/>1. To determine how far the manual performance of microfinance banking has gone.<br/>2. To ascertain the impact of computerization in microfinance bank in Nsukka.<br/>3. Identify other ways of improving banking functions through the use of computer.<br/>4. To determine how ready and rich the microfinance bank are for the adoption of computerization.<br/>5. Computerization and IT benefit.</p> <p><strong>Significance of the Study</strong><br/>In this research work, the researchers intend to establish computerized strategies of banking of which both microfinance banks and even customers will benefit from.<br/>Furthermore, it is optimistic that after study, the acquired knowledge of computer, internet and information technology of carrying out their services has been replaced with fast and easy technology which also makes their services more effective.<br/>As a result of this microfinance banks will attract huge deposit as they will be computing with other commercial bank.</p> <p><strong>Scope of the Study</strong><br/>This study is meant to cover all microfinance banks throughout Nsukka urban zone. However, it is not possible to reach and collect information from every were.<br/>Therefore, this study is carried out but with a case study of micro-finance bank with Nsukka urban zone.</p> <p><strong>Research Question </strong><br/>1.

Three research questions and one hypothesis were used as guide. The literature was reviewed under four subheadings which include: <br/>1. Important of instructional materials in teaching and learning process<br/>2. Availability of instructional materials <br/>3. Factors affecting the utilization of the available instructional materials <br/>4. Strategies by which the use of instructional materials can be fully increased. <br/>This study adopted a descriptive survey design. it was carried out in Enugu North Local Government Area of Enugu State. The population of the study was all the junior secondary school students and teachers in the field of integrated science and computer. Out of 14 secondary schools in Enugu North Local Government Area, 6 schools were randomly selected, picking 20 students and 4 teachers from each school which gave us a total of 120 students and 24 teachers. structured questionnaire was used for collection of data which was constructed in accordance with the research questions. The data collected were analyzed using mean and standard deviation. The interpretation of the data was based on real limit number of mean score <br/>Based on the data analyzed the following major findings were made <br/>1. Adequate instructional materials needed for effective teaching and learning of integrated science and computer were not available. <br/>2. Only the teacher made instructional materials were being used. <br/>3. Available instructional materials were not fully utilized. <br/>4. Insufficient materials and equipment is a major factor affecting utilization of instructional materials.<br/>5. Another factor affecting utilization of instruction materials is lack of fund for the purchase of the instructional materials. <br/>6. Provision of funds by the government for procurement of instructional materials can help increase utilization of instructional materials.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION <br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>In teaching, it is highly desirable to know exactly what one aims to achieve as it is in all great undertaking. Instructional materials according to Wiki (1998), are kind of tools or equipment that can help the instructor effectively in theory teaching classroom or in practical assessment. They are also materials that aid in the transference of information from one to another. Also Ilori (2000) pin-pointed that instructional material are aids the teacher uses to arouse the interest of the learner there by enabling the learner to gain direct experience. Instructional materials are assumed to have being in place right from the primary school level but if not properly utilized, enhancement of learning is thwarted. The neglect of the use of instructional materials by teachers pose negative effect in the process of teaching and learning of integrated science and computer. Merrrel (1993) (p.37) pointed out that at present, schools are continually faced with financial problem and this could increase the likelihood that teachers will make more use of free or cheap teaching materials to supplement their own ageing resources. It is therefore important that teachers remain vigilant and exercise sound judgment on approaching what is available to help them teach and their pupils to learn. <br/>The extent to which instructional materials are made available also determines the extent to which they are being utilized in teaching and learning of integrated science and computer. Onwuka (1981) indicated that instructional materials help the teacher to convey the intended message effectively and meaningfully to the learners so that the learner receive, understand, retain and apply the experience gained to reach an educational goal. <br/>Instructional materials are some of the most important devices which both teachers and learners can use to enhance the quality of instruction. They are good sources of acquiring factual information and help to make learning permanent. Man is naturally endowed with five senses: smell, touch, sight, hearing and taste. learning or change in behavior is through these senses. In effect, these senses should come into play for effective learning. In the classroom the teacher therefore, must sensitize the sense of the learner through the use of instructional materials. <br/>The various topics in junior secondary schools in integrated science and computer demand the use of instructional materials by the teacher from the preparation and delivery of their lessons to student. Instructional materials include all terms of information carriers that can be used to promote and encourage effective teaching and learning activities. They could be in form of text book, reference books, journals, posters, chart, programmed text, non-print materials, such as films, tapes, models, picture ,recorders etc. furthermore instructional materials are anything the teacher turns for help in his goal-seeking activities. The help may be in form of information, idea, formulae, generalization or experiences (Saylor and Alexander (1966).<br/>Tremendous changes have taken place in the development of science and technology. Therefore the Enugu state ministry of education and the school boards are supposed to provide junior secondary school pupils with funds for the procurement of instructional materials likewise, the teacher should use the available materials in his everyday teaching learning process, bearing in mind that the interest of children will be aroused more when they see things in their natural setting and the educational goal will be achieved as well.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </strong><br/>The extent of use of instructional materials should not be excluded in teaching and learning of integrated science and computer. They supply a concrete basis for conceptual thinking and hence reduce meaningless word responses of students. It was observed that the result of student in integrated science and computer education at junior secondary school certificate examinations (JSSCE) are consistently poor. Some of the causes of this poor achievement is related to lack of understanding of the concepts. Also the populations of students in continuation of science subjects in senior secondary schools are drastically reduced. One would ask, are there no knowledgeable teachers who can impact the knowledge of the concepts effectively. For a teacher to be effective in her work, she must know the principles of teaching which also include the use of instructional materials. Teachers have neglected the use of instructional materials in teaching and learning of integrated science and computer. They engage themselves with chalk and talk method which lives the student with little or no understanding. <br/>This study therefore, tries to determine the extent of utilization of instructional materials in teaching and learning of integrated science and computer in junior secondary schools in Enugu North Local Government Area Enugu State.</p> <p><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The major purpose of this research is to find out the extent of utilization of instructional material in teaching and learning of instructional science and computer in junior secondary school in Enugu North Local Government Area, Enugu State. In the light of this, the specific objectives of the research include:.<br/>1. To ascertain the extent to which these instructional material are being utilized in teaching and learning of integrated science and computer in junior secondary schools in Enugu North L.G.A Enugu state.<br/>2. To ascertain the factors affecting utilization of instructional materials in teaching and learning of integrated science and computer <br/>3. To find out the possible solutions or strategies through which the use of instructional materials in teaching of integrated science and computer can be increased.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>It is intended that findings from this research on the interest of use of instructional material will be of help to both the student, teachers, school and the government.<br/>1. It exposes the importance of instructional materials which would make students have more understanding on the lessons.<br/>2. The information from this research will help teacher to carry out their task with ease unlike the chalk and talk method where the teacher spend the whole time trying to make the student to understand what is being taught. <br/>3. The information from this research will enable the school administrators to ascertain the availability of instructional materials for teaching integrated science and computer and the extent to which they are being utilized in promoting the new emphases on teaching integrated science and computer in junior secondary schools in Enugu North L.G.A Enugu State <br/>4. The information from the research will also help the bodies, whose duty is to lay educational policies and monitor the progress of the planned educational evolution to ensure that instructional materials are supplied and bottle necks removed in time to facilitate the effective implementation of this National policy on education with reference to teaching of integrated science and computer.</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTION </strong><br/>This study seeks to provide answers to the following <br/>1. To what extent are these instructional material being fully utilized in teaching and learning of integrated science and computer in junior secondary in Enugu North L.G.A <br/>2.

The work will be divided into five chapters. Chapter one is the introduction; chapter two reviews the literative; chapter three is the methodology; chapter four is the analyses while chapter five is the summary, conclusion, recommendation and implication of the study. The study will be guided by four research questions. Survey design will be used. A portion of the entire population will serve as the sample size. The instrument of the study will be adopted to get the sample size. The instrument of the study will be questionnaire. It will be face validated. A reliability exercise will be carried out whereby the questionnaire will be given to ten teachers from another local government Area for the first time; after two weeks they will be given the same questionnaire items to respond to. Their responses in the first and second times will be analyzed using Pearson product moment correlation co-efficient. Any result from 0.50 and above that is realized shows that the instrument is reliable. The research questions will be answered using mean scores. The analyses will be presented in tables and statements of inter-presentation will be made after each of the tables. Findings will be made. There will be recommendation and implications for the study. Finally, suggestions for further studies will be equally made.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/>Background of the Study:</strong><br/>English is a language of the people of England. It originates from the Jute, Angles and Saxon, who are the early settlers in Britain. It is part of the Germanic branch of the Indo European language family. At the initial state, English was confined to Britain alone. Later, it grew wide within the British Empire as a Prestigious Core Language among all other European languages in the upper classes of London, Oxford, Wales, Ireland, Scotland, Cambridge and England. It further developed and got to other people of the world. It spread to Asia, Germany, Africa and other continents as a Native Language, Second Language or Foreign Language. Progressively, English Language has spread virtually all over the world.<br/>English, throughout the world, is a significant everyday language. It is a global language and widely distributed medium of instruction and communication. It has a prestigious official status and has acquired a constitutionally endorsed legal right. It has gained explicit recognition, which has established it as a medium of administration, education, international relations, commerce and law. Throughout the world, English language is very important (Mac Arthur, 1996).<br/>In Nigeria, English language is a second language and a lingua franca. This means that it is the language for unit, communication economy, national pride, law, press, trade and instruction. As a language of instruction, it is an essential prerequisite for an advancement and career succession in the country. It means a lot in the life and progress of a child as it is a key subject with profound influence on all the school subjects.<br/>The English Language is used in the Junior Secondary Schools as core school subject. It is a solid foundational course. The key elements of the course are designed to cover the basic four language skills, which are listening, reading, speaking and writing. It is expected that after learning these skills in Junior Secondary School, the students who choose to work can use the language fluently while those who wish to go further can be very proficient in the language. According to Harold (1995), the teachers are to integrate the key elements of the language experiences at school. English at this stage tends to receive more critical attention. He posits that the professional English language teacher is one who has been trained or has trained himself to do a competent work. He should at least possess a college major in English or a strong minor. He must have deep interest in literature and a solid knowledge of the language skills. Moreover, he has to acquire strong skill in the handling of the instructional materials and educational problems. The emphasis here lies on training and qualification of the teachers.<br/>The importance of instructional materials in teaching the English Language in Junior Secondary School cannot be under-estimated. It makes whatever amount of work being done at Junior Secondary School easy and fast. It promotes greater acquisition and high retention of actual knowledge. They provide increased interest and integrated experience (Eya and Ofoefuna, 1999)<br/>Vikoo (2003) observes that the most suitable instructional materials for the effective teaching and learning of the English Language at this information age are audio – visual materials. He describes the audio – visual materials as the instructional system which uses the operations of the scientific and technological equipment combining both visual projections and sound productions to provide tangible experiences to learners. Some of such materials are computer assisted instruction, video – taped instruction and film shows. Baldeh (1990) states that audio – visual aids have been introduced, tested and tried in the school system and found effective.<br/>In spite of the importance of the English Language and the effectiveness of the audio – visual aids in teaching English Language in Nigeria, the students’ performances are found low in the Junior Secondary Examination in Chief Examiner’s report (2006), it is stated that the students attainments in English Language have been dwindling every year while the enrolments of the candidates are astronomically increasing. Rowtree (1994) still, describes audio – visual aids as the most fitted materials to aid the teachers to inculcate the language competence in students. It uses electric method to enhance learning. Yet, the results of the students are found low.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Problem:</strong><br/>English Language emerged from a common origin of the Germanic branch of indo European language family, and has far–reaching spread and uses in Nigeria, it is her lingua franca and a second language. It is the official language, which has gained it’s endorsed statutory legal position. It is the language of education and all other transactions in Nigeria. In effect, it is of paramount importance for all users of the language in the country; in education, all students of Junior Secondary School should gain competence in it.<br/>In order to gain the required competence, audio – visual materials are specifically used in instructional activities to mitigate the instruction problems and improve knowledge of both teachers and students in relatively short time. Incidentally, the failure rate of the students is disturbing.<br/>This poor performance may imply that the students have not grasped the basic language skills. Secondly, it suggests that the teachers may use it on a minimal level or may have ignored the use of the materials in their classroom practices. Thirdly, the training of the teachers may contribute to its success or failure in the students’ performances.<br/>Again, there is controversy on gender differences. It is not certain whether female and male teachers react differently in the extent of use of audio – visual aids. The question here is, to what extent does the teachers use audio – visual materials in learning English Language in Junior Secondary Schools in Enugu East Local Government Area? Finding an answer to this question is the major concern of this study.</p> <p><strong>Purpose of the Study:</strong><br/>The purpose of this research is to elicit from the English Language teachers the extent of use of audio – visual aids in teaching and learning English language in Junior Secondary Schools in Enugu East Local Government Area. Specifically, the researchers intend to<br/>(I) Determine the degree of the use of audio – visual aids in teaching the English Language.<br/>(II) Find out the level of the use of audio – visual aids to improve the students’ performances in English Language.<br/>(III) Examine whether the male and female differences affect the extent of use of the audio – visual aids in teaching and learning in Junior Secondary Schools in Enugu East Local Government Area<br/>(IV) Ascertain whether the difference in the education of the teachers affect the extent of the use of the audio – visual aids in the teaching and learning of the English language in Junior Secondary Schools in Enugu East Local Government Area?<br/>In effect, there is no clear cut stand as there are generally varied opinions. This therefore, emphasizes the need for the study to be carried out.</p> <p><strong>Significance of the Study:</strong><br/>It is hoped that this study will inspire teachers and inspectors of the State and Federal Ministries of Education to improve their competence and performance by adopting instructional audio – visual materials to suit their proper use in the classroom. This will improve the teaching and learning of English language in particular and other subjects in general. This study also will help educational planners to lay more emphasis on teachers’ use of the audio – visual instructional materials when drawing up an English Language curriculum. The Federal Ministry of Education and State Education Commission, when recommending text books for English Language, should ensure that text books should contain CD ROMS, films and tape recorded work of the same text books and that teachers should be made to have and use audio – visual materials such materials should be available for the teachers’ use in the classrooms. Finally, this study shows that each of the students has absolute control of his potentials and as such is capable of developing his potentials and attain high academic excellence commensurate with those potentials through the use of audio – visual ads.</p> <p><strong>Scope of Study:</strong><br/>This study was carried out in all the secondary schools in Enugu East Local Government Area. The study investigated the extent of usage of the audio – visual materials in Junior Secondary Schools. Some percentage of teachers and students was used.</p> <p><strong>Research Questions:</strong><br/>The following research questions addressed and guide the study<br/>(I) To what extent do teachers make use of audio – visual material in teaching and learning English in Junior Secondary Schools in Enugu east Local Government Area of Enugu State?<br/>(II) To what extent does the use of audio – visual materials improve effective teaching and learning of English in Junior Secondary Schools in Enugu East Local Government Area of Enugu State?<br/>(III) Do male and female differences of the teachers influence the extent of usage of the audio – visual aids in Junior Secondary Schools in Enugu East Local Government Area of Enugu State?<br/>(IV) Do differences in the qualifications of the teachers influence the extent of usage of the audio – visual aids in Junior Secondary Schools in Enugu East Local Government Area of Enugu State?</p> <p><strong>Research Hypotheses:</strong><br/>This study was guided by the following null hypotheses which were tested at 0.05 level of significance.<br/>HO: There is no significance difference in the mean scores of male and female teachers in the use of the audio-visual in teaching English Language in Junior Secondary School in Enugu East Local Government Area.<br/>HO: There are no significant differences between the mean scores of trained and untrained English Language teachers in the use of the audio-visual materials in teaching English Language in Junior Secondary School in Enugu East Local Government Area.</p>\n\nEXTENT OF USE OF AUDIO VISUAL MATERIALS IN THE TEACHING AND LEARNING OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN JUNIOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EXTENT OF USE OF AUDIO VISUAL MATERIALS IN THE TEACHING AND LEARNING OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN JUNIOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS", "id": 53}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This study seeks to evaluate the availability of qualified teachers for effective teaching and learning of English language in our junior secondary schools using schools in Enugu zone in Enugu state as our focal point. Pragmatist theory which is a philosophical example of innovation based on policy orientation and abstract world view, pure ideas as the Yardstick (tool) for assessment, teaching and learning of English language was adopted as our theoretical framework. Our method of data collection is primary sources which helps us to organize the information in quantitative form. <br/>Two hypotheses tested are that we lack qualified teachers in English language in Enugu zone and that performance of students in English language is poor.<br/>The study recommends that the ministry of education will sit up and take the bull by the horn in nipping it in the bud the endemic problem. Non-dedicated and incompetent teachers should be shown the way out while provisions will be made for the reward of teachers and students to enhance greater performance output and productivity.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Contemporary education is an indispensable asset and factor in the solution of the modern equations whether in terms of individual self actualization, socio-economic needs, natural development and consolidation or modification of the attitudes and behaviour of our children. But education like other important human enterprise and human condition stems from the fact that it provides comprehensive interpretation of the fundamental issues and the events that are pertinent to them. <br/>These philosophies are built around the teacher, environment and the students who are the cardinal pillars or reasons behind its success. In the classroom the teacher performs the very important functions of instructions and evaluation of the pupils, control of the class, creation of congenial atmosphere for learning and motivating the children to learn. <br/>Ukeje (1984) but outside the classroom the role changes and with the importance attached to each of the child’s functions in the class room. He now performs consciously or unconsciously the important function of socializing the school and the community.<br/>Madukwe (2008); has it that the teacher is expected to participate actively in the extra curricular activities of a varied and different set of situation. Onimode (2008) has it that even though , the teacher may enjoy the goodwill of the pupils/students, his relationship with the students where he is expected to be less disapproving, less authoritarian, less formal, more friendly and accommodation may be appealing. Having gone through all these, we see that such human phenomenon no longer exists in Enugu state public schools and that is the reason why education viz – a – viz learning is foreseen to be relegated to the background.<br/>All the qualities highlighted above which are deemed as techniques every teacher is expected of is lacking and may be environmentalistic in nature or humanistic. Be that as it may this study may profer solution for them.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>One of the major challenges facing effective teaching and learning in Nigeria is non-availability of qualified teachers. Statistics have shown<br/>that our tertiary institution and teaches training institutions have been yearly mass producing and doling out teachers at astronomical quantum, yet their impacts are not felt at the classroom and examination level. <br/>The performance of our students in the 2009 WAEC and NECO examinations has not been impressive. In the last 2009 NECO General Certificate Examination (GCE), only 1-8 percent of the 236,613 that sat for the examinations across 1,708 centres in the country has five credit passes, mathematics and English language inclusive. In the same year, the candidates that sat for the senior secondary school examinations did not do any better. Out of the 1,373,009 candidates that failed the examinations, 25.99 percent of them had five credit passes in five subjects, mathematics and English language inclusive.<br/>On the other hand, out of 1,184,907 candidates that sat for May/June 2009 NECO, only 10.68 percent has credit passes in five subjects including Mathematics and English which are acceptable basic standards for admission into tertiary institution. Also in 2008, only 13.76 percent of the 1,369,142 candidates that sat for the May/June WASSCE had credit passes in five subjects including mathematics and English.<br/>(Federal Bureau of Statistics F.B.I 2010) narrowing it down to Enugu state due to the present changes and alterations going on, 6,3334 system to the 9,3,4 system which did not give room for students that failed to repeat classes so that they can improve, the carryover that is witnessed at the junior class level is the migraine facing the policy formulations of education at the higher level. <br/>Enugu state, in the just concluded junior WAEC result, out of 1,205,268 that sat for the examination only 28,42 past English and mathematics. This mathematically represents about 12% (percent) performance. Analysis apportion the problem to lack of qualified teachers.<br/>Despite the recent performances of WAEC/NECO and junior WAEC candidates, stakeholders believe that this is a further proof that all is not well with our educational sectors. Post primary educational sector has had its share of problems. In 2008 for instance, the sector was affected by a 10 – week nationwide industrial action embarked upon by the Nigeria union of teachers (N.U.T) that resulted in the alteration of school calendars. Tell May 17 2010).<br/>Inadequate funding has hampered the future and sustenance of education in our land. The private sector could not courageously help the government to shoulder the responsibility of funding its schools. According to the United nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization UNESCO agreement of which Nigeria is signatory in 1998, it stipulates and recommends 26 percent allocation of a nation’s budget to education sector. But presently the sector is being allocated less than 15 percent in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Depending on the nature of the activities in which the teacher engages, he is likely to meet children of different classes, interest and background for the inculcation of virtues and knowledge. <br/>The significance of this study is to profer solution on how half baked teachers should be phased out in the annals of the teaching environment so that our children, students/pupils will no longer have stunted growth in terms of educational development. It will also suggest ways in which the teacher and the students will improve most especially as it relates to the teaching of the English language. This will seriously reduce mind boggling results we witness these days at the lower level. </p> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTION</strong><br/>The following are our research questions <br/>a. Do we lack qualified teachers in English language in Enugu zone<br/>b. Are there witnesses of poor performance in English language in Enugu zone.<br/><br/><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The scope of this work revolves round the teacher, students, secondary schools in Enugu zone and more importantly the government who are the arrow head of school management in the state privately established and approved schools in Enugu zone are not included “but only schools owned by government are used. </p> <p><strong>LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>One of the major challenges that faced the researchers is the inability to reach all the government owned secondary schools in Enugu zone. For lack of funds the researchers confined themselves to five secondary schools. Also during this rainy period access to some school that are situated in the hinter land is bit more difficult and affected adversity the administration of questionnaires. </p>\n\nAVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED TEACHER IN EFFECTIVE TEACHING AND LEARNING OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN JUNIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED TEACHER IN EFFECTIVE TEACHING AND LEARNING OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN JUNIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL", "id": 54}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Although English language is now the language of government, business and commerce, education, the mass media, literature and internal as well as external communication, there are still problems in the teaching of English as a second language in secondary schools. Students presume that English language is a difficult language to learn and so do not make effort to learn it. Teachers also find it difficult to cope with the heavy demand required for effective teaching and learning of English language. This research work was carried out using the twenty secondary schools in Igbo Etiti Local Government Area of Enugu state. Six boys secondary schools, eight girls secondary schools and six co-educational schools. The target population was one thousand, eight hundred and fifty four students in JS III and one thousand, eight hundred and eighty eight students in SS III and one hundred and five English teachers. Ten schools and two hundred students from both junior and senior secondary schools were used for the study. Forty teachers were also selected and analyzed using mean. Based on the findings some recommendations were made. </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Origin of English language: English language originated in the North Western Europe, going by the history of the English. It is therefore said to have involved from the Germanic branch of Indo-European language family. Apart from having the widest geographical spread, the indo-European language family is spoken by the greatest number of people. The language was first spoken by various tribes in Denmark and Northern Germany.<br/>Uchechukwu (2008) said that, the word English is used to denote the name of people. By the time of the Northern conquest (1066) English was the name for all the inhabitant of English.<br/>Of all the heritage left behind in Nigerian by the British at the end of the colonial administration, probably none is more important than the English. English language is now the language of government, internal, business and commerce, education, the mass media, ENEH (2008) observed that, English was the name for all the inhabitants of England. He also observed that English language is the name for all subject in Nigeria except Igbo language. This observation is a reality because since we gained independence from the British people, English has been enjoying a high status within the Nigeria society. <br/>English language is not only used in Nigeria but also has domains of usage in international levels too. Paul (2005) said that, English is flexible enough to be used for the most trivals conversation or for transacting the most important affairs of the day. Thus, it is English language that gives Nigeria opportunity to take part in the deliberation and decisions in international organization such as united nation organization common wealth of nation, world heath organization. <br/>In Nigeria, English serves several purposes that are very important to her existence. It is the lingua franca of the country and the official language in the society due to multi ethnic groups that speak different language. For this diversity of language, Nigeria needs one language that will bridge the linguistic barriers among its component states. The choice of such language (English) has been made for Nigeria by the British colonial administration; Uchechukwu (2008) observed that, English is spoken by more than a quarter of a billion people. It is becoming increasingly popular as a second language for non-English speaking people throughout the work. Thus, English is regarded as a second language. Nigeria civil service, government establishment armed forces, the public and judiciary system English is the prescribed language of communication among the various ethnic groups with different language background. In social gathering, English is used among people for social interaction.<br/>Uchechukwu (2008) observed that, apart from English language having the widest geographical spread, that the language is spoken by the greatest number of people. It is becoming increasingly popular as a second language for non-English speaking people throughout the word. It is a language that uses more than a million symbols. It is flexible enough to be used for the most trivia conversation or for transaction. The most important affairs of the day, it can be used for recording scientific data with accuracy and precision or for creating a poem expressing a beautiful thought in words that are pleasing to the ear. <br/>Literature books so far produced in Nigeria are written in English. This includes, works of Wole Soyinka, Mrs. Edith Eze, Chinua Achebe, Christopher Okigbo and so on. They are highly claimed internationally. <br/>In education, it is used as a means of instruction in school and it is introduced as a school subject in the university level. School subjects in the first year in primary school up to the university level. School subject like, biology, history, government, mathematics and so on are thought in English. This means that scientific knowledge of the word is through English language, which he learn in the school. Thus, English language plays a role in our society. In education homes, English is used as the common language to impact knowledge to younger ones. Gradually the younger ones will develop fluent speech in English from their parents.<br/>It is true that English is a lingua franca, the main official language and the second language (L2) for Nigerian children, but only a small percentage of the Nigerian population have access to it and use it in communication. And the small percentage of the people who use English in Nigeria, only negligible proportion of them may be said to speak and writes Standard English like the educated native speakers of the language. As Anibueze (2000) observed that at a pre-school age, native speakers have usually acquired unconsciously the basic sentence structure of English language. It may not necessarily be the standard language, but it is one in which the child is relatively competent. Since a large number of Nigeria population who use English language acquire it through the form school systems, the poor standard of their English can be ascribed in school, especially secondary school by those concern teachers and student who sat for general certificate of education examination (G.C.E) at community High School Ekwegbe (C.H.S.) in October 2009 and the data collected confirmed that ninety five percent of the students book the examination because of failure in English language.<br/>Related to poor teaching and learning strategies adopted in school. Onyejeli 2008 states five basic principles of learning/teaching English language. Firstly, the teacher should be very clear to what he/she is teaching the students because, it is a regular usage. Secondly, the teacher should start the teaching of English from listening and speaking before reading and writing will follow. Thirdly, the teacher should tell them the important of materials because they are learning it as a second language. Fourthly, the teacher should tell them the important of revision of skill learned to identify mistakes. Fifthly the teacher when teaching should create much time and patience because he/she is teaching English language to a second language learner.<br/>Infact, the status of English language in Nigeria and the secondary school have attracted the problems of the researchers to investigate the problems of teaching and learning of English.<br/>The method of language teaching and learning strategies, the method and strategies used by some teachers of English pose problems to the learners of the language by the students teachers of English should understand the meaning of the word “teach” that is to acquire knowledge or to perform an act. Any methods used by the teacher should aim at enabling the child acquire knowledge of doing something. There are eight ways by which a teacher can make his student acquire knowledge, each slightly different from the other but all tending to produce the same results in varying degrees. He can make him learn it, he can inform him, instruct him, train him, lecture him or educate him. Each approach has its peculiar connotation and its effect on the relationship between the teacher and the pupils. <br/>The methods learn it puts efforts on the student and makes the achievement more long-lasting and more effective. The other methods, especially “teach” put the responsibility on the teacher. This is why it is necessary for teacher to learn how to use different material to teach in the classroom. English language should be practiced for effective learning. <br/><br/><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>This is a wide spread feeling that the standard of English language is rapidly a great problems to the educationist especially specialist teachers of English language. The student find it difficult to the English language as a medium of expression in many social gatherings or in their academic purposes. They make a lot of grammatical mistakes when speaking or writing English. <br/>We have shortage of specialist teachers in the educational system cannot be over-emphasized. The successful implementation of the curriculum in each of the school subjects which depends to a large extent on availability of specialist teachers in the English has led to employment of graduates from other disciplines such as mass communication to teach English language in some secondary schools. This constitutes a serious problem to the teaching and learning of English language in secondary schools. <br/>Since the most important factor in the teaching learning process is the teacher, there is a great need to train more teachers in English language. Teachers provide back ground experiences for their students and also determine their academic achievement. <br/>Hence the need arises to ascertain mother tongue, physical and psychological problems, insufficient time allotted to English time table, inadequate supply of teaching material and shortage of specialist teachers of English hinder the teaching and learning of English as a second language in secondary schools in Igbo Etiti local government area of Enugu state.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The purpose of this study includes <br/>i. To know if there is any problem in the time allotted to the teaching and learning of English language as a second language.<br/>ii. Find out how lack of teaching and learning material have contributed problems in the teaching and learning of English language. <br/>iii. To ascertain the effect of shortage of specialist teachers on the teaching of English language as a second language.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The study on the problem of teaching and learning of the English as a second language in secondary school in Igbo Etiti local government area of Enugu state will help the teacher of English to know the strategies to adopt in.<br/>Improving their acquisition of skill in English language through this study too, the educational policy makers and the administration will know the resources to be provided in school so as to improve the teaching and learning of English.<br/><br/><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong><br/>The following research questions were formulated to guide the study. <br/>i. Does insufficient time allotted to the teaching and learning of English language in the school time table affect the mastery of English language. <br/>ii. Does inadequate supply of teaching materials militate against the teaching and learning of English as a second language?<br/>iii. Does shortage of specialist teachers hinder the teaching and learning of English as a second language?</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The researchers limited their study to junior secondary III and senior secondary III in twenty secondary schools, six boys secondary schools, eight girls secondary schools and six co-educational schools in Igbo Etiti local government area of Enugu state. The problems include; mother tongue interference, inadequate supply of instructional materials method used by the teachers to teach the language shortage of specialist teachers, student physical and psychological problems and insufficient time allotted to English language in the school time table.</p> <p><strong>1.7 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>In the course of the researchers work, the researchers encountered some problems. One of the problems was uncooperative attitude of some respondents. The researcher found it difficult to gain access to the class room to distribute their lessons or limit the time for their lessons. Some teachers and students were reluctant in filling the questionnaire and this affected their responses. The researchers are living far away from the sampled schools and could not travel frequently to the schools to be present when some teachers responded to the questionnaire since some of them choose to do it at their convenient time.<br/>The presence of the researchers would have helped to clarify some misconception to the respondents.</p> <p><strong>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/>PROBLEMS: It can be defined as something that is very difficult to deal with or understand.<br/>TEACHING: It is a way of given lessons in a class to a learner. It is also a way to show someone how to do something.<br/>ENGLISH: It is the language of England, use in many varieties throughout the word. <br/>LANGUAGE: This can be said to be human or the communication of all creature through the structural use of word. It is also a system of symbols and rules for writing something. <br/>SECOND: Learn as an imitation or learned from others.<br/>SECONDARY: School of children from the age of 11 to 16 or 18.<br/>LEARNER: One who gain knowledge or skill of future changes in good behaviour. </p>\n\nPROBLEMS OF TEACHING ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE IN NIGERIA SECONDARY SCHOOL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS OF TEACHING ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE IN NIGERIA SECONDARY SCHOOL", "id": 55}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The purpose of this study is to find out the teachers and students perception of problems of effective teaching and learning English language and computer science in junior secondary school in Enugu educational zone. The population for this study comprised all the English language and computer science teachers and student in junior secondary in Enugu Educational zone. <br/>The sample was drawn from the population. The sample consisted all the teachers teaching English language and computer science in junior secondary school. The instruments used were questionnaire and data were collected analysis by use of percentage. <br/>The major findings of the study are as follows: <br/>1. It was found that they lack concentration in English language because of mother tongue interference. <br/>2. Also the lack qualified teachers <br/>3. They also lack teaching aids like books. <br/>4. They lack fund and equipment for computer laboratory so it affect teaching and learning the subject matter <br/>5. We found out that short time of teaching leads to lack of understanding of the subject. <br/>6. We found out that lack of communication affect teaching and learning effective.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>Introduction<br/>1.1 Background of the study</strong><br/>English language is the second language. It is a second language because there are other native languages before it like Igbo, Hausa, and Yoruba etc. English language is nationally considered as a measure for literacy and outstanding status. <br/>According to Anibueze (2007), English language is the major language for instruction, social services, business communication and occupational purposes. In the school curriculum, English language occupies a more important position than any of the vernaculars. At the university, secondary and primary schools, English is a very important subject. Therefore, no effective teaching and learning in Nigeria would be made without the knowledge of English language. <br/>Oga and Udemba (2007) state that: English language is one of the major languages out of about 5000 estimated languages spoken in the world. It is also one of the most influential and fast growing languages spoken across the globe. This is the more reason why children are exposed to English right from their primary education. To make sure that English s well taught in the schools, Ozohili (2007) observes that the best techniques for teaching English language is by providing a useful knowledge of target language. This is because, that can only be developed by the direct use of the target language in the class rather than forcing learners to accumulate abstract knowledge about rules of grammer. <br/>Kamler (2001) pointed out that the very poor performance of students in West African school certificate in English language is as a result of unqualified teaches and poor background knowledge of English. In most cases, teachers teaching this subject are not trained enough in the filed of English and therefore, have no knowledge of it. He further pointed out that over population in the classroom is one of the factors affecting the effective teaching and learning of English language and computer science. This is because when there are over population of students in a classroom, half of the students will be hearing what the teacher is saying while the remaining once will not be following in what the teacher is saying.<br/>Teaching and learning of English language and computer science is also affected by inadequate of instructional material and small allocation of time for teaching of both subjects. These things can lead to the problems of effective teaching and learning because when there are no materials like text books and computers for the teaching and learning of both subjects, the lessons on those courses will not be effective. In the other hand, when the time allotted for the teaching of both subject is not enough the lesson will not be well understood by the students. <br/>However, computer science is very important in our educational system therefore, we should be taken time to teach it with complete computer equipments. That is the reason why is being taught in our secondary schools very well as a way of increasing students knowledge in learning. Okolo (2006) states that: computer has changed the way we learn, communicate and work. He further stated that this days, organization throughout the world do business with computers.<br/>Kulik (2002) argues that one of the greatest achievement we have gotten from computer is the global communication of individuals and organizations with one another over a network of computer called the internet. To succeed in computer science, students must master a variety of abilities which ranges from general study to specific skills, such as logic, problem solving algorithmic thinking and programming. <br/>Penuel (2001) in his own view indicates that the poor performance of students in computer science is as a result of inadequate provision of computer equipments in so many schools. Even when there are sufficient equipments in schools, students find it difficult to operate on the computer which is the main thing as regards to learning computer science in schools. <br/>Standard language is defined as a language universally accepted as the appropriate educational target in teaching English, computer and other subjects. Hiep (2001) states that the use of English language plays an important part in both one’s desire to communicate with the world and one’s will to preserve one’s identity. Standard language is also an official language which was introduced to help the existing indigenous languages. <br/>In the other hand, modern language laboratory is a place for teaching and practicing language with equipments like tapes and video instead of reading books for the course.<br/>According to Ozohili [2007], teachers now enhances faster learning of language by making use of classroom language laboratory where portable tape-recorder and film-strip projector are used in teaching listening skills. Video clip is also used with the sound off to ask students to make predictions about what dialogue is taking place. Widdowson (2003), also states that: standard and modern language is the language used internationally across communities as a means of global communication. <br/>Language teaching is defined as the language that has been introduced so that the people of varied language will have purposes to relate together mutually. Through language teaching, students would become more familiar with grammar of their native language which would also help them to speak and write their native language better . <br/>Clemente (2001) pointed out that teachers commitment to their work helps a lot in students understanding of what is being taught in the classroom, and will also help to bring out positive academic out comes. He proceed by saying that the development from the study of this language has brought about the rise of phonetics and phonology as a new linguistic discipline with the creation of the international phonetics alphabets. <br/>Lindgren and Sullivan (2002) observe that it is necessary to look into the method of teaching language which provides the students with an opportunity to look into their writing composition processes. And it is only by confronting the complexity in teaching language that we can identify the good and right things to do in any given set of circumstances, that is, to know the rightway to teach language. <br/>Language learning is the process of learning a native or second language. All human beings are genetically endowed with the ability to learn language.<br/>However, people rarely become as fluent in a secondly language as in their native tongue. <br/>Little (2003) stated that practice of learning a language requires insight, a capacity for reflection and a readiness in interact with others. In this sense, learners can decide what to learn, when and how to learn it by taking responsibility for their learning. <br/>Hamer (2003) also points out that the social context in which learning takes place is of vital importance to the success of the educational endeavor. The method for learning a second language also involve some systematic approach to the analysis and comprehension of grammar as well as to the memorization of vocabulary. This is the reason why Usuki (2002) pays more attention on teachers attitudes and commitment towards their lesson in the classroom which plays a very important role to the learners of a particular language.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the problems.</strong><br/>The researchers found out that there are many problems that affect effective teaching and learning of English language and computer science in junior secondary schools in Enugu Educational zone. They found out that students lack of interest in English language and computer science was due to inappropriate method of teaching and teachers ineffectiveness. <br/>The teachers of English language and computer science do not acknowledge the importance of both subjects, because of this, they do not guide their students in secondary schools on how to learn and understand English language and computer science. And as a result of this, it causes the problem of effective teaching and learning of these subjects.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Purpose of the study</strong><br/>The purpose of the study is to find out the reasons why there is problems of effective teaching learning of English language and computer science in junior secondary schools, and these reasons are:<br/>1. Lack of qualified teachers of English language and computer science in schools. <br/>2. Over population of students in a class.<br/>3. Inadequate provision of instructional material for teaching of English and computer science. <br/>4. The time allotted for teaching and learning of these subjects is not enough.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Research questions</strong><br/>In order to carryout this work efficiently, where are the following questions should be answered.<br/>1. Do schools lack qualified teachers of English language and computer science? <br/>2. Does population of the students in classes affect the teaching and learning of English language and computer science?<br/>3. Do schools lack adequate instructional material for teaching English language and computer science? <br/>4. Does time allotted to for teaching of both subjects enough?</p> <p><strong>1.5 Scope of the study</strong><br/>The researchers have limited themselves to Enugu urban. The research will be carried out in Idaw-River girls secondary schools, urban girls, uwani girls uwani boys secondary schools in Enugu urban. The researchers will make use of all secondary school teachers of English language and computer science in Enugu urban.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Significance of the study</strong><br/>It is disturbing to read from examiners reports in 2005 on the public examination where faults like weak handling of sentence structures, inability to control sentences, inability to identify mouse and keyboard, frequent misuse of tenses, errors of agreement, wrong spellings in writing English and computer science and other easily isolated problems. As the examiners comment are true, they prove that many school certificate holders have simply not mastered the basic English sentence structure, and how to type in data into the computer. In view of this, it is in the interest of the students in school, teachers, professional teachers, educational administrators and humanity as a whole that researcher undertake this study. The study will help those who are interested in conducting further research on those topics. </p>\n\nTEACHERS AND STUDENTS PERCEPTIONS OF PROBLEMS OF EFFECTIVE TEACHING AND LEARNING OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND COMPUTER SCIENCE IN JUNIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " TEACHERS AND STUDENTS PERCEPTIONS OF PROBLEMS OF EFFECTIVE TEACHING AND LEARNING OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND COMPUTER SCIENCE IN JUNIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL", "id": 56}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Political corruption is the use of power by government officials for illegitimate private gain. Misuse of government power for other purposes such as repression of political opponents and general police brutality is considered political corruption. Most economic political and social problems in under developed societies like Nigeria emanate from corruption. Some of these problems include lack of accountability, diversion of public resources to private ownership, different types of discriminations, ethnicity. Lack of competence, inefficiency etc.<br/>There are many causes of political corruption such as ineffective political processes, ineffective political financing, and poverty. Ethnic and religious difference.<br/>A lot of secrecy still pervades government document and this underlies the need for the passage of the freedom of information bill presently before Nigeria‟s National Assembly, also law public participation in Government to mention a few.<br/>The pervasive corrupt practices have been blamed on the colonial masters. According to this view, the nation‟s colonial history may have restricted any early influences in an ethical revolution.<br/>10<br/>Throughout the colonial period most Nigerians were struck in Ignorance and poverty.<br/>The level of corruption raised serious alarm that attracted the concern of both Nigerians and international community which rated Nigeria as one of the most corrupt countries.<br/>Although, the government embarked upon anti-corruption measures but were not sincerely and properly implemented such that the expected objective and goal were not achieved. The problem was rather aggravated. Since then, corruption has continued to militate against national development.<br/>In Nigeria corruption is a problem that has to be rooted out.<br/>Owusi (2002), however in his book, The Root Causes of Corruption in West Africa, was of the view that;<br/>Corruption is made up of opportunist manipulation or branches of existing laws and regulation for advantages.<br/>He emphasized that;<br/>Our inordinate desire for wealth, power prestige and high status and its desirous consumption of scarce, expensive and prestigious import commodities is no doubt one of the roads to corruption in the society”.<br/>11<br/>Over the years, the country has seen its wealth withered with little to show in living conditions of the average people.<br/>As with many other African nations, Nigeria was an artificial structure initiated by former colonial powers which had neglected to consider religious linguistic and ethnic differences.<br/>The causes of Nigeria Civil War were diverse although, in his memoir, journalist Alex Mitchell blames involvement of the British, Dutch, French and Italian oil companies whose battles for the rich Nigerian oil fields started the Civil War and kept it going.<br/>Nigerian‟s political problems also started from the manner in which the British took over power, administered and abandoned government and people of Nigeria. The British administrators did not make effort to weld the country together and unite the heterogenous group of people. Though many technologies we have today are due to their enlightenment.<br/>Northern leaders however, fear that independence would mean political and economic domination by the more westernized elites in the south, preferred the perpetuation of British rule. As a condition for accepting independence, they demanded that the country continue to be divided into three regions with the North having a clear majority.<br/>12<br/>On January 15, 1966, major Kaduna Nzeogwu and other junior Army officers (mostly majors and captains) attempted a coup d‟etat. It was generally speculated that the coup had been initiated by the Igbo and for their own primary benefit, because of the ethnicity of those that were killed. The two major political leaders of the North, the Prime Minister Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and the Premier of the Northern region, Sir Ahmadu Bello was executed by major Nzeogwu. Also murdered was Sir Ahmadu Bello‟s wife<br/>The coup was not only generally carried out in the Northern region, it was most successful there. The fact that the officer, Lieutenant Connell. Arthur Umegbe was killed can be attributed to the more fact that the officers in charge of implementing Nzeogwu‟s plans in the East were incompetent. The coup, also referred to as the coup of the five majors, has been described in some quarters as Nigeria‟s only revolutionary coup. This was the first coup in the short life of Nigeria‟s nascent democracy. Claims of electoral fraud was one of the reasons given by the coup plotters. This coup resulted in General Johnson Aguyi-Ironsi, an Igbo and Head of the Nigerian Army, taking power as General becoming the first Military Head of State in Nigeria.<br/>13<br/>By the late 1960s the literature of disillusionment was taking form as a reflection of the widespread violent conflict and political corruption which had began to take hold throughout African societies. Such conflicts inevitably threw the nationalist project into turnoil: how can one speak of a nation or even Pan-African identity when a national is at war with itself? In terms of the novel as genre, Gikandi states that in the mid-1960s the form and function of the novel changed almost overnight, moving the reader away from the sometimes celebratory and utopian tone of earlier novels to a grim critique of the narrative of cultural nationalism. This was a generation of writers who are consciously distancing themselves from the project of cultural nationalism.<br/>This interventionist reading of the contemporary problems regarding ethnic conflict in Africa is one that is shared by writers as diverse as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Ngugi Wa Thion‟o. Discussing Nigeria Adichie takes the view that the idea of the tribe has, its roots in colonialism as people did not consciously identify themselves as Igbo, Yoruba or Hausa until the involvement of the British.<br/>The British governed Nigeria indirectly through their traditional rulers, as a result the true leader of the masses were hamstrung and held down. Just because Africans were given authority to rule over her own<br/>14<br/>people. They saw it as means to maltreat those that have more than them and sell his or her brother and sister, mother to gain favour from the superior leaders. The British (Adewale Ademoyeya:why we Struck).<br/>These actions by the local and foreign leaders made the people to seek for independence. Many of them were not thinking straight anymore. The present leadership blame the colonial masters and fore runners of independence for their actions for not doing what is expected of them and also for the embezzlement and stealing of public fund. The political elicits in other to become rich and influential in the society, steal and blame it on the economy and leaders. No one takes responsibility for his own crime and actions.<br/>The politicians and military rulers blame one another for a bad government no one agrees that the other is better than himself.<br/>Emeka Nwabueze is of the opinion that, the question is not weather we should wage war against corruption or not, my quarrel is that the fight should be waged within the context of the constitution.<br/>Several opinions hold that Nigerian political and economic underdevelopment since independence has been as a result of pervasive<br/>15<br/>corrupt practices in both private and public fields: Nepotism which means favouratism granted in politics or business to relatives regardless of merit.<br/>Bribery which is an act of giving money or gift giving that alters the behaviour of the recipient.<br/>Political Scandal is a kind of political corruption that is exposed and becomes a scandal, in which politicians or government officials are accused of engaging in various illegal, corrupt or unethical practices.<br/>Electoral Fraud is the illegal interference with the process of an election. Acts of fraud affect vote counts to bring about an election result whether by increasing the vote share of the rival candidates, or both. Embezzlement, abuse of office etc.<br/>Arnold saw corruption as receiving or offering of money or other advantages in return for contract, acquiring an opportunity, unqualified favor, pervasion of Justice, leading ahead of a queue and the likes. He saw corruption as poverty in juxtaposition to great wealth and luxury or crook in order to live big.<br/>A symbol is an object that represents, stands for or suggests an idea, belief, action, or material entity. Symbols take the form of words, sounds gestures or visual images and are used to convey ideas and beliefs.<br/>16<br/>It‟s also a sign, shape or object which is used to represent something else.<br/>Symbol is seen in every culture, religion and society. This makes symbol universally acceptable in the sense that it does not exist in one society and is absent in another. There are cultural and religious symbols. Cultural symbols are seen in language, traditional attire, and tribal marks, sacred objects of ancestral qualities; like “ofo” in Igbo culture as the communion of the ancestors. In Igbo culture, grey hair is a symbol of old age and should attain contesy and respect, proverb also in Igbo society are symbolic because they are embodiment of wisdom and tradition.</p> </div>\n\nPOLITICAL CORRUPTION AND SYMBOLISM IN ADICHIE CHIMAMANDA NGOZI’S HALF OF A YELLOW SUN AND OKEY 2<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " POLITICAL CORRUPTION AND SYMBOLISM IN ADICHIE CHIMAMANDA NGOZI’S HALF OF A YELLOW SUN AND OKEY 2", "id": 57}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/>Language is a tool or a code system used for human communication. It is made up of sounds or graphic symbols, which users or speakers have accepted to use as units of communication.<br/>Language is a symbol system based on pure or arbitrary conventions infinitely extendable and modifiable according to the changing needs and conditions of the speakers.<br/>Robins (1985).<br/>According to Lyons (1970) Languages are:<br/>The principal systems of communication used by particular groups of human beings within the particular society (Linguistic community) of which they are members.<br/>The use of language is not restricted to only human beings but for the purpose of this study, the researcher is concentrating on language used by human beings. Language as a human property is used to perform various functions in a society such as communication, instruction and socialization, which is why its study is<br/>exii<br/>indispensable. Linguists over the years have studied languages and have actually expanded the wings of language to various levels of Linguistic analysis or description such as phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics and Discourse.<br/>The graphic representation of sounds (speech sounds) on paper is called writing. Writing is done in different ways for various purposes and by different people. It is because of this that the study of stylistics becomes necessary and an important area to both linguists and critics.<br/>According to Syal and Jindal (2010)<br/>“Stylistics is that branch of linguistics which takes the language of literary texts as its object of study”.<br/>Stylistics is the study of various styles used in literary and non – literary texts which distinguishes the uniqueness of a writer from another.<br/>Style is a pattern of linguistic features that distinguish a piece of writing from another; it also distinguishes the personality of an author from another. No wonder the French scholar Buffon said “Style is the Man”.<br/>exiii<br/>Syal and Jindal (2010) opined that:<br/>Out of the many types of variations that occur in language, it is the variation in literary style that is most complex, and thus offers unlimited scope for linguistic analysis. (61).<br/>Stylistics is very important in Literature because each literary text represents an individual‟s use of language which reflects his unique personality, thoughts and style.<br/>The study of literary styles shows the linguistics repertoire of a writer. We often hear of the style of Armah; the style of Milton and the simplicity that is associated with Wordsworth.<br/>Stylistics looks at the choice of words, the sentence patterns and figurative usage of words by a writer. Figurative expressions which are sometimes called “Rhetorical Expression” helps a writer to be vivid in his description of events and ideas.<br/>According to Ezugu:<br/>Figures of speech, sometimes called “rhetorical” figures are expressions, phrases or words used to convey more than their ordinary literal meaning. These figures, if properly used, not only enrich but strengthen and give life to our writing.<br/>Ezugu (2011)<br/>exiv<br/>Some of the features used in a achieving style include:<br/>- Diction, figurative usage and various sentence structures such as:<br/>- Parenthetical Expressions: These are words, clauses or even another sentence inserted at the middle or end of a sentence such as after thoughts.<br/>- Compound Sentence: A compound sentence is one which consists of three or more simple sentences joined together by a co-ordinating conjunction or semi – colon.<br/>- Complex Sentence: A complex sentence consists of two parts. The main clause and one or more subordinate clauses.<br/>- Compound complex sentence: This consists of two or more main clauses and one or more subordinate clause.<br/>Other features of style include:<br/>- Graphology: The analysis of hand writing to interpret character and personality. Aspects of which are ”Italics, Bold sentence” and capitalization”.<br/>exv<br/>- Code Switching: A system of switching from one linguistic code to another.<br/>- Code – Mixing: A systematic way of mixing two or more linguistics codes in an utterance or writing.<br/>- Transliteration: This is the literal translation of the syntatical structure of a language into another language<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Although many works have been done on stylistics, little work has been done on style used in Chimamanda Adichie‟s<br/>Half of a yellow sun which was published in 2006. Most of the works done were based on general analysis of how her works reflect the realities of the society. To the knowledge of this researcher, no work has been done on the stylistic analysis of the devices used in her work, hence, the decision of the researcher to investigate the style of the author in this her second widely acclaimed novel Half of A yellow Sun.<br/>exvi<br/>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study aims at an identification of the predominant stylistic devices used in Chimamanda Adichie‟s Half Of A Yellow Sun and the effect these devices have in the over all evaluation of the novel.</p>\n\nSTYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE’S HALF OF A YELLOW SUN 2<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE’S HALF OF A YELLOW SUN 2", "id": 58}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1     <strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Language is the distinctive quality unique to man. It is what enables man to express him/herself and communicate with his/her fellow man, and it is acquired naturally. According to Fromkin et al “…language is the source of human life and power” (3). They also state that “we use language to convey information to others…, ask questions…, give command…, and express wishes” (173).  There are two specific media of using language: oral – which is by words of mouth; and written – which is a graphic representation of words on paper.</p> <p>It is in the use of language that style comes in. Style shows the difference between one piece of writing and the other. According to Adejare, “style is an ambiguous term…” (1). He further states that the term style means different things to different professions. Some examples are: to a psychologist, style is a form of behaviour, to the critic, style is individuality and to the linguist, it is the formal structures in function (1).</p> <p>       Stylistics is the study of oral and written texts. It is the description of the linguistic characteristics (which means features of linguistics) of all situationally restricted uses of language. Linguistics is the scientific study of language or of a particular language. Linguistics is scientific because it applies the method of objective observation, collection, classification and application of facts to the study of language.</p> <p>Stylistics focuses on texts and gives much attention to the devices, parts of speech and figures of speech. It goes further to look into the effects of the use of the devices on the reader.</p> <p>Talking about the scope of stylistics, Onwukwe Ekwutosi gave four distinctive types of stylistics and they are:</p> <p>1.                 General stylistics</p> <p>2.                  Literary stylistics</p> <p>3.                 Stylo-stylistics</p> <p>4.                 Phono-stylistics</p> <p>General stylistics deals with the non-dialectical varieties found within a language. In other words, it deals with situational or contextual use of language, that is, variation according to use. It also includes variation of language according to field of discourse, variation according to mode of discourse and finally, variation according to style of discourse.</p> <p>Literary stylistics deals with language use in literature, that is, variations, characteristics of individual writer that made mark in literature. Often, we hear people talk about the style of Shakespeare, Milton, Achebe or Soyinka.</p> <p>And also, stylo-stylistics deals with the qualification of stylistic pattern. It studies the statistical structure of literary texts often using computers. Finally, phono-stylistics is the study of expression of aesthetic function of sound.</p> <p>Stylistic features can be described as features that produce style. They include linguistic features such as diction(writer’s choice of words, such as clichés, archaism, polysyllabic, monosyllabic), sentence structure such as loose and period sentences, parallelism, parenthetical expressions and passive expressions. Other features are cohesion, coherence, use of punctuation marks and figures of speech such as metaphor, simile, hyperbole, metonymy and personification, slang, colloquialism and connotation.</p> <p><strong>Diction:</strong> By diction, the reader looks at the simplicity or the difficulty of words chosen by the writer to express himself.</p> <p><strong>Sentence:</strong> It is made up of words that express a complete thought. It is the basic unit of thought in any communication. Both oral and written languages are made up of sentences. There are two main kind of sentences; loose and periodic sentences.</p> <p><strong>Loose sentence:</strong> It is the kind of sentence that states the main point at the beginning. Even when the statement is grammatically complete, one or more explanatory clauses or phrases come after it.</p> <p><strong>Periodic sentence:</strong> This kind of sentence keeps the main point for the end. The sentence is not grammatically complete until the end of the sentence.</p> <p><strong>Parallelism:</strong> It is the use of pattern repetition in a literary text for a particular stylistic effect.</p> <p><strong>Parenthetical expression:</strong> It is used to give more information and also as an after thought in a statement.</p> <p><strong>Passive expression:</strong> This is the use of words in the past tense to show the time of action.</p> <p><strong>Cohesion:</strong> It is a linguistic phenomenon which explains the way discourse is structured or organized with regard to message. It is a binding force that ties together stretches of utterances.</p> <p><strong>Coherence:</strong> This is the arrangement of sentence in a logical order.</p> <p><strong>Punctuation marks:</strong> Are signs in writing to divide sentences and phrases and to make meanings clear.</p> <p><strong>Figure of speech:</strong> A figure of speech is an expression used figuratively rather than literary. It gives a deeper meaning to word. Some examples are:</p> <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Is a comparison between two dissimilar things which have something in common.</p> <p><strong>Simile:</strong> It is a clear comparison between two dissimilar things. These two unlike items however share something in common. It is this common characteristic that is emphasized by the use of like or as …as.</p> <p><strong>Hyperbole:</strong> It is an overstatement where the speaker exaggerates what he is saying out of proportion.</p> <p><strong>Metonymy:</strong> This is using a word for something to refer to another with which it has become closely associated.</p> <p><strong>Personification:</strong> It is giving human quality to an inanimate object.</p> <p><strong>Slang:</strong> Very informal words and expressions that are more common in spoken language, especially used by a particular group of people.</p> <p><strong>Colloquialism:</strong> A word or phrase that is used in conversation but not in formal speech in writing.</p> <p><strong>Connotation:</strong> It is the additional meaning the word gains because of the different environment in which a word has been used in the past.</p> <p><strong>Archaism:</strong> This is the use of old and middle English words which are no longer in general usage today.Some examples are, “thereto”, “thou”.</p> <p><strong>Clichés:</strong> They are phrases or ideas that have been used so often that it no longer has much meaning and is not interesting.</p> <p> A way of stylistic analysis is taking a text and analyzing it at the various levels of linguistic organization – phonological, morphological, syntactic, and semantic levels. It is the identification of patterns of usage in speech and writing.

In the past, women did not exist as individuals with personalities to defend. They rather existed as mere docile and exotic accompaniments to the males. Throughout that period, women lacked a voice to articulate their dilemma and their point of view. They, thus, accepted their fate without resistance.</p> <p>          In those days, these women, in addition to experiencing the same oppressive social condition as their male counterparts in a developing world, were subjected to extra repressive burdens arising from the socio-cultural structures of patriarchy and gender hierarchy. These years of subjugation have, however, produced in today’s women relentless questioning of the status quo. They protest against dehumanization, political enslavement and social oppression. They rationalize that the running of the African world is not the preserve for males and thus there should be absolute equality of both sexes in all spheres of life. Such a reaction is termed feminism, which is an ideology that urges, in simple term, recognition of the claims of women for equal rights with men.</p> <p>          The term feminism usually refers to a historically recent European and American social movements founded to struggle for female equality. Feminism by this designation has become a global political project.</p> <p>African female writers have come a long way from the 1960’s when the few women that published fiction could be counted on one fingers and they were hardly noticed by critics or if noticed at all, were not taken seriously. At the end of the twentieth century, it was no longer out of place to talk about generations of female African writers or categorize female authors as ‘established’ or ‘emerging’. Nadine Gordimer, a female writer from South Africa had won the noble prize for literature in 1991. two years later, the African continent lost a leading female writer Flora Nwapa of Nigeria. A novelist, short story writer, and poet, Flora Nwapa held in her hands on her death bed on 17 October 1993, the first printed copies of her three new plays; sycophants (SIC). A pioneer African Female Novelist, she had published poetry and short stories before revealing her talents as a playwright, etc.</p> <p>          The phenomenon of female change was not limited to creative artists. African women scholars too, were no longer satisfied to have somebody else define for them the aesthetics of female writing, or patronizingly describe for them the dynamic and intrinsic reality of being a woman in the African socio-cultural and political environment.</p> <p>          This issue of African literature today is entirely devoted to African writers and the presentation of women in African literature. This in itself is a recognition of two important facts: first, that African women writers, as a number of articles in the collection point out, have been neglected in the largely male authored journals, critical studies and critical anthologies and secondly, that the last ten years or so have seen a tremendous blossoming of highly accomplished work by African women writers and it would have been in excusable to continue to ignore them. The second fact partly, though not entirely offers an explanation for the first. If the critical attention has been scanty, it is partly because up-to the end of the 1960’s the literary output of African women was also rather scanty. This is most probably due to a number of well known historical and sociological factors. Writing and education go hand in hand and for all kinds of sociological and other reasons the education of women in Africa lagged far behind that of men. Adetokunbo Pearce’s article on Efua Suther Land’s plays suggest precisely how public the role of the dramatist could be and usually is, but African societies have been slow in according to women this ‘senior’ position and public exposure.</p> <p>          In this regard it might seem strange, perhaps, that the genre in which African women have featured last is that of poetry, which is the most private of the genres. The face remains, however, that in so far as Africa is concerned, the role of the poet also has always been public. The death of African women writers, up-till the very recent past, is therefore probably in itself a consequence of traditional African attitudes towards women.</p> <p>          Feminism is the belief, largely originating in the west on the social, economic and political equality of sexes represented worldwide by various institutions committed to activity on behalf of women’s rights in interest.</p> <p>          Feminist is someone who supports the idea that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men. The term feminism tend to be used and the women’s right movement which began in the late 18th Century and continues to campaign for political, social and economic equality between women and men.</p> <p>          In Hook’s (1984) explanation in Akorede (1996; 50) feminism is the movement concerned with the positive promotion of the image of the woman and the creation of female consciousness and awareness.</p> <p>          Nnolim’s (1994:248) view is that feminism as a movement and ideology urges, in simple terms, the recognition of the claims of women for equal rights with men in legal, political, economic, social and marital situation. For Helen Chukwuma (1994: IX): Feminism in African Literature, it is a rejection of inferiority and a striving for recognition, it seeks to give a woman a sense of self as a worthy effectual and contribution human being. It is a reaction against such stereotypes of women which deny them a positive identity. It set out to enhance the position of women in a predominantly male oriented society. Chukwuma (1994: IX) states that what feminist writers articulate is the dire need of African women for recognition and partnership.</p> <p>          She further asserts that feminism is based on the theory of individuality, recognition of the personhood of women and equally opportunity for development. Filomina Steady (1981: 74) in the Black women cross culturally writers that true feminism is . . . a determination to be resourceful and self reliant.</p> <p>For the gender training manual for Higher Education by Akin Aina and Taiwo (2000: 11) feminism is a label for a political position which indicate support for the empowerment of women.</p> <p>          We have two main branches of feminism: Radical feminism and liberal feminism.</p> <p><strong>Radical Feminism</strong></p> <p>          A third theory of feminism according to Akin Aina and Taiwo (1999: 7) is radical feminism which places the concept of patriarchy at the center of gender inequality. Radical feminists claim that women as a class are and have probably always been dominated and controlled by men as a class and that this domination and control pervade all aspects of their lives. It is not only in the sphere of paid work and in the relations between the public and domestic spheres that women are oppressed but also in their child bearing and rearing in the family, in sexual relations such as rape and prostitution and in politics.</p> <p><strong>Liberal Feminism</strong></p> <p>          Akin-Aina and Taiwo, (1999: 17) “Development and Equality: an overview’”. Explain that liberal feminism stemmed from the increasing importance placed upon individual human rights and freedoms that occurred during the 1700’s.</p> <p>           Liberal feminists believe that as human beings, women have a natural right to the same opportunities and freedoms as men. The approach they adopts is to campaign to gain for women rights which were previously men’s exclusive preserve. They campaign against laws which discriminated against women but were claimed to be for their protection. Liberal feminism sees the root of the problem of gender inequality as the socialization process of children.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>          The purpose of this study is to promote the issue of feministic activities in our society by bringing out the feministic issues in Sefi Atta’sEvery thing Good Will Come and Ama Ata Aidoo’s Changes.</p> <p>          The main purpose of this research is to sensitize women on the issue of feminism and the roles of some feminists in the society. This research is aimed at imparting in people the feminist ideals and positive roles displayed by women in an attempt to change some of the traditional beliefs and practices imposed on them by their male counterparts.</p> <p><strong>1.3     Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>          Feminism is regarded as an ideology that urges in simple terms, recognition of the claims of women for equal rights with men. The struggle to rejuvenate the wounded dignity of Africa womanhood has been a dominating theme over the years. The situation still prevails even in this age of modernism. The Africa women have to fight against an oppressive culture and its attendant discrimination. A number of writers have attempted to analyze the ideology from different perspective and this has led us to carryout research on this topic: Feministic Issues in Ama Ata Aidoo’sChanges and Sefi Atta’s Everything Good Will Come.</p> <p><strong>1.4     Significant of the Study</strong></p> <p>          This research work in feministic Issues in Ama Ata Aidoo’s Changesand Sefi Atta’s Everything Good Will Come will be of great important to many.</p> <p>          It will show that feminism is one of the themes which have been portrayed in Africa drama, poetry and most important in Africa prose. It shows that some African writers believe in the equality of women and men. This research work will also educate the minds of men who think or feel that women are less important to the society.</p> <p>          This research work will be of great important for students researchers who would go into researching on feminism, thereby serving as a secondary material to them.</p> <p><strong>1.5     Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>          This research work will be on Feministic Issues of textual analysis inEverything Good Will Come and Changes.</p> <p>          Reference would also be made to other western countries related materials in carrying out this research.</p> <p>          There will be a review of other relevant related works (both drama and prose) of other African writers which have treated feminism.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Research Methodology</strong></p> <p>          The primary and the main source of information of this work are the two novels Changes and Everything Good Will Come. And the secondary source of information includes, journals, internet materials.</p>\n\nFEMINISTIC ISSUES IN AMA ATA AIDOO’S CHANGES AND SEFI ATTA’S EVERYTHING GOOD WILL COME<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FEMINISTIC ISSUES IN AMA ATA AIDOO’S CHANGES AND SEFI ATTA’S EVERYTHING GOOD WILL COME", "id": 60}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0     INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p>          Nigeria’s political problems sprang from the carefree manner in which the British took over, administered, and abandoned the government and people of Nigeria. British administrators did not make an effort to weld the country together and unite the heterogeneous groups of people. Though, many things we have today is due to their enlightenment, they still left us hanging. According to Adewele Ademoyega in his book Why We Struck1981, he said that when the British came, they forcibly rubber-stamped the political state of the ethnic groups of Nigeria, and maintained that status quo until the left. According to him upon their departure nearly a hundred years later, the people resumed fighting for their political rights.</p> <p>          When the British came to Nigeria as an imperial nation to take over the rulership of the country from 1861 (with the cession of Lagos), they met the people of the south totally free, only observing and regulating their own monarchies and institutions (Adewele Ademoyega: Why We Struck). Chinua Achebe in his work or novel Things Fall Apart, 1958, tries to portray the life Africans lived before and during the arrival of the Europeans in Nigeria.</p> <p>          Things Fall Apart tells the tragic story of the rise and fall of Okonkwo and the equally tragic story of the disintegration of Igbo culture, symbolized by the agrarian society of Umofia, under the relentless encroachments of British Christian imperialism.</p> <p>          For Achebe, Mister Johnson represents the worst kind of portrayal of Africans by Europeans. To him, the portrayal was all the more disheartening because John Cary was working hard to achieve and accurate depiction, unlike many British authors during the imperial colonial period who deliberately, often cynically, exploited stereotyped of Africans and African society. It was precisely because John Cary was a liberal-minded and sympathetic writer, as well as a colonial administrator that Achebe felt the record had to be set straight. Achebe’s purpose then is to write about and for his own people. His first novels form a continuum over one hundred years of Igbo civilization. The Europeans have not yet penetrated Umuofia, the setting of the first novel, when Things Fall Apart beings. When the novel ends colonial rule has been established. His other novels talk about the different changes that took place before independence and after it.</p> <p>          The British governed Nigerian indirectly through their traditional rulers, as a result, the true leader of the masses hamstrung and held down. Just because Africans were given authority to rule over her own people, they saw it as a means to maltreat those that have wronged them, extort from those that have more than them and sell his/her own brother and sister for favours from the superior leaders - The British. (Adewele Ademoyega: Why We Struck).</p> <p>          These actions by the local and foreign leaders made the people to sort for independence. Many of them were not thinking straight any more. Many people now saw the need to transfer their faults to others using others as an excuse. The present leader blame the colonial masters and fore runners-for-independence for their actions for not doing what is expected of them well and also for the embezzlement and stealing of public funds. They claim that the colonial masters taught them to do so. The political elites in other to become rich and influencial in the society, steal and blame it on the economy and leaders. No one takes responsibility for his own crime and faults.</p> <p>          Between the politicians and the military they blame one another for a bad government no one agrees that the other is better than himself. In the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, people do all type of things just to steal from the petroleum companies they believe that it is their own right and bunkering which is a common business there is not stealing. That is why Tanure Ojaide uses his novel The Activist to enlighten the people of what is happening in the Niger Delta areas. He says those that claim to be literate in the society are the Chief Criminals sabotaging one another. Everybody in the country is in one way or the other suffering from the harms political corruption brought, we are psychosocial disordered.</p> <p>          Kole Omotoso in his fictions focuses on identifying the problems in Nigerian society and proposing solution. He lived his childhood and adolescence, sharing the nationalist dreams of peace, progress, and prosperity, as an adult and as a writer, he was forced to watch the systematic deferment of these dreams after independence for decades after freedom from colonial rule, Nigeria was cursed by civil strife, including a civil war (1967 – 1970) and incessant military coups d’etat. These events, together with undemocratic rule political chicanery and bureaucratic cynicism resulted in a steady decline in the quality of life in a nation that, because it is the most populous black nation on earth is often looked upon as representative of the black race. Omotoso tries to use fiction to talk about the decay and chaos in the society but he tries to make it less real like Armah did in his The Beautyful Ones are not yet Born.</p> <p><strong>1.1     Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>          Political corruption is the use of legislated powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain misuse of government power for other purposes, such as repression of political opponents and general police brutality is also considered political corruption.</p> <p>          Forms of corruption vary, it include: bribery, extortion, cronyism, nepotism, patronage, graft and embezzlement. While corruption may facilitate criminal enterprises such as drug trafficking, money laundering and trafficking, it is not restricted to these activities. While political corruption is an illegal abuse of power, psychosocial disorder is the mental reaction one gets from it.</p> <p>Psychosocial disorder is a mental illness caused or influenced by maladjusted cognitive and behavioural processes.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>          Due to the political dictatorship and the high rate of starvation and poverty in the country, many of the people are suffering from problems caused by the many ways they are treated and controlled.</p> <p>          Their manner of thinking have been blurred with the idea that if they steal or kill to survive, it is not a crime because their leader are also thieves who loot the national treasure and put is in their foreign accounts.</p> <p>          Again due to this, the citizens are psychosocially disordered and their minds corrupt. The key problem is the government. Because of the corrupt nature of the society, the government sells her pride and glory to foreign companies and enterprise. This people now treat the natural inhabitants of the areas where the companies are located like animals without dignity. Example is the Niger Delta area of Nigeria which is the oil producing state.</p> <p>The major problem is between the people and her government. Both are psychologically and socially sick. The pain of poverty and starvation in abundant money have destroyed the peoples mind that they no longer think or reason straight.</p> <p><strong>1.3     Aim and Objectives</strong></p> <p>          The objectives of this research are;</p> <p>To identify the problems caused by political corruption and</p> <p>To provide suggestion to the prevention of political corruption and psychosocial disorder and find a way to eliminate it completely from the society in general.</p> <p><strong>1.4            </strong><strong>Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>Political corruption and psychosocial disorder using The Activist by Tanure Ojaide and Arrow of Rain by Oke Ndibe, will serve as a good material to student’s researchers.</p> <p>          This work will show how the government and the citizens and foreign companies helped in the corruption of the society and her environment and how the act of corruption has disordered everything.</p> <p><strong>1.5     Scope of Research</strong></p> <p>          This project is restricted to the study of the political corruption and psychosocial disorder, using Tanure Ojaide’s The Activist and Okey Ndibe’sArrow of Rain and other relevant literary work of some other Nigerian and African prose writers and commentaries on corruption.</p> <p>          The research is divided into five chapters, chapter one consist of the introduction, definition of term, statement of the problem, aims and objectives, significance of the study, scope of research and research methodology.

In the past, women did not exist as individuals with personalities to defend. They rather existed as mere docile and exotic accompaniments to the males. Throughout that period, women lacked a voice to articulate their dilemma and their points of view. They, thus, accepted their fate without resistance. Such passive stance results from societal conditioning through questionable cultural practices. From birth, through childhood and adolescence, to adulthood, Africans receive from society and others around the messages and feedbacks which launch them into roles and behaviors considered appropriate for males and females respectively. Most often, female are accorded inferior roles and such long years of cultural suppression and intimidation, unfortunately, misled the women into an underestimation of their capabilities and self worth. Encased in such a cultural mystique, the African women were particularly driven by a community sense since culture obviates individualism. In those days, these women, in addition to experiencing the same oppressive social condition as their male counterparts in a developing world, were subjected to extra repressive burdens arising from the socio-cultural structures of patriarchy and gender hierarchy. These years of subjugation have, however, produced in today’s women relentless questioning of the status quo. They protest against dehumanization, political enslavement and social oppression. They rationalize that the running of the Africa world is not the preserve for males and thus there should be absolute equality of both sexes in all spheres of life. Such a reaction is termed feminism, which is an ideology that urges, in simple terms, recognition of the claims of women for equal rights with men.</p> <p>          According to Cora Kaplan (162) Literary text are constructed from within ideology, and the reality they articulate is dependent on the historical culture which surrounds them; so too are the literary critical claims about their truthfulness or authenticity determined by the culture from which they arise. Helen Chukwuma (xiv) specifically contends that African feminism is dedicated and informed from within, from social realities that obtain. One of such realities is the persistence of sexist socio-psychological paradigm despite the efforts to overcome “the androcentricism which informs social life”. (Uko, 33)</p> <p>           The persistent sexism in Africa is, however, matched with women’s continued aggressive demand for equal places in men’s former citadel of power and privilege. The chorus African women say to men “whatever the case maybe, you will never again hear us pronounce the words of the Virgin Mary, ‘thy will be done’ while smiling at your despotic power”. (Josephine Felicite in Moses, C.G. and Rabine, L. 308-309). They argue that it is better for men to desire from them those noble and generous feelings which must exist between equals than those mercenary feelings which a slave has for his master. Consequent upon this quest and argument, there is a recent definition of womanhood in the context of the African cosmic order: “A human being endowed with all the capabilities and talents required to effectively function and make impact on all levels of life within society” (Adeife Osemeikhiam, 21).</p> <p>         Notwithstanding the above stance, there still abounds in Africa, evidence of gender stereotypes which simply means a collection of commonly held beliefs or opinions about what are “appropriate” behaviors and activities for males and those that are “appropriate” for females. As a result of this, even though men support women’s condemnation of their (women) societal deprivations, men’s language still betrays subtle inclination to sexist socialization.</p> <p><em>The New Lexicon Webster’s Encyclopedic Dictionary of the English Language</em>, Sexism is exemplified firstly as attitudes and institutions, often unconscious that judge human worth on the grounds of gender or sex.</p> <p>         It is explained as prejudice or discrimination usually against women, based on their gender. Sexist socialization, therefore, refers to the process by which infants and children are brought up to imbibe attitudes and practices that discriminate against women on the grounds of their gender.</p> <p>        This work examines <em>So Long a Letter</em> with a view to highlight its characteristic language usage and as well as the psychological disposition that informs such use of language. Research findings by anthropologists, educationists and sociolinguistics show that traditionally, males use non-standard language; females use the language of rapport while males use the language of report; discursive language style is meant for women while men are given to the language of theories and abstractions; females use polite language meant to maintain harmony and strong relationship as well as to keep conversations open whereas males use the language of assertiveness and insistence. Women use the language of solidarity but men use the language of the expert.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Men in Africa make women understand that they, the men, are the head of the  family that is, they are superior to women. They see women as being weak and as a result, women have no say in the activities of the community. They have no rights and are subjugated to do whatever he the men want them to do especially in Africa. Women are made to feel inferior and this breeds some sort of ill feelings in women.</p> <p><strong>Objective of the study</strong></p> <p><strong>The aim of this is to identify how Mariama Ba uses language to portray feminism - the reaction of females against the oppressive and discriminatory culture experienced by them</strong><strong>- in her novel <em>So Long a Letter.</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p><strong>          The topic Language in Feminist Literature: a study of Mariama Ba’s <em>So Long a Letter</em>, will serve as a good research material to students and other researchers.</strong></p> <p><strong>          This work will throw more light on the language of feminism and its impact to society.</strong></p> <p><strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>          This project is restricted primarily to the study of the Language in Feminist Literature in Mariama Ba’s <em>So Long a Letter</em>.</p> <p><strong>Research Methodology</strong></p> <p>          The primary material of this work is Mariama Ba’s <em>So Long a Letter</em>while the secondary materials include the various works from the library.</p>\n\nLANGUAGE IN FEMINIST LITERATURE: A STUDY OF MARIAMA BA’S SO LONG A LETTER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " LANGUAGE IN FEMINIST LITERATURE: A STUDY OF MARIAMA BA’S SO LONG A LETTER", "id": 62}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p> viii</p> <p>Ecocoritical studies intensely show the relationship between man’s environment and literature. In this way, ecocriticism becomes a standpoint that brings environmental discourse to the fore within a literary context; a context that shows the exploitation and decay in man’s environment. Following this assertion, the themes that border on environmental degradation are routed in migration, pipeline vandalism, blowouts owing to gas flares and pollution. Most of the analyses on the concept of ecocriticism take the direction of the greenish nature of the environment and the extent of the marginalisation of a people. This research views ecocritism from a different perspective. It depicts ecocritism as a theory that deploys the tools of ecoactivism and resistance in the reading and analyses of Tanure Ojiade’s <em>The Activist</em> and Kaine Agary’s <em>Yellow-Yellow</em>. It also shows the manner in which humans strive to unchain themselves from the manacles that hold them bondage by resisting the discourse of ecotrauma. This study also delves into the negative impacts of oil activities in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria by connecting the ecocritical patterns of ecoactivism and resistance to the utterances and actions of the characters in the texts.</p> <p> 1</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Man cannot be separated from his environment because his perception and interaction with his surrounding make up his being. The destruction of the natural things that surround man is caused by man himself by the acts of destroying and recreating his habitat. Thus, ecocritical studies examine the way in which humans and the natural environment interact and counter each other. Byron Caminero-Santangelo will comment in his essay that ‘Laurence Coupe sees ecocritism as an approach to literature which considers the relationship between human and non-human life as represented in literary texts and which theorizes about the place of literature in the struggle against environmental destruction’ (705).</p> <p>The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is rich in crude oil, but it is in a state of omnishambles because of ecological problems. The discovery, exploration and exploitation of oil in the region have affected agriculture, fishing as well as the living conditions of the people. With the leakage of oil from pipes and its spillage into lands, farms, and water, the Niger Deltans are faced with a threatening disaster. Best Ordinohia and Seiyefa Brisibe note that ‘oil spillage affected at least 1500 communities in the eight crude oil-producing states in Nigeria, and were mainly from the 5284 oil wells that were drilled as at 2006 and the 7000 km of crude oil pipeline that cross the Niger Delta region. Oil spillage often results in contamination of surface water with hydrocarbons and trace metals, as measured using atomic spectrometry’(4). They further note that ‘th e crude oil of the region contains some naturally occurring radioactive materials. The crude oil spillage reduces soil fertility. It also smothers economic trees and food crops, outrightly killing them or reducing their</p> <p> 2</p> <p>yield causing a 60% reduction in household food security. The deterioration of the quality of staple food leads to a 24% increase in the prevalence of childhood malnutrition’ (4). Crude oil spillage also results in the bio-accumulation of heavy metals in surviving food crops like cassava and pumpkin. Pat Okpoko in <em>Environmental Impact of Technological Intrusion in</em> <em>Nigeria </em>notes that crops and economic trees affected by oil spillage show signs of scorching, yellowing and shedding of leaves, stunted growth and death’ (4). He notes further that ‘fishes caught from the polluted streams are often unpalatable and show signs of reduced growth and reproductive performance and consequently decreased population’ (62).</p> <p>When pushed to the wall, some Niger Deltans try to make the government and the world to understand their predicament. This has led to untold violence, killing, maiming, gunrunning, destruction and vandalism of pipelines, and the kidnapping of foreigners. Young girls who cannot find jobs find succour in the hands of foreigners and wealthy Nigerian men who after sleeping with them give them money that ought to be naturally theirs. Chris Onyema notes that ‘since the discovery and commercial exploration of oil in this area in 1958 until date, the people of the Niger Delta have been suffering from acts of bioterrorism, oil pollution of lands and water, gas flaring, hunger, diseases and poverty. Poverty breeds prostitution, gas flaring breeds cancer and respiratory diseases’ (189). Sometimes, they feel that violence is the only answer to their problem. After the amnesty that was granted to the militants of Niger Delta, some of its indigenes still resort to thuggery. Ojaide says that ‘the area boys were fighters attempting not only to reclaim what had been robbed from them, but also holding firmly to what was theirs that others were attempting to snatch away’ (55). For Ato Quayson, ‘violence becomes a means by which some people visit displeasure on those associated with the state, particularly minor officials and those seen as colluding with it’ (58). Also, Ngugi wa Thiong’o lends his voice to that of Quayson to say that ‘violence in order to change an intolerant unjust social order is not savagery, it purifies man. Violence to protect</p> <p> 3</p> <p>and preserve an unjust oppressive social order is criminal and diminishes man’. (28). It is against the marginalization of the economic and political deprivation of the people of Niger-Delta that Ken Saro-Wiwa and his Ogoni people fought and died for. Saro Wiwa views the exploration of oil by multinational companies as anti- people exploitation. Ed Simon will subscribe to Sam Uniamikogbo and Stanley Aibieyi view that ‘considering the role of oil in National Development, the struggle for indigenous control of activities in the industry has persisted over the years. Among oil exploring countries like Mexico and Libya, this struggle has culminated in apparent revolution, which ultimately forced out foreign oil firms from the industry and made way for national control of oil operations’ (157). The blame for the pollution and spillage of oil in the Niger Delta region are not supposed to be apportioned to foreigners alone because Nigerian leaders collude in the decay that is threatening to gulp the nation. Oil activities take a toll on the people of the region, and people migrate to other parts of the country in search of a better life. It is ironical that the region that contributes to the growth and development of the nation cannot cater for the needs of its indigenes.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The criticism and analyses of the decay in the environment have been done from different angles, with most researchers focusing on the gaseous and non gaseous state of man’s environment, while some researchers critique <em>The Activist</em> and <em>Yellow-Yellow</em> under the themes of political activism, the girl-child education and the representation of the male figures as depicted in the primary texts. The lacuna the researcher filled is the analyses of <em>The</em> <em>Activist </em>and<em> Yellow-Yellow </em>using the ecocritical tools of ‘Ecoactivism and Resistance’. The researcher also related the portrayal of the negative impact of oil activities in the primary texts to the tools of ecoactivism and resistance. In the long run, the protagonists are studied,</p> <p> 4</p> <p>to find out their bearings and the manner in which their environment affects their characters and their relationship with other characters in the texts. In <em>the Activist</em>, the Activist, like Ken Saro-Wiwa is an ecoactivist. As a way of liberating his people from marginalisation, he teams up with Pere Ighogboja, to set up an oil bunkering business. In <em>Yellow-Yellow</em>, there is Zilayefa, who leaves her village for the assumed comfort the city offers. There is a chain binding the industrial activities of oil and its result in the lives of the characters of the narratives. With the spillage of oil into water, fishes and water are condemned. When oil spills into farms, many people give up farming and they look for alternative means of livelihood. For some who dare to challenge the status quo, they resort to vandalism of pipelines to get even with the government. For some in the village, migrating to the cities to search for greener pasture become the only alternative, but they end up despondent and disillusioned.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The major aim of this research is to show the disastrous results we get by the rough handling of our environment by man. This we can detect by the actions of the characters in <em>Yellow-Yellow </em>and<em> the Activist </em>shown through the tools of ecoactivism and resistance<em>. </em>The researcher tries to avoid the repetition of the works previously done by other researchers by sticking to her research problem. Reference is made to other works depending on their connection and relation to this work, but the crux of the work is an in-depth analyses of the primary texts in order to fill the lacuna left by other researchers.</p> <p> 5</p> <p><strong>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research will add to the growing number of research done on environmental studies. It will also add to the rich and encouraging research done using the Niger Delta literary texts. The authors of the primary texts to be studied; Tanure Ojaide and Kaine Agary are from the rich but impoverished Niger Delta. Ojaide is from Delta State and Agary is from Rivers State. They are aware of the extent of the rot in their region. The significance cuts across almost all fields of life because man cannot be separated from his environment. When the environment is endangered, the responsibility of restoring it to its default nature rests on man. It will also be useful for other researchers whose fields of study border on environmental studies.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is based on the following texts: Tanure Ojaide’s <em>The Activist</em> and Kaine Agary’s <em>Yellow- Yellow.</em> The choice of these novels is not just because they are close to home, but because, to a great extent, they clearly show the economic and social result of oil exploration and exploitation. Where necessary, reference is made to other works that have ecological or ecocritical background. While analysing the texts, close attention is paid to actions, objects, thoughts, ideas that contribute to the degradation of man’s environment.</p> <p>The analyses in this research are dependent on ecocriticism. This theory shows that there is a relationship between literature and man’s environment. Glotfelty and Fromm opine that ‘most ecocritical works share a common motivation; the troubling awareness that we have reached the age of environmental limits, a time when the consequences of human</p> <p> 6</p> <p>actions are damaging the planet's basic life support systems. Either we change our ways or we face global catastrophe, destroying much beauty and exterminating countless fellow species in our headlong race to apocalypse’ (xx). It has been observed that not much work has been done on ecocritism by black writers and critics. Most of them refused to adopt ecocriticism or the literature of the environment. William Slaymaker notes that they feel that ecoliterature and ecocriticism are another attempt to ‘white out’ black Africa by colouring it green (683). Their hesitation is because of their suspicion of the green discourse emerging from Western centres. But, since the early nineties, black writers have shown interest in their environment, seeking for change, and redressing issues that relate to environmental hazards. It is noted that there is a branch of ecocriticism that sees to the globalization issues in any depth. The branch is referred to as ‘Envronmental Justice’. The United States Environmental Protection Agency defines ‘Environmental Justice’ a s ‘the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, colour, sex, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies’ (2). Slaymaker notes further that ‘it is obvious to black African intellectuals, as well as their white counterparts, that environmental justice, as a global paradigm, will be used in the world marketplace when decisions are made about production, consumption of resources, and pollution caused by modernization, industrialization, and population growth’ (684). In the long run, the scope will cover the primary texts of study, and on the theory the research is hinged on.</p>\n\nAN ECOCRITICAL ANALYSIS OF TANURE OJAIDE’S THE ACTIVIST AND KAINE AGARY’S YELLOW-YELLOW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ECOCRITICAL ANALYSIS OF TANURE OJAIDE’S THE ACTIVIST AND KAINE AGARY’S YELLOW-YELLOW", "id": 63}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>In English Language, there is a strong correlation between oral language skills and achievement in the writtenlanguage among learners in schools. In Nigeria, English remains the undisputed language of school instruction, governance, administration, legislation, judiciary, international relations, unification of the country‘s numerous ethnic constituents, social prestige, and so on (Adeniran, 1980; Okedara 1997; Oluga, Adewusi, Babalola, Oyediran, 1999; FGN, 2004; Osisanwo, 2005).</p> <p>English language is taught as a subject and at the same time it is a medium of instruction for other subjects in the Nigeria education curriculum.The aim and objectives of teaching oral skills in English being taught in the Nigeria education curriculum is to make the student communicate effectively and intelligently in English. It also helps the student to develop confidence in his ability to express himself in English as fluently as possible and provides an opportunity for thecorrection of mistakes in spoken English.</p> <p>A good approach to oral language instruction will developsthe reading, writing and speaking skills of the student thereby making the learning of English language more effective and the learning experiences of the learners in other subjects being taught in Secondary Schools more concrete and more enjoyable.</p> <p>Thisresearch seek to study and identify the factors affecting Oral English instruction in Secondary Schools in Osogbo local government Area of Osun State.</p> <p><strong>1.1     BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The English language has become greatly valued and adorned in Nigeria’s Educational system. As remarked by Bamgbose, Banjo &amp; Thomas (1995), “the dominance of English in formal and transactional communication is unchallengeable”. In view of the multilingual nature of Nigeria, with more than 400 indigenous languages (Ufomata 1995), English is regarded as the only feasible and realistic choice for the nation now and in the foreseeable future. The greatest efforts expended on English language in Nigeria have been in the area of the Educational system, particularly in relation to Nigerian indigenous languages of which the major ones are Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba, Ibibio, Edo, Fulfulde, and Kanuri. English as the official language of Nigeria and also the former colonial language was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country. English, however remains an exclusive preserve of the country’s urban elite, and is not widely spoken in the rural areas which comprise three quarters of the country’s population.</p> <p>Language planning in Africa has to take place against the background of several factors, including multilingualism, the colonial legacy, the role of education as an agent of social change, high incidence of illiteracy, and concerns for communication, national integration and development (Bamgbose, 2000: 99) Thereforelearners of English language as a second language are mostly faced with the problem of oral proficiency in terms of appropriate pronunciation of English sounds (phonemes) either by virtue of being anew language or mother tongue or first language interference. However, there has been emphasis on the quest for Standard English, hence; an English language Instructor as well as learner must aim at proficiency to a degree of the standard form (Standard English or Received Pronunciation). This enables the instructor and the learner to acquire adequate competence for practical purpose of teaching and everyday communication.</p> <p>It is on this note, that much emphasis and efforts should be placed on the teaching of Oral English because it will help the learner to develop his or her pronunciation sufficiently to permit effective communication with both native speakers and non-native users. Similarly, it is obvious that common mistakes identified among the teachers and learners of English as a second language today include improper pronunciation, mispronunciation, poor intonation, as well as misrepresentation of phonetic sounds. For instance, most students misplace the qualities and length of vowels. It is in view of these problems that recent development in language teaching and learning has made the teaching and learning of oral English not only a necessity but also a pre-requisite for assessing the learner’s competence in language use and acquisition.</p> <p>Therefore, since emphasis has shifted to studying varied rules aimed at the identification, interpretation and reproduction of English sounds (phonemes), there is every cause to emphasise and to review the teaching of oral English especially in post-primary schools. Furthermore, speech is regarded as persona which represents an individual’s ability to articulate phonemes according to some established norms. It also entails the ability of an individual to identify and understand the representation and meaning of English sounds. It is quite unfortunate that most of our secondary school learners do not exhibit the knowledge of oral English when using the language which could be associated with the aforementioned factors. In a nutshell, there is the need for concern.</p> <p>Oral proficiency should be made inherent in both Instructors (teachers)and learners (students). Jowitt(1991) confirms that the emphasis on proficiency in spoken English was introduced in the New National Curriculum in English language for Nigerian Secondary Schools in the 1980s. It was previously neglected in the teaching of English in Nigeria as oral English was made optional for the West African School Certificate students (though a compulsory course for teacher grade II examinations in those days). Roach (2000) confirms that pronunciation teaching has not always been popular with teachers and language theorists and in the 1970s and 1980s. It was fashionable to treat it as a rather outdated activity. It was claimed that it makes learners try to sound like native speakers of Received Pronunciation, which became difficult and led to repetitive exercises, and it also failed to give importance to communication.</p> <p>Jowitt (1991) comments about the negligence of oral English teaching on teachers. He stated that pupils unconsciously relied on mother tongue models when deprived them of consistent and reliable guidance from teachers, as indeed many of teachers did: assuming that there was a perfect correspondence between sound and spelling. They use orthography as their guide to pronunciation. Anthony (2001) and Uche (1998) emphasise the difficulties of acquiring oracy skills. According to Williams (1990), the factors to be enumerated could be categorised under one factor – the interference of mother tongue. It is worth noting that for the non-native speakers, the mother tongue always affects the acquisition of the second language. This has always, been a major problem in oral English or pronunciation teaching especially in Nigerian schools. Unoh (1986) also examines the situation of oral English in Nigerian secondary schools. He asserts that teaching of English pronunciation in Nigeria suffers from peculiar handicaps unknown to the teaching of English language or any other school subject (for that matter). For any subject to be effectively taught, there are at least three very important conditions that must be met:</p> <ol><li>A high degree of motivation on the part of both student and teacher; and</li> <li>The teachers’ competence in the subject, and his or her mastery of the techniques of imparting knowledge in it.</li> <li>Availability of relevant books as well as standard facilities for practical.</li> </ol> <p>While the aforementioned conditions are rarely achieved in the teaching of English Language, they are also hardly met in the case of the teaching and learning of English pronunciation. Okoli (2000) comments on the need to be proficient in the sound system of a new language and explains that English should be pronounced in the accent normally chosen as the standard form especially the model most often recommended for foreign learners studying standard British English and also Received Pronunciation.</p> <p>The teaching of oral English in Nigerian secondary schools has previously been overlooked. However, recent development in the teaching of English Language requires greater emphasis on this aspect of English language. Oral English complements the understanding and the use of English language so as to improve the standard of spoken English. According to Idris (2001), not much has been achieved since the introduction of Oral English in our West African School Certificate and National Examination Council due to the problems associated with the teaching and learning of oral English. There are existing publications on phonology written by Linguists such as A.C. Gimson, Daniel Jones, David Jowitt, Peter Roach, among others. Recently, there is the emergence of new publications particularly on Oral English by other language teachers, researchers and scholars such as Mannell, Cox, and Harrington (2009), Akperero (2000), Enyeazu (2001), and Idris (2001). This development has gone a long way in bringing oral English into focus. Its recent inclusion in the English Language Examination Paper (Test of Orals) has drawn the attention of many teachers and students.</p> <p>Consequently, the teaching of oral English is rather weighed down by various factors which have contributed to the slow pace and ineffectiveness in teaching the course. These factors include:</p> <ol><li>Poor background.</li> <li>Interference of mother tongue.</li> </ol> <ul><li>Unqualified teachers, poor teaching methodology</li> </ul> <ol><li>Lack of constant practice,</li> <li>Lack of orientation and facilities</li> <li>Shortage and limited accessibility to relevant books.</li> </ol> <p>Most of the students in our secondary schools are faced with either one of the problems or the other. Some are deficient due to more than one problem especially students from rural and poor backgrounds. This study examines some of the major challenges that the teaching of oral English could be faced with in Nigerian secondary schools.</p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Due to the increasing nature of poor academic performance of secondary school students especially in external examinations like WAEC, NECO, NABTEB or JAMB, many educationists tend to shift the blame on the students lack of interest in the subject being discussed, interference of mother tongue, lack of constant practice by the students, lack of orientation and facilities as well as shortage and limited accessibility to relevant books.</p> <p>I wish to maintain that though efforts have been put in place to improve Oral English, a good result is yet to be seen and according to Obriri (2007), “Although many concerned pundits have charted numerous ways to simplify the teaching or instruction of Oral English, many more problems are mounting and need to be thoroughly addressed urgently as they are alarming”. The cause of this negative development is certainly because a lot of energy are being channelled only towards the learners’ problems, and not the problem of teaching.</p> <p>The main concern of this investigation is to identify those problems that are negatively affecting the instruction of Oral English. The inquiry will also look at the efforts that have been put in place to tackle the problem of teaching Oral English, which however have not yielded any practical solution. The factors affecting Oral English instruction in Osogbo Local Government Area range from teacher incompetence, inadequate instructional materials, disgust for the emphasis on the British accent, poor teaching skills, poor motivation for the students, to other problems which could have been caused by school proprietors or the government. The work identifies workable solutions to the factors affecting Oral English instruction in secondary school in Osogbo Local Government Area.</p> <p><strong>1.3     THE PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Nigeria as a country requires a population competent in the English Language in order to keep up with the pressure of globalization which has led to the increasing use of the English Language in all sectors as well as its continued use as the official language and medium of instruction, Oral English is an important part of the language curriculum in Nigeria is also required for learners to be able to understand the structure of the English Language. Thus, it is arguable that proficiency in English is one of the greatest opportunities that the Nigerian education system ought to provide children with. The primary aim of this study is to identify the factors affecting Oral English instruction in Secondary Schools in Osogbo local government Area of Osun State.From the above this study sets out to:</p> <ul><li>Assess the methods of instruction of Oral English by teachers in senior secondary school.</li> <li>Compare the effectiveness of various method being used for the instruction of Oral English by teachers of senior secondary school via their academic performance,</li> <li>Examine the effect of interference of mother tongue oninstructors of Oral English in senior secondary school.</li> <li>Compare the qualification of instructors on their ability to perform effectively in their field of work.</li> <li>Investigate the influence of relevant books, practical facilities on the instruction of Oral English in Senior Secondary Schools.</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.4     RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <ol><li>Is there a significant relationship between good instructional materials and students performance in Oral English?</li> <li>Are practical Oral Exercises necessary in the instruction of Oral English?</li> </ol> <ul><li>Do the instructors’ qualifications affects the instructions of Oral English?</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.5     RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <ol><li>There is no significant relationship between good instructional materials and students performance in Oral English.</li> <li>Practical Oral Exercises are not necessary in the instruction of Oral English.</li> </ol> <ul><li>Noise is not inimical to the instruction of Oral English.</li> </ul> <ol><li>Instructors’ qualification does not affect the instruction of Oral English.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.6     SCOPE AND DELIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>First, the researcher will focus his inquiry on investigating the factors affecting the instructions of Oral English.Secondly, the researcher will limit his work to ten selected secondary schools in Osogbo Local Government Area of Osun State.

This new role does not just involve the more transmission of information to students but it involves looking at the problems associated with learning and instruction. The National Policy on Education (NPE, 2004) in Nigeria emphasized that our children should be educated properly so that they can acquire skills and competencies that would enable them function well and solve problems in the society. The accomplishment and realization of these important educational goals in Nigeria lies in the new trend in the educational approaches.<br/>These new approaches to learning and instruction expose the students to conceptualize and effectively manage their own learning and thus reinforce their learning and transfer their training in practical situations. Despite the new approach to learning and instruction, English language at the Senior Secondary School level in Nigeria has been plagued with poor results and low achievements. Annual results from West African Examinations Council (WAEC) reveal woeful performances from the students who have made enrolment for English language examinations a yearly ritual. It is worrisome to note too that the performance of these students has continued to deteriorate year after year. It is understood that if the situation in English Language remains like this, it will affect both the economic and technological growth of the state. This is because a good mastery of English language is mandatory on all students in order to do well in other secondary school subjects. Students who are handicapped in English language are therefore likely to be handicapped in the acquisition of skills in arts and technological related subjects.<br/>From the foregoing, therefore, we can conclude that English language is an indispensable language of communication in Kaduna.<br/>1.2      <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong><br/>This research as stated above concerns itself with the study of strategies for improving low academic performance in English language by suggesting possible solution to the following questions:</p> <ul><li> <ul><li> <ul><li>What are the attitude/feelings of the students towards the studying of English language?</li> <li>What account for the decline in performance in the subject (English language)?</li> <li>Do they have enough material and human resources for the teaching and learning process?</li> <li>Do they understand the subject very well?</li> <li>Does the Senior Secondary School Certificate (SSCE) syllabus have either a positive or a negative effect on the student performance?</li> </ul></li> </ul></li> </ul>\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING LOW ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING LOW ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS", "id": 65}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div>CHAPTER ONE</div> <div>INTRODUCTION</div> <div>Background to the Study</div> <div>Language is the most distinctive human quality and attribute.

Students presume that English language is a difficult language to learn and so do not make effort to learn it. Teachers also find it difficult to cope with the heavy demand required for effective teaching and learning of English language. This research work was carried out using the twenty secondary schools in Igbo Etiti Local Government Area of Enugu state. Six boys secondary schools, eight girls secondary schools and six co-educational schools. The target population was one thousand, eight hundred and fifty four students in JS III and one thousand, eight hundred and eighty eight students in SS III and one hundred and five English teachers. Ten schools and two hundred students from both junior and senior secondary schools were used for the study. Forty teachers were also selected and analyzed using mean.

Once a pidgin has emerged, it is generally learned as a second language and used for communication among people who speak differently. <br/>Language is the most creative and unlimited instrument for social communication and it helps us to understand the deep seated social relevance, culture involvement and the human relatedness of language. Having said this, we can therefore agree that pidgin is a language of its own and not just a supplementary tongue as some people see it, since it serves as an unlimited instrument of social communication especially in a multilingual community as Madona University.<br/>According to R. Linton he states that “the culture of a society is the way of life of its members, the collection of ideas and habits which they learn, share and transmit from generation to generation” (12). These cultures, ideas and habits can only be transmitted from generation to generation through language. In linguistic, every language is considered adequate to represent the communicative needs of its people and as such should not be made to suffer any biases. <br/>This cannot be said of Nigerian Pidgin – even though it is a language – because various attempts have been made by different faction to eradicate the use of Nigerian Pidgin English. These attempts have however been unsuccessful because of the significant value the language has to its users. It is a language that has brought people together in spite of their differences in ancestral culture and language by creating a local culture for itself which blends ideas from different cultures.</p> <p><strong>Statement of Research Problem:</strong><br/>Nigerian Pidgin is a language just as English and there is enough room for both language to co-exist and be mutually enriching. Despite this – and the fact that Nigerian Pidgin English appears to be the most popular means of communication among diverse groups and is easier to learn than any other language in the country today – it is generally asserted that it is not the suitable language for use in formal setting and its use in such setting is usually frowned at.<br/>This research work will explore the potentials of Nigerian Pidgin English as a language. If Nigerian Pidgin English does have this potential, why is its usage and status denigrated? Also, does the speaking of Nigerian Pidgin affect the student’s academic performance? Answers to these questions will enable us make useful recommendations for future studies.</p> <p><strong>Purpose of the Study:</strong><br/>This work intends to look into the effectiveness and status of Nigerian Pidgin English. It is inherent that for a long period of time that Nigerian Pidgin English has been the means of communication among students in the higher institutions. This research will bring into light if the use of Nigeria Pidgin English has any effect on the students and their academic performance in Madona University. The finding will be regarded to be generic, affecting also students in other institutions who equally exalt Nigerian Pidgin English above standard English.</p> <p><strong>Significance of the Study:</strong><br/>This study is important because its results can go a long way to finding out the causes of students’ negative or positive academic performance. If Nigerian Pidgin English has contributed negatively or positively to the students.<br/>This work will in no doubt contribute to one’s knowledge especially in the department of English, Madona University, Enugu as it will highlight some issues in educational planning.

The research was conducted on essays written by thirty (30) Students of the above school. The analysis of the essays revealed the deficiencies of some of the Students in using English tense. In the use of the present tense, for instance, Students had more difficulties in the use of present tense compare to the use of other tense. It has also been observed that students commit these errors as a result of their mother tongue interference. It was also found out that the errors were as a result of poor teaching methods, lack of adequate textbooks and qualified English teachers. To minimize these problems, we suggest that the government should provide adequate textbooks on English grammar and qualified English teachers. So that student in the lower classes should be exposed to the various situations in which tenses should be used.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong><br/><strong><em>CONTENTS                                                                                                     PAGE</em></strong><br/>Title Page        -           -           -           -           -           -           -           -           -           i<br/>Declaration      -           -           -           -           -           -           -           -           -           ii<br/>Approval Page            -           -           -           -           -           -           -           -                       iii<br/>Dedication      -           -           -           -           -           -           -           -           -           iv<br/>Acknowledgement      -           -           -           -           -           -           -           -           v<br/>Abstract          -           -           -           -           -           -           -           -           -           vi<br/>Table of Contents       -           -           -           -           -           -           -           -           vii<br/><strong>CHAPTER ONE: GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>1.0       Background of the Study       -           -           -           -           -           -           1<br/>1.1       Statement of Problem -           -           -           -           -           -           -           1<br/>1.2       Aim and Objectives    -           -           -           -           -           -           -           2<br/>1.3       Significance of the Study       -           -           -           -           -           -           2<br/>1.4       Scope and Delimitation          -           -           -           -           -           -           2<br/>1.5       Justification of The Study      -           -           -           -           -           -           3<br/>1.6       Methodology  -           -           -           -           -           -           -           -           3</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW</strong><br/>2.0       Meaning of Tense       -           -           -           -           -           -           -           4<br/>2.1       Types of English Tenses         -           -           -           -           -           -           5<br/>2.2       Error Analysis -           -           -           -           -           -           -           -           8<br/>2.3       Types of Errors           -           -           -           -           -           -           -           10</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY</strong><br/>3.0       Introduction    -           -           -           -           -           -           -           -           15<br/>3.1       Sources of Data          -           -           -           -           -           -           -           15<br/>3.2       Method of Data Presentation And Analysis -           -           -           -           15</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR: PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS, AND INTERPRETATION</strong><br/>4.1       Introduction    -           -           -           -           -           -           -           -           17<br/>4.2       Data Presentation        -           -           -           -           -           -           -           18<br/>4.3       Data Analysis and Interpretation        -           -           -           -           -           26</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS</strong><br/>5.0       Introduction    -           -           -           -           -           -           -           -           27<br/>5.1       Summary         -           -           -           -           -           -           -           -           27<br/>5.2       Conclusion      -           -           -           -           -           -           -           -           28<br/>5.3       Recommendations      -           -           -           -           -           -           -           29<br/>Works Cited    -           -           -           -           -           -           -           -           30</p>\n\nGRAMMATICAL ERRORS IN SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS’ ENGLISH ESSAYS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " GRAMMATICAL ERRORS IN SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS’ ENGLISH ESSAYS", "id": 69}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Language and style never moves beyond a concentration on the supremacy of words. These words somehow contain meanings style is effectively language manipulated in ways that signal it as different from ‘ordinary’ language. A stylistic analysis of the selection of some Wole Soyinka’s poems is carried out to educate, explicate and expose to everybody that comes across this write up, in guiding them on how to analyse. The data used to illustrate and substantiate our claims are systematically sourced from some selected poems of Wole Soyinka. The lexico-syntactic patterns and choices, the phonological, morphological and graphological devices are the main stylistic elements used to prove our claims. Finally, we find that each of the elements however, has identifiable functions which contribute to the effective meaning of the poems. It can therefore be concluded that these elements trigger and play important roles in passing the intention of the writer across.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE : GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0       Introduction</p> <p>1.1       Research Problem</p> <p>1.2       Aims and Objectives</p> <p>1.3       Scope of the Study</p> <p>1.4       Justification</p> <p>1.5       Research Methodology</p> <p>1.6       Biography of the Poet</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>2.0       Introduction</p> <p>2.1       Style</p> <p>2.2       Stylistics</p> <p>2.3       Approaches to Stylistic Analysis</p> <p>2.4       Levels of Stylistic Analysis</p> <p>2.5       Elements in Stylistic Analysis</p> <p>2.5.1    Lexico-Syntactic Patterns</p> <p>2.5.2 Lexico-Syntactic Choices</p> <p>2.5.3    Phonological Devices</p> <p>2.5.4 Graphological Devices</p> <p>2.5.5    Morphological Devices</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE: DATA ANALYSIS</p> <p>3.0       Introduction</p> <p>3.1       Textual Analysis</p> <p>3.2       Discussion of Tables</p> <p>3.3       Conclusion</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR: SUMMARY,FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION</p> <p>4.1       Summary</p> <p>4.2       Findings</p> <p>4.3       Conclusion</p> <p>Bibliography</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <ul><li>INTRODUCTION</li> </ul> <p>Stylistics is a word derived from style; it is a discipline which studies different styles. It can refer to the study of proper use of words or language in proper places. Widdowson (1975, p 3) defines stylistics as “the study of literary discourse from a linguistic orientation”. He goes further by saying that  what distinguishes stylistics from literary criticism on the one hand, and linguistics on the other, is that it is essentially a means of linking the two and has (as yet at least) no autonomous domain of its own. He also added that stylistics, however involves both literary criticism and linguistics, as its morphological make-up suggest: the ‘style’ component relating it to the former and the ‘istics’ component to the latter. Style has grown to mean so many things to so many people today. Carter (1989, p 14) is of the view that it is generally recognized that the style of a work can depend on linguistic levels-often simultaneously and that one fairly crucial factor is our expectation concerning the literary form or genre employed.</p> <p>Haynes (1989, p 3) believes that the study of style is the study of distinctions: looking at what was said against what might have been said. Style is almost synonymous with variety. Style refers in a simple way to the manner of expression which differs according to the various contexts.</p> <p>Style, being a versatile field, is defined depending on one’s field of study. Adejare (1992) makes this clear when he said that style is an ambiguous term. Lawal (1997, p 6) however, describes style as an aspect of language that deals with choices of diction, phrases, sentences and linguistic materials that are consistent and harmonious with the subject matter. He added that it involves the narrative technique of a writer in terms of choice and distribution of words and character. Lawal (1997, p 6) also added that it may be reckoned in terms of the sociolinguistic contexts and it may also be reckoned or analysed on linguistic, semantic and even semiotic terms.</p> <ul><li>RESEARCH PROBLEM</li> </ul> <p>This research notes that the stylistic analysis of this selection of poems has not been done so this research will address itself to analyzing these poems stylistically and examining the uniqueness of stylistics as it combines both linguistics and literary studies as it pertains to these poems. It is also addressing itself to examining how words are put together in transferring of message to the readers.</p> <ul><li>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</li> </ul> <p>The ultimate aim of this research is to explore ways in which language use has been integrated in the selected poems. It is also aimed at analyzing some of the distinctive features that give the selected poems their identity. This refers to the recurrent features of stylistics employed by the writer.</p> <p>In the same vein, this work will be concerned with striking and marked use of words in these poems in order to enhance effective transfer of message. The effects and functions of the stylistic elements as regards the poems will be looked at in the analysis.</p> <ul><li>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</li> </ul> <p>This work shall be exclusively stylistic, and analysis will be conducted through the use of the following levels of analysis: lexico-syntactic patterns and choices, phonology, graphology and morphology. Analysis will be conducted using the stylistic elements in each of the above mentioned levels of analysis, such that it could provide a guide and be relevant to future researchers in a related field.</p> <ul><li>JUSTIFICATION</li> </ul> <p>What fascinated the researcher into doing this work is the uniqueness of stylistics as it combines both linguistics and literary studies. The choice of words of Wole Soyinka marked by great scope and  has also made the researcher to embark on this project and to choose some of Wole Soyinka’s works as the data.</p> <p>This work will be of great benefit to those students in the field of language and literature who also have interest in stylistics. It will also inspire them more on how to analyse texts using the levels of stylistic analysis employed in this work.</p> <ul><li>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</li> </ul> <p>The data for analysis have been randomly selected from the “Selection of African Poetry”- introduced and annotated by K. E. Senanu and T. Vincent. All the poems of Wole Soyinka in the selection have been selected. The poems are seven in number and they are ‘Abiku’, ‘To my first white hairs’ and ‘Post mortem’ written in 1967. ‘Telephone conversation’ written in the 1960’s, ‘Night’ and ‘I think it rains’ written in 1988 and the seventh poem ‘Procession 1-hanging day’ written in 1969. The poems will be analysed stylistically and the five levels of analysis already mentioned will form the basis of the analysis.</p> <ul><li>BIOGRAPHY OF THE POET- WOLE SOYINKA</li> </ul> <p>Wole Soyinka was born on 13 July, 1934 in Ake in Abeokuta, near Ibadan in Western Nigeria. After preparatory University studies in 1954 at Government College in Ibadan, he continued at the University of Leeds, where, later, in 1973, he took his doctorate. He showed interest and ability in poetry and drama while in the University.</p> <p>Soyinka has published about 20 works: drama, novels and poetry. He writes in English and his literary language is marked by great scope and richness of words. His writings are sophisticated and show a profound exploration of human themes and concerns through a unique exploration of his cultural milieu. He has won many international prizes for his contribution to literature. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986.</p>\n\nA STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF SOME SELECTED POEMS OF WOLE SOYINKA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF SOME SELECTED POEMS OF WOLE SOYINKA", "id": 70}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p> It was obviously vital that African should be treated for culture preservation.

So, Literature is a mirror which reflects man’s actual life in the society where he is found. Literature also borrows from history and relies on everyday events. Awotunde (1999:7) asserts that literary critics, poets, authors and playwrights are engaged in the process of adapting, inventing and recreating certain life situations to sustain the make belief and the suspense that are part of the key ingredients of literature. Literature is characterized by its aesthetics or pleasure and its edification.</p> <p>Literature, like all other art forms, draws on human experience and tries to reflect the same and communicate it to man in an order and artistic form. It can also imply an artistic use of word for the sake of art alone. Omotayo Oloruntoba Oju (1999) observes that</p> <p>The term literature may be used to refer to any material in written form or any other material whose features tend themselves to literary appreciation or appraisal… The term in a specialized sense refers to work of art in any of the established literary genres, prose, poetry and drama.</p> <p>Any good definition of literature therefore, cannot do without the oral composition of a community from which the written and established genres and still emanates according to society changes.</p> <p>Also, Akande and Ibrahim define Literature as</p> <p>Any creative imagination which uses a specialized form of language and style for effective communication in prose, poetry and drama.</p> <p>A modern definition of Literature by Terry Eagleton (1973) says:</p> <p>Literature is a liberating force, freeing us from inherent shackles placed upon us by the society. Literary criticism is therefore born out of the struggle against a loss of culture and its feature becomes defined as a struggle against the foreseen bourgeois state and it has no predetermined future.</p> <p>Aesthetics refers to the appreciation or appraised of value. Whenever a judgement is made about the nature, worth or significance of a phenomenon, an aesthetic appreciation is being made. In a more narrow sense, aesthetics refers to the philosophical contemplation of a work of art. Thus, a discipline, aesthetics is concerned with the appropriate modes of evaluation of works of art. An unending debate in aesthetics is: which aspect of the object, or phenomenon being evaluated should be assigned a great weight of appreciation. The two main elements involved in any such appreciation are the form or appearance of the object or phenomenon on the other hand. Correspondingly, there are two extreme aesthetic attitudes: aestheticism and utilitarianism or functionalism.</p> <p>Africaness refers to elements in works of art that express themes, ideas or notions, aesthetic features and objects relating to Africa. Africaness is predominant in the literature of the diaspora in foreign languages. Africaness include the deliberate infusion of African linguistic and non-linguistic elements into literature to give a natural touch. At a moderate level, such Africaness is seen as representing the African aesthetic matrix. At the extreme, such Africaness may be an expression of cultural nationalism. In Literature of Africans in Diaspora, Africaness takes the form of the theme of the black beauty and of the African homeland. It is often a romanticization of the African heritage.</p> <p>According to Oloruntoba-Oju (1999:213) similarities between African and Caribbean aesthetics have been demonstrated at various levels because of the numerous African elements preserved in several sectors of the diaspora. One thing stands out when one reads a novel by an African on Africa. It’s the fact that it is dominated by element that reveal not only the cultural realities of its people but also the peculiarities of the region the novelists dwells in furthermore, a particular ethnic community’s belief and practice reflects in its actions and reactions to issues and life generally.</p> <p>Therefore, African Aesthetic seldom appears in literature instead such words such as ‘Negritude’. The African personality, the African outlook and more recently, the black aesthetic. The African world views are more common. A large body of literature has grown up around most of these terms, particularly ‘Negritude’</p> <p>Susan Vogel from the New York Centre for African art described an African aesthetic in African work as having the following characteristics: youthfulness, other African aesthetics include myth, legend, oral tradition, history, poetry, folktales, folklores, riddles and jokes, song, performance narrative etc.</p> <p>From the above definition, it is clearly seen that literature and aesthetics has a relationship, since aesthetics also has it impact on African literature, therefore, these refers to element in works of art that express theme, and ideas or notions relating to Africa. In order to examine and know what exactly African literature is, there are certain things one has to guide against and these according to Achebe are known as common fallacies which we must avoid. Achebe goes further to say: (Achebe:13)</p> <p>The first is to see African literature as so different and special and so removed from the realm of other literatures that it can share no common approaches with them.</p> <p>In as much as one would not see African literature as different and special, it is therefore logical to accept the fact that literature, being a product of human culture, cannot develop in a vacuum, rather it has to develop in a tradition or traditions.</p> <p>So the emergence of the writing culture in Africa and the foreign traditions on the African literature, no doubt gave birth to the literature of colonial experience, which eventually turned the Africa literature to a protest against colonialism and its effects. These were literary works purely concerned with cultural rehabilitation and thus grew in response to the cultural values of Africa.</p> <p>Example of such works include Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart (1958), Amos Tutuola’s Palm Wine Drinkard (1952), Peter Abraham Mine boy (1946), Bayo Adebowale’s The Virgin (1986), Camara Laye’s African Child (1953) and The Radiance of the King (1954). These are the books written to show case the rich cultural traditions of the Africans. According to Dada, they were historical or ethnographical designed to explain African culture to the foreign reader.</p> <p>With these, it has become very difficult to separate African literature from its root because day in day out, the tradition of the past still continues to wield much influence on African literature. No doubt then that Ngugi Wa Thiongo asserted in article on “The African Writer and his Past” that:</p> <p>The African in spite of his modernity, has never been wholly severed from the cradle of a continuous culture from folklore, tales, proverbs, riddles and all oral components that made him what he is today.</p> <p>Camara Laye’s The African Child (1953) and The Radiance of the King (1954) for example, can be conveniently classified into the volume of contemporary African writings of the prose traditions, which is fully loaded with the traditional value of the past.</p> <p>It is clearly seen that different scholars have tried to look at what African aesthetics is and some uses fictional works to show this aesthetics value in his works. Among this numerous authors, Camara Laye uses virtually all his novels to portray this concept especially his African Child (1953) and The Radiance of the King (1954).</p> <p>Camara Laye as an African writer uses this two novels to disengage the mind of the westerners who believed that Africa is cultureless. His African Child (1953) reveals the peaceful and happy childhood of the boy Laye. He traces the hero’s life from about the age of six when he attended the Koranic school, the time he graduated from the technical College to finish his studies in France.  The author laid special emphasis on love, respect and concern for one another in the village community. He dwells on the communal nature of African societies in a way to show the European reader that Africa societies are very different from the individualistic societies of Europe.</p> <p>The Radiance of the King (1954) tells a long story but straight forward story of a while man’s adventure in a particular corner of Africa. The hero Clarence has gambled all his money among his fellow Europeans. He owes money to all of them and he is thrown out of the hotel because he has no money to pay, therefore, action, it is seen that Africans are very accommodating and they do not discriminate as the while does.</p> <ul><li>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</li> </ul> <p>As earlier said, literary works of art are studied by considering the aesthetic and pleasurable value of such works. This refers rather to a sense of aesthetic appreciation, that is, the feeling that a particular work of art satisfies or fulfills the expectation that the reader or audience brings to it. In this study, attempt will be made on the examination of African aesthetics in the works of Camara Laye. The exploration of Africaness in his work will be on the use of African aesthetics prominent in The Radiance of the King (1954) and The African Child (1953).</p> <ul><li>SCOPE AND LIMITATION</li> </ul> <p>The focus of this study will be on the use of African aesthetic in Camara Laye’s The African Child (1953) and The Radiance of the King (1954). Apart from some cursory references to some texts of similar thematic thrust, this study will be limited to observation made from aesthetic appraisal. Analysis therefore will be made available by a close reading of the two novels.</p> <ul><li>JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</li> </ul> <p>This work is to examine how Camara Laye emphasizes the conscious effort to capture the traditional tones of speech and action with which he draws his audience closer to his novel. His infusion of African elements like songs, dance, customs, beliefs, traditions, divination, dance, praise singing, proverbs, idioms and so on into his novel will also be analyzed. He intentionally uses these elements to bring out the beauty and aesthetics of his dramatic works and evoke a burst of emotion from the audience. This work is chosen in order to show the westerners that Africans are of great cultural heritage.</p> <ul><li>METHODOLOGY</li> </ul> <p>In this study, all the elements of Africaness and aesthetics employed by the author within the scope of this study will be carefully examined. In doing this, the formalist approach to literature will be used. Formalism developed and flourished in Russia in the twentieth century. It was propounded by Immanuel Kant, Bishop Joseph Butler and W.D Ross. The formalist theory looks at the aesthetics of any literary work. Therefore since this work aims at bringing out the beauty in The African child (1953) and The Radiance of the king (1954). Therefore the theory is the most suitable for this work.</p> <ul><li>STRUCTURE OF THESIS</li> </ul> <p>This thesis contains five chapters. Chapter one by way of introduction capture matters like the definition of key terms, purpose of the study, scope and limitation of the study justification of the study as well as the methodology of the study. In chapter two, perspectives on Camara Laye’s works are examined under the literature review. The title of chapter three is Africanism and social in Camara Laye’s African Child (1953), the chapter considers the African aesthetics and its element in the novel. Our concern in chapter four, under the title: Toward a Cultural rainbow in Camara Laye’s The Radiance of the King. The chapter five of the thesis is the summary and conclusion of the research.</p>\n\nAESTHETIC OF AFRICANISM IN CAMARA LAYE’S THE AFRICAN CHILD AND THE RADIANCE OF THE KING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AESTHETIC OF AFRICANISM IN CAMARA LAYE’S THE AFRICAN CHILD AND THE RADIANCE OF THE KING", "id": 71}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT </strong></p> <p>This project work deals with a critical evaluation of Africanism in relation to theme and techniques of Amos Tutuola’s novel – THE PALMWINE DRINKARD. This study tends to examine the important of African culture and promotion of its cultural heritage which was bastardized by the colonial masters during colonization. In the course of this essay, chapter one will deals with introduction, background of the study, purpose of the study, scope and limitation, justification, methodology and authorial background. Chapter two forms the literature reviewed about past scholars’ view on Africanism, the concept of Africanism as theme, the concept of Africanism as techniques. Chapter three focuses on analysis of the novel- the palm-wine Drinkard. Chapter four encompasses summary, findings and conclusion to the whole essay. In our finding, we are able to discovered. That “Africanism especially the aspect of African culture in Tutuola’s texts enable the readers to appreciate and value their own traditions. That Africanism as a concept is capable of generating its own body of literature and attracts criticism to itself. That through the concept of Africanism, the efficacy of African culture has been proved using Tutuola’s text, the    palmwine Drinkard.

Therefore, it has become necessary to minimize the differences between the various peoples of African favour of a generalized “African” heritage.   <strong>1.1</strong> <strong>Background of the study</strong> The word “Africanism” connotes pan-Africanism. Pan-Africanism represents the aggregation and the projection of historical, cultural, spiritual, artistic, scientific and philosophical legacies of Africans from past times to the present. Pan-Africanism as an ethical system traces its origin. From ancient times and promotes values that are product of the African civilization and the struggles against slavery, racism, colonialism and neo-colonialism. However, Pan-Africanism is usually seen as a product of the European slave trade. Enslaved Africans of diverse origins and their descendants found themselves embedded in a system of exploitation where their African origin becomes a sign of their service status. Pan-Africanism set aside cultural differences, asserting the principality of these shared experiences to foster solidarity and resistance to exploitation. Alongside a large number of slave insurrections, by the end of the eighteenth century political movement developed across the Americas Europe and African which sought to weld these disparate movements into a network of solidarity putting an end to these oppressions. In London, the sons of Africa were political group addressed by quotona Ottobah Lugoano in the 1791 edition of his book thoughts and sentiments on the evil of slavery. The group addressed meetings and organized letter-writing campaigns, published campaigning material and visited parliament. They wrote to figures such as Granvile sharp, William Pitt and other members of the white abolition movement, as well as king George III and the prince of Wales, the future George IV. Modern Pan-Africanism began around the beginning of the twentieth century. The African Association latter renamed the Pan-African Association, was organized by Henry Sylvester – Williams around 1887, and their first conference was held in 1900.   <strong>1.2</strong> <strong>Purpose of study</strong> The purpose of this study can be seen from different perspectives. First and foremost, to see how Amos Tutuola has promoted the richness of African culture. He wants Africans to cast a favourable look at their indigenous traditions, unique cultural heritage forgetting the culture impose on them during the colonial period, secondly, the study is desirable at discussing how Africanism has been used as theme and techniques in Tutuola’s the palmwine drinkard in order to convey his message to his readers.   <strong>1.3</strong> <strong>The Significance of the Study</strong> This research work is significant in the literary world where it adds to the body of knowledge and making known some hidden riches of the book The Palmwine Drinkard. This work will convey why Tutuola wrote in such of manner with imaginary pictures of places which are often told in Yoruba myth. In this generation where culture and ethnics are not well regarded, this work shall carve out our culture of Africanism and enlighten all to value our culture.   <strong>1.4</strong> <strong>Justification</strong> Many researchers have worked on Amos Tutuola’s the Palmwine Drinkard discussing different issues such as Ajayi A. (2002) “Language and style in Amos Tutuola’s The Palm-wine Drunkard” brought out to appreciate the asteriated use of language in the book and also Baiyerohi, P. (2008) “Folklore in Amos Tutuola’s “The palm-wine Drinkard” to diverse perspectives of folklore but for the purpose of this work, we shall be using “Africanism” to analyze themes and techniques in The palmwine drinkard by Amos Tutuola. </p> <p>From the foregoing, more researches have been made by scholars and students of English to analytically criticize Tutuola’s The Palm-wine Drinkard but for the authenticity of this work, we shall be exploring the richness of African culture messaged by Tutuola which from our</p><p>  </p>\n\nAFRICANISM THEME, AND TECHNIQUE IN AMOS TUTUOLA’S THE PALMWINE DRINKARD<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AFRICANISM THEME, AND TECHNIQUE IN AMOS TUTUOLA’S THE PALMWINE DRINKARD", "id": 72}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This study has been able to show how Wole Soyinka and Ola Rotimi have treated politics artistically in their various texts.

He is a nobel laureate and has written in all genres of literature (prose, poetry, and drama).</p> <p>He uses his works as an instrument for social mobilization and change.</p> <p>Wole Soyinka as a democrat believes in an egalitarian society that is a society where everybody should be answerable to the law and justice is met out without considering the class of the individual. In fact, he believes in a society where there should be no class at all. Everybody should have equal rights in all ramifications.</p> <p>Although, Soyinka is not much of a politician but those years in his country when absolute power was in the hands of the military he was not at ease because his dream society was not guaranteed under such leadership.</p> <p>Soyinka abhors the intrusion of military into politics of a country. He finds military in politics contrary to the constitutional duty and argues that the provision of security for the nation as a whole is their duty. He sees the military as leaders without a mandate and as a threat to personal essence and his dream society. He wants changes during the reign of the military and employs his writing toward this end. Soyinka uses satire to bring out the ills of the society and his ideas to bring a desired change.</p> <p>Ola rotimi hails from the Yoruba land in the Southern part of Nigeria. He has written a great deal of work whose thematic preoccupations are of tremendous literary social significance. He has contributed immensely to the development of African literature especially in the areas of African drama and theatre and a lot of critical attention has been paid to his works by both African and European critics. Ola Rotimi’s mode of assessing a socio-political system, the people’s attitude e.t.c. in a society is satire- a form of writing which makes fun of the evil or foolish behaviour of people, institutions or society in general. The Nigerian society for him is obviously a chaotic one where dreams and aspirations of people remain unrealized. He has seen with shock and disbelief the endemic corruption, moral decay and political morass that have become part and parcel of the society.</p> <p>Ola Rotimi, Wole Soyinka and other artists are committed as writers to restore order in the society through their various works respectively.</p> <p>1.2                  PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This research work will aim at examining the adventure of the military into the politics of a country and how Wole Soyinka and Ola Rotimi have presented this artfully in their works respectively.</p> <p>This study focuses on the artistic presentation of the military in politics and it examines Soyinka’s The Beatification of Area Boy and Ola Rotimi’s Our Husband Has Gone Mad Again respectively.</p> <p>1.3      SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This study focuses on the artistic presentation of the military in politics and it examines Soyinka’s <em>The Beatification of Area Boy</em> and Ola Rotimi’s <em>Our Husband Has Gone Mad Again</em> respectively.</p><p> 1.4      JUSTIFICATION </p> <p>This research work is done to advance scholarship on art and politics.

It was discovered that English language has adapted to the Nigerian context which brings out the creative and unpredictable nature of language users.

Hence, there must be a relationship existing between language and society. The interdependency of these two entities – language and society led to the study of sociolinguistics. Sociolinguistics is the study of all aspects of linguistics applied towards the connections between language and society, and the way we use it in different language situations.</p> <p>Language is seen as a unifying force and a common ground among various people through which effective communication is carried out. It has however been noticed that even within the same language, there are different ways or styles of speaking. The contact English language had with Nigeria and her indigenous languages and a bid to communicate effectively across and within ethnic boundaries (cases of intra and inter ethnic communication), led to code mixing.</p> <p>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM</p> <p>The multilingual nature of the country and some individuals’ multilingual or bilingual competence and the inter-language relationship existing between English language and over four hundred indigenous languages in Nigeria have led to code-mixing in conversation, discourse and communicative competence. These lead to the following questions</p> <ol><li>Is there any limit(s) or constraint(s) to code-mixing?</li> <li>Is code-mixing really necessary in discourse?</li> <li>What informs code-mixing?</li> </ol> <p>1.3   AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</p> <p>This research is informed by questions arising from code-mixing in the lyrics of songs in the Nigerian music industry. This research focuses on some songs in which Yoruba language predominates in the Pidginize English medium used. This research attempts at discovering why the artistes code mix in their songs.</p> <p>This study will examine the various reasons and motivations for code-mixing. This study will look at how the artistes have arrive at a communicative end via code-mixing and examines the success or otherwise of this trend.</p> <p>1.4     DELIMITATION AND LIMITATION</p> <p>Due to the researcher’s level of proficiency, knowledge and understanding of the English, Yoruba and Pidgin languages, the researcher will cover some selected songs in the Nigerian music industry in which these languages are used.</p> <p>To achieve the success of this research work, the work is limited to code-mixing.</p> <p>1.5     JUSTIFICATION</p> <p>This is regarded as an addition to the existing stock of researches on the subject of code-mixing. However, to the knowledge of the researcher, no work has done a study of code-mixing as a sociolinguistic medium in the Nigerian music industry. This study aims at tackling code-mixing as used in the lyrics of songs of some artistes in the Nigerian music industry. This study will therefore be useful to students of sociolinguistics generally.</p> <p>1.6      METHODOLOGY</p> <p>Ten songs will be chosen randomly from the lists of songs in the Nigerian music industry and these songs will be analyzed alongside the reasons and motivations for code-mixing.</p>\n\nCODE MIXING AS A SOCIOLINGUISTIC MEDIUM IN SOME SELECTED SONGS IN THE NIGERIAN MUSIC INDUSTRY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CODE MIXING AS A SOCIOLINGUISTIC MEDIUM IN SOME SELECTED SONGS IN THE NIGERIAN MUSIC INDUSTRY", "id": 74}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Conflict is a disagreement or clash between people, ideas; or in the case of our study, cultures.

For a long time, Africans in particular, have been subjected to cultural imposition and displacement of western culture. This report aimed at examining the Eurocentric psyche that considers westernization superior.

Therefore, each character is a product of its unique history. Culture is an extensive feature of a group or society, also, it is a mark of identification and something that the individual or groups could easily get sentimental about. Though the Encarta English Dictionary (2009ed) has different definition of culture varying from “arts collectively”, “knowledge and sophistication”, “shared beliefs and practices” and so on, but the definition that best suite our course of study is that which says that culture:</p> <p>Are the beliefs, customs, practices and social behaviour of a particular nation or people. (Also) it can be a group of people whose shared beliefs and practices identify the particular place, class, or time to which they belong. 1</p> <p>Culture is a human characteristic in which man expresses the totality of his ways of life in a collective setting. It can also be referred to as the sum total of human activities shared by members of a group. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, culture is defined as: “… broad-based as it is all civilizations, social and material inventions, institutions, and literary achievements of a people”.2</p> <p>Culture is a sentimental phenomenon which an individual not only cherishes, but also protects dearly. Thus, literature becomes the medium through which cultural sentiments are expressed and projected. Africans in particular; have, for a long time, been subjected to cultural imposition and displacement of foreign culture. This was due to the invasion by the Arabs in the African regions. This is not to say that Africans received these foreign cultures whole-heartedly. There was resistance and there has continued to be resistance through African arts, ethnics and culture. As result of this resistance, the conflict between the western world and Africans began to manifest. Today, plays that protestant in nature are being written to this effect.</p> <p>On this note, we shall define conflict by adapting the definition of the Encarta 2009 dictionary which states</p> <p>it is a disagreement or clash between ideas, principles, or people. It can also be a psychological state resulting from the often unconscious opposition between simultaneous but incompatible desires, needs, drives or impulse.3</p> <p>The key words in the definition are “clash” and “disagreement”. This definition best suit our course of study because it is on this note that Wole Soyinka opposes in the two texts being understudied.</p> <p>African literary writers are victims of cultural imperialism as a result of European colonial rule, therefore, at one time or the other they try to force themselves from colonial cultural imposition while projecting and glorifying traditional cultures. In the words of Adeyemi (1993) citing Olorunmoye (15)”culture supplies us our habits of life…”4</p> <ul><li>WOLE SOYINKA’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY</li> </ul> <p>Born Akinwande Oluwole Soyinka in the western part of Nigeria called Ogun State, Wole Soyinka was born on the 13th of July, 1934, at Isara, Ijebu Remo near Abeokuta to Mr. Ayodele and Mrs. Eniola Soyinka. His father was a school supervisor and his mother was a trader. Wole Soyinka, as he is popularly called, grew up in a time of transition when the technologically more advanced colonist, Britain, was destroying the very foundation of the indigenous Nigeria civilisation.  Wole Soyinka is seen as a writer who partly writes to explain the social dilemma of the group to which he belongs and partly to a way of life which has survived to some extent, and might have more fully survived, if certain historical events had not so drastically affected Africa and the attitudes of Africans not only to people of other race but also to their own selves. This is what playwright portrayed in his plays which we have for this study. The fact that Wole Soyinka has lived to write so much about the African experience is a miracle. His upbringing reflected both African and western influences, and the conflict and interaction between these two forces occupies most of his writings, particularly in the plays; <em>The Lion and the Jewel</em> and <em>Death and the King’s Horseman</em>, which we will be understudying in this research work.</p> <p>Some critics of the playwright agree that he is an African writer with stronger African than western theatrical bias, and his style is mid-way between African and European tradition. In short, his drama is a perfect synthesis of both traditions.5 Finally, most of his plays, including the texts being understudied; the themes, plots and settings are mainly African.</p> <ul><li>STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM</li> </ul> <p>This research acknowledges that the concept of culture has been overflowed but we are focusing our attention on the conflicts between the traditional and western culture by drawing examples from Wole Soyinka’s <em>The Lion and the Jewel</em> and <em>Death and the King’s Horseman</em>.</p> <ul><li>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</li> </ul> <p>What this research is setting out to do is to use the texts; <em>The Lion and the Jewel </em>and <em>Death and the King’s Horseman,</em> by Wole Soyinka to reveal the conflicting point between the traditional and western culture. In doing this, we shall focus on what these conflicts are how they have been expressed by the playwright. We shall also examine the reserved norms, nature, values and cultural practice of the Africans by looking at the plays which are set in the post-world war II Nigeria.</p> <ul><li>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</li> </ul> <p>This work aims at finding the conflict between the traditional and western culture and how Wole Soyinka has been able to use both text; <em>The Lion and the Jewel</em> and <em>Death and the King’s Horseman</em>, to explore this. The research shall be limited to a critical analysis of the conflict between these two cultures mentioned by comparing the two texts and showing how they have been portrayed because both texts best capture the existence of the conflicts of the two cultures.</p> <ul><li>JUSTIFICATION</li> </ul> <p>Today, Africans have neglected some of the rich cultural heritage and adopted the “white-man’s” culture. Some of which has prompted the clash between the African and western culture. Writers, poets and even dramatists have been using their works to sensitize these issues. Likewise, it is the belief of that the conclusion of this research work will make a significant impact on the development of African literature and add to the existing work of prominent researchers in exposing the conflict between African tradition and westernization.</p> <ul><li>METHODOLOGY</li> </ul> <p>For a clear and competent analysis of the texts set aside for this research we have adopted the sociological theory because it best suits the study. Under the sociological theory, we shall be looking at societal norms and belief system, psychological conflict and generation gap conflict. In the analysis of these elements, some of the dialogue of the characters in the texts shall be looked at, the characters and some events/ incidents as well.</p> <p>Consequently, we have been able to give a brief introduction of conflict and culture. Also, we have been able to state our problem and purpose to which the research is being embarked upon. We pointed out our limitation and went ahead to give the theory in which the researcher aims to adopt. Therefore, at this point, we shall move on to our chapter two, which is the literature review.</p>\n\nCONFLICT BETWEEN TRADITIONAL AND WESTERN CULTURE (A CASE STUDY OF SOYINKA’S DEATH AND THE KING’S HORSEMAN AND THE LION AND THE JEWEL)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONFLICT BETWEEN TRADITIONAL AND WESTERN CULTURE (A CASE STUDY OF SOYINKA’S DEATH AND THE KING’S HORSEMAN AND THE LION AND THE JEWEL)", "id": 75}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This research work examined the persuasive strategies of President Obama’s public speaking as enshrined in his inaugural address.

It is a general insight to what the work entails.</p> <p>1.1     BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>Effective reading is of utmost seriousness in the modern era due to the prevalence of media and vast exposure to information. Ironically, people and even scholars have turned a blind eye to the details and distinctions of discourse production and comprehension. This is due to the fact that language users do not often develop a full competence in the semantic component of the language. Regularly, people are heedless to and unenlightened about the implications of the shades of meanings when they are producing discourse or are exposed to it. Moslem (2009)</p> <p>The concepts of discourse, genre, and style are intimately connected with each other. They are dealing with the macro and micro levels of sociological and linguistic studies. There is a dialectic relationship between social actors or individuals (micro structure) and the social practices and values (macro structure). In this background, a multiplicity of texts is in close interaction with social parameters to bring about different ideological, identities and power structures. In this respect, the voice given to the macro structure, that is government and institutions or the micro structures that is individuals is immensely affected by the theorists’ ideological orientations. Moslem (2009).</p> <p>Politics is a struggle for power necessary to put certain political, economic and social ideas into practice. In this process, language plays a crucial role, for every political action is prepared, accompanied, influenced and played by language. This paper analyzes political discourse, namely the inaugural address of President Barrack Obama. Given the enormous domestic and global significance of the said speech in these times of international economic turmoil it is crucial to interpret ideological traits typical of Barrack Obama’s enshrined in his inaugural address. An Inaugural address oridinarily decides policies of the newly inaugurated president and its overall significance is enhanced in the case of Obama’s policy of “change”. This work will examine President Obama’s speech using Critical Discourse Analysis as a tool.</p> <p>1.2     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This work will attempt to critically analyze the relationship between language, ideology and reality. Critical Discourse Analysis attempts to reveal hidden meanings, which are ideologically inclined in a discourse. This work in other words shall reflect on insights in Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) that is uncovering of implicit ideologies in texts. It unveils the underlying ideological prejudices and therefore the exercise of power in texts. (Widdoson, 2000:157).</p> <p>The aim of this paper is to examine President Barrack Obama’s Inaugural speech especially its ideological component using the tools of Critical Discourse Analysis texts.</p> <p>1.3     JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The conceptual basis of this work is adopted from Norman Fairclough’s ideas on discourse and power, and discourse and hegemony. The attempt to link social practice and linguistic practice, as well as micro and macro analysis of discourse (Fairclough 1989: 97). At the same time, the analytical part of this research work analyzes the possible interrelatedness of textual properties and power relations, which is also underpinned in Fairclough’s conceptual work. Furthermore, this research work attempts to deconstruct covert ideology which is ‘hidden’ in the text – President Barrack Obama’s inaugural speech, stemming from the theoretical hypothesis of the Critical Discourse Analysis.</p> <p>1.4     SCOPE AND DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Language is the most essential ingredient in communication which explains why it means different things to different people who employ it to varied academic endeavors. As expected, many people have attempted to study the language used by people in various professional, non-professional and academic fields. For instance, volumes have been written on the phonological, Syntactic, Lexico-Semantic, Morphological as well a Pragmatic concept of English language such as “The study of Phonology of English Language”, “University Grammar” by Randolph Quirk.</p> <p>However, it must be noted that this research work will shed more light on the description and the critical interpretation of a discourse namely, President Barrack Obama’s Inauguration Speech on January 20, 2009 thereby bringing about the relationship between the choice of lexemes in the language use and the ideology embedded in it, and how it affects the society.</p> <p>1.5     AUTHORIAL BACKGROUND</p> <p>          On January 20, 2009, Barrack Hussein Obama not only became the 44th president of the United States of America but also the first African-American to hold the highest office in the American history. Barrack Hussein Obama was born to a black man, Barrack Obama Snr., and a white woman named Ann Dunham on August 4, 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii. His mother was from Kansas and his father was originally from Kenya where he later returned to after his separation with Obama’s mother. Obama’s early childhood was not a smooth one of any sort. In 1967 Obama’s parent divorced. His mother remarried an Indonesian foreign student named Lolo Soetoro and had a second child named Maya. Obama lived in Jakarta with his mother, new stepfather and half sister from age six to ten. He moved back to his birthplace in Honolulu, Hawaii when he turned ten to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham.</p> <p>Obama’s grandparent took the role as his parents. Although, Obama was living in a white household yet he was being identified as a black man. Living with his grandparent in Honolulu, Hawaii, led Obama to attend an elite Punahou Academy on a scholarship, where he was one of the only three African-American students, until 1979 when he graduated. During this period in his life, Obama saw his father for the last time in 1971.Unfortunately, Obama’s father died later on in a car accident in 1982. Barrack Obama also lost his mother to ovarian cancer in 1999</p> <p>Barrack Obama received a Bachelors of Arts at Columbia University in New York City, where he also studied political science. After graduation, Obama went to work at Business International Corporation and New York Interest Research Group. Obama later worked for a social services organization in Chicago right before being admitted in one of the top three law schools in the United States, Harvard Law School to study law.</p> <p>This is where Obama’s determination, strength and will really started to shine. In 1990, Obama was elected as President of the Harvard Law Review Journal. He was the first African-American to hold that type of position at Harvard. He worked hard and strong during his years at Harvard and in 1991, Obama graduated “magna cum laude” at the top of his class. His accomplishments gave him the opportunity to work at any law firm of his choice. He declined the top Manhattan Law Firm’s offers to go back to Chicago and work for the civil rights Law firms such as Miner, Barnhill and Galland. He went on to teach at the University of Chicago Law School, which also helped organize voter registration drives during Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign. His work led him to run for Illinois State Senate with the Democratic Party, where he won in 1996, which became the start of former Senator Obama’s journey to become the 44th President of the United States and the first African-American President in 2009.Barrack Obama got married to Michelle Obama on October 3, 1992. They have two daughters Malia Ann Obama born in 1998 and Natasha Obama born in 2001.</p> <p>1.6     CONCLUSION</p> <p>In conclusion, Meaning is not a monolithic construct; it is a multidimensional and slippery concept with amazing complexity. ( Moslem: 2009).Understanding the silent meaning of a text, be it spoken or written is a highly-needed skill in the modern era, because the exposure to information and media is so vast that one can ever be sure of the validity of the surrounding information.</p> <p>In the next chapter, we   shall   review   our   literature.

CDA along with other related disciplines attempts to reveal hidden meanings i.e. the ideological loads of the language and the exercise of power. CDA is a contemporary approach to the study of language and discourses in social institutions. It focuses on how social relations, identity, knowledge and power are constructed through written and spoken texts in communities, schools and classrooms.</p> <p>CDA aims to make its users aware of and able to describe and deconstruct vectors and effects in texts and semiotic materials generally which might otherwise remain to wield power uncritiqued. In there respects, CDA may be a kind of wake up cal, or consciousness, rising about the coercive or anti-demo criticizing effects of the discourses we live by. Critical discourse analysts take explicit position and thus want to understand, expose and ultimately resist social inequality. In other words, CDA may be seen as a reaction against the dominant formal (social or uncritical most times) paradigms of the 1960’s and 1970’s.</p> <p>This project focuses on an attempt to carry out a Critical Discourse Analysis of Ola Rotimi’s Our Husband has Gone Mad Again. This chapter therefore focuses on the purpose of study, scope of the study, justification, methodology, data description and author’s background.</p> <p>1.1    PURPOSE OF STUDY</p> <p>The purpose of this project is to critically analyze Our Husband has Gone Mad Again by Ola Rotimi using Critical Discourse Analysis. Being that the analysis of a play is rarely done, the researcher is not aware of any previous attempt to do CDA of the text Our Husband has Gone Mad Again.</p> <p>1.2    Scope of the study</p> <p>This project will analyze Ola Rotimi’s Our Husband Has Gone Mad Again using Critical Discourse Analysis. It will analyze selected conversations and utterances in the text. There are a lot of CDA elements but only some of them will be selected for the analysis of the text. The analysis will entail how power relations are decoded from the text that links to the society. Findings and conclusions will bring a temporary end to this research work.</p> <p>1.3    JUSTIFICATION</p> <p>In the best knowledge of the researcher as a theoretical construct has not been used in analyzing Our Husband has Gone Mad Again by Ola Rotimi. Thus, the study is justifiable as it seeks to investigate the sociopolitical and cultural issues that are inherent in the text. It is also believed that this study will be an additional work in the scholarship of the study of CDA, especially at the undergraduate level.</p> <p>1.4    METHODOLOGY</p> <p>This project is basically a Critical Discourse Analysis or Ola Rotimi’s Our Husband Has Gone Mad Again. Some selected conversations and utterances will be selected from the text for analysis.</p> <p>Norman Fairclough’s theory of CDA has been chosen for the analysis of this research work, some elements have been selected from the theory including the political and sociocultural issues which occur in the text and leads to the society. The textual analysis sociocultural analysis and the political issues of this text will be analyzed.</p> <p>1.5    DATA DESCRIPTION</p> <p>The play, Our Husband has Gone Mad Again, is a political satire. It shows the follies and fables of the entire political system in Africa and Nigeria in particular, in a bid to correct some of its anomalies. It lampoons the protagonist Major Rahman Teslim Lejoka-Brown a former military officer who takes to politics with the motif that looks more of vanity patriotism. Ola Rotimi takes a comic swipe at the ideological misfits and opportunist who strut the ever accommodating political landscape of the continent Africa.</p> <p>1.6    AUTHOR’S BACKGROUND</p> <p>Olawale Gladstone Emmanuel Rotimi, best known as Ola Rotimi was born in Sapele, former Bendel state of Nigeria on 13thApril, 1938, to an Ijaw mother and Yoruba father, so cultural diversity was a recurring theme in his work. He was a playwright, stage director, producer, actor, critic, scholar and a teacher. In his early age, he was exposed to a traditional Nigeria heritage of arts. He was educated at Methodist Boys High School in Lagos from 1952 to 1957. He went to Boston University for a bachelor’s degree in theatre arts where he studied play writing and directing. He later went to Yale University where he had masters in the arts after three years and retired to Nigeria in 1966. While in America, he got married to a French Canadian lady, Hazel a renowned artist, actress, singer and pianist. In Nigeria, Ola Rotimi took a job at the University of Ife, where he was a research fellow from 1966 to 1969 at the institute of African studies. He later became the head of creative arts and director at the University of Port Harcourt.</p> <p>The dramatic works of Ola Rotimi are known throughout Africa and have made him one of the most significant playwrights on that continent. While he was at Yale University on a Rockefeller fellowship, his socio-political comedy Our Husband has Gone Mad Again was chosen as Yale’s student play of the year in 1966. Ola Rotimi examines Nigerian’s history and ethnic traditions in his works. Some of his published works are: Introduction to Nigerian Literature, The Gods Are not to Blame(London: Oxford University Press 1971), Kurunmi (Ibadan: University press Limited 1971), Our Husband has Mad Again (London: Oxford University press 1977), Ovourumwen Nogbaisi (Benin: London: Ethiopian and Oxford University press 1974), If : A Tragedy of the Ruled (Ibadan: Heinemann 1983). He was in Nigeria until his Nigeria until his death in 2001.</p> <p>Ola Rotimi is sure to be remembered as a model in the literary genre whose views have shaped the conduct of the theater and whose plays have demonstrated the power of drama to shape the thinking of the society and attempted to solve some of the problems encountered in everyday living.</p>\n\nCRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS OF OLA ROTIMI”S OUR HUSBAND HAS GONE MAD AGAIN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS OF OLA ROTIMI”S OUR HUSBAND HAS GONE MAD AGAIN", "id": 77}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT </p> <p>Over the years, the major challenge facing the female folk is discrimination and unfair treatment in the society. This work discusses cultural practices that discriminate against women. This research work is a critical analysis of two African novels: Buchi Emecheta’s The Joy of motherhood, and Chimamanda Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus. For secondary sources, materials were got from the internet and library. It is discovered that several cultural practices discriminate and oppress the female folks. Such practices are identified in the selected texts for this work and critically examined. It is hoped that an awareness of such practices will eventually eradicate the social inequalities that are engendered by such practice in the African society.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY                           </p> <p>1.1   Purpose of Study.</p> <p>1.2  Scope and Limitation.</p> <p>1.3  Research Problems.</p> <p>1.4  Research Methodology</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>2.0     Introduction</p> <p>2.1     Origin of Feminism.</p> <p>2.1.1   Definition of Feminism</p> <p>2.1.2   Aims of Feminism.</p> <p>2.1.3   Types of Feminism.</p> <p>2.1.4   Feminists in Africa</p> <p>2.2.0      Discrimination.</p> <p>2.2.1  Type of Discrimination.</p> <p>2.2.2  Discrimination against Women</p> <p>2.3.0  Cultural Against Women</p> <p>2.3.1  Subordination of Women.</p> <p>2.3.2  Female Oppression in Widowhood Practices</p> <p>2.3.3  Female Genital Cutting/Female Circumcision.</p> <p>2.3.4  Polygamous Practices</p> <p>2.3.5  Female Sacrifice</p> <p>Background Information on Buchi Emecheta and a Synopsis of the Joys of</p> <p>Motherhood</p> <p>Chimamanda Adichie (Purple Hibiscus)</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>3.0     Introduction</p> <p>3.1     Practices against Women</p> <p>3.1.1  Preference of Male over Female Child</p> <p>3.1.2   Polygamous Practices</p> <p>3.1.2.1 Acquisition of Concubine</p> <p>3.1.2.2 Disrespect to Legal Wives</p> <p>3.1.2.3 Multiple Wives</p> <p>3.1.3 Maltreatment of Wives by Husbands</p> <p>3.1.3.1 Wife Battering</p> <p>3.1.3.2 Denial of Marital Rights</p> <p>3.1.3.3 Dereliction of Duties</p> <p>3.1.4 Marriage and Bride Price</p> <p>3.1.5 Female Sacrifice</p> <p>3.1.5.1 Sacrifice of Life/salve Murder</p> <p>3.1.5.2 Sacrifice to Gods</p> <p>3.1.5.3 Sacrifice to Marriage</p> <p>3.1.6   Widowhood Practices</p> <p>3.1.6.1 Marriage to Deceased’s Brother</p> <p>3.1.6.2 Maltreatment of Widows</p> <p>3.1.6.3 Effect of Widowhood Practices on Families</p> <p>3.2     Cultural Beliefs about Motherhood</p> <p>3.2.1.

Their rights and being were taken for granted. Silence became the virtue of women but with education, the silence was broken. Chambers 21st.century dictionary (2004, p. 327) says:</p> <p>Culture is the custom, ideas, values etc of a particular civilization, society or social group, especially at a particular time, and the appreciation of art, music, literature etc. improvement and development through care and training.</p> <p>Reuters .T. (2011, p.1) reports that; “Discrimination is to distinguish, single out, or make a distinction in everyday life, when faced with more than one option.” For the purpose of this research, the definition of women in chambers 21st century dictionary (2004, p.1631) will be used “women generally: the female sex.” Wikipedia (2010) assert that; “discrimination against women is the attitude and beliefs in relation to the female gender that they are less important, such beliefs and attitudes are of social nature and do not normally carry any legal consequences.”</p> <p>With these definitions, we can therefore define culture and discrimination against women as the cultural practices against the female folks that support men. Discrimination against women has become customs passed from generations to generations. In African, many cultural practices are against women. Women are beaten by husbands and are always blamed for not been able to produce children. Even when it is not confirmed that they are responsible for the marital problems, they suffer for those problems. Married woman could be replaced at anytime by their husbands because culture supports that men could marry many women.</p> <p>Female children are not always given the best upbringing; they are trained in the kitchen, instead of school. Male children are brought up well because they are known to be the people who will take their family from generations to generation. Therefore, with the use of Buchi Emecheta’s work, The Joys of Motherhood, many discriminatory acts against woman will be analyzed; to signify the cultural practices discriminating against women. Also, through the works of Chimamanda Adichie; Purple Hibiscus, discrimination against women will be identified. Cultural practices discriminating against women have been on for long and needs to stop.</p> <p>PURPOSE OF STUDY</p> <p>The study intends to examine culture and discrimination against women, using two carefully selected novels as primary data, Buchi Emecheta’s The Joys of Motherhood and chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus. Using radical Feminism to show that women should be treated equally as men and that gender differences is no excuse for discrimination. This research work aim at bringing out how cultural practices affect women, the pain it brings and the survival of women.</p> <p>1.2      JUSTIFICATION                                                        </p> <p>Researchers over the year have worked on how to stop gender inequality, especially discrimination against women. However it is important we know that some cultural practices affect women.</p> <p>This study is therefore embarked on to discuss the aspects of culture discriminating against women. Two aspects will be studied in this research the cultural aspect representing the old using The Joys of Motherhood and the religion aspect representing the modern period using Purple Hibiscus.</p> <p>It is hoped that the proper analysis of this work will ginger writers to the awareness that much needs to be done on gender inequality in the society. This work will also contribute to the body of knowledge, and the society in general especially to the feminist and female folks.</p> <p>SCOPE AND LIMITATION</p> <p>The researcher finds it difficult to bring out so many cultural practices discriminating against women, as a result of limited time coupled with financial constrain available for the study.</p> <p>As such this work will analyse culture and discrimination against women only in two selected novels. The research will also limit its scope on some materials from the library, internet and the two selected novels: Buchi Emecheta and Chimamanda The Joys of Motherhood and Purple Hibiscus respectively.</p> <p> 1.4    RESEARCH PROBLEMS</p> <p>Women have for long been discriminated against, oppressed and not given equal rights in life and in literary works, also we cannot but obey the customs and traditions of our land, however some cultural practices affect women.</p> <p>Thus, this study will investigate how some cultural practices discriminate against women, what women go through because of traditional beliefs and their survival.</p> <p>1.5RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</p> <p>This research work intends to carry out an investigation on culture and discrimination against women, through the proper analysis of the two carefully selected novels Buchi Emecheta and Chimamande Adichie: The Joys of Motherhood and Purple Hibiscus respectively. In analyzing these books radical feminism will be used. Sotunsa (2008, p.11) reports that:</p> <p>Radical Feminism argues that, women’s oppression storms from being categorized as inferior to men on the basis of gender. Therefore radical Feminism aim to destroy the sex classed system.</p> <p>The researcher uses radical Feminism to challenge male control. This work will present radical female protagonists, desperate to achieve their aim, not minding the consequences of their action. Through the female characters in the two selected novels, proper analysis of how cultural practices discriminate against women will be identified.           </p>\n\nCULTURE AND DISCRIMINATION AGAINST

ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>The word ‘emergent’, means something new and still developing, while ‘tradition’ is a belief custom or way of doing something that has been in existence for a long time among a particular group of people.  Therefore, emergent tradition is a new development in literary works.  Also some certain writers have come  up with  new traditions and these writers can be referred to as emergent writers in which the havereinuented the aesthetics traditions they inherited from old writers (dominant writers) and came out with some new forms of writings Oyeniyi Okunoye (2004) said that “The term ‘emergent’ is very much misunderstood.  He said  that we must not confuse what is historically and materially emergent from the loose sense of emerging or the new”.  Therefore, an emergent aesthetic tradition is that which departs from the old in terms of authorial ideology mode of literary ‘Production and aesthetic’ ideology.</p> <p>The writers in Africa are moved to write because they are constrained to respond to the call of their inner selves to express their though feelings and ideas about their environments, societies and cultures.  The African writers therefore, captures their existential experiences through their literary creativities through their innermost feelings.  Emergent tradition and African poetry is therefore a product of the modern poets and poetry as a tool for social change and it marks an important development of political consciousness and also, there is a common</p> <p>ideology uniting poets like Niyi Osundare, Tanure Ojaide and Kofi Anyidoho of Chana.  All these poets share the idea that literature can be employed to mediate in socio-political formation.</p> <p>Apart from this they deploy literary language pattern that communicates to an average reader because most of their works are not entangled with the kind of syntactic obstacles and abstractors found in the so called dominant poets or writer like Wole Soyinka and early Christoper Ohigbo.</p> <p>For instance some of these emergent poets even find popular language variety like pidgin to be a useful means of aesthetic communication.  There is the light-hearted impact of Ojaide’s pidgin rendition of the Image “Mami Wata” (sea goddess).  The mere fact that foreign languages are used could occasionally create disagreement, but modern African poetry attempts to reflects indigenous rhythms.  They believed that black poetic imagination must be differentiated from the western tradition of poetry as long as the artistic philosophy of African writers is rooted in literary tradition. The artistic practices and principles shared by various Black African Societies  provide the common bases for modern African poets in African descents.</p> <p>Literary tradition and its legitimizing claims cultural or historical affinities.  They are at best efforts of black intellectuals committed to making a claim to a unifying black literary heritage.  Femi Ojo Ade’s sustained scholarly preoccupation with constructing a black literary tradition as evident in Colour and Culture in literature  (1984).</p> <p>Young black intellectuals followed these tradition and read the principal works of their exponents which gave a powerful to criticise western society and culture to reappraise political and social frame work of the colonial relationship and the moral and spiritual value of the culture of their colonial masters.</p> <p>The efforts of the emergent tradition is remarkable in the sense that it generated the enduring problematic in African critical practice, all of which is associated with the task of clarifying the African literary identity.   Literary tradition in African writing was first empowered by the anxiety of writers like Toban lo Liyong who detected discrepancies in literary productivity in various parts of the continent it was flowed by the arbitrariness of the criteria adopted.  For instance, West African poetic tradition, considering the diversity of her people and the forms of colonialism experienced in the region.  Each of the two sub traditions in West African poetry, the Anglophone and the Francophone is a product of a unique colonial experience.  This is largely responsible for reinforcing received assumptions with regard to the Canon of African poetry, as representative poets are often identified in each case, especially when such studies are incorporated into comprehensive surveys of the literature of the region concerned because such works are significant both for the writers they recognised and that which is excluded  because the pattern accounts for the recognition of certain poets as representing  the  literary achievement of a region.</p> <p>This research work of emergent tradition and the African poetry, will be represented by using Tanure Ojaide’s selected poems of “The Fate of Vultures” and “The endless song” and other poems” like “The music of pain” and “For my Love”.</p> <p>In Ojaide’s poetry is writings or works are based on his experience during his period or his time, which is part of one of the importance of emergent tradition and African poetry.  It also implies that the poet takes the responsibility of using his work to create awareness of socio political crisis.  It also goes beyond this to provide alternative political practice that allows for equality, justice and protection for all.  In his poem The music of pain he talked about the military class for its coercion, corruption, lawlessness, injustice and class segregation.  These key problems are revealed through his specific poetic devices.  Ojaide’s  pattern of literary writings portrays  him as a poet of African poetry whose works are based on what is happening in his environment.</p> <p>PURPOSE OF STUDY</p> <p>The purpose of study of the research work is to take a closer look at literary traditions of the emergent writers in the context of African literature, recent creative works show evidence of innovation and reinvention from the aesthetic traditions he inherited from the aesthetic traditions he inherited from the dominant writers and also partially from the residual writers.  In this research work a close look will be given to Tanure Ojaide’s work by believe looking at some of his poems like “The Fate of Vultures”, and “The music of pain”, The Endless song”, and For my Love”   These poems are due to the poet’s experience during his period or his time which is one of the importance of literary tradition in African poetry.  It is believed that no writer writes in a vacuum but according to the goings-on at a particular period.</p> <p>This study will examine his selected poems will be used as some kinds of record of the changes and the growth of emergent tradition in African poetry as his works are used to expose or create awareness of socio political crisis and the political instability in his country (Nigeria) to be precise.  For example in his poem “The music of pain”, he talked about the military class segregation, these key problems are revealed through specific poetic devices.  These work centre mostly on the clarion call for all, so that there will be equality and political justice in the society or the country.  This research work will show how the poet has demonstrated himself as the mouth piece of the masses through his works.</p> <p>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This research work will start by giving a general introduction of what “emergent traditions and African poetry” is, and how they go along together under the theory of literary tradition.  Four of his poems will be considered in this research work for us not to go outside the topic or things that are not relevant in this research work.  “The fate of vultures”, “The music of pain”,  “The endless song”  and “For my house” are the poems to be considered in this research study.</p> <p>The chapter two centers on the literature review of emergent tradition and African poetry.  It will also centre on facts from works already done in relation to this research topic after which there will be a data analysis of the two selection of poems applied for this research work which are, The fate of vulture and other poems and Endless song and other poems.  These analysis will be in chapter three and four under the topic emergent writer and social issues and Emergent writers and the question of tradition respectively.  </p> <p>JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This study will examine the ideas and the themes in Ojaide’s poetry.  What is African in</p> <p>his poetry and look at literary tradition from his perspectives, his feelings and his experience</p> <p>during his own period as it does not only touches him but other poets who believed in his</p> <p>ideology that no literary work is written in vacuum and set for himself and writer who is</p> <p>concerned about the political and social – ills in his environment.</p> <p>METHODOLOGY</p> <p>The sociological approach will be adopted in the analysis of Ojaide’s selected poems. The sociological of Ojaide’s selected poems.  The sociological theory is interested in understanding the social milieu and the extent and manner in which artists responds to it.  This theory is also interested in understanding the cultural relationship of the people.  This theory believe that in any society we have two dominant classes which are proletariat and the bourgeoisies that is, the upper class and the middle class, it also preach about humanism with reference to Maxwell Adereth (1960) who said that “Literature does more than mirror of the world”.   Since it actively intervenes in other to change the society.</p> <p>Ojaide’s poems talks about how literature is also recognised as a weapon for social change and this is also the same idea of some emergent writers like Niyi Osundare,  Kofi Anyidoho of Ghana, Femi Osorisan and Tanure Ojaide.  All these poets believed that literature is a means of how writer expressed their innermost feelings and mind.</p> <p>STRUCTURE OF THESIS</p> <p>This research work will have five chapters, chapter one, which is the introduction, purpose of the study, scope of the study, justification, methodology and structure of thesis.</p> <p>Chapter two will be literature review, it will examine relevant works on Tanure Ojaide’s selected poems that will be used in this research study.  Chapter three, with the title “Emergent tradition and African poetry using Ojaide’s selected poems”, it will consist of textual analysis under the topic The emergent writers and social issues in chapter three examples from Ojaide’s poems which are “The Fate of Vultures   and “The music of pain”.  The chapter four will centre on the analysis of the other two poems under the topic Emergent writers and the question of tradition a study of the “Endless Song”  and  “For my Love”.   The chapter Five will be The Conclusion, the research draws on the facts generated from the analysis of the prominent themes of the project.</p> <p>In my own opinion, I suggest that whenever creativity calls for smart conniving, in order to service and avoid prosecution and yet be transparent enough to register his message.  Ojaide engages metaphors, images, linguistic and semantic manipulative, and legends from folklores and history to speak his thoughts, make his points and depict topical conditions mostly human.</p>\n\nEMERGENT TRADITION AND THE AFRICAN POETRY, A CASE STUDY OF TANURE OJAIDE’S THE “FATE OF VULTURES” AND “ENDLESS SONG”<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EMERGENT TRADITION AND THE AFRICAN POETRY, A CASE STUDY OF TANURE OJAIDE’S THE “FATE OF VULTURES” AND “ENDLESS SONG”", "id": 79}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0     Introduction</p> <p>This chapter will look into the background and the general introduction of feminism using Buchi Emecheta and Zaynab Akali’s ‘The Joys of Motherhood and ‘The Stillborn’ respectively. Also, it shall discuss purpose and scope of the study and finally the biography of the two authors.</p> <p>1.1     Background of the study</p> <p>Feminist ideology is found on the need to develop a female tradition of creativity to cause awareness on the plight of women as the oppressed, deprived, subjugated and unfulfilled gender. This ideology is known in European Africa continents.</p> <p>On the European scene, in the 18th century, the male writers like snake spare, Chaucer, John and Milton had made their names as great author and set tradition for stale and form in literature. However, their writings hardly focused on the female character but when female authors like Austen, George Eliot came to the scene in the 19th century, their works suffered rejection for what was regarded as ‘19th century critics’ as their female trivialities and frivolities in their choice of themes and in their characterization.</p> <p>Feminism is seen in Africa as an imported ideology alien to the African society and it is seen as the newest form of neo-colonialism and so because of this most of African female writers preferred to be referred to as motherist or womanist instead of feminist because Africans believe that most matrimonial homes have being ruined because of feminism. Womanism according to Alice Walker means matured, responsible, courageous behaviour of girlish gender.</p> <p>In Nigeria, women have gone into professions that were once regarded as exclusively for men. This is to say that Nigeria women are achieving more of her goals and gradually asserting herself. Religiously, feminism is believed to be evil and being regarded as a rebellious act of the female gender. Feminism is believed to be the lie of the Devil {Gen.3:6). According to Pastor Jack, he referred to feminist as ‘Goddesses who have being forced into amnesia by primitive white men trying to keep them from their true potential’. He added that feminism is a spiritual movement partly on reawakening goddesses consciousness and its real goal is matriarchy not equality. Socially, women are climbing the ladder of success as women now earn as much as men, after taking into account such as family status, education, profession and the number of hour worked.</p> <p>Putting all these argument together, one can come up with a working definition of feminism as a political, cultural and economic movement aimed at establishing greater, equal or among a minority superior right and participation in society for the female folks.</p> <p>There are many issue militating against feminism in Nigeria and Africa as a whole. This is because feminism is viewed by men as an unpardonable drive for equality between sexes in a rather negative outburst which is a reflection on the dominant cultural attitude in Nigeria. A newspaper article of Nigeria Dailies covering a period between March and November 1996 describe feminist as ‘——- iconoclasts who want to subvert tradition, treat religious injunction with disdain and pick holes in the sociological make-up of the people it is therefore obvious that such negative and conservative motion persist with regards to feminism in this jet-age of liberation of anthropologist, sociologist, political growth.</p> <p>Different supportive organizations have being raised to assist the female forks examples are National Council of Women Society (NCWAS). The Women in Nigeria (WIN). The Nigeria Association of Women Advancement (NAWA). However, despite the achievement and the effort made by both governmental and non-governmental organization, feminism has not reached dominated society and westerly influenced both locally and internationally.</p> <p>Olu Obafemi remarked that ‘as a result of the prevalent nature of the systematic obfuscation of ideological perception of the society ——— a deliberate mystification by the perpetration of the status quo clear ideological position and friends are yet to gain objective, appreciation, tolerance of expression and responsiveness from the dominant socio-political system’ it is from within this social milieu that the few feminist novel in Nigeria have emerged a society that promote the mystification of feminism to portrait dehumanization of women can hardly produce a large number of feminist writers and writings of a thoroughly uninhibited feminist discourse, hence, on the literary scene, we have situation where by women writers and critics are apologetic on behalf of feminism. Feminist therefore prefer to be appreciated rather than being criticized for their effort, they also want to be supported though encouragement to work harder and alongside the opposite sex.</p> <p>1.2     The Purpose Of The Study</p> <p>This work examines the concept of feminism and various roles women play in the society through the work of both gender writers.</p> <p>It also examines the response of the females to the male dominated society and bring out the feminist perspective in the works of various writers. It also examines that women too have played great roles in the growth of the society and their immediate families, thus, they deserve to be acknowledged and appreciated by the male gender.</p> <p>1.3     The Scope of The Study</p> <p>The scope of this study is limited to feminism as portrayed in the work of Buchi Emecheta and Zaynab Alkali’s ‘The Joys of motherhood’ and ‘The stillborn’ respectively.</p> <p>In order to make a thorough investigation, the research has adopted two authors as a case study with the view of scholars in other works reviewed in the study.</p> <p>Justification of the Study</p> <p>This study is being undertaken to find out what is slowing down the emergence of feminism in Nigeria and Africa as a whole and also to determine the feminist inclination of both works in the society.</p> <p>Another significance of this work is the contribution unto the knowledge which hopefully will make a new insight into the literary merit of the two author’s novel.</p> <p>Another significance of this study is the fresh argument which will raise as regards the question of feminism and male domination in the African novel.</p> <p>1.4     Biography of the two Authors</p> <p>Zaynab Alkali according to wikipendia came from a Islamic family in a village in Borno state, Nigeria but they moved to a Christian village in Gongola state where she was brought up. The entrance of Zaynab into being fond of Nigeria female writers is significant to a historical scene as well as the scene of her contribution to our literary tradition. She a lecturer of English in the University of Maiduguri, since 1975 even a female voice from the North acute sensitivity to a typically female issue experience and problem, we may well expect that Zaynab would contribute illuminately southern female writer such as Flora Nwapa, Tessy Onwene, Cathererine Achlonu and others.</p> <p>The female tradition of writers in which Zaynab is now itching her place is least now pivoted on how main stream on the other hand are the resolute of  the feminist writer such as Buchi Emecheta and vigorous  literary critics through their contently regorals writings. She attempts to correct prevalent erroneous male perception of women and demonstrate the class of female writers who just vigorously deny any claim to the ideology of feminism as in the example of Zulu Sofola and others in any case of their works who do not primarily concern themselves with the feminist literary concept.</p> <p>Like her predecessors, Zaynab is deeply conscious of fundamental conflict that confronted the emergent and will as a Nigeria women whether she lives in the village or in the crowd of character that sometimes confuse the thread of the first story we can outline the emotional development of the precious girl-hero in an attempt to heighten Li’s role in the novel. Alkali surrounds her main character who plays only transient role in the story.</p> <p>Buchi Emecheta according to Wikipedia was born on July 21, 1944 in Lagos to Igbo parents. Due to gender bias of the time, the young Buchi was initially kept at home while her younger brother was sent to school but after persuading her parents to consider the benefits of education, Buchi spent her early school at an All-girls missionary school. Buchi received a full scholarship to the Methodist Girl’s school a year after her father died, where she remained until she was married to Sylvester Onwordi at sixteen years old. After her marriage, she bore five children in six years but it was an unhappy oft-violent marriage. To keep her sanity, Emecheta wrote at her spare time, however, her husband was deeply suspicious of her writing and he ultimately burnt her first manuscript. At the of 22, while working as a Librarian at the British Museum, Dr. Emecheta left her husband and supported all five children while earning a Bsc degree in sociology at the University of London. She also wrote prolifically, publishing articles about Black British in several journals and newspaper. In 1972, she published her first book of shorts in the ditch’. The semi-autobiography book chronicled the struggle of a main character named Adah who is forced to live in a housing estate while working as a librarian to support her five children.</p> <p>From 1969-1976, Dr. Emecheta was a youth worker and a sociologist for the inner London Education Authority. She then visited the United State as a community worker in Camden , New Jersey from 1976-1978. as a successful author and visiting professor, she has traveled throughout the world visiting Universities both locally and intentionally.</p> <p>Dr. Emecheta once described her stories as ‘stories of the world (where) women face the universal problem of poverty and oppression and the longer they stay no matter where they have come from originally, the more the problems become identical’. In 1982, Emecheta and her journalist son ran the Ogwugwu Afor publishing company, whose intention was to promote and financially support the Black artist; Her works include ‘The Bride price’ 1976, ‘Our own freedom’ 1981, ‘The Joys of Motherhood’ among others. The Joys of Motherhood is a fictional record of her true feeling at a point in time.</p> <p>1.5     Endnote.</p> <ol><li>Alice Walker: In search of our Mothers Gender: A woman’s Prose [NV:Hb] Books. 1989 (pg 11-12.</li> <li>Pastor Jack Hyles: How to destroy the Human Race.</li> <li>Biodun Ajayi ‘Feminism: a lost Battle’ an article of August 24, 1993.</li> <li>Olu Obafemi: ‘Towards Feminism Aesthetics in Nigerian Drama: The plays of Tess Onwnene’.

It has discovered, for instance that the persistent inequality between men and women in the Nigeria society which Alkali works portray, has contributed to the general disempowerment of women. Alkali however, projects womanhood in a positive light she upholds female potentialities which the patriarchal structure has represent. As a feminist, she aims her female character with an intensity of vision and makes role models out of them. This study has further discovered that illiteracy among women is on a slow decline compared to that of men. The education of the female child is a rarity in Northern Nigeria. This has affected noticeably the quality of life that the female child experiences. Zaynab Alkali has therefore, presents education as the most essential weapon for challenging one aspect of gender inequality which is the educational disempowerment of the woman. Feminist Aesthetic in Zaynab Alkali’s in The Stillborn and The Virtuous Womanhas been discussed and our findings reveal that education plays major role in women emancipation and liberation in a patriarchal society. The study has concluded that there is a need to re-evaluate and re-define gender roles in African society in order to establish mutual complementary between men and women and it recommended that both sexes should be equally trained for the joy of motherhood to be full realized and that education underscores a fundamental necessity for the mental and material liberation of women from male domination.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>Chapter one</p> <p>1.0     Introduction to the Study</p> <p>1.1     Purpose/Significance</p> <p>1.2     Scope and Limitation</p> <p>1.3     Justification of the study</p> <p>1.4     Methodology</p> <p>1.5     The Research Questions</p> <p>1.6     Authorial Background</p> <p>Chapter two:  the Literature Review</p> <p>2.0     Introduction</p> <p>2.1     Feminist Theory</p> <p>2.2     Types of Feminism</p> <p>2.2.1  Liberal Feminism</p> <p>2.2.2  Radical Feminism</p> <p>2.2.3  Marxist Feminism</p> <p>2.2.4  Socialist Feminism</p> <p>2.2.5  Cultural Feminism</p> <p>2.2.6  Black/African Feminism</p><p>   </p> <p>2.3     A Review of Feminist Aesthetics</p> <p> Chapter three</p> <p>3.0     Introduction</p> <p>3.1     Plot Construction</p> <p>3.2     Image of Womanhood</p> <p>3.3     Feminist Tendencies</p> <p>3.4     Gender Equity</p> <p>3.5     Female Modern Characterization</p> <p>3.6     Language and Style</p> <p>3.7     The Function of Feminist Aesthetics in Zaynab Alkali’s The Stillborn</p> <p> Chapter Four</p> <p>4.0     Introduction</p> <p>4.1     Plot Construction</p> <p>4.2     Image of Womanhood</p> <p>4.3     Gender Equity</p> <p>4.4     Motherhood</p> <p>4.5     Female Modern Characterization</p> <p>4.6     Language and Style</p> <p>4.7     The Feminist Aesthetics in Zaynab Alkali’s The Virtuous Woman</p> <p>Chapter five</p> <p>Summary</p> <p>Findings</p> <p>Conclusion</p><p>   </p> <p>Bibliography</p> <p>CHAPTER  ONE</p> <p>1.0     INTRODUCTION</p> <p>A man never  begins by presenting himself as an individual of a certain sex, but a woman has to define herself as a woman from start. The masculine is regarded as the very type of humanity and woman is seen as relative to man. This act is what gives birth to a term “Feminism”.</p> <p>Feminism according to the Oxford Advanced Dictionary is “the movement for recognition of women’s rights (legal, political, social etc.) equal to possess by men”.  Although,  the term ‘Feminism’ has a history in English linked with womens activism form the late 19th century to the present, it is useful of distinguish feminist ideas or beliefs from feminist political movements for even in periods when they have been no significant in political activism around women’s subordination, individual has been concerned with and the theorized about justice for women.</p> <p>Feminism is an ideology which is a direct reation to the social and psychological restraints place upon women. Femilism come as a result of an attempt by the women to liberate their feet from traditional claws in African patriarchal society that allow the male see to exercise authority and emphasis male supremacy over the female. This is basically to bring impediments on the path of the women in realization of their potentials.</p> <p>Joseph (2001:163) also aserts that “in order to be almost inextricaly successful in that chauvinist patriarchal society and authoritarian set-up the society conditions and manipulates the economic and psychological being of a woman”. Through history, women has always struggled against male domination and suppression, be it political, religious, economical or social.</p> <p>The major reason for the women’s strive and thirst for quality with men can be traced to the changing role for women in contemporary West Africa is not to say that the traditional role of women as keeper of home, mother obedient, mate participation in actions, economics are being eliminated rather, it is to state a fairly obvious sociological fact. Society is not stagnant technologies and science just as the general societal changes have occurred in different part of the countries, so also is the changes in the role of women. The changes in the educational set up include changes in the educational set up include changes attitudes economics, political and society environmental of women which necessarily alter their roles.</p> <p>Most African female writers seek to address the plight of women in most of their works. The advent of women into an exclusively male world was possible with an increasing sensitivity to inequalities of sexism. This issue forms the base of the African women writers. The women came to awareness that there is the heed to change the image of women from the oppressed and the underdog.</p> <p>As a result of this fact, gender scholars and feminist writers have continuously lamented the sad plight of women, especially women who are not adequately empowered, in their works. Feminist writers in Europe and America like Virginia Woolf and Elaine Showalter have dwelt almost on the same concerns that dominated the thematic pre-occupation of African Feminist writers like Buchi Emecheta , Flora Nwapa, Ifeoma Okoye, Mariam Ba, Zulu Sofola, Zaynab Alkali and others. The main concern of most of these female is the problem confronting women. The female writer gives manly qualities to their female characters and makes the men to play a secondary role. This trend in female writers makes them feminist.</p> <p>It is important to say that female writers also gained approval in the society through the assistance of some male writers whose techniques of writing are different from the female form. Showalter (1988:209) posits that “there is any specifically male and female way of writing or approaching test because human imagination is essentially genderless” for examples is critical reading in Sembene Ousmane God’s Bits of Wood (1962) which portray female characters as revolutionary activists. They take up the leadership roles to fight oppression in the society. The women march from Thies to Dakar with no food and water, though many lose their lives in the struggle, those who are left to achieve success at the end of the railway strike. Ngugi Wa also shows the sterling quality of women in the African society. In a Grain of Wheat, women did not only stand by their men, they also participate in various active parts in the struggle for freedom and Wole Soyinka’s The Lion and the Jewel (1964) would be shallow without paying attention to the influence of the women folk in the strike action in the novel and the roles play by Sadiku and Sidi in the play respectively.</p> <p>Education therefore is believed by many writers to be the major agent of women’s liberation and emancipation with Western form of education, more women are now empowered to express themselves and assert their right to be heard. Women thereby write to create awareness in the societies. The awareness will lead women to speak out their minds in matters concerning them.</p> <p>Aesthetics on the other hand means the study of beauty of art. From the consideration of this project topic Feminist Aesthetic in Zaynab Alkali’s The Stillborn and The Virtuous Woman implies those elements and facts the novelist write to glorify womanhood in struggle for the attainment of self liberation and transformation for the beauty and betterment of the societal growth. Through feminism, she identifies the social qualities imposed on feminine roles which place excessive restraints upon women and conclude that neither a woman nor a man can be free unless each rejects fixed roles in all their forms. Her belief is that it is essential that women throughout Africa be allowed and encouraged to fulfil their potential for them to make an effective contribution to nation building.</p> <p> 1.2     Purpose of the study</p> <p>This project work is to examine and emphasized the ideological production of ‘Femininity’ as ‘other’ of patriarchy and the need therefore for women to become ‘real’ subjects and to discover their ‘true’ selves. It also examine the theme of female oppression by men as well as the struggle by women for emancipation in Zaynab Alkali’s The Stillborn and The Virtuous Woman where you will see how African women in projected. All her works hoped to promote an awareness of female educational development which would lead to the socio-economic and political empowerment of more African women.</p> <p>This project work centred on how improvement can be brought women condition in Africa.  Zaynab Alkali writes to asses as one of the African writer on feminists and recipes for improving the women condition in Africa.</p> <p> 1.3     Scope of THE study</p> <p>The scope of this project work is focused on Feminist Aesthetic in African Literature with a close study of two novels written by one of the Nigerian leading female writer, Zaynab Alkali. The novels to be studied are The Stillborn and The Virtuous Woman. Reference shall however be made to other relevant works which centre on feminism in the African sense of the word.</p> <p>1.4     Justification of the study</p> <p>In Africa culture, women have been subjected to oppression, depression, suppression, rejection, and segregation and unfair and undue victimizations. This is duely because of the insignificant view that the analysis of Zaynab Alkali’s novels The Stillborn and The Virtuous Woman will be carried out to identify how she function in instructing the society thereby helping it to develop and also bring out the beauty of woman significance for the betterment of the society. In the process of data collected, the library would be consulted before embarking on this project. There is need to find out what has been written on the subject so as to guide the researcher on the general nature of the work and to add more view to improve or better the on-going project.</p> <p>However, this study will attempt to pay a critical attention to the awareness created in the above books of Zaynab Alkali so as to bring out the aesthetics of feminism and their contributions to societal growth.</p> <p>1.5     METHODOLOGY</p> <p>There will be a general study of various texts with aim of finding two that relate to feminism. Having done this, a research will be carried out to pursue works connecting to the element and concept under study of feminism including works previously written on the concept. This will give root of background to the study. Any information gathered will be used to carry out proper work.</p> <p>The analysis of Zaynab Alkali’s novels The Stillborn and The Virtuous Woman will be carried out to identify how they function in instructing the society thereby helping it to develop and also bring out the beauty of woman significant and betterment of the society. In the process of data collection, the library would be consulted before embarking on this project, there is need to find out what has been written on the subject so as to guide the researcher on the general nature of the work and to add more view to improve or better the on-going project.</p> <p>1.6     THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>What are the tenets of gender aesthetics?</p> <p>What are the primary concerns of these two novels of Zaynab Alkali’s The Stillborn and The Virtuous Woman to feminism issue?</p> <p>What is the significance of women in the society?</p> <p>1.7     Authorial background of zaynab alkali</p> <p>Zaynab’s father is said to have come from Dam, a village in Borno State in the Northern part of Nigeria, but he moved to Gongola also in the northern region where Zaynab herself was born and brought up in the early 1960s. She attended Queen’s College and later went for further Degree in English before taking up the post of Principal of Shekaka Girl’s College, Kano in 1976, she was appointed as lecturer at Bayero University, Kano.</p> <p>Zaynab Alkali’s belongs to the group of African Feminist writer that fervently decry the condition of women. Her published books are The Stillborn (1984), The Virtuous Woman (1986), The Descendent (2003) and other short stories collection Cowbells and other Stories (1997). Her pre-occupation is the plight of women in a society where the only means of survival, physical and emotional is to attain considerable level of education and economic independence.</p> <p>As a feminist writer, Zaynab writes to deconstruct and at the same time to correct the evils of patriarchy in her society. In this society, women are regarded as mere subordinate to their men counterpart. They are subjugated and oppressed under the guise of male supremacy over female. The way out is what Zaynab Alkali’s trying to depict in her works</p>\n\nFEMINIST AESTHETIC IN ZAYNAB ALKALI’S THE STILLBORN AND THE VIRTUOUS WOMAN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FEMINIST AESTHETIC IN ZAYNAB ALKALI’S THE STILLBORN AND THE VIRTUOUS WOMAN", "id": 81}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Feminism as a concept gained approval the help of some male feminist writers who write for the sake of women liberation but this concept has its limitations.

(Joseph 2003:99) describes feminism as an ideology of social commitment to the struggle for female libration in the society through conscious and collective effort.</p> <p>Feminism Raji (1999:228) says feminism a concerns itself with contemporary agitation by women for social economics, political and cultural equality with male counterparts”. Most feminists are especially concerned with social, political and economic inequality between men and women.</p> <p>First inaugurated in the sixties, feminist criticism proceeds from the assumption that “the history of all the societies is the history patriarch of male domination and exploitation of women, a situation which women clam has hundred the actualization of women’s possibilities aid potentials in all fields of human endeavour. Just as feminism clamed in murices, feminists behaves that literature represents a very strong infrastructural support of this patriarchal ideology Abram (1998;209) says:</p> <p><em>Typically, the most highly regarded literary works on male protagonist to these, the female characters when they play a role are marginal end subordinate…………….and implicitly addressed to male readers either leave the women reader as an alien outsider or else solicit her to identify….and ways of perceiving.</em></p> <p>Feminism like Marxism is concerned about societal inequalities. It is also a literary ideology founded on the need to develop a female tradition of creativity to cause awareness on the high of women as the oppressed, deprived, subjugated and unfulfilled gender. It is directed against patriarchal hegemony which according to Josephy (2003) “gives men confidence, subordination the female to male or treats the female as an inferior being:</p> <p>Marxism recognizes that women are oppressed, and attributes the oppresses to the capitalist/private property system. Thus, it insists that the only way to end the oppression of women is to overthrow the capitalism system (Christian, 1985). Marxism and feminism as schools of thought are different but they have a meeting point while Marxism deals with class stratification between the wealthy and the poor, feminism discussion gender discrimination between the oppressing male and oppressed female. The bottom line is that they are both fighting for the same cause which is liberation of the people from oppression, exploitation and domination.</p> <p>Feminism as an ideology later, pined a fertile ground in Africa in the 1960’s Obioma Nnaemeka (995) establishes the fundamental purpose of the discussion when she assets that:</p> <p><em>Fermium provides the opportunity of evaluating attitudes and misconception about women which have buttressed all along both by African culture and the misogynous tradition of European colonial masters.</em></p> <p>      Where are varieties of African feminism feminist writers like Acholonu behave that women should not be seen as objects to decorate the homes but they should be regarded as major contributors to the destiny of the nation without really affecting the roles as mothers and wives at home in her article titled “Buchi Emecheta” (1988) acholonu says:</p> <p><em>Women should no longer be decorative accessories, objects to be moved about, and companions to be flattered or claimed with promises. They should see themselves as nation’s primary fundamental roots, from which all else grows and blossoms. Women must be encouraged to takes a keen interest in the destiny of the country. </em></p> <p>African feminist writers can be grouped in for the liberal and the radical Encydopeadia of feminist theory says liberal feminism “advocates equal rights for women”. The writers are gradient in their approaches to women emancipation as they portray the ability of their rural women of be at par with man in farming. Writers in these categories include flora Nwapa, Zaynab Alkali and the base most of their early works on rural protagonists who are created to realize their fund potentials as human beings and to contribute the special demine quota to the general improvement of the society.</p> <p>The radical feminist writer on the other hand approaches women’s literature from materialist perspective. It is an approach to feminist thinking and action which maintains that the sex gender system is the fundamental cause of women’s oppression. Writer in the category include Molara Ogundipa Leslie, Mariam Ba and Animata sowfall.</p> <p>Radical and liberal as types of African feminism are different in their approach to writings. Radical feminists are harsh, militant and most forceful form of feminism. Radicalists believers that women are oppressed as a result of her sex/gender while liberal are slow and lenient in their writings in the sense that, they advocates equal rights for men.</p> <p>The rebel against anything that subjugates or relegates women to the background. The radicalists relegated women to the background. The radicalists and the liberalists advocates joint efforts across gender in solving human problems, aid in developing a solid society, again, they behave in education as a weapon that women need to challenge patriarchy.</p> <p>On the whole the bottom line is that they are both fighting for the same cause which is the liberation of self expression, self fulfillment in a world that is male dominated. Talking about Zaynab Alkali’s <em>the stubborn</em> from the liberal perspective. Alkali compasses women’s need for economic independence but also the need for women to work with men to build a new society. Zaynab concerns in her works the plight of the rural woman, whose effort to satisfy the man is trivialized. The novel encloses and records the heartaches and disappointment of the women in the society the presents the values of virtue and self determination for self construction of women in a patriarchal society. She endows with trampy through her tough and indomitable determination. She becomes truly liberated from humiliation, betrayal, oppression and brutalization in the hands of Habu Adams. Li finds education as the key to her freedom from male subjugation and dehumanization and therefore puts the past behind and focuses on the future. Zaynab builds a vision of a better’s life based on economic independence, self sacrifice and solidarity between men and women. Also, we shall consider Marian Ba’s so long a letters from the radical perspective. Ba’s works treat issues of conflicts for survival in an oppressive society and freedom from subjugation. An example of this is Aissaton in so long letter who struggled to survive in African patriarchal society. Marian uses education as a weapon needed for the challenges of self determination. She creates two females friends Aissatou and Ramatoulaye who face matrimonial disappointments with their respective polygamous husbands. Aissation gets imbued with the near spirit of liberation gained through her education and intellect and refuses to accept any self made destroy to oppress her.</p> <p>Women are portrayed in this novel in different guises of check patriarchy. They are portrayed as friend’s enemies within to expose the effects of patriarchy on them and to put a cheek on it.</p> <p>African male playwrights and other characters</p> <p>African male playwrights have presented better myths and images of women in their writings writers include Wole Soyinka, Ngugi wa Thiong’o and Olu Obafemi. Soyinka autobiographies inevitably presents strong women because that was how things were in reality as we are familiar with the history of Abeokuta woman as a strong force for women’s mobilization against oppression. These playwrights depict their female characters as being strong, resourceful and skillful against the mundane opinion of some writers who point to women as being second fiddle. They have presented myths and images of women in most of their works. We shall use Olu Obafemi wheals suicide syndrome and Ngug: Wa  Thiong’o the Trial of Dedan Kumathi to show that they have presented more positive images of women consistently. Olu Obafemi suicide syndrome also created a positive role for women in his play. To him women have a dynamic role in the society and should not be seen as second class citizens. The market women in the play protest against the contemptible ways of the bourgeois class which claims there is austerity and declares emergency. Yeye Oja, the matriarchal head mobilizes her colleagues to fight against the ruling elite that keep them in object poverty. Also in his novel wheels, Obafemi recognizes the role which women are playing. This is conveyed through the characters of Abeke and Kemi, who both participate in their own individual significant ways in the task of nation building. Kemi is portrayed positively and given a very wholesome personality. She comes across as vivacious courageous, sensitive and highly motivated participating actively in the social transformation of her society and takes a catalytic part in the entire process. To this extent, Obafemi has recognized the potentials of the women to complement the efforts of the men to transform the society.</p> <p>In the trial of Dedan Kimathi, the playwrights identify women as an integral part of the guariila movement. The role women play cannot be over emphasized Mugo and Ngugi see women in the evolutional struggle as an embodiment of unity, loyalty and faithfulness. The women in the trial of Dedan Kimath is see as the champion of the oppressed Kenyans. She mobilizes the youths, mainly the body and girl to free Kimathi, the imprisoned leader of man, man freedom fighters.</p> <p>Purpose</p> <p>This study examiners the aesthetics of feminism in African drama through a critical study of Temi Osofisan’s Morountodun and Ola Rotimi’s our I thus bands have gone mad Again. The work focuses on conscientizing women to rise up to the challenges in the society with understanding of the roles they could play in their community to make the society a better place. It also focuses on how women have struggled side by side with their male counterparts, against the general injustice and oppression that the few privileged impose on the majority underprivileged.</p> <p>Justification</p> <p>The importance of women many given society can neither be underestimated nor can research on their past, present and future be exhausted. Osofisan recognized the role which women are capable of undertaking in revolutionary process. He has gone a long way to bring out the fact that women and their positions in the society are inevitable in societal development. He therefore does not leave out women in his call for revolutionary activities since he believes that everyone is to be involved in any successful revolution.</p> <p>Methodology</p> <p>In this study, we shall adopt liberal feminism to our study. This is because liberalists recognize women as human beings and agitate for women equal opportunity, so that they can contribute their own quota to national development. On the whole, Osofisan is more of a liberal feminist than a radical feminist. The scope of the long essay covers four chapters. Chapter one is the general introduction which comprises the purpose, justification, and methodology. Chapter two will be literature review i.e the comments of some critics about the pre-occupation of Femi Osofisan’s Morountodun. Chapter three on themes, the personality of women, the role of women in the social political struggle, the contrastive study of male and female characters and the biography of another. Chapter four will be summary, finding and conclusion.</p> <p>Scope</p> <p>This research work will only cover aspect of feminism and areas related to it. It will be limited to the feminist concept in Femi Osofisan’s Morountodun Attension shall be focused on defining feminism as a ideology. With feminism, our scope is limited to include only works that focus on or raise issues relating to women, situations and events affecting them.</p>\n\nFEMINIST AESTHETICS IN OLA ROTIMI’S OUR HUSBAND HAS GONE MAD AGAIN AND FEMI OSOFISAN’S MOROUNTODUN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FEMINIST AESTHETICS IN OLA ROTIMI’S OUR HUSBAND HAS GONE MAD AGAIN AND FEMI OSOFISAN’S MOROUNTODUN", "id": 82}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Folklore as an aspect of the African oral tradition has been traced to traditional African society handed down by customs, beliefs and an aspect of culture handed down by our for forefathers through orature.  Conflict that arises over death and the quest for re-invention in the plays of Wole Soyinka’s Death and the King’s Horseman (1975) and Hope Eghagha’s Death not a Redeemer, (1998) as well as the themes, genres, song and other aspect of oral literature that form its aesthetics.

Hope Eghagha’s Death not a Redeemer (1998) is motivated by Soyinka’s Death and the king’s Horse man (1975). Few definitions by scholars on folklore will give a better understanding on what folklore entails.</p> <p>Edward D. Ivese and Joe Scott (1978) saw folklore as:</p> <p><em>No song, no performance, no act of creation can be properly understood apart from the culture or sub-culture in which it is bound and which it is a part, nor should any work of art be looked on as a thing in itself apart from the (continuum of creation consumption).</em></p> <p>Benjamin A. Botkin (1938) gives a very clear definition of what folklore is about.</p> <p><em>Folklore is a body of traditional belief, custom and expression handed down largely by word of mouth and circulating chiefly outside of commercial and academic means of communication and instruction.</em></p> <p>These definitions express what folklore entails in different words.</p> <p>Folklore consists of legends, music, oral history proverbs, jokes, popular beliefs, fairy tales and customs that are the traditions of that culture, sub culture or group. It is also the set of practices through which those expressive genres are shared. The study of folkloristic. The word ‘folklore’ was first used by the English antiquarian William Thomas in a letter published by the London journal in 1846. In usage, there is a continuum between folklore and mythology. Smith Thompson made a major attempt to index the motifs of both folklore and mythology providing an outline into which new motifs can be placed and scholars can track all older motifs.</p> <p>Folklore can be divided into four areas of study, artifact (such as voodoo dollar), describable and transmissible entity (oral tradition), culture and behaviour (ritual). These areas do not stand alone; however, as often a particular item or element may fit into more than one of these areas.</p> <p>ARTIF OF ACTS                                           </p> <p>Object such as dolls, decorative items used in religious rituals, hand-built house and barn, and handmade clothing and other crafts are considered to be folk artifacts, grouped within the field as “Material” “culture”. Additionally, figures that depict characters from folklore, such as statues of the three wise monkeys may be considered to be folklore artifacts, depending on how they are used within a culture. The operative definition would depend on whether the artifacts are used and appreciated within the same community in which they are made, and whether they follow a community aesthetic (The three wise monkeys over the Tosho-gu shrine in Nikko, Japan).</p> <p>ORAL TRADITION</p> <p>Folklore can contain religious or mythic elements; it equally concerns itself with the sometimes mundane tradition of everyday life. Folklore frequently ties the practical and the esoteric into one narrative package. It has often been conflated with mythology, and vice versa, because it has been assumed that any figurative story that does not pertain to the dominant beliefs of the time is not of the same status as those dominant beliefs.</p> <p>Sometimes folklore is religious in nature, like the talks of the Welsh Mabinogion or those found in ice landic skaldic poetry. Many of the tales in the Golden legend of Jacob de voragine also embody folklore elements in a Christian mythology are the themes woven round Saint George or Saint Christopher. In this case, the term ‘folklore’ is being used in a pejorative sense. That is, while the talk of Odin the Wanderer has a religious value to the Norse who composed the stories, because it does not fit into a Christian configuration it is not considered “religious” by Christians who may instead refer to it as “folklore”.</p> <p>“Folktales” is a general term for different varieties of traditional narrative. The telling of stories appears to be a cultural universal activity common to basic and complex societies alike. Even the forms folktales take are certainly similar from culture to culture, and comparative studies of themes and narrative ways have been successful in showing these relationship.  Also it is considered to be an oral tale to be told for everybody. On the other hand, folklore can be used to accurately describe a figurative narrative, which has no sacred or religions content. In the Jungian view, which is part of the method of analysis, it may instead pertain to unconscious psychological patterns, instincts or archetypes of the mind. This may or may not have components of the fantastic (such as magic, ethereal beings or the personification of in animate object). This folklore may or may not emerge from a religions tradition, but nevertheless speak to deep psychological issues. The familiar example tale may primarily be one of mundane, instruction regarding forest safety or secondarily a cautionary tale about the dangers of famine to large families, but as latent meaning may evoke a strong emotional response due to the widely understood themes and Motifs such as “the terrible Mother” “Death” and “Atonement with the father”.</p> <p>There can be both moral and psychological scope to work, as well as entertainment value, depending upon the nature of the teller the style of the telling, the age the audience members, and the over all context of the performance. Folklorists generally resist universal interpretation of narrative and where ever possible, analyze oral versions of telling in specific contexts rather than print sources, which often show the work or bias of the writer.</p> <p>CULTURAL ASPECTS OF FOLKLORE AND THE DYNAMICS OF CULTURE</p> <p>Folklore William Bascon says has many cultural aspects, such as allowing for escape from societal consequence. In addition, folklore can also serve to validate a culture (romantic nationalism) as well as transmit a culture’s morals and values. Folklore can also be the root of many cultural types of music; country blues and blues grass all originated from American folklore. Folklore can also be used to ascertain social pressures, or relieve them, for example in the case of humor and carnival. Folklorists study medical, supernatural, religious and political, belief system as an essential, often unspoken, part of expressive culture.</p> <p>Mary Magonlick describes cultures as dynamic. Anthropologists and folklorists of previous generations sometimes lamented that an age of high technology and global capitalism would result in the demise of “traditional” cultures. Today, we more often consider culture and tradition as fluid and dynamic resources which interact with the modern world, rather than bearing over run or determined by it.</p> <p>Folklorists Barre Toelkens Sums up the current view of many scholars about the dynamism and vitality of “culture”. In folklore, as in the biological world, variation from a hypothetical norm is universal. No two individuals are exactly alike in every detail no matter how closely related. Variation affects every sort of characteristics, structural or functional, and occurs in tradition. Toelken says: (1996)</p> <p><em>“Folklore is ever-changing, always developing, on the move.”     </em></p> <p>Toelken also stresses that folklore and cultural processes are all linked by single force. The interactive dynamics of living culture. They can be studied but such studies will offer greater insight when built upon the premise that cultures always change. As scholars from all fields, including physics are nothing, the whole universe and everything within it is in constant movement and flux.</p> <p>When the modern notion of culture was first margined by Victorian Scholars, it was used to prove the evolutionary model Western civilization as the apex of human possibility. These thinkers had Darien’s evolutionary model to work from, and thereby recognize change as a constant force in earlier history. In 19th century Edward Tylor defines culture synonymous with civilization as: (1970)</p> <p><em>“That complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.”   </em></p> <p>Although this definition seems very inclusive and wide ranging, its ultimate effect is to define and ultimately to limit culture as a particular “whole” Tylor accounted for the messiness of his categories with concepts like “Survivals” bits of culture that hang on into the next stage of evolution (1970).</p> <p>Clifford Geertz sees culture as equivalent to a text, and therefore something to be interpreted, Shery B. Ortner explains his concept of cultures “Geertz” arranged that:   (1999)</p> <p><em>“Culture must be seen as the webs of meaning within which people live, meaning encoded in symbolic forms that may be understood through acts of interpretation analogous to work of literary critics…”    </em></p> <p>Geertz’s notion of culture spurred a generation of ethnography and interpretation of cultural production. The notion and practice of “think description” that he contributed are still valuable. Culture has never been seen as other than complex; yet the full measure of its complexity, the extent of the “web” is now emerging as process as vast and overwhelming as life and cosmology.</p> <p>CONTEMPORARY ORAL TRADITION</p> <p>Many genres of folklore have vanished forever with the passing of lest tradition bearers familiar with them. There is living folklore all around. Complex work place lore, various contemporary tales, legend and anecdotes, rumors, parodies on proverbs and riddle. It will be interesting to see that relationship between traditional agrarian folklore and contemporary forms of folklores in the near future, the traditional taxonomy, the perspectives contributed by the theory of immanent Art, ethnopoetics, cognitive, science, structuralism, sociolinguistic, psycholinguistic, as well as the notion of folkloristic variation.</p> <p>These developments all represent a shift away from the world of old text criticism of purely and solely diachronic or typologically oriented frame works, and they also mean a shift away from the world of grammar new syntheses.</p> <p>Tradition and Authenticity: cultural renewed occurs individually, flowing from and shaping individual lives, while shaping and resonating with lager patterns of traditions, worldview, and personal inspiration. Tradition flows into and from this process of convergence. Classic defines tradition as: (1995).</p> <p><em>“History, culture, and the human actor meet tradition, which is volitional, temporal action”.  </em></p> <p>When humans commit to willful acts of creation intended to express cultural or social connection, they are participating authentically in traditional culture. Throughout time and space cultures change and adapt rather than die.</p> <p>Dell Hymes (1975) understands tradition in equally fluid and emergent terms:</p> <p><em>“the traditional begins with the personal. Its distribution in history, in a community, is important, but secondary, not defining. Something’s partakes of the nature of the traditional already when the effort to traditionalize has brought it into bearing… intact traditional is not so much a matter re-creation, by successive persons and generations, and in individual performance. ”</em></p> <p>Folklore and tradition both rest on notions of situation creativity and performance.</p> <p>Demallie (1988) develops his definition of culture with consideration of the dynamic and fluid nature of culture. He notes that both symbols and their associated meanings change over time and according to various outside and inside influences, providing the dynamic that keeps human groups in constant flux. Such fluidity of culture is universal and natural. Give this fluid and dynamic definition of culture. “<em>authemtic</em>” need only refer to moments of creativity or interpretation, when individual commitment brings social association. So long as one acts freely, with desire to connect to the “<em>traditional” </em>within a society (i.e, the work and ideals of other society members which are also willful, creative and consciously connected to values or ideals of a social group) resultant creations, expressions or interpretation are authentic.</p> <p>FOLKLORE IN NEW WORLD BLACK FICTION: WRITING AND ORAL TRADITION AESTHETICS (REINVENTION OF CULTURE) CHIJI AKOMA </p> <p>The complexity of the new world demands that any meaningful exploration of its cultural landscape, especially with reference to its literary production, take not of the regions multiple racial identifies, the histories of slavery, military conquest and various forms of migration to the area in different time and circumstances. For a study on folkloric forms in narratives by writers of African descent in the new world, it is certainly important to bear that complexity in mind. Although this work draws from African oral performance aesthetics in the examination of works by selected authors.</p> <p>The intersections between African folkloric practices and other cultural traditions that is present in these texts. It is fair to claim a black bias based on the preponderance of signals indicative of that heritage and on the strength of the claims made by the authors. This point is worth emphasizing, for in a region composed of indigenous people and descendants of people from Africa, Asia, and Europe it is tempting to view literary production through the prison of it’s most dominant number, the United States, which despite the growing visibility of its minority writers. For much of the Southern Hemisphere that has long come under the political and economic dominance of the North and Europe, the ramification of this dominance might be felt through the marginalization that occurs due to limited access to the world stage.</p> <p>In the context of such dominance, many despotic black writers have sought to assert their place in the New World’s cultural production through conscious engagement with and tribute to their continental African heritage, defined by oral verbal arts and folklore. It is not difficult to assess the reason behind the close association between folklore and New World written narrative tradition.</p> <p>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The particular purpose of this research topic is primarily to do a critical analysis on Wole Soyinka’s Death and the King’s Horseman (1975) bringing out the conflict over death in the play, And also Hope Eghagha’s Death not a Redeemer (1998). The Theme, genre, Rhythm, song, method language, and cartelization will be analyzed in both plays.</p> <p>The project work is intends to bring into focus folklore and the quest for re-invention and how the selected authors have been able to portray this in their various play.</p> <p>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This project work is limited to Wole Soyinka’s Death and the King’s Horseman (1975) and Hope Eghagha’s Death not a Redeemer (1998) brings out the folklore in both works and also establishing the re-invention that occurred in folklore.</p> <p>This work is going to critically look at the conflict over death in both plays and also move on to analyzing theme, Genre, language, method, characterization, song, Rhythm in both plays. Then the project gives a general conclusion of the entire work, how the project work will be beneficial to all.</p> <p>JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This project work looks at folklore because it has been long forgotten; bring a re-birth of folklore in a different way. Doing a merging of two different plays, a play that has been written since 1975 by Wole Soyinka and a very new play written in 1998. This two plays can not be compared, but they both deal with folklore, death and re-invention. That is why this project decided to use both authors, for the project work, because that is what is suitable for the topic.</p> <p>This research work specifically discusses the issue of conflict over death in Wole Soyinka’s Death and the king’s Horseman(1975) and Hope Eghagha’s Death not a Redeemer (1998), it will also deal with analyzing Rhythm, theme, Genre, language, cartelization, song in both plays.</p> <p>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</p> <p>This research work sets to examine folklore and the quest for re-invention in the selected work. To this extent, sociological method is adopted for the research. Sociological theory is centered on the attempt to understand the society. Sociological theory relies heavily on the scientific method, its objective, and does not presume to judge the society. Sociological theory has separated itself from the other ‘social sciences’ with its focus on society, a concept that goes beyond nation and includes organization and relationships. The proponents are Jurgen Habermars, Pierre Bourdieu, Anthony Giddens, Dorothy Smith, Alfred Schutz, Jeffrey Alexander and others.  </p> <p>Some of the key developments that influenced sociological theory were: the rise of individualization the appearance of the modern state, industrialization, and capitalism, colonization and globalization and the world wars. Sociological theory includes conflict theory, critical theory, Ethnomethodology, feminist theory, functionalism, interpretive sociology. But this research work will be looking at Ethnomethodology because it’s examines how people make sense out of social life in the process of living it. This aspect is chosen because it deals more with the project work.</p> <p>ORGANIZATION OF CHAPTERS</p> <p>The project work shall be divided into five chapters. Chapter one is the introduction to the topic. The chapter contains scope and limitation of the study, purpose of the study, justification of the study, research methodology and organization of the chapters. Chapter two is the literature review. While chapter three is the conflict over death in Wole Soyinka’s Death and the King’s Horseman (1975) and the conflict over death and the quest for reinvention in Hope Eghagha’s Death not a Redeemer(1998). Chapter four is the analysis of Death and the King’s Horseman (1975) and Hope Eghagha’s Death not a Redeemer(1998), while chapter five is the conclusion, findings and Recommendation.</p>\n\nFOLKLORE AND THE QUEST FOR RE-INVENTION A STUDY OF WOLE SOYINKA’S DEATH AND THE KING’S HORSEMAN AND HOPE EGHAGHA’S DEATH NOT A REDEEMER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FOLKLORE AND THE QUEST FOR RE-INVENTION A STUDY OF WOLE SOYINKA’S DEATH AND THE KING’S HORSEMAN AND HOPE EGHAGHA’S DEATH NOT A REDEEMER", "id": 83}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Genderism, an apt neologism for gender equilibrium in literary discourse and creativity is a sequel to feminism following the emergence of gender studies in the last quarter of the twentieth century.</p> <p>Since 1975 – declared by the United Nations as the international women’s year, there has been an uprising in the global ferment of female activism which through all fields of human endeavour, from the art of politics to the politics of arts.

Patriarchy – adjudged and described by feminists as the conscious minimization and subjugation of the women folks, deploying ideologies, cultural and metaphysic and ever religion of all kinds form western Christianity, Islamism, Buddhism and African traditionalism have spoken with one voice in favour of a male dominated world.</p> <p>Ever since, especially through the emergence of democracy, the struggle by women to negotiate their vice into mainstream of participation in cultural, economical social and vocational and even political aspect of the society has been a permanent feature in the world’s development.</p> <p>As such, feminine dislocation has become a discourse in our current past-colonial society. This arose out of the tension and challenges in the nineties that characterized feminist works in many parts of the world. It had its origin in experimental theatre groups and vari0ohjs women’s movements of the sixties and seventies and even through the eighties.</p> <p>These issues concerning women have generated arguments amongst the critics with shares minds to investigate as forte (1996:19) observed that “the structure of realism and narrative structures which a re implicated in religious to patriarchal ideology”</p> <p>PURPOSE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</p> <p>The burden of this research work is to take a cursory view of the theoretical and ideological propositions majority of the female gender in the contemporary Nigerian democratic society in order to establish the trend of female participation in the political and development processes of the society. The exemplification will be derived from the experiences and the responses of the Nigerian literary producers to gender imbalances in the society.</p> <p>We majorly make use of Tess Onuwenes’s Go tell it to Women (1991). In this play we see how cultural practices such as female marginalization, forced marriages, early marriages. Forced docility etc has been retrogressive to the feminine gender in Nigeria and that have also situated women as mere shadows of themselves in their immediate society.</p> <p>We also want to bring to light cultural practices in Nigeria that advocate’s docility, intelligence or only allowed to give supportive roles to men. Our pole Wright has created women in their individual capacity to speak in their own voice of their plights as women in the Nigerian society.</p> <p>This study therefore looks forward to trying to pose the already existing problems and prefer solutions to help re-evaluate these rights in the Nigerian society which are slow to progress.</p> <p>METHODOLOGY/RESEARCH APPROACH.</p> <p>Our methodology is the concept of feminism with emphasis on its Africa faction, “Womanism” which is a spectra of female empowerment and a typical African feminist approach.</p> <p>Feminism and womanism which are at once mutually inclusive and exclusive on a strangely paradoxical configuration while the former is Eurocentric and more radical in nature the latter is essentially afrocentic and more composing. For the African woman female empowerment is meant to be conscientiously pursued within the broad context of womanly dignity and social responsibility. Radical feminism on the other hand threatens to replace male hegemony with female domination which runs contrary to the African socio political experience.</p> <p>The primary material is the play in focus: Go tell it to women and relevant references from the texts by other written used will be examined briefly in the course of this research. Our secondary materials are sources from libraries, intent material and extensive consultations to othr critical writings.</p> <p>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF STUDY.</p> <p>The scope of this study with a view to admonish the excesses and maltreat melted out on women by the particular society in the post colonial Nigerian society. This study is extensively within the south west geopolitical zone (the movement setting in Go Tell it to women; Lagos) in this study we limit our research to only feminism as an ideology and woman as revealed in the African context with the literary work of a feminist; however occasional references may be made to other works made to other relevant works which centre on feminism to place the study in its proper perspective.</p> <p>Material sources are Tess Onuwene’s Go tell it women and other critical works that shed more light of feminism.</p> <p>In this chapter, we have been able to do certain important things like; 1) we have been able to introduce female empowerment as a source of female liberation in the Nigerian society. We also had a bit of insight on what an average Nigerian woman suffers in her immediate society. We have also been able to know the author of the play text that will be used as we proceed in this research work as Tess Onwueme who is a feminist .</p> <p>In all we have been able to understand the level of gender is course in our society and the plan to understand the efforts of fight backward also the responses of some literacy authors.</p> <p>The next chapter goes into works that are feminist oriented and also into the history of feminism.</p> <p>AUTHOR’S BACKGROUND.</p> <p>Osonye Tess Onuweme was born on September 8, 1955. she is a Nigerian playwright, scholar and a poet.</p> <p>She was born in present day Delta state to the family of chief Akaeke and Maria Eziash.

The trends in writings and discourses have been to observe the female sex at domestic background. The roles played by the women as mothers, sisters, custodian, home managers, family maintainers are enumerated through character portrayal in literature.  Also, female writers have gone beyond exposing the inequality among females and males in the society as they have started exposing the ills of society thereby correcting them. This essay using the sociologist framework examines the theories of social problems and gender disparity as treated in the novels of Ifeoma Okoye.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p> CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.1  General Introduction</p> <p>1.2  Purpose of the Study</p> <p>1.3  Justification</p> <p>1.4  Methodology</p> <p>1.5 Scope of the Study</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>2.1  Literature Review</p> <p> CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>3.1      Gender Ideology in <em>Behind the Clouds</em> (1982)</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>4.1      Ideology and Social Crises in <em>Men without Ears </em>(1984)</p> <p> CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p>5.1      Summary and Conclusion</p> <p>Bibliography                                                                                              </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.1     General Introduction</p> <p>Generally, literature is not developed in a vacuum. Literature is a simulacrum of reality and every work of art is a product of its social and cultural milieux. Consequently, every writer is a product of his/her socio-cultural and historical milieu. The African novel as a medium of literature is not an exception because the society remains the material that inspires writers. Every society has gone through one experience or the other; such experiences are what writers depict in their writings. The purpose of such depiction is either to appraise or criticize the trend. Mostly common in Literature is the depiction of the unpleasant realities of life. It is in this light that a discussion of the works by Ifeoma Okoye becomes relevant.</p> <p>The works of emergent writers have ceased to give attention to patriarchy as the only system that subjects women to oppression. Consequently, their works show a great deal of consciousness, serious concern and interest in their political, economic and social environments. Okoye’s state of social consciousness is depicted in her novel; <em>Men without Ears</em> (1984) as she identifies the ills in the society and thus makes an attempt to correct the perceived socio-economic and political imbalances. The most frustrating of these societal ills is the issue of money ritual making with human blood and flesh as exemplified in the novel. Also, women serving as subordinates to men in their private life of familial setting are common phenomenon in the African tradition. Abuse of the female gender (especially wives) has been in existence for centuries and it would continue to exist, if not curtailed by emergent actions of the female writers. The issue of childlessness in matrimonial homes has also captured the attention of female writers. Such writers see these structures and manipulations as constituting danger to both the female and male members of the society. As it is often witnessed, wife is always blamed for any discrepancy and her reaction to this could be detrimental to the sustenance of her matrimonial home.</p> <p>Definition(s) of Terms</p> <p>Ideology: According to oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary (Sally Wehmeier), “Ideology’’ is a seen as “a set of ideas that economic and political system is based on: Marxist and Capitalist ideology”. In another sense,</p> <p>“An ideology can be thought of  as a comprehensive vision, as a way of looking at things as it is in the common sense and several philosophical tendencies,  or a set of ideas proposed by the dominant class of a society to all members of the society” (a received consciousness or product of socialization.) (Wikipedia:2010).</p> <p>The main purpose behind an ideology is to offer change in a given society, and also to provide adherence to a set of ideas where conformity already exists. For instance, one of the social issues that have generated concern in Africa as an ideological concept is that of prevailing patriarchy in the African society and this needs to be changed. This is the reason Ifeoma Okoye like other feminists has made her stand known in a bid to correct the ugly situation. For academic exercise of this nature, there is a need to define patriarchy. According to the Merrian Webstar’s Online Dictionary, “Patriarchy” is defined as a</p> <p>“Social organization marked by the supremacy of the father in the clan or family, the legal dependence of wives and children, and the reckoning of descent and inheritance in the male; control of disproportionately larger share of power by men.</p> <p>Now, issues in gender ideology would be discussed.</p> <p>Gender: It is a sociological term that has more than one valid definition. In ordinary speech, it is used interchangeably with “sex” to denote condition of being a male or female. In the social sciences however, it refers specifically to socially constructed and institutionalized differences such as gender roles. However, the World Health Organization (WHO), for example, uses “gender” to refer to “the socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women” (Wikipedia:2010).</p> <p>Gender is a socio-cultural construction and ideological determination, a way of representing and defining “others” contingent on sexual differences. Gender is therefore, at the core of power relations and social representation in the society such that it becomes imperative in literary discourse. This differentiates gender from sex. (Wikipedia:2010). As Lizbeth Goodman et al (1996:vii) observe, “Gender refers to ways of seeing and representing people and situations based on sex differences while sex “is a biological category: female and male”. (Wikipedia:2010). This perspective is corroborated by Sara Mills (1989:242) who also sees gender as “a socially constructed masculine or feminine as opposed to the biologically determined difference of sex. Such contours of difference, to Homi Bhaibha (1995:32) are “agonistic” but also have two potentials of “shifting and splitting”.</p> <p>The major components of gender are masculinity and femininity. According to Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary (Sally Wehmeier), Masculinity is defined as “the quality of being masculine” while femininity is also defined as “the fact of being a woman; the qualities that are considered to be typical of women”. The feeling of belonging to a gender, masculine or feminine, has different meanings: First, a biological meaning that refers to primary and secondary sexual characteristics; Second, a sociological meaning that has to do with real and symbolic roles that society attributed to men and women, and finally, psychological meaning that consider the ensemble of traits belonging to either gender. This has to do with individual mind as they consider the differences between man and woman in any society with their minds. Ifeoma Okoye has presented the woman as being psychologically disturbed when they are attacked by childlessness and this makes them suffer the defeat of being the second to their husband. This is how Ije feels herself to Dozie in <em>Behind the Clouds</em> (1982).</p> <p>According to Lorber (1994:30), gender ideology is defined as “the justification of gender statuses, particularly, their differential evaluation. Kroska defines gender ideology as “the attitudes regarding the appropriate roles, rights, and responsibilities of women and men in society”. Gender ideology about the family, in the African society is seen for example, as men fulfill their family roles through instrumental, breadwinning activities and women fulfill their roles through nurturing, homemaking and parenting activities. It also refers to attitudes regarding the appropriate roles, rights, and responsibilities of men and women in the society. (Amy Kroska:2007).</p> <p>Gender ideology is a much debated and pressed subject in literature. Globally, the role of gender plays out as such that the male figure acts as the sole provider, while also conducting himself as the head of the household, making major decisions that are only allotted to the paternal figure while female figure acts as maintainer of the household. The domestic responsibilities constitute ideology in the sense that it is the expectation of the African society that females should be responsible for domestic work as ideology itself is a set of ideas that constitute someone’s goals, expectations and actions.</p> <p>The roles of female in African society are not the same if compared with that of male. This ideology has been the major dominants in the works of early African writers. For instance, in <em>Things Fall Apart</em> (1986), Chinua Achebe made this remark:</p> <p>You have not eaten for two days, said his daughter Ezinma when she brought the food to him. ‘So you must finish this.’ She sat down and stretched her legs in front of her. Okonkwo ate the food absentmindedly. ‘She should have been a boy, he thought as he looked at his ten-year-old daughter.</p> <p>For the fact that that Okonkwo appreciates Ezinma’s concern for his well being yet he still considers the fact that she is a female who is only in charge of domestic work while Nwoye, his son is not portrayed in the novel, as having anything to do with domestic works.</p> <p>The universal roles of men and women usually remain constant, however, as time progressed and changed, so did gender ideology among genres of literature. Gradually, as the colonial period diminished, women began to have a voice as characters and as authors. Though not very popular in American literature, the struggles, hardships and concerns of women began to show up. Nathaniel Hawthorne, a renowned Romantic author, generally used male characters to execute his ideal on “human nature about sin and guilt, and about the peoples of the intellect and the pleasures of the heart” (Hawthorne:682).</p> <p>Presently in Africa, the realities of issues that affect the gender are being promoted by many authors in order to mobilize and sensitize females against the existing coded cultural dictates and policies that hinder the welfare of female. Measures that relegate the female to the background on a second class cadre are now being discussed and strategies for protecting female rights and their fair treatment at all level of existence, (social, domestic, national, economic and political affairs) are now being articulated and accentuated as contributory seeds of change for gender inequality. This has gone a long way among the elites and educated ones in Nigeria but yielded low result among the vast majority of people especially, the illiterates.</p> <p>Feminism</p> <p>Feminism is a form of criticism which is the struggle for women emancipation. “Feminism is a worldwide ideological and political movement directed at changing the existing power relations between men and women in a patriarchal society” (Joseph, 2003:161). Men in such society hide under the guise of male supremacy to subjugate women. Feminism can also be defined as ideology of social commitment to the struggle for female liberation in the society. It started with women movements in the 1960 in Nigeria with exhibitions to depict the skills of women in various disciplines. The examples of women movements are Women Liberation Movements in Nigeria and Black feminism, lesbianism in America around 1970.</p> <p>History of Feminism</p> <p>Feminism started with the idea that human rights should be given to women. This idea was put forward by some politically committed activists in the 18th and 19th centuries such as Mary Wollstonecraft and John Stuart Mill. Later, feminists in the early 20th century also claimed that women should be allowed to vote and there were many protests. These women were called suffragettes. This is because they were fighting for universal suffrage which means everybody is eligible to vote. The suffragettes staged many protests for their rights. Some women even committed suicide to show how wrong it was that they could not take part in politics. After women received the vote, feminism worked to make all societies more equal for women.</p> <p>Many nineteenth-century American feminists like Elizabeth Cady Starton and Susan B. Anthony, were the first activists in the struggle for the abolition of slavery. In the eighteenth century, there were the women’s organizations that organized exhibitions to portray the skills of women in the various industries, arts, professions etc. An example of various exhibitions is the first World Colombia Exhibition in Chicago in May 1983. It was headed by Bertha K. Palmer. The exhibition advocated for the new women who have the ability to contest with the man in all ramifications of life. Many more organizations sprang up after the successful outing in Chicago.</p> <p>However, the emergence of organizations (women) brought an end to the first wave of feminism, which centered on debates about material, women’s individual and collective socio-political interests and self determinations. Later, feminism moved from mere organizations and was introduced into writings and readings by female artists in the early 19th century. The early feminine writers agitated for the rights of women to man’s homage, respect and gratitude for her services to him and demand that fidelity in marriage should be considered to be as important for the husband and the wife.</p> <p>Social Crises/Social Problems</p> <p>According to oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, the word ‘social’ in this context is described as “connected with society and how it is organized” for instance, we have social problems, issues and reforms. Also, the same dictionary defines ‘crises’ as “a time of great danger, difficulty or confusion when problems must be solved or important decision must be made”. It can also be said to be a time when a problem, a bad situation or an illness is at its worst point. In view of the above, social crises are the crises that have to do with society and how that society is organized and this can be linked with social problems.</p> <p>According to Frank R, (1980:1), he observes that “social problems are those conditions that have a negative impact on individual and social well being, as identified by sociological analysis of the organization and functioning of the society”.  He also defines social problems as “conditions that decision makers view as undesirable and decide can be ameliorated by social actions”. In Nigeria, excessive urge for material things which has made many people to be corrupt, sexual harassment, hooliganism and racial discrimination are some of the social problems we are facing.</p> <p>1.2     Purpose of the Study</p> <p>Drawing from Ifeoma Okoye’s <em>Behind the Clouds</em> (1982) and <em>Men without Ears</em> (1984), the main purpose of this study will be to examine the cause of social problem in the society, gender disparity as well as manifestations of feminism in modern African literature. This becomes pertinent because there is problem of this disparity especially as it affects matrimonial home and the society at large. This study will also consider the effects of social crises on the society at large and as well, proffer solutions on how to redeem the image of women from the abyss of despair.</p> <p>1.3     Justification</p> <p>So many people have written on gender related issues, but our choice of Ifeoma Okoye’s <em>Behind the Clouds</em> (1982) and <em>Men Without Ears</em> (1984) is informed by the fact that the works focus on gender issues with special attention on moral decadence. These novels are chosen because they are typical examples of the concept of African Feminism among different Nigerian societies.</p> <p>With the publication of <em>Behind the Clouds</em> (1982), Okoye has since published several other short stories in order to register her name in Africa and indeed global literacy circles. However, she has received relatively little critical attention. This is not because her works are socially irrelevant but probably because critics are still largely fascinated with writers that they consider to be popular. But two years later when she published <em>Men without Ears</em> 1984, things changed for better as the novel earned her the 1st Association of Nigerian Authors literacy prize for the best novel of that year.</p> <p>1.4     Methodology</p> <p>This work will make use of Feminist–Marxist method. Since the novels show the experiences of males and females in the African society, hence, there is the need to use the chosen approaches. Marxism theory was propounded by a German, Karl Henrick Marx. It sees literary texts as product of an ideology and social class. Thereafter, a literary work is examined from a socio-economic perspective. Thus, a Marxist critic is concerned with the cultural, economic and political values that a text promotes. While Feminist criticism is a movement to interpret or re-interpret women’s experience as depicted in literature. Hence, a feminist reading of a text asks important questions about the roles of women.</p> <p>1.5     Scope of the Study</p> <p>In order to get our line of thought straight vis-à-vis our concern and pre-occupation in this work, there is the need for us to state in clear terms, where our work will begin and where it will end. Going by the title of our study, we will examine the issue of gender ideology, social crises on the one hand and the manifestation of feminism as raised and presented by Ifeoma Okoye on the other hand. For this to be done, we will make an attempt to examine the words gender ideology, social crises and later, we will embark on examination of the concept of feminism as well as its relevance to literature.</p> <p>Therefore, our analysis, even though is mainly restricted to Ifeoma Okoye’s chosen novels; it will include cursory references to other critical and artistic endeavours that are relevant to our study. On social crises and gender ideology, our study will concentrate on social system like family unit, government establishments etc. It is from this major system that we will x-ray the manifestations of feminism in literature and at the end we will suggest the solutions and as well, we would give comments on the problems identified.</p>\n\nGENDER IDEOLOGY AND SOCIAL CRISES IN IFEOMA OKOYE’S BEHIND THE CLOUDS AND MEN WITHOUT EARS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " GENDER IDEOLOGY AND SOCIAL CRISES IN IFEOMA OKOYE’S BEHIND THE CLOUDS AND MEN WITHOUT EARS", "id": 85}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>As a result of social vices in our immediate environments this research work aims at bringing out how contemporary writers have reacted to the bad happening in the society, especially using Denja Abdullahi’s Mairogo and Jide Balogun’s The Desert in the river using sociological theory to investigate social vice that were present in the two texts and it is discovered that poetry is used as a means of achieving an egalitarian society.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1    Introduction</p> <p>1.2    Purpose of the study</p> <p>1.3    Significance of the study</p> <p>1.4    Scope and Limitation of the study</p> <p>1.5    Research methodology</p> <p>1.6    Chapterization</p> <p> CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>LITERATURE REVIEW</p> <p>2.0    Introduction</p> <p>2.1    Sociological theory introduction</p> <p>2.2    Relevance of sociological theory of literature</p> <p>2.3    Importance of sociological theory</p> <p>2.4   sociological theorist</p> <p>2.5    Social forces I n the development of sociological theory</p> <p>2.6    Intellectual forces and the rise of sociological theory</p> <p>2.7    The contemporary relevance of sociological theory</p> <p>2.8    Relevance of sociological theory to the research work</p> <p>2.9    Conclusion</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>3.0    Introduction</p> <p>3.1    Themes of social vice in Jide Balogun’s the desert in the River</p> <p>3.2    Themes of social vice in Denja Abdullahi’s Mairogo</p> <p>3.3    Literary techniques employed</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>4.0    Introduction</p> <p>4.1    Summary</p> <p>4.2    Findings</p> <p>4.3    Conclusion</p> <p>BIOGRAPHY</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Nigerian poetry is the poetry of the Nigerian people that is written in order to show the experiences of the people, their culture, socio – economic and political status.</p> <p>Poetry is a work of art that deals with style like other genres of literature which can be used to expose the societal vices or ills done by man. Vices such as socio – economic, political and cultural vices among others.</p> <p>As a result of societal decadence,  writers or poets use their literacy works as interventional tools to effect a change in the society. Earlier poets like Wole Soyinka, Niyi Osundare, Odia Ofeimu, Ezenwa Ohaeto, Funso Aiyejina, Ikekwu Ogine, Femi Osofisan among others are in this category. Many critical works and many articles in journals Newspaper Magazines, etc have been written by them so as to expose various forms of vices.</p> <p>In an interview by Jane Wilkinson (1985)</p> <p><em>          Soyinka says</em></p> <p>The only problem we all face is one which besets not only writers but citizens in Nigeria. The problems of our unbelievable and unacceptable socio – political situations, which get and more reactionary and in human with every succeeding regime.</p> <p>For this reason, Soyinka (1985:68) sees the social economic and political situations of Nigeria as frustrating.</p> <p>Examples of literary essays and literary works that have been written by some Nigerian scholars include, Chinua Achebe’s essay, The Trouble Nigeria, (1993), and also Odia Ofeimu in his poetry titled The Poet Lied, (1980), Tanure Ojaide’s Fate of Vulture (1997) and Invoking the Warrior Spirit (1998), also Niyi Osundare’s Village Voices (1984) and The Eye of the Earth, (1986) among others. All these works reflect the social vices that are rampant in the society.</p> <p>In the Fate of Vulture: Poems like “the music of Pain” is addressed to the issue of social and political status of the society, in the form of protest and agitation for justice. Also, the poem identified as the “chorus of resistant cries” depicts lament song used as a bid against corruption and also, it shows the dauntless spirit of the people’s voice and will, including the poet. As illustrated of the victories against overloads.</p> <p>… I wanted communion to shame</p> <p>Chief of selfish role.</p> <p>… drawing into its veins</p> <p>The strength of millions,</p> <p>It took the course of the country</p> <p>Into its expanding heart</p> <p>… listen to my song</p> <p>The music of communion pain (p.2)</p> <p>In addition, the poem “Compatriots” shows the political disappointment, mockery of the national integrity, nonchalant attitude of the custodians of power, moral and social dereliction among others. Some lines from the poem include:</p> <p>As soon as they had their hold on the land,</p> <p>They upset the customs of the truth</p> <p>Now they have blunted the sacred sword</p> <p>How will justice be executed (p.13)</p> <p>Moreover, in the village voices poem like “Eating with all the fingers” establishes the greediness spirit in the life of people in the society especially the politicians who care not for the others in the society, but they want every thing to becomes their own personal properties. It says</p> <p>The affairs of this life</p> <p>are like people eating</p> <p>some dip ten fingers</p> <p>and close their throats</p> <p>their greed chokes the land</p> <p>with sprawling dirt. (p.15)</p> <p>In addition, the poem “The land of Unease” shows moral and social decadence in the life’s of the people. It also shows the attitude of the leaders toward the economy of the country, as the one which does not improve it but to destroy the one which does not improve it but to destroy the economy. As illustrated</p> <p>Men forge unequal knives</p> <p>A few slashing the yam</p> <p>With machete greedier</p> <p>Than Esimuda’s sword</p> <p>leaving mere peelings</p> <p>This research work is aimed at showing how contemporary Nigeria poets use their poetry to expose the social, economic, cultural, religious and political vices in Nigeria so that adequate changes can be made.</p> <p>This research work shall consider Denja Abdullahi’s volume of poetry Mairogo and Jide Balogun collection of poems, The Desert in the River and materials to be used in discussing and analyzing the images of social vices in contemporary Nigerian poetry.</p> <p>1.2 PURPOSE OF STUDY</p> <p>The purpose of this research work is to show themes and cultural influences in the poetry of Denja Abdullahi and Jide Balogun. Furthermore, this research work will place emphasis on the socio – political, economic, religious and cultural subjects in the poetry of Denja Abdullahi and Jide Balogun and their struggle for positive change.</p> <p>1.3  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>To the best knowledge of the researcher, no research has been carried out in this area using Abdullahi’s Mairogo and Jide Balogun’s The Desert in the River. Therefore, the researcher is studying these texts using sociological theory to discover how these texts have depicted socio realities. The research work is going to be of benefit to both literary and non – literary students. Students at the secondary level can also benefit from it.</p> <p>It is also a contribution to the body of knowledge in the area of sociological theory in relation to literary texts.</p> <p>1.4 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF STUDY</p> <p>This research work will focus on the themes of social vices in the poetry of the two poets.

doing only that which their husbands want them to do or approves of.  They must be very obedient and submissive; they must obey their husbands at all times and never refuse them anything even if it is not really convenient for the wives.</p> <p>“Therefore, as the Church is subject unto Christ, so let wives be to their    own husband in everything”</p> <p>The result is that women were put behind men as their submissive helper (servant).</p> <p>Feminism is referred to as the belief that women should have economic, political and social equality with men.  Feminism is also referred to as a movement that works to gain such equality which movement is sometimes called the women’s liberation movement or women’s rights movement.</p> <p>In view of this, this research will focus on the effort of women writers to make this movement a reality in Africa.</p> <p>Women need to arise to stop what they do not want, and in particular to oppose whatever seeks to deny or deprive them of their rights.</p> <p>1.2   PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The purpose of this research is to examine how Buchi Emecheta and Ifeoma Okoye two African feminist writers used their female characters in the novels to portray and depict how women were able to endure the struggles and challenges imposed upon them in the male domineering society and how they came out of it, and were able to challenge women to stop allowing themselves to be treated anyhow by men.</p> <p>1.3   SCOPE AND LIMITATION</p> <p>This research will only be limited to the struggle for survival by the female character in the works of Buchi Emecheta’s <em>Second Class Citizen </em>and Ifeoma Okoye’s<em> Behind the Clouds.</em></p> <p>1.4   JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This study is embarked upon because though it is believed that women are now being given a fair hearing in the society.  Feminism is yet to be embraced as an equal work on the Nigeria Literary Scene.</p> <p>In reaction, a critical study will be carried out on the two fore mentioned texts bringing out the feminist features as observed in the text and to make women see the light of their freedom.</p> <p>1.5   METHODOLOGY</p> <p>The major source for the material in the writing of this project work will be restricted to the library and the internet due to the inability of conducting a private interview with the novelists.</p> <p>1.6   AIM AND OBJECTIVE</p> <p>Looking at all this, this research will focus on the effort of women writers to make this movement workable in Africa.</p> <p>We shall take a look at Buchi Emecheta’s contribution in her Novel <em>Second Class Citizen</em> and how she has achieved her goals.  Also Ifeoma Okeye’s <em>Behind the Cloud</em> will also be treated with focus on how she achieved her own feminist goals.</p> <p>1.7   BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES ON BUCHI EMECHETA</p> <p>Buchi Emecheta was born in Lagos, Nigeria.  She was born of Ibuza heritage.  She is a Nigerian writer with a B.Sc degree.  She attended Methodist Girls High School, Yaba Lagos in Nigeria and University of London U. K.  She was appointed Senior Research Fellow, Department of English and Literary Studies, University of Calabar, Calabar Nigeria in 1980.</p> <p>A member of Art Council of Great Britain, member of Advisory Council, Home Secretary on Race and Equity, London, U.K.  Her awards include Best black writer in Britain, 1978:  Jock Campbell awards, 1979, Daughter of Mark Twain, an American literature award.</p> <p>She has many publications to her credit, they include the following:-  <em>In the Ditch</em> published in 1972, <em>Second Class Citizen</em>(1974), <em>The Slave Girls</em> (1976), <em>the Joys of Motherhood</em> (1979), <em>Destination Biafra</em> (1982) her auto biography, <em>Head above Water</em> (1986) and many others.</p> <p>She is a mother of five children.  She is a sociology graduate of London University.</p> <p>1.8   BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON IFEOMA OKOYE</p> <p>Ifeoma Okoye</p> <p>Ifeoma Okoye started her writing career when she discovered herself to have the potentials for writing.  She also discovered that children did not have adequate books on children especially stories on Nigeria children, so she was surprised to write some children’s books which are <em>The Adventures of Tolu</em>, <em>The Little Monkey, Eze goes to School, No School for Eze, Village Boy, Only Breed to Eze</em> all of which were published in 1980.</p> <p>Her first adult novel was <em>men without ears</em> she said she considered herself lucky to have got a publisher for the book which was published in 1984.  Her second Novel <em>Behind the Clouds </em>was published in 1988.  Her novel <em>Men without Ears </em>won the 1984 prize for the Association of Nigerian Authors best fiction of year.</p> <p>She is happily married to famous husband, Mokwogo Okoye whom she respects and cherishes so much.  They have a son and four daughters.</p> <p>1.9   END NOTE</p> <p>(1)     Emecheta Buchi (1977) <em>Second Class Citizen, </em>London; Fontana / Collins.</p> <p>(2)     Okoye Ifeoma (1983) <em>Behind the Clouds</em>  London:  Longman.</p> <p>(3)     The Macmillan Dictionary of Women’s Biography (1982:  190) London:            Macmillan Press Ltd., Second Edition.</p> <p>(4)     The World Book Encyclopedia Volume (1990)  U.

Language is only possible because within each society, people agree to understand a particular pattern of sound in a particular way. For instance, all English speaking countries understand the meaning of the word ‘water’. According to Akindele and Adegbije, language is:</p> <p><em>A human phenomenon that has form which can be described in terms of units of sound (phonemes), word, morphemes, phrases, sentences and paragraphs or discourse (1).</em></p> <p>This definition shows that language has often been identified as the most unique attribute of man. It is through language that human beings grasp and understand reality and transmit it from one generation to another. This view is buttressed by Blakar who asserts that “we actually live and behave in a world of language” (4). Victoria Fromkin and Robert Rodman quoted Noam Chomoky as saying that:</p> <p><em>When we study human language, we are approaching what some might call the human essence. The distributive qualities of mind that are so far as we know unique to man. (1).</em></p> <p>Language, which Oyewo Yinka describe as “the medium or vehicle for conveying ideas, a system of arbitrary vocal symbol based on social cooperation; the totality of meaningful utterance in any given society” (15) is by far the most important means of human communication.</p> <p>The effects of Nigerian Pidgin English on students is the focus of this research work. Pidgin has their different histories about language contact and subsequent borrowing and code-mixing. The origin of Nigerian pidgin can be traced to the contact which was established between multilingual coastal communities and Portuguese merchants, who were joined later by the Dutch and the English. Nigerian Pidgin English is in fact becoming very popular in the country, especially in the secondary schools and in the universities; even at public function as well as in the offices. It is a lingua franca for social integration among diverse ethnic groups in the country.</p> <p>Nigerian Pidgin English has developed to the extent that it is utilized for literary communication. Some of the works which Nigerian pidgin is employed as a medium of expression are “Dis Nigeria Sef” a poem written by Ken Saro-Wiwa, <em>No Food No Country</em> a play by Tunde Fatunde, and <em>Grip Am</em> a play by Ola Rotimi; though some people consider it to be a low social status. Nigerian Pidgin has come to stay as the major lingua franca adopted for communication among the many different speakers in Nigeria. According to Jowitt:</p> <p><em>The situation today is that pidgin flourishes as a medium of inter-ethnic communication, especially in the south, and especially in the large cities with many non-indigenous residents (Bendel, Benin, Port Harcourt, etc) or throughout States with small many ethnic groups…(13)</em></p> <p>Nigerian Pidgin in this case is a situation where normal language pattern is altered, but generally accepted to convey meaning. The language does not only evolve but also has its origin from a mixture of other languages. Experiences have shown that among the students for which this work was conceived, Nigerian Pidgin English has gained a wider audience in all sectors of the economy, especially the educational sector.</p> <p>Background to The Study:</p> <p>The term pidgin is used to refer to a language which develops in a situation where speakers of different languages have a need to communicate but do not share a common language. Once a pidgin has emerged, it is generally learned as a second language and used for communication among people who speak differently.</p> <p>Language is the most creative and unlimited instrument for social communication and it helps us to understand the deep seated social relevance, culture involvement and the human relatedness of language. Having said this, we can therefore agree that pidgin is a language of its own and not just a supplementary tongue as some people see it, since it serves as an unlimited instrument of social communication especially in a multilingual community as Caritas University.</p> <p>According to R. Linton he states that “the culture of a society is the way of life of its members, the collection of ideas and habits which they learn, share and transmit from generation to generation” (12). These cultures, ideas and habits can only be transmitted from generation to generation through language. In linguistic, every language is considered adequate to represent the communicative needs of its people and as such should not be made to suffer any biases.</p> <p>This cannot be said of Nigerian Pidgin – even though it is a language – because various attempts have been made by different faction to eradicate the use of Nigerian Pidgin English. These attempts have however been unsuccessful because of the significant value the language has to its users. It is a language that has brought people together in spite of their differences in ancestral culture and language by creating a local culture for itself which blends ideas from different cultures.</p> <p>Statement of Research Problem:</p> <p>Nigerian Pidgin is a language just as English and there is enough room for both language to co-exist and be mutually enriching. Despite this – and the fact that Nigerian Pidgin English appears to be the most popular means of communication among diverse groups and is easier to learn than any other language in the country today – it is generally asserted that it is not the suitable language for use in formal setting and its use in such setting is usually frowned at.</p> <p>This research work will explore the potentials of Nigerian Pidgin English as a language. If Nigerian Pidgin English does have this potential, why is its usage and status denigrated? Also, does the speaking of Nigerian Pidgin affect the student’s academic performance? Answers to these questions will enable us make useful recommendations for future studies.</p> <p>Purpose of the Study:</p> <p>This work intends to look into the effectiveness and status of Nigerian Pidgin English. It is inherent that for a long period of time that Nigerian Pidgin English has been the means of communication among students in the higher institutions. This research will bring into light if the use of Nigeria Pidgin English has any effect on the students and their academic performance in Caritas University. The finding will be regarded to be generic, affecting also students in other institutions who equally exalt Nigerian Pidgin English above standard English.</p> <p>Significance of the Study:</p> <p>This study is important because its results can go a long way to finding out the causes of students’ negative or positive academic performance. If Nigerian Pidgin English has contributed negatively or positively to the students.</p> <p>This work will in no doubt contribute to one’s knowledge especially in the department of English, Caritas University, Enugu as it will highlight some issues in educational planning. It will be a guide for the federal government in planning for effective educational system.</p> <p>Scope and Limitations:</p> <p>The scope of this project is on the effects of Nigerian Pidgin English in university community. An assessment of its use in various forms will be carried out. This research is limited to Caritas University, Enugu even though the findings might be generic.</p> <p>Research Methodology:</p> <p>Questionnaires were distributed to hundred (100) students in Caritas University, Enugu State which is my case study and these questionnaires were filled and collected and the hundred questionnaires were returned.</p> <p>The result/total of responses from the respondents is tabled in the yes/no format. The collection of data was done in two parts. The secondary and primary source. The primary source is the questionnaire; the secondary source includes textbooks, journals and so on. The materials were researched upon in libraries: Benue State University and Caritas University libraries.</p> <p>The total number of hundred (100) questionnaires were distributed and the percentage system is the method used in calculating the different responses.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF NIGERIAN PIDGIN ENGLISH IN UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECTS OF NIGERIAN PIDGIN ENGLISH IN UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY", "id": 88}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The thrust of this study is a sociolinguistic analysis of the gender on language use. The method of investigation used for this study is questionnaire and audio-recoding. This study has established the fact that the differences between male and female in ways of interacting often leads to wrong notions, meanings and interpretations given to certain statements and gestures. It was also discovered that the differences between male female in the aspects of turn taking, use of minimal responses, use of questions, shift between topics, loud and aggressive arguments, often result in miscommunication and misinterpretation and when this happens, it leads to breakdown in communication.</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>People have always known that gender and language use are connected. Women and men however, do not use completely different forms but different quantities or frequencies of form. Though both sexes use particular form, one sex shows greater preference for them than the other. Research shows that women tend to use more of standard forms than men do, while men use more of the vernacular forms than women do. Gender itself is an influential factor accounting for different speech patterns among men and women. Therefore, the major pre-occupation of this study is to examine the differences in the use of language between men and women and the influence of gender on the use of language. This study is aimed at bringing to limelight such factors that are responsible for differences in the use of language between men and women and by implication how gender interfere with language use.seeks to examine the differentiation between male and female use of language and how gender consideration influences speech patterns. This has to do with how gender influence interaction among sexes. To achieve this, data will be collected from 400 level students; forty (40) students (20 males and 20 females) were selected at random for this study from the Department of English and Literary Studies. 400 level students who I relate with daily are selected because it will be easier to collected data for this study. Participants will be interviewed and questionnaire issued out and data will be collected, discussed and analysed explicitly.</p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>When we tell people about ourselves or our circumstances, or ask for information about others and their circumstances, we are using language in order to exchange facts or opinions. This use of language is   often called ‘referential’, ‘propositional’ or ‘ideational’. Language is used by human beings in social context, communicating their need, ideas, and emotions to one another (Labov, 1981:83). Human language according to Sapir (1921) ‘is a purely human and non-instinctive method of communicating ideas, emotions and desires by means of a system of voluntarily produced symbols’. Language as Sapir rightly said is human. Only humans’ posses language and all normal human beings uniformly possess it. Animals also have a communication system but it is not a developed system. That is why language is said to be species specific and species -uniform.</p> <p>Language gives shape to people’s thought; it guides and controls their entire activities. It is a carrier of civilization and culture as human  thoughts and philosophy are conveyed from one generation to the other through the medium of language (Syal and Jindal, 2001:5). Ultimately, attitudes to language reflects attitude to the users and uses of the language. People generally do not hold opinions about language in a vacuum. They develop attitudes towards languages which reflects their view about those who speak the language, and contexts and functions with which they are associated (Holmes, 1996:344).</p>\n\nA SOCIOLINGUISTIC ANALYSIS OF THE INFLUENCE OF GENDER ON THE LANGUAGE USE OF 400 LEVEL STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A SOCIOLINGUISTIC ANALYSIS OF THE INFLUENCE OF GENDER ON THE LANGUAGE USE OF 400 LEVEL STUDENTS", "id": 89}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research was to do an in-depth study of the variations in language as used by the various novelists in the novels selected for this study. The objectives of the study were to investigate the divergent ways in which these writers have creatively used English to perform the functional role of communication in a non-native environment, show the extent to which their various choices succeed in the supposed semantic function, show how systemic text linguistic approach is a departure from other stylistic approaches and to show how the features of these “Englishes” contribute to the development of the concept of global English. The novels studied are Chukwuemeka Ike’s Our Children Are Coming, Festus Iyayi’s The Contract and Abubakar Gimba’s Witnesses to Tears. The study is a text linguistic one based on the Systemic Functional model. The two text linguistic concepts of “projection” and “procedure” were used in the selection of data from the chosen texts for analysis. The data gathered were analyzed according to the three meta-levels of Primitive, Second order and Prime order developed from the three levels of thesis, immediate situation and wider situation in text linguistics. The study revealed that all the three novels studied project a central message each. This is contrary to the age long belief and tradition of multiple messages in a second order text. The study also revealed that each author projects the message of his text using the three aforementioned levels of meaning. However, each author uses these levels in a manner that is peculiarly functional. The study as well revealed that the messages projected by the novels are interrelated, as they all bring human nature under scrutiny based on the philosophical and linguistic idiosyncrasies of these authors.</p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>This work is divided into five chapters. The first chapter is the introductory chapter which discusses the background of the research, the problem that the research is intended to solve, the aim and the objectives of the research, the questions that are to be answered in the course of this research, justification of the research as well as the scope and delimitation of the research.</p> <p>The second chapter contains a review of essential literature relevant to the topic of this research in order to show the extent of data in existence in this area of study with a view to showing the contribution of this research to knowledge. The third chapter is devoted to a discussion of the methodology of this research. It gives a comprehensive explanation on the way features of language are gathered for analysis and the analytical procedure used for the study of the selected texts. The fourth chapter discusses analytically the various linguistic features identified as worthy of discussion in this research based on the approach stated in the third chapter. Chapter five contains a summary of the entire study, conclusions drawn from the research.</p> <p><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>For several decades now in Nigeria, there have been in existence a number of divergent views on the kind of English used by Nigerian writers of fiction. Scholars such as Adetugbo (1971), Afolayan (1980), Bamgbose (1995) and several others have expressed views on this subject matter. In summary, these writers have identified two groups of writers of fiction in Nigeria. The first group, they remark, uses indigenous English, while the second group has a flawless command of English, but continues to adapt it to suit their peculiar environment for the purpose of effective performance (Jibrin 2005).</p> <p>However, there is no doubt that there is often a problem generally associated with mastering a foreign language as well as using a foreign language to express local sensibilities. The reason is that, a second language learner always acquires his first language before his second language. The system of this first language often interferes with his learning of a second language. Then the foreign language does not have ready mechanism with which to express other people’s culture. As Nigerian writers try to master English in order to be able to adapt it to carry the weight of their native experience, their various mother tongues keep interfering. This is often the case of bilinguals who have to make creative efforts in a foreign language. There are two popular but sharply contrasting positions in Nigeria as far as the use of English in fiction is concerned. The first group was championed by late Obi Wali who barely three years after Nigeria’s independence, predicted a dead end for all African literature written in English:</p> <p>The whole uncritical acceptance of English and French as the inevitable media of educated African writing is misdirected and has no chance of advancing African literature… this would be pursuing a dead end which can only lead to sterility, uncreativity and frustration (Wali1963:14).</p>\n\nA SYSTEMIC TEXT LINGUISTIC STUDY OF SELECTED NIGERIAN NOVELS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A SYSTEMIC TEXT LINGUISTIC STUDY OF SELECTED NIGERIAN NOVELS", "id": 90}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>“Fact” is something actual as opposed to invented; something which is real. It is also information about a particular subject, especially actual condition and/or circumstances. It is a piece of information about circumstances that exist or events that have occurred.</p> <p>“Fiction” on the other hand is a literary work based on imagination and not necessarily on fact. It is a literary type using invented or imaginative writing instead of real facts, usually written as prose. Fictional writers invent their stories and use imaginary characters in their works of fiction. In support of this, M.H. Abram posits that:</p> <p>Fiction is any literary narrative, whether in prose or verse which is invented instead of being an account of events that actually happened. In a narrower sense however, fiction denotes only narrative that are written in prose (the novel and short stories), and sometimes is used simply as a synonym for the novel. Literary prose narratives in which the fiction is to a prominent degree based on biographical, historical, or contemporary facts are often referred to by compound names such as “fictional biography”, the historical novel, and the non-fiction novel.

It investigated certain linguistic features in the speeches that were employed to appeal to the sense of emotion of the listeners, to ethics (speaker’s credibility) and logic alongside the use of unethical or illogical appeals to persuade the listeners. The three variables of ethos, pathos and logos of the aristotelean model of rhetoric were used to analyse 75 sentences (37 and 38 sentences respectively) which were selected from the inaugural speeches of two democratically elected presidents (Goodluck Jonathan of 2011 and Mohammed Buhari of 2015). In carrying out the research, the text of the speeches served as the data and sentences that reflected the appeals and fallacies were selected. The research found that the linguistic features of inaugurals are consciously formed to persuade the listeners. Political leaders employ these lexical choices to thank and acknowledge, express their will, aims and objectives, show their capacity to lead and rebuild, show they understand the problems and promise a better future. In trying to persuade the listeners, they commit some fallacies which may be persuasive but illogical or unethical. Of the three rhetorical appeals, the emotional appeal was the most employed in persuasion.</p> <p><strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The study of language is captivating due to the role it plays in capturing all aspects of human thoughts and endeavours. Language playsso many roles in our society among which is the forming of social psychology with regard to how attitudes and perceptions are expressed (Yule, 254). Adedimeji also adds that, ‘language mainly serves to form (or deform), inform, reform and transform man and his society’ (6). Boltz and Seyler (n. pag.) argue that words are the tools for saying what you want to say and what you want to say are your thoughts, feelings, dislikes, hopes, fears, business, pleasure, everything that makes you up. Whether in politics, media, administration, teaching and even daily conversations, we use language to achieve the aforementioned goals.</p>\n\nLANGUAGE OF PERSUASION: AN ANALYSIS OF THE INAUGURAL SPEECHES OF PRESIDENTS JONATHAN AND BUHARI<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " LANGUAGE OF PERSUASION: AN ANALYSIS OF THE INAUGURAL SPEECHES OF PRESIDENTS JONATHAN AND BUHARI", "id": 92}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study is concerned with an appraisal of Race, Identity and Perspectives of African American Women in the Selected Works of Toni Morrison and Rita Dove about the African American community, within the context of the United States of America. Over the years African American women writing has not been accorded due relevance within the American literary space. As such, black male writers have dominated the literary scene for long, being literarily the spoke persons on the specific and general dimensions of black people‟s existence and experience in America. This position is now being contested by black women writers such as Toni Morrison and Rita Dove. In other words, the claim of a homogenous black experience is now being debated and challenged by these African American women writers through different literary platforms. Thus, these black women writers foreground women characters who are now subjects of their own narrations. This research apprehends the various views of African American women about themselves, about the African American community and how their perspectives have contributed significantly to shaping the concerns bordering on history, existence, experience and the community of black people in America via different literary platforms. Significantly therefore, this research employs various genres of literature, specifically the novelistic art form and the poetic genre, as parameters for the exploration of the complex dynamics of African American community in America. To this extent, the study contends that the poetic genre of literature is also a distinctive genre that similarly apprehends the African American reality and should be emphasized alongside the novel form which has gained popular acceptance in the literary circle. This thesis employs the postcolonial praxis as a rewarding paradigm for investigating the works of Morrison and Dove, especially as it facilitates the foregrounding of such critical parameters as hegemony, hybridity, mimicry, conflict, power dynamics, identity, gender to name a few and how these concerns are implicated in the existence and experience of black people in America. This research work is presented in six chapters. Chapter one is the introduction, which provides a background on the conceptual framework of the research. It comments on the origin and development of African American writing as well as the emergence of African American women writing. Chapter two delineates the dynamics of slavery in Morrison‟s A Mercy. Chapter three locates the place and position of African American identity in Morrison‟s Paradise. Chapter four interrogates the concept of race in the globalized American society in Rita Dove‟s American Smooth. Chapter five appraises the dilemma of mothering in Dove‟s Mother Love. Chapter six, the concluding chapter brings to bear the central arguments and findings of the study and its contributions to knowledge in the field.</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>African American literature acts as a creative umpire that offers possibilities for blacks in the United States to mediate their general aspirations and desires. As a body of literature, black writing started in the 18th century as the medium that provides African Americans the platform to interrogate the dynamics of the African American identity, community and experience within America. According to Abah (2008) “the culture of African American writing is traceable to the middle of the 18th century, although the issues at the front-burner of this literature extend beyond two hundred years. In truth the life of bondage and enslavement became the necessary materials which were to translate into black writing”(7). Abah‟s contention brings to the fore the root and origin of African American literature and its relationship with the social context of America. Commenting on the destabilizing nature of the life of bondage in America, Kenneth Stampp (1956) observes that African Americans were seen as slaves who were “deemed, held, taken, reputed and adjudged in law to be chattel slaves, in the hands of their captors, owners, possessors, executors, and administrators, to all intents, constructions and purposes whatsoever” (97). This debate suggests that the tragedy of blacks in America did not begin with the ordeal of Reconstruction, or with the agony of the civil war, but with the growth of what Kenneth Stampp sees as a “peculiar institution”, that is, the institution of slavery in the ante-bellum days. Thus, “the engendering impulse of African American literature is resistance to human tyranny and the dedication to black dignity and identity” (Gates et al 2003). In other words, the struggles against the institution of slavery in America formed the fabric for black writing and subsequently the impetus for its development. In his review of Frederick Douglass‟ Narrative of the life in 1845, Lucius Matlock as cited in Gates and Mckay (1997), notes that: The soil of slavery itself – and the demands for its abolition – turned out to be an ironically fertile ground for the creation of a new literature, a literature indicting oppression, a literature created by the oppressed: “from the soil of slavery sprung forth some of the most brilliant productions, whose logical levers will ultimately upheave and overthrow the system (xxvii). From Matlock‟s view it is evident that the context of the emergence of black writing falls within the purview of an unbearable social environment of slavery in America. Thus, Jonathan Earle (2004) posits that “the abolition of slavery further created the environment for the thriving of African American literature” (4). Evidently, Earle is of the view that the elimination of slavery paved way for a more suitable platform for the development of black writing. It is in the light of this therefore that African American writers employed literature as a medium to express the plights and hopes of black people in America.</p>\n\nRACE, IDENTITY AND PERSPECTIVES OF AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN IN THE SELECTED WORKS OF TONI MORRISON AND RITA DOVE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RACE, IDENTITY AND PERSPECTIVES OF AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN IN THE SELECTED WORKS OF TONI MORRISON AND RITA DOVE", "id": 93}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>This paper examines the different subjugating conditions that women are confronted with daily. These include domestic violence, sexual abuse, Female Genital Mutilation, child-brides, bride-burning, discrimination in religious institutions and work place and other harmful cultural practices that inhibit the personal development of women in the society. Nawal El Sadaawi‟s portraiture of this grim reality in Woman at Point Zero brings to fore the various phases of injustices and abuse that women grapple with in phallocentric societies. Set in Egypt, the novelist reveals the deep rooted cultural and religious beliefs which are actually barriers to the self actualization of the female. The story, a true life account of a woman awaiting execution on death row, corroboratesNgugi‟s assertion that “Literature does not grow or develop in a vacuum; it is given impetus, shape, direction and even area of concern by social and economic forces in a particular society” (XV). The various stages of a woman‟s life and the peculiar type of oppression of each stage as portrayed in the novel forms the subject of the next discussion.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p> Female oppression is a problem that still exists in present day society. The fact that we live in a modern world with monumental technological advancement has not changed the grim reality that women are discriminated against and suppressed because of the patriarchal molded structures. The cultural beliefs, traditions and religions of most societies give more attention to patriarchy thereby ensuring the continuation of the domination and repression of women. Any attempt by women to protest against the injustices and discrimination meted by the men folk is tantamount to challenging age long tradition and culture which is perceived to be a sacrilege. Therefore she is made to accept her subordinate and second class position hence leading to the violation of her human right.  “To be a woman is a natural infirmity and every woman gets used to it. To be a man is an illusion, an act of violence that requires no justification(Henrietta and Nwodo, 1982) Hence  women are therefore viewed as the passive sacrificial lamb, always ready to be sacrificed on the altar of man’s social, economic and political spheres of the society by making meaningful contribution to its development. In spite of these, a woman, especially in Africa, is only respected and regarded as fulfilled when she performs her traditional duties as a housewife, mother, homemaker and caregiver who is meant to be seen and not heard. Any other role contrary to these stereotypical roles is regarded as an affront to male authority and ego which results in violence, oppression and violation of women right.  Based on this set back in this research focus on violation of the right of women in African novel. An examination of the case study of faceless Amma Darko and women at point zero novel.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the problem  </strong></p> <p>In Africa, procreation is the most common expectation governing marriage. A woman‘s ability to secure her marriage rests on her ability to give birth. The primacy of womanhood to African women has been elucidated by Oduyoye thus:  </p> <p>“Woman<em>hood is a highly valued role open only to women but desired by both men and women as well as the society as a whole; it is the channel by which men reproduce themselves and continue the family name and it is the channel by which women actualize their psycho-religious need to be the source of life. Often, procreation is described as if women are simply ―Objects of genetic and social transmission”. </em></p> <p>Oduyoye‘s analysis of the primacy of motherhood to African women reveals some attempt at a comparative analysis as per the importance of childbirth to men and women. Whereas for men procreation constitutes a duty call since it is the channel by which men continue with the family name, for women, childbirth goes beyond ensuring survival of the human race. Women see in it their ability to procreate, their very essence—it is fulfilling since the birth of a child supposedly fills a vacuum in a woman‘s life. It does not bring only physical joy to the woman; it assures her that her ability to procreate makes her acceptable before God and man. Ann Oakley has argued that being a mother is held out as the primary feminine goal. She writes: </p> <p><em>“Women hood settles women down and provides a focus for feelings of feminine responsibility. It is fulfilling – both of the social expectation and of the personal desire – though its capacity to satisfy the latter is not so great in reality as in anticipation (when babies are clothed in a mystique that red and squalling infants do not have)</em>.More than this, the very sentimentalization of womenhood is a problem for women in becoming and being mothers, since it poses the insoluble dilemma of tracing perfection in imperfect circumstances(Oakley, Ann,198:86) </p> <p>As an important marker of female identity, womanhood to most Africans and especially most African women is considered the major role of the female. According to Sarpong, womanhood ―is the principal if not ultimate end of marriage.( Sarpong, 1974:69</p> <p> According to John Gills (1996:174)  womanhood is the sovereign means of female identity formation. Gills (1996:174) asserts, giving birth ceased to be something that happens to a woman and became the ultimate source of adult female identity formation( Gills 1996:174).</p> <p>Gills‘s assertion points to a rather disturbing generalization which considers procreation as a duty for every woman. The woman who refuses to procreate or who, for one biological reason or the other, cannot procreate automatically comes under severe criticism for interrupting nature‘s original plan. Sarpong (1974:69) says: </p> <p>“The greatest calamity to befall an African woman is to be barren.The idea that women occupy important spaces in society cannot be overemphasized. According to Naana Horne, ―Matrilineal kinship recognizes woman as the very source of intergenerational connectedness.  Indeed, Darko‘s descent from a matrilineage explains partly the space she  gives to motherhood in her novels. The attendant challenges mothers face in the political and the  socio-economic domains of the woman nurturing the matrilineal kinship system of the Akans(in Ghana) . Furthermore, problems such as economic hardships, patriarchal and cultural demands, woman violation by men, domestic  violence against, as well as the irresponsible behaviour of some men have rendered many  women voiceless  in Africa to the extent that  women who are mothers cannot mentor their children, especially not their daughters, to become mothers or to make their views heard in public. Womanhood, in Africa, is fraught with a myriad of problems and these problems have made motherhood a paradox—that which brings joy and reward whilst at the same time reducing the woman/mother to the level of an object conditioned to suffer shame and abuse. The received view that all mothers have automatic love for their children has been radically interrogated by world changing situations as well as African women writers. It is based on this problems that this study examines the violation of the right of women in Africa novel. </p> <p><strong>Objective of the study</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study is to ascertain how African novels such as faceless and women at point zero portrayed the violation of women right in African novel. Specific objective is to examine:</p> <p>1.     How  the violation of  right of women  is being  highlighted in faceless  Amma Dark Novel.</p> <p>2.     How the violation of right of women is being highlighted in women at point zero Novel.</p> <p>3.     To compares and contrast the way the Africa novel such as faceless and women at point zero highlighted violation of human right.</p> <p><strong>Research Question  </strong></p> <p>The following research question will guide the study as follows:</p> <p>1.      How does violation of human right highlighted in faceless Amma Dark Novel?</p> <p>2.     How does violation of human right highlighted in women at point zero Novel?</p> <p>3.     What comparison and contrast exist between faceless Amma Darko highlight of violation of the right of women in African and that of women at point zero?</p> <p><strong>Significance of the study </strong></p> <p>The study will be of benefit to all citizens of Africans countries in that it will enable them see the need of protecting and advocating for the freedom of women oppression as regard violation of their right. It will enable the male counterpart to fully understand some of the crucial role which woman play in homes and society at large. Therefore, enabling the male to see the need of respecting and honour the women in the society.</p>\n\nTHE VIOLATION OF WOMEN RIGHT IN AFRICAN NOVEL FACELESS AND WOMEN AT POINT ZERO PORTRAYED<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE VIOLATION OF WOMEN RIGHT IN AFRICAN NOVEL FACELESS AND WOMEN AT POINT ZERO PORTRAYED", "id": 94}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS, PROVISION, UTILIZATION AND NURSERY PUPILS’ PERFORMANCE IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN JOS NORTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, PLATEAU STATE.</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>English Language is the language of instruction in Nigeria’s educational system. It is therefore important that it is properly taught in schools. This study was designed to assess the impact of provision and utilization of instructional materials on performance of public nursery pupils in English Language in Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State. Four research questions were raised and three hypotheses were formulated. A sample of one hundred and twenty (120) teachers were randomly selected from the twenty (20) sampled primary schools in Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State. Data analysis was carried out using chi-square of independence for the hypothesis and simple percentages for the research questions. The result showed that provision of instructional materials to schools were grossly inadequate. It was also observed that there was poor utilization of the available instructional materials by teachers in the classrooms, making the performances of pupils poor in the language with resultant low impact on the academic performances of public nursery pupils in education generally. It is therefore recommended that ‘instructional materials should be made available for the teaching of English Language and the teachers as well should ensure that the available instructional materials are appropriately utilized during the lesson delivery. </p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>Education is an important instrument for the development of a nation’s social life, human resources, political awareness and the economy at large. It is clearly stated by the federal republic of Nigeria (1988:15) in her national policy of education that ‘education has been adopted as an instrument for effecting national development: it is in the light of this that the federal government is doing everything possible to see that illiteracy rate is reduced or totally wiped out of the nation because no country can grow beyond the educational level of its citizenry.</p> <p>Nursery education or early childhood education which is the first stage of formal school system in Nigeria today forms the bedrock of an individual’s education life. This is because the quality of an individual’s subsequent educational prowess depends largely on the quality of nursery education that the individual received. Hence the broad aims of nursery education within Nigeria can be summarized as preparation and laying of strong foundation for primary school and other levels of education in future.</p> <p>The federal republic of Nigeria (2004), has stated that nursery education is the education given in an educational institution to children between the ages of three (3) and five (5) prior to entering into primary school. Nursery education began as a private enterprise in Nigeria and continued until the year 2003, when the federal government and the United Nations International Children Education Fund (UNICEF) took inventory of early childhood care facilities in Nigeria and discovered that most of the facilities were privately owned. It was then that the Universal Basic Education (UBE) act (2004) included programmes and initiatives for early childhood education and development in states and local government areas. To make it more effective, the UBE programme made provision for every public school to have a nursery school linkage to cater for children aged 3 – 5 years. This is a period of growth and vulnerability in children. They are extra active at this stage, inquisitive and very curious to know the ‘hows’ and ‘whys’ of everything they see. It is because of this that teaching and learning process requires a sort of simulation and adequate use of instructional materials to make lessons interesting and meaningful, especially in English language.</p> <p>The impact of instructional materials in teaching and learning in the school is indisputable. Teaching at any level requires that students be exposed to some form of simulation. Danmola (1992) noted that teaching resources in English language means anything that can assist the teacher in promoting teaching and learning of the subject. When the students are given the chance to learn through more senses than one, they can learn faster and easier.        </p> <p>Ikerionwu (2000) refers to instructional materials as objects or devices which help the teacher to make learning meaningful to the learners. Instructional materials are materials which assist teachers to make their lessons explicit to learners. They are also used to transmit information, ideas and notes to learners (Okorie 1982). He identified instructional materials to include both visuals and audio visuals such as pictures, flash cards, charts, posters, tape recorders, radio sets, video, television sets and computers among others. These materials and equipment serve as supplements to the traditional or normal processes of instruction.</p> <p>The use of instructional materials provides the teacher with interesting and compelling platforms for conveying information since they motivate learners to learn more. Furthermore, the teacher is assisted in overcoming physical difficulties that could have hindered his effective presentation of a given topic to the learners. According to Lane in Larson (2001), the use of electronically medicated instruction to duplicate the traditional face to face classroom has resulted in a shift from teacher to student centered classes. In this situation, the responsibility for learning is shifted to the students. The teacher only facilitates the learning by acting as a coach, resource guide and companions in learning. The use of instructional materials therefore does not only encourage teachers and students to work collaboratively, but also results in more cooperative learning activities among the students.</p> <p>The purpose of instructional materials is to promote efficiency of education by improving the quality of teaching and learning. Incorporating these tools and materials present, supports and reinforces teaching. According to ‘Aduwa Ogiegbeen and Imogie (2005), these materials and resources including audio tape recorders, video tape recorders, slide projectors, still pictures, programmed instruction, film strips, maps, charts, graph, opaque projectors, overhead projector and many more, offer a variety of learning experiences individually or in combination to meet different teaching and learning experiences.</p> <p>Since the inception of nursery in public primary schools in 2005, few or no studies have been devoted to evaluating the availability and utilization of instructional materials in the teaching of English language in nursery classes in Jos North local government area. At the threshold of this new millennium, English language teachers face challenges and need to evolve strategies to engage learners in activities that are active, meaningful and challenging in the teaching and learning of the subject.</p> <p>English Language is not an indigenous language to Nigerians. Since it is the medium of instruction in our schools, duty demands that the subject be properly handled, especially for the beginning readers. English language is technical in nature. The ability to assimilate meaning from text, spoken words, commands and reading of print materials is an index of good performance in English language which speeds up understanding of every other subject taught in school. It then becomes necessary to use techniques, methods and materials which will help the pupils to learn fast and happily. This fact is supported by Arisi (2000), who asserts that visual aids make lesson come alive and help students learn better. It is in view of this background that this study attempts to examine the extent to which the availability of instructional materials could advance nursery pupils performance in English language especially in reading.</p> <p>Franzer, Okebukola and Jegede (1992) stressed that a professionally qualified English teacher, no matter how well trained, would be unable to put his ideas into practice if the school setting lacks the equipment and materials necessary for him or her to translate his competence into reality. Kadzera (2006), opined that English language is resources intensive and so teachers should not depend on sophisticated imported materials and equipment always rather, the need for improvising. Producing and providing instructional materials locally will reduce cost and irrelevancy.</p> <p>Ogunleye (2002) and Obioha (2006) reported that there were inadequate resources for teaching English language in primary schools in Nigeria. They further stated that the available ones were not usually in good conditions. There is the need therefore for adequate provision of good teaching materials in schools. Garuba (2003), also noted that improvisation as a means of providing for the demand of adventure, creativity, curiosity and perseverance on the part of the teacher. Such skills are only realizable through well planned and administrative training programmes on improvisation of learning objectives and instructional materials.</p> <p>Given the importance of instructional materials, the government does not adequately provide instructional materials to primary and nursery schools. Teachers themselves are also lacking in improvising and this could be the reason for poor performances of nursery pupils in English language. For instance, in ECWA transfer primary school, Jos, records of results have shown poor performance in English language tests and examinations consistently from 2011 to 2014. In 2011 promotion examination, the pupils had average mark of 40% in English, 2012, 35% average; 30% in 2013 and 45% in 2014. This trend of poor performance may likely be common to many other nursery schools in Jos North Local Government Area.</p> <p>Based on these performances, the researcher would want to find out whether the poor performance of pupils in English language is due to inadequate availability or lack of instructional materials. If instructional materials are available, how adequate are they? And how well are the teachers using them in the course of their teaching and learning processes in the classroom. </p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Instructional materials play significant roles in the teaching and learning process. The federal government in its national policy on education recognizes education as an expensive social service, requiring adequate financial provision from the federal, state and local governments as well as the local communities, individuals and organization (FRN: 1998). The government cannot provide education alone. The slogan is, ‘all hands must be on deck’, yet there are pitfalls as regards financing education in Nigeria. In nursery schools, there are no instructional materials for teaching because the government is not providing them. Teachers are not helping matters due to financial constraints. This condition is capable of affecting pupil’s performance negatively. Aguwu, (2005) stated that instructional material management is a crucial component of the entire classroom control. Since the act of teaching is fundamentally concerned with passing ideas, knowledge, skills and attitude from the teacher to the learners, it will be improper to go about it haphazardly.</p> <p>The problem of this study is that nursery pupils are performing below average in English language especially reading. It may be as a result of in-availability of instructional materials in schools or lapses on the side of the teachers in using the available materials in teaching. If the materials are available, then are they of good quality? Are they used by teachers at the right time during lessons? Could pupils learning capacity be enhanced by the use of instructional materials?       </p> <p><strong>1.3    THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The propose of this study is to find out the impact of instructional material utilization on pupils performance in English language in public Nursery schools in Jos North LGA of Plateau State. However in specific terms, the identifiable objectives of the study are:</p> <p>1.   To find the availability of instructional materials for teaching English language in public nursery schools in Jos North Local Government Area.</p> <p>2.   To find whether there are adequacy of the instructional materials in public nursery schools in Jos North Local Government Area.</p> <p>3.   To find out whether the teachers are appropriately using instructional materials for teaching in Jos North Local Government Area.</p> <p>4.   To find the impact of instructional material utilization on pupils performance in English language in public nursery schools in Jos North Local Government Area.</p> <p><strong>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In order to achieve the objectives of this study, these research questions were raised to guide the investigation:</p> <p>1.   To what extent has the availability of instructional materials in public nursery schools affected the performance of pupils in English language?</p> <p>2.   To what extent has adequacy of instructional materials affected teaching of English language in public nursery schools in Jos North?</p> <p>3.   To what extent have teachers been appropriately utilizing the available instructional materials in delivering lessons?</p> <p>4.   Of what impact is the utilization of instructional materials by teachers on the performance of public nursery pupils in English language?</p> <p><strong>1.5    RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>The following hypotheses have been postulated to guide the study:</p> <p><strong>H01:</strong>  There is no significant relationship between the availability of instructional materials and pupils performance in English language in public nursery schools in Jos North local government area.</p> <p><strong>H02:</strong>  There is no significant relationship between adequacy of instructional materials and performance of nursery pupils in English in Jos North local government area.</p> <p><strong>H03:  </strong>There is no significant relationship between appropriate utilization of instructional materials and nursery pupil’s performance in English language in Jos North Local Government Area.                 </p> <p><strong>1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>          The use of instructional materials give the learner opportunity to touch, smell or taste objects in the teaching and learning processes. Consequently, knowledge passed unto the pupils at different levels of educational instructions should be well planned, administered and properly aligned with relevant instructional materials for clarity and comprehensibility to the learners. Hence, the significance of this current study to the students or pupils, teachers, curriculum planners, educational system, the government and the society at large are outlined below:</p> <p>          To the government, the finding of this study would provide the ministry of education with some useful information which would make them appreciate the need to work out effective means of providing the essential instructional facilities and materials for the nursery schools in Jos – North L.G.A and Plateau State at large. They would do this by establishing instructional resource centres where these materials could be easily made available. Government would also see the need to organize seminars and conferences for serving teachers on the improvisation and utilization of instructional materials for teaching in the school.</p> <p>          The curriculum planners in the area of English Language would benefit from the findings of this study. They would be provided with some information on the need for making instructional materials enshrined in the curriculum and make it mandatory for teachers to use.</p> <p>          Teachers of English Language would also benefits from these findings of this research; it will equip them with some useful information on the need for effective utilization of instructional materials in the teaching and learning processes.</p> <p>          Pupils and students would also benefit from the findings of this study as regards the use of instructional materials by teachers in the teaching of English Language: to arouse their interest and help them acquire skills in English Language, to help them effectively learn and retain what they have learnt and thereby advancing their performance in the subject in question.</p> <p>          The study is also significant to the educational system itself. It could be among the many literature references to the future researchers and show gaps which need further investigation. It may also accord public education on how to teach learners with reading problems in the classroom.</p> <p>This study will immensely benefit the society at large because the findings herein may be used as a basis for relevant Non Governmental Organizations (NGO) to help provide the support services needed in our public schools. When teachers solidify their teaching with teaching materials and the learners learn effectively, the knowledge acquired will reflect positively in the society.</p> <p><strong>1.7    DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          This study was confined to examining the utilization of instructional materials in the academic performance of nursery pupils in English language in public Nursery schools in Jos North Local Government Area. Hence, it is not within the scope of this research work to deal with other subjects. Similarly, private nursery schools would not constitute part of this study.</p> <p><strong>1.8    THEORETICAL/ CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK</strong></p> <p>This study is guided by the constructivist theory. Formalization of the theory of constructivism is generally attributed to Jean Piaget, a Swiss psychologist who articulated mechanisms by which knowledge is internalized by learners. He suggested that through processes of accommodation and assimilation, individuals construct new knowledge from their experiences. When individuals assimilate, they incorporate the new experience into an already existing framework without changing that framework.</p> <p>This may occur when individuals’ experiences are aligned with their internal representation of the world, but may also occur as a failure to change a faculty understanding. For example, they may not notice events, may misunderstand input from others, or may decide that an event is a fluke and is therefore unimportant as information about the world. In contrast, when the individuals’ experiences contradict their internal representations, they may change their perceptions of the experiences to fit their internal representations. According to the theory, accommodation is the process of reframing ones mental representation of the external world to fit new experiences. Accommodation can be understood as the mechanism by which failure leads to learning. When we act on the expectation that the world operates in one way and it violates our expectations, we often fall, but by accommodating this new experience and reframing our model of the way the world works, we learn from the experience of failure, or others failure (Ernest, 1991).</p> <p>According to Floden (1994). Constructivism is based on observation and scientific study about how people learn. People construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world, through experiencing things and reflecting on those experiences. In the classroom, the constructivist view of learning can point towards a number of different teaching practices. In the most general sense, it usually means encouraging students to use active techniques (experiments, real – world problem solving) to create more knowledge and then to reflect on and talk about what they are doing and how their understanding is changing.</p> <p><strong>1.9   OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>1.      <strong>Academic Performance: </strong>It is the school evaluation of pupils classroom work as quantified on the basis of marks or grades assigned by the teacher to pupils in nursery schools.</p> <p>2.      <strong>Instructional Materials:</strong> They are the materials that teachers use in teaching to make the lesson active, interesting, real and understandable to the learners in nursery schools.</p> <p>3.      <strong>Instructional Materials Availability:</strong> They are the types of instructional materials provided for the school use.     </p> <p>4.      <strong>Instructional Material Adequacy:</strong> This is the idea of having sufficient material for teaching in order to involve all the pupils in the classroom activities.     </p> <p>5.      <strong>Instructional Material Utilization:</strong> This is the idea of the teachers actually using the provided instructional materials for teaching during lesson delivery in the classroom. </p> <p>6.      <strong>Improvisation:</strong> This is the act of making instructional materials available locally by the teachers in nursery schools.</p> <p>7.      <strong>Nursery Schools:</strong> This refers to schools attended by children or pupils between the ages of three (3) and six (6) in Jos North Local Government Area.   </p> <p>8.      <strong>Public Nursery Schools:</strong> They are the nursery schools that are in primary schools owned by the government.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>REVIEW OF RELEVANT LITERATURE</strong></p> <p>          This chapter is commonly referred to as the library because it strictly deals with the review of related and relevant studies, works and researches done by different scholars which would serve as bench mark and round works of analysis to this current study. The literature would be reviewed in the orders below.</p> <p>1.   Place of instructional materials in the teaching and learning processes.</p> <p>2.   Instructional materials and categories</p> <p>3.   Improvisation of instructional materials</p> <p>4.   Instructional materials and academic achievement.</p> <p>5.   Impact of provision and utilization of instructional material on pupils academic performance </p> <p>6.   Empirical studies </p> <p>7.   Summary of literature</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>2.1   PLACE OF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS IN THE TEACHING AND LEARNING PROCESSES</strong></p> <p>          The acquisition of basic vocational knowledge, skills and attitudes to facilitate occupational efficiency requires skill oriented teaching and learning activities. Over the years the poor performance of students and pupils in examinations has been blamed on the wrong choice of teaching methods by teachers, but teaching and learning activities have a lot to do with other variables such as instructional materials, school environment variables, student’s factors and so on. In this study, instructional material utilization is the main focus in order to determine their impact on the performance of the pupils.</p> <p>          Instructional materials are the devices developed or acquired to assist teachers in transmitting organized knowledge, skills and attitudes to the learners within an instructional situation (Nwachukwn, 2006). Teachers are to use different instructional materials to motivate learning. Teachers often make use of textbooks, charts, models, graphics, regalia as well as improvised materials (Awotus Efebo 2001). The success of the skill and knowledge acquisition in an instructional situation depends on the suitability of the instructional materials, adequate provision and effective utilization of the available materials (Olaitan and Agusiobo, 1994).  The relevance of instructional materials is serious consideration in order to better the learner’s performance.</p> <p>Learning is facilitated when the learner makes use of at least three of the sense organs namely; seeing, hearing and touching. Literature in methodology of teaching an instructional communication have explained and illustrated the effectiveness of instructional materials as a tool for improving student’s performance in the learning of difficult concepts (Ibe –Bassey, 1991; Etim, 1998; Ikot, 2008).</p> <p><strong>Instructional Charts:</strong> A chart is a two dimensional object. They are flat-visual materials which may represent diagrams or a combination of pictorial, graphic, numerical or verbal materials prepared to give a clear visual summary of vital processes, concepts or a set of relationship (Ibe Bassey, 2000). Charts are used to present ideas and concepts which may be difficult to understand if presented using the verbal code only. Walter (1998) noted that the use of instructional charts in teaching improves the students reading skill and stimulates creativity in the learners. Charts present an abstract rendition of reality because what is presented is shown as effective in the cognitive domain of learning.</p> <p>Okechukwu (1997) studied the impact of graphic materials on student’s academic achievement in English using 925 students as the population size and 120 as sample size in an experimental study adopting 2 x 2 factorial arrangements. The findings of the study showed that students taught English using graphic materials such as charts and pictures performed better than their counterparts who were taught using lecture method. </p> <p><strong>Instructional Pictures:</strong> Pictures are photographic representations of objects, people, places, events, things or concepts. Pictures in this context are still or motionless objects. They may be illustrated in textbooks, periodicals, catalogues, magazines, study prints and so on. Pictures are used to communicate abstract ideas in a more realistic way (Ibe Bassey, 1991; Etim 2006). A good picture according to Etim (1998), should have good composition, a clear message, good contrast and sharpness with effective colour. Children like colour, so they can learn from good pictures with or without the help of teachers. In his observation, Okechukwu (1997), opined that students taught with instructional pictures performed better than their counterparts taught without pictures.</p> <p><strong>Instructional Filmstrip:</strong> Instructional filmstrip materials are another materials used in schools to aid teaching and learning process in the classroom. A filmstrip is a roll of 35mm transparent film containing a series of related still pictures showing one concept at a time. A filmstrip can either be of a single or double frame format (Ikot, 2008). Filmstrip can be used to teach skills, show relationships in order to convey knowledge, to affect attitude through individual and independent study, groups or other tutorial group viewing (Ibe Bassey, 1991). In a study to determine the effects of instructional materials utilization on performance of pupils in English language in Iket-Abasi Local Government Area. Ikot (2008) adopted a quasi experimental design using the population of 1995 pupils and the intact class sample size 225 pupils. The findings showed that there was significant difference between the performance of pupils taught with filmstrip and those taught without filmstrip. Abass, Bimbo and Ojo (2012), in a study to determine the effects of animated agricultural science instructional packages on attitude and performance of primary school pupils in south west area Nigeria, discovered that the animated agricultural science instructional packages significantly influenced the academic performance of the selected students.</p> <p>Osokoya (2007), in a study to determine the effects of video-taped instruction on achievement in English discovered that there was significant difference between the mean scores of students taught English with video-taped instructional packages and those taught with the conventional method. Countries all over the world, especially the developing ones like Nigeria, are striving hard to develop technologically and scientifically through education, since the world is turning scientific and all proper functioning of lives depend greatly on effective means of communication and of course English language is of paramount importance. According to Ogunleye (2002), Esioba (2005), and the Nigerian Educational Research and Development Council (NERDC) Isola (2010), studies revealed that the performance of Nigerian students in ordinary level English language was generally and consistently poor over the years (Akanbi, 1983, Omosewo, 1999). Poor academic achievement in English language could be attributed to many factors among which teachers utilization and instructional materials strategy itself was considered as important factor. This implies that the understanding and mastery of English concepts might not be fully achieved without the use of instructional materials.</p> <p>Bassey (2002), opined that English is resource intensive, and in a period of economic recession, it may be very difficult to find some of the electronic gadgets and equipment for the teaching of oral English language in schools. A situation that is further compounded by the galloping inflation in the country and many at times, some of the imported sophisticated materials and equipment are found expensive and irrelevant; hence the need to produce materials locally. Obioha (2006), and Ogunleye (2002), reported that there were inadequate resource provision for teaching English language subjects in both primary and secondary schools in Nigeria. They further stated that the available ones are not usually in good conditions. There is the need therefore for improvisation so as to supplement the available ones. The experiences in the utilization of instructional materials in English language studies are not different from the reports of various investigations on the use of instructional materials in other subject areas (Ogbondah, 2008). In an appraisal of the utilization of instructional materials in the education of migrant fishermen’s children in river state of Nigeria Ogbondah, (2008), reported shortage of instructional materials in the schools. He noted that there was significant relationship between availability and adequate utilization of instructional materials and effective implementation of migrant fishermen’s children education programme in river state of Nigeria.</p> <p>Teachers should however note that effective teaching and permanent learning take place when pupils actively participate in a variety of learning activities. These activities are intended to challenge the pupils to think creatively about the subject (MDG, 2007). It is necessary to know that pupil’s environment needs to be filled with as many learning materials as possible. Pupils will selectively respond to the materials which interest/stimulate them most. Therefore, the concept of using instructional materials is to enhance the teaching and learning process. Teaching effectiveness depend upon the quality of interaction the teacher has with his pupils on the subject/topic.          </p> <p>A study to investigate the effect of using instructional materials on the achievement of primary school pupils in English language as done by Bassey (2002), revealed that the main effect of treatment, that is, types of instructional materials on pupils achievement in English language is significant (F = 115.969; P&lt; 0.5). This means that there is a significant difference in the performance and achievement of pupils taught using standard instructional materials, those taught with improvised instructional materials and those taught with conventional instruction (control group). To find out which of the two treatment groups and the control group performed better than others, multiple classification achievement test was administered and it was shown that pupils taught with improvised instructional materials obtained the highest achievement score at post test (F = 74.94), followed by those taught with standard instructional materials (F = 63.07) while the control group scored the lowest (F = 39.89). This shows that the improvised instructional materials were the most effective than the standard and control group.</p> <p>Furthermore, the Duncan post hoc analysis was used to trace the sources of the significant main effect of treatment on student’s achievement in English language. This indicated that each of the three possible pairs; standard (F = 63.07) versus improvised (F = 74.94) are significantly different. Hence, all the pairs compared contributed to the significance obtained for treatment on achievement in English language. It also showed that there was no significant difference between male and female performance and scores in the experimental and control group. The study also found that gender has no significant effect on students achievement in English language (F = .065, P &gt;.05). This implies that the difference between the achievement of male and female is not significant. The multiple classification achievement performance shows the gender group which performed better than the other. It was revealed that females performed better (F = 59.52) than the male counterparts (F = 59.04). This difference was not significant as shown earlier.</p> <p>Findings from the other studies conducted by Adepimpe (1997), ‘Utilization of Teaching Resource’ and Garuba, (2003), ‘Towards the Optional Utilization and Management of Resources for Effective Teaching and Learning of English in Schools’ revealed that there was significant effect of treatment on pupils’ achievement in English. The researchers found out that the pupils who were taught with the standard instructional materials or resources achieved significantly higher scores in their examinations to those who were taught with conventional method. It was therefore observed that using standard instructional materials assist the teacher economically and allows students interactions which make pupils to achieve better in their lesson. It makes pupils use their intellectual ability during teaching and learning processes. Improvised instructional materials encourage creativity, bringing learning home-wards and often better suited to the climatic conditions of the local environment which improve and enhance pupils’ achievement (Ogunleye, 2002). The reason for this might be due to the efficiency which the English teachers used in handling the instructional materials, which was different from the other methods.</p> <p>Similarly, the findings from the study done by Ekpo (2001). ‘Availability of resources for the Teaching of English in Public Primary Schools’, using English reported that pupils taught with teaching materials performed better than those taught verbally. It was also found that there was no significant effect of gender on student’s achievement in English. This implies that both male and female students achieved equally under the same condition during learning and teaching process, since achievement has to do with mental and intellectual ability and not gender. Agreeably, Moronfola, (2002) stressed that English language as a subject should be taught primarily as a practical subject with all the instructional materials. Dahor and Faize (2011) survey finding ascertained that in a modern English curriculum programme, pupils (male and female) need to be encouraged to learn not only through their eyes or ears but should be able to use their hands to produce, observe and manipulate materials. This is in line with the theory of constructivism.</p>\n\nINSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS, PROVISION, UTILIZATION AND NURSERY PUPILS’ PERFORMANCE IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS, PROVISION, UTILIZATION AND NURSERY PUPILS’ PERFORMANCE IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE", "id": 95}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>This essay is on the post-independence Nigerian politician in Wale Okediran’s Tenants of the House. The study examines the corrupt nature of Nigerian politics. The book itself is a skillful delineation of the ugly colors of Nigerian politics with its seeming intrigues, base motives, ‘win at all costs motive’ and money as the great leverage. It also has its rich mix of love and politics.<br/><br/>Once upon a time, there was a region in the amalgamated units called Nigeria which has the largest land mass, contributed greatly to the national pool, had fair share of commerce and industrial activities and above all called the shots in the art of power and leadership. This region had produced nine out of the fourteen (14) heads of government so far who had ruled for greater part of the country’s fifty one (52) years of self government. The region also produced uncountable numbers of ministers and retinue of other influential citizens who drew their power from diverse sources. As the nation celebrates thirteen (14) years of uninterrupted democracy to day, one huge question is to be asked ‘What have the leaders so far done with political powers?’<br/><br/>African literature not Nigerian has had a long tradition of political satirization perhaps owing to experiences of dictatorship, nepotism and such other vices inherent in the leadership of various African countries. This explains the theory of writing as socio responsibility. Thus, from anti-colonial struggle to the vicious neo-colonialism we have had writers that pursued this course with uncommon virtuosity, it is within this context that one situates Wale Okediran’s Tenants of the House.<br/><br/>In Tenants of the House, Wale Okediran presents a vivid picture, a critique, even if not an expose of contemporary Nigerian politics. Though the setting of the 306 page novel is the Nigeria’s lower chamber of the National Assembly; the House of Representative, it dramatizes the polity with coverage and artistic bravura. Indeed, the first person narration endears readers to the book and gives chance for details.<br/><br/>Fortunately, both the writer and the narrator were members of the House (insiders) hence the excellent account. Tenants of the House is not all about politics as it embedded equally powerful themes, notable among them is the theme of love.<br/><br/>The novel always has the potential to stir up controversies as it gives a unique insight into the politicking, corruption, intrigues, scheming, betrayal and political horse-trading that has been the hallmark of Nigeria’s legislature since 1999. What many Nigerians have only previously speculated about has been revealed by an insider. It is a haunting portrait, with a strong ring of familiarity and topicality, that I find most instructive, the realism of the narrative, a strong indication of how little progress has been made in Africa’s development process. The point has been made and nauseam that a critical causative factor in Nigeria’s development, is the failure of the leadership elite; their graft and greed, lack of enlightenment, and viciousness, made worse by their alienation from the reality and the people they are supposed to lead.<br/><br/>In Okediran’s most recent novel, we are introduced to a terribly disoriented society, where there is much conflict between rhetoric and action, appearance and reality, individual and society, and this is reproduced not only among the political elite but also at all strata of the society. The book presents, withy gripping suspense a shrill voice of a nation in urgent need of political renewal and rebirth.<br/><br/>1.1 LIFE AND WORKS OF THE AUTHOR<br/><br/>Wale Okediran was born in April 1955 in Oyo State Nigeria. He qualified as a medical doctor from the Obafemi Awolowo University in 1980. He had worked in government and private hospitals for several years before he went into private practice until 1999 when he went into politics and was appointed Chairman, Oyo State Hospital’s Management Board.<br/><br/>He later contested for a seat in the Federal House of Representatives, where he represented his constituency, from 2005 to 2007. Wale Okediran is well known for his essays, short stories and novels which are deeply rooted in the contemporary Nigerian society in which he lives.<br/><br/>In 1990, his poem “Call to Worship,” won a book prize for the American poetry contest while his novel, The Boys at the Border was shortlisted for the 1991 commonwealth literature prize. Indeed most of his works have been shortlisted for awards or are actually award winners. His novel The Rescue of Uncle Babs, won the 1998 ANA Prize for children’s literature while Dreams Die at Twilight, was adjudged for the NLNG, Nigerian Literature Prize in 2004.<br/><br/>In the same year, Dreams Die at Twilight was one of the 25th best books of the last 25 years in Nigeria by Spectrum Books Limited.<br/><br/>In 2005, Strange Encounters won the ANA Fiction prize while The Weaving Looms, was shortlisted to the 2008 Wole Soyinka prize for literature in Africa.<br/><br/>Okediran who is a medical doctor, served as a member of the Federal House of Representatives, Abuja, Nigeria between 2003 to 2007, he was also the National President of the Association of Nigerian authors from 05 to 2009.<br/><br/>1.2 SYNOPSIS OF THE NOVEL<br/><br/>Tenants of the House is a skillful delineation of the ugly colors of Nigerian politics with its seeming intrigues, base motives, ‘win at all-cost’ motivations and money as the great leverage with its rich mix of love and politics. The novel centers on the plot to oust the speaker of the House of Representatives as seen through the eyes of Honorable Samuel, the narrator. The move was initiated by the p residency and Honorable Samuel, hitherto an inconsequential member in the House, was propelled to the forefront of dubious politicians with dubious intents, moving him a key figure in the battle for the leadership of the house.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds, the narrator reveals the motivations behind the unpredictable flow of events in the legislative largely shaped by `fertilizer’ (bribes) offered to legislators. The extent to which corruption dictates the fate of a country is summarized by one of the honorablses, Moses Adeyi, who says:<br/><br/>“Who will stand up for anything<br/><br/>except his stomach, all people <br/><br/>want is money to eat”[217].<br/><br/>It is this desperate avarice that leads to the intrigues daily played out in the hallowed chambers of the house that revolve around late night meetings, prostitutional shift of allegiances, driven revelries, blackmails, conspiracies, betrayal and spy work. All of these are part of legislative work that Nigerians are not privy to. We are also exposed to some of the tricks employed by legislators to truncate the functioning of the house, like curing off power supply, sabotaging the air conditioning and short circuiting the microphones. One would be surprised how dubious our lawmakers are.<br/><br/>Okediran also gives us a fictionalized insight into the battle for the third term bid how the greedy legislators so dramatically demonized in the impeachment saga, came together in a union of very strange bed fellows, to shoot down the dastardly tenure elongation bid of a very theatrical president. ‘Oneya’. In disregarding the rules of narration Okediran, who alternates between the first person and omniscient narratives goes behind the scene to report events that shed more lights on the overall plot. While some may see this as a plus, conservatives may consider it a flagrant violation of narrative rules, but there is no denying this approach helped in the wholesomeness of the study.<br/><br/>The novel apart form being an expose on some subtle issues in the House, like cultism and drug use among legislators the novel has a mix of memorable characters like Hon. Lizzy Bello, the gun-carrying belle of the house how carries pistol in her purse and is in the thick of every plot, for the good or the bad. There is also the small senator smollet, the president’s dog on a leash and go between, not to mention president Oneya and others, whom Okediran assembled to move his plot forward with much drama and theatrics.<br/><br/>1.3 REVIEW OF RELATED CRITICISM<br/><br/>The spirit of struggle against unjust social systems like slavery, colonialism, racism, capitalism and imperialism is neither new or peculiar to Africa, and different people of the world at different times have had to resist forms of oppression sometimes successfully without decisive success.<br/><br/>Writers, because they constitute a sensitive part of the society may more than others feel the oppression around them although they may not have the best imaginative responses to political analysis and activities but they still contribute their own quota through their write ups.<br/><br/>Okediran Tenants of the House has also been analysed by different authorities but only a few would be cited here.<br/><br/>Abubakar Adam Ibrahim in an online article sees the book as<br/><br/>“a competition of political intrigue treated with a huge dose of thirty veiled fiction documenting occurrences in Nigeria’s lower legislative chamber.”<br/><br/>This is a fact as the author who is also a fictional character in the novel recounts his ordeals as a tenant in the House of Representatives.<br/><br/>Reuben Abati views Okediran’s latest novel in an article as <br/><br/>“a fictional account of some of the highlights of that season in Nigeria’s fourth republic.” <br/><br/>He admits that much in the end what the author offers is an artistic portrayal of the enduring challenge of leadership not just in Nigeria’s tottering political space but in Africa.<br/><br/>Abati’s view is correct because the Nigerian politicians who was depicted as a hero, fighting for independence in anti-colonial Nigerian literature, is now portrayed in post-independence Nigerian literature as a corrupt individual, intolerant of opposition and dissent, a criminal, a monster dictator and a vain fool.<br/><br/>Lanre Ogundimu in an online article where his views were properly expressed comments on the book as one: <br/><br/>“full of political satire, innuendo, intrigue and dubious characters, the author, Wale Okediran, uses his inside knowledge and experience as one term congressman in Nigeria’s Federal House of Representatives to skillfully tell an interesting fictional story. The book exposes the political class and the back stabbing and selfish interest in the lawmaking chamber and the country.”<br/><br/>In addition to this, I would say that this novel offers a quintessential portrait of the brutal and cannibalistic leadership that Nigeria has had to endure in the past five decades.<br/><br/>Carmen views the novel in an article by “good reads” published online as she gave her own contribution to Okediran’s novel: Tenants of the House: “Recent Nigerian history has read like the melodramatic imaginings of Nollywood, so it is no surprise that the new novel describing surreal machinations in the Nigerian House of Assembly, Tenants of the House, by Wale Okediran describes a dizzying. Swirl of rapidly changing political loyalty. Extravagant sums of money casually changing hands in brown envelope, politicians whose actions make the reader waver between disgust and sympathy.”<br/><br/>Carmen’s view is true as the book portrays the societal ills and decadence prevalent in our present society.<br/><br/>Abdulaziz Abdulazid in an online article titled “muse and musings of a young Journalist” views the book in is comment: <br/><br/>“Tenants of the House has many strong points one of which is obviously manifested meticulous research conducted by the author. There are many instances to prove this point: one which is the Fulani culture he deeply explored the trip to Canterbury and Kampala show case research/experience of water at his work”.<br/><br/>The novel is indeed typical of a scholarly work as the text shows enough research which proves the extent at which author strives to please his readers.<br/><br/>1.4 JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY<br/><br/>African independence remains a twentieth century political mirage sought for but never attained political misrule, dictatorship and corruption have become the order of the day and the masses are grossly disillusioned by the activities of the leaders.<br/><br/>This topic is justifiable owing to the fact this research work has not until now been analyzed to portray the character trait of Nigerian post-independence politicians in Okediran’s Tenants of the House.<br/><br/>1.4 THESIS STATEMENT<br/><br/>This essay examines the post-independence Nigerian politician as corrupt and immoral in Wale Okediran’s Tenants of the House.</p>\n\nTHE POST INDEPENDENT NIGERIAN POLITICIAN IN WALE OKEDIRANS TENANTS OF THE HOUSE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE POST INDEPENDENT NIGERIAN POLITICIAN IN WALE OKEDIRANS TENANTS OF THE HOUSE", "id": 96}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>1.0INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>1.1Purpose of Study <br/><br/>This study examines irony in Aminata Sowfall’s The Beggars’ strike with the purpose of bringing out how irony is used to realize the themes in the work.<br/><br/>1.2Scope of Study <br/><br/>This essay examines The Beggars’ Strike as a novel in which Aminata Sowfall uses irony such as situational and verbal irony to demonstrate themes.<br/><br/>1.3Methodology<br/><br/>This work is carried out using the primary text, Aminata Sow Fall’s The Beggars’ Strike,internet, library research and other subject related articles.<br/><br/>1.4Theatrical Background<br/><br/>This research work is based on the sociological theory which Kenneth Allan defines as “abstract and testable propositions about society” (Web) it often relies on the scientific method which aims for objectivity and attempts to avoid passing judgment. “The field of sociology, itself and sociological theory by extension is relatively new, both date back to 18th and 19th centuries. The drastic social change of that period such as industrialization, urbanization and the rise of democratic states caused particularly western thinkers to become aware of society. The oldest sociological theories deal with broad historical process relating to these changes. Since then sociological theories have come to encompass most aspects of society including communities, organizations and relationships. Sociological theory attempt to answer the following three questions, what is action? What is social order and what determines social change.” (Web). Sowfall’s The Beggars’ Strike conforms to the sociological theory since it gives a picture of modern society, highlighting societal problems such as poverty, religious hypocrisy, corruption and alienation in a realist vein. <br/><br/>1.5Review of Literature<br/><br/>This review examines Aminata Sowfall’s The Beggars’ Strike in line with what Critics have said about the novel.<br/><br/>Irene Udosoro says – Sowfall is very humorous, she knows how to throw her readers into fits of laughter. One of such case in The Beggars’ Strike is when Mour Ndiaye went to the beggars in their encampment to persuade them to come back to the city so he could perform his sacrifice in terms of characterization Sowfall’s characters are more or less carriers of her thought one way or the other they pullout of a debilitating social conditionor statusquo with a view to ushering in new values. Further more, she also opines that the award-wining novel presents a town, which critics believes is Dakar, the capital of Senegal, but which infact could be any major African city. The administrators in the said town claims the capital is defaced, fifty and unattractive because of the beggars who station themselves in strategic positions in town to beg for alms. (68, 70).<br/><br/>Patrick Naagbamton in his article “Our Beggars on the Rampage. Again” states that The Beggars’ Strike tells the story of Senegal an Islamic country entrapped between the influences of old and new values. In the novel, Fall protest against a cruel society, revolts against induced poverty and underdevelopment. He further says that the novel is a light political satire that is symbolic of the decay in our society. (Web).<br/><br/>According to Mark Beeman Sow Fall’s The Beggars’ Strike is an account of the fictional strike in a West African society. He argues that Aminata Sowfall presents the institution of begging from the point of view consistent with the structural functionalist sociological approach. (Web).<br/><br/>Emmanuel Sarpong Owusu-Ausah says the novel is a political satire setina muslim dominated African community. (Web)<br/><br/>Also, Martins Nicolls says The Beggars’ Strike is set in a city known only as the capital. Undoubtedly, Aminata Sowfall writes of her own experience and the novella is a long short or a short long story of only 99 pages full of wit and succinct dialogue. (Web)<br/><br/>Tessa asserts that the novel’s alternative tittle is the dregs of society and the story portrays how all elements including the dregs are vital part of humanity. (Web)<br/><br/>Shittu Kelani Okunade says Aminata Sow Fall has creatively demonstrated that leadership is the bane of our society in her novel The Beggars’ Strike and like a social realist that she is, she has made the beggars to show Mour Ndiaye that power belongs to God and that the masses are repository of such power because it is the masses that will give the leader the mandate through which he will exercise power. Furthermore he also observe that the author of the Beggars Strike seems to approve of begging which goes against the tenet of Islam as a religion does not support begging rather it preaches hard work. Sowfall, a Muslim adherent who hails from an Islamic society should have impressed it on her audience that despite. The fact that the state should take adequate care of its citizenry, the citizens should also work hard to get their daily bread rather than begging. (77,78).<br/><br/>Mike Edung states that The Beggars’ Strikeis a work of art actually communicated environmental health hazard among the other problems they pose in then society. The beggars’ strike has gone to present the idea that cultural belief and practices could seriously threaten the success of measures aimed at tackling this social problem. (57, 58).<br/><br/>Mbye B. Cham in his essay “Islam and the creative imagination in Senegal” states that The Beggars’ strikeis the story of Mour Ndiaye, Director of Public Health, whose efficient yet inhuman removal of beggars from the city in the interest of tourism thwarts his hopes of being appointed to the newly created post of vice-president of the country. The novel also details the disarray of individual like Mour Ndiaye who seesthe beggars’ strike (that is, their refusal to accept arms in the city as the bane of their selfish objectives. In exploring the divergence between the principle, Aminata Sowfall strongly indicts the society’s obsession with the material which fosters on psychology of dependence easily exploited by charlatans masquerading as deviant venerable marabouts. Deviation from the true altruism of zakat bastardizes it’s moral and philosophic intent leading to one of the beggars to lucidly observe that people no longer give out of the goodness of their heart but out of an instinct of self-preservation and improvement.

To the Eastward, Igbanke is bounded by Mbiri village in Delta state, to the West, it is bounded by Alishimien village also in Delta State; while to the North, it is bounded by Ekpon village in Edo state and finally to the South, bounded by Agbor town in Delta State.<br/><br/>1.3SIZE AND POPULATION <br/><br/>Igbanke community covers the geographical landmass of about 2,382 kilometre square (2382km2) and has the population of about 182,717 as at the last census (2006)<br/><br/>1.4LANGUAGE SPOKEN <br/><br/>Igbanke community speaks “Ika”. Ika is a language spoken by some parts of Delta e.g. Agbor and Igbanke in Edo state. Such towns and villages in Delta state and Igbanke in Edo State which speak Ika were formally known by the name “Bendel Ibo” until they were split into Delta and Edo state, which is why we now have speakers of “Ika” in Delta state and also in Edo state. <br/><br/>Description: <br/><br/>Ika is Igbo-like language with a blend of few other languages such as: Benin, Yoruba, Oredo, among others.<br/><br/>1.5RULERSHIP STRUCTURE<br/><br/>Igbanke community is ruled by rulers with such titles as: Obi, Eze and Enogie depending on the village. That is at the kingship level. <br/><br/>At the family level, Okiolor (meaning the ruler of the house), presides over the family and it is the oldest male member of the family that does this.<br/><br/>Again, in a particular quarter of the village, the oldest man in that area who is given the title “OGELE”., rules over the quarter; while the Obi, Eze and Enogie rule over the various component villages. <br/><br/>1.6SUPREMACY OF AUTHORITY <br/><br/>Igbanke community is subjected to the authority of the Oba of Benin. Hence the Obi, Eze and Enogie all pay homage to the Oba of Benin as the Supreme ruler. <br/><br/>1.7TRADITION <br/><br/>Nwobu festival (New yam festival): This is the festival that is celebrated by the entire Igbanke community to mark the beginning of new yam harvest and to appease the god of harvest called “Nwobu” <br/><br/>1.8RELIGION <br/><br/>Christianity and Traditionalism <br/><br/>The majority of Igbanke men and women are Christians while others are traditionalists.<br/><br/>1.9GREETING (VARIETIES) <br/><br/>The people of Igbanke have different ways of greeting according to the different villages. They are: <br/><br/>Alua-Welcome / well done <br/><br/>Laweze-Good morning <br/><br/>Elie-Good morning <br/><br/>Asisio-Good evening <br/><br/>Ndor’O-Thanks or well done <br/><br/>Yemeke-Thank you very much <br/><br/>Yarunka-You have done well <br/><br/>1.10TYPE OF MUSIC PLAYED <br/><br/>Agbara Music: This is a special form of traditional highlife music which involves the use of certain instruments like: gong, Maracres, rattles, Carved elephant tusk etc. <br/><br/>Members often wear beads and tie rappers. The instrumentalists often dress like title holders, thus wearing caps adorned with feathers.<br/><br/>1.11HOSPITALITY <br/><br/>The people of Igbanke community are very hospitable, loving and happy people. </p>\n\nSATIRE IN THE ORAL POETRY OF IGBANKE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SATIRE IN THE ORAL POETRY OF IGBANKE", "id": 98}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This study is a stylistic analysis of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie‟s novel</div> <div><em>Half Of A Yellow Sun, </em>which comprises four parts with a total numberof 37 chapters and 433 pages. The aim of this study is to identify the predominant stylistic devices used by the author in the novel and the effects achieved by using them. To achieve this aim, the researcher uses quantitative stylistic analysis which entails the counting and writing down the number of times each device occurs in the selected chapters of the novel. Review of related literature is also done. The researcher chooses this study because <em>Half Of A Yellow Sun</em> is</div> <div>Chimamanda‟s second and most voluminous novel; it is also an award winning novel and not much has been done on the stylistic analysis of the novel. 24 chapters are selected out of the 37 chapters and tables are used to represent the frequency of occurrence of the predominant stylistic devices used in the novel. Random selection sampling was used in parts two and four respectively to select six chapters from each while part one and part three are selected because they have six chapters each and need no random sampling. At the end, the predominant devices found out to be used by Chimamanda are Compound sentences followed by Compound complex sentences, Parenthetical expression, Italics, Transliteration and Code-mixing. It is then recommended that other young writers should adopt Chimamanda‟s style since the aim of studying style is to improve the vigour of one‟s writing.</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1</strong>      <strong>BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></div> <div>Language is a tool or a code system used for human communication.</div> <div>It is made up of sounds or graphic symbols, which users or speakers</div> <div>have accepted to use as units of communication.</div> <div>Language is a symbol system based on pure or arbitrary conventions infinitely extendable and modifiable according to the changing needs and conditions of the speakers.</div> <div>Robins (1985).</div> <div>According to Lyons (1970) Languages are:</div> <div>The principal systems of communication used by particular groups of human beings within the particular society (Linguistic community) of which they are members.</div> <div>The use of language is not restricted to only human beings but for</div> <div>the    purpose    of     this     study,    the     researcher    is     concentrating    on</div> <div>language used by human beings.

Misuse of government power for other purposes such as repression of political opponents and general police brutality is considered political corruption.

They also state that “we use language to convey information to others…, ask questions…, give command…, and express wishes” (173).  There are two specific media of using language: oral – which is by words of mouth; and written – which is a graphic representation of words on paper.</div> <div>It is in the use of language that style comes in. Style shows the difference between one piece of writing and the other. According to Adejare, “style is an ambiguous term…” (1). He further states that the term style means different things to different professions. Some examples are: to a psychologist, style is a form of behaviour, to the critic, style is individuality and to the linguist, it is the formal structures in function.</div>\n\nTHE USE OF STYLISTIC DEVICES IN THE NOVEL WIZARD OF THE CROW BY NGUGI WA THIONG’O<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE USE OF STYLISTIC DEVICES IN THE NOVEL WIZARD OF THE CROW BY NGUGI WA THIONG’O", "id": 102}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0     Introduction:</strong></div> <div>One of the most important differences between man and animal is man’s ability to speak and make others understand him. Language is only possible because within each society, people agree to understand a particular pattern of sound in a particular way. For instance, all English speaking countries understand the meaning of the word ‘water’. According to Akindele and Adegbije, language is:</div> <div><em>A human phenomenon that has form which can be described in terms of units of sound (phonemes), word, morphemes, phrases, sentences and paragraphs or discourse (1).</em></div> <p>This definition shows that language has often been identified as the most unique attribute of man. It is through language that human beings grasp and understand reality and transmit it from one generation to another. This view is buttressed by Blakar who asserts that “we actually live and behave in a world of language” (4). </p>\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF NIGERIAN PIDGIN ENGLISH ON STUDENTS OF TERTIARY INSTITUTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECTS OF NIGERIAN PIDGIN ENGLISH ON STUDENTS OF TERTIARY INSTITUTION", "id": 103}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div><em>The purpose of the research is to examine the shades of meaning that are associated with names and naming in Igala.

The study looked at the practice of naming among the Igala to find out the peculiar features that differentiate the practice from those of other Nigerian languages as well as the meanings that personal names have by reason of the society that confers these meanings and that gives them the status as names.

It was also found that Igala people generally believe that both the bearer of a name and the society that endorses his actions help to bring to reality the proclamation in the name. Some Igala names only possess descriptive meanings that are associated with the physical features of the child for example, Oboni – six fingers or toes, Enefu – white –skined. It was also found that Igala names connote certain things in the language which Igala people hold as the meaning of a name. These are, the personality of other people bearing the names, for example, „Obaje‟ of Ali</em></div> <div><em>Obaje, the immediate past and late traditional ruler of Igala land. It was also found that names are not given for the purpose of identity alone but also as a proclamation of the future of the bearer. Therefore, Igala personal names have shades of meaning that are tied to some socio-cultural variables.</em></div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0              </strong><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></div> <div>In spite of the cross cultural variations that characterize human societies, one phenomenon that is constant is the identity carved out for individuals through the names they bear. Names are a valuable source of information which indicates gender, birthplace, nationality, ethnicity, religion and position within a family and the lager society. Names are said to be the most meaningful lexicon in the vocabulary of any language and they are considered as an integral part of the language inventory, Mphande (2006). Thus, names are regarded as social emblems crafted for and attached to every human no matter their creed, sex, ethnic affiliation or nationality. Names and naming are considered a universal phenomenon as every culture has its own naming practices and the implication of such practices helps for the construction of identity for the individual.</div> <div>Naming practices vary considerably across the human race. As such names do not seem to make any meaning to the outsider in terms of their underlying cultural essence. For instance, a Nigerian, from the Igala speaking group, would wonder why an English man would bear such names as Stone, Grass, Fox and the likes. This is because among the Igala, names are given to reflect circumstantial factors relating to the birth of a child apart from having bearings with the lineage, religion, culture, vocation and values of the people. For instance, some names such as „<em>Agaba‟</em> are based on panegyric (praise) attributes, while some have to do with congenital circumstances such as</div> <div><em>„Ejima‟</em>(twins, male or female); and some names touch on thepeople‟sbelief in reincarnation, aschildren born after the demise of a grandfather or a grandmother could be named <em>„Ayegba‟.</em></div>\n\nSHADES OF MEANING ASSOCIATED WITH PERSONAL NAMES AND NAMING IN IGALA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SHADES OF MEANING ASSOCIATED WITH PERSONAL NAMES AND NAMING IN IGALA", "id": 104}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>The current crisis of ecology and environmental pollution have gripped the attention and aroused the concern of many people alive today. Studies show that our imprudent behaviour towards, and utilisation of, Nature have pushed the world into a crisis that has not only led to the gradual destruction of our ecology and its very capacity to sustain life, but also threatens our survival. There is also the socio-economic and psychological dimension to the crisis. Many countries and organisations have endeavoured to prevent the further spread of the ecological crisis but in spite of all efforts, the ecological crisis continues to mount. This realisation has prompted scholars in various disciplines to open up ecological/environmental dimensions to their respective disciplines as a way of contributing to environmental restoration. Literary scholars have also joined the debate through the field of ecocriticism. This study attempts to explore the ways in which Soyinka participates and responds to the current ecological challenges. Using ecocriticism as a theoretical tool, the study contends that Soyinka’s philosophy which informs his literary works is Nature sensitive and attempts to address the basic presupposition at the roots of the ecological crisis. The study reveals that the current ecological crisis is a disturbing manifestation of the dangers inherent in a change in the structure of the relationship between man and Nature which currently assumes that humans are separate from Nature. Through his literary works, we get to see an alternative worldview which shows that man exists in a cosmic totality and is a part of Nature. The study also suggests that a consciousness of this fact enables us to live in greater peace and harmony with Nature; thus the call for a reassessment of some of the basic premises upon which our current practices are grounded.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div>PREAMBLE</div> <div>Humans all over the world who have the privilege of witnessing the modern era are inheritors of a magnificent history. The period marks not only the economic ascent of some third world countries but also ecological disorder and violent processes of change that challenge humans at every level imaginable. The 20th/21st century man is the recipient of the legacy of industrialization and the subsequent modernity. Although extraordinary and important advances have been made through the age of industrialization, the accompanying changes in our lifestyles and social circumstances beyond doubt have led to significant changes in our outlook and understanding of ourselves in relation to the world which we inhabit. The prevailing outlook of the world especially after the age of industrialization is to perceive humans as somehow apart from ‘Nature’, as isolated individuals and discrete entities. This profound detachment from our surroundings has led to ecological crisis which is one of the greatest global problems of our time.</div> <div>The issue of ecology has therefore come to play a central intellectual role in our present age. It refers to the study of the relationships between humans, animals, plants and their setting. This relationship affirms the premise that people and the planet are interrelated. Unarguable however, ecological crisis is one of the most pressing and timely concerns at the turn of the 21st century. The word ‘environment’, in the light of our argument, adds a human dimension to the idea of ecology. It brings out the particular interaction of the human being with his or her habitat defined as the life sustaining surroundings that are given to the people and that are partially the result of their labour. Today the earth is experiencing a lot of ecological problems and it appears that the current ecological crisis is a reflection of man’s relationship with the natural world.</div>\n\nLITERATURE AND ECOLOGY: A STUDY OF WOLE SOYINKA’S A DANCE OF THE FORESTS AND THE BEATIFICATION OF AN AREA BOY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " LITERATURE AND ECOLOGY: A STUDY OF WOLE SOYINKA’S A DANCE OF THE FORESTS AND THE BEATIFICATION OF AN AREA BOY", "id": 105}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div><em>This study deploys Historicism as a literary discourse to the analysis of the selected writings of Isidore Okpewho, Elechi Amadi and Biyi Bandele. The study argues that Historicism emerged in the 19</em><em>th</em><em> Century as a method of investigating how texts of all kinds come to terms with their putative contexts. In spite of this, the application of Historicism to the analysis of texts on the internecine Nigerian Civil War and the reconstruction of the roles of Nigerians in the prosecution of the Second World War has been sparing. This thesis, therefore, demonstrates the applicability of the discourse of historicism to Isidore Okpewho‘s <strong>The Last Duty</strong>, Elechi Amadi‘s <strong>Sunset In Biafra</strong>, and Biyi Bandele‘s <strong>Burma Boy</strong>. It argues that, writing as historicists, these writers appropriate historical events, vicarious and personal experiences, and recorded or documented activities, all of which had hitherto passed into history as past. Having been refined and reconstituted, these variegated materials appear aesthetically resplendent as novels, as new experiences, conformable to the patterns of literary discourse. This study thus argues that, the novels that emerge from this social process are never complete without relating them to the minutest discourse that shapes them and to which the texts invariably respond. The thesis is divided into four chapters for proper articulation of the discourse. Chapter One is an introduction, which deals with (Conceptual Background, Statement of the Problem, Objectives of the Study, Justification, Scope, Methodology, Historicism and Literature, Assessment Criteria of poetics of historicism, and Literature Review. Chapter Two examines the Reconstruction of</em></div> <div><em>Nigerian Civil War in Isidore Okpewho‘s <strong>The Last Duty</strong> and Elechi Amadi‘s <strong>Sunset</strong> <strong>In Biafra</strong>.

Such treatises have often questioned the rationale behind the participation of Africans in a war that was not theirs. However, analysts of the international political system such as Louis J. Halle (1984) and K.J. Holsti (1972), have dubbed the Second World War as</div> <div>‗the war to end all wars‘ on accounts of its gruesome devastation. The depiction of the horrors of Second World War has further fuelled the resentment of African intellectuals such as Frantz Fanon, Aime Cessaire against the involvement of Africans.</div> <div>The two war situations provide the setting for writers to accentuate and articulate the devastation suffered by individuals and societies. As evidenced by historical records and literatures, the two wars occasioned physical suffering and psychological dislocation. However, despite these gruesome effects, the two wars serve as platforms for Africans and Nigerians respectively to reassess their conditions and the means by which they contribute to nation-building, world peace and progress.</div>\n\nHISTORICISM AS A LITERARY DISCOURSE: A STUDY OF ISIDORE OKPEWHO’S THE LAST DUTY, ELECHI AMADI’S SUNSET IN BIAFRA AND BIYI BANDELE’S BURMA BOY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " HISTORICISM AS A LITERARY DISCOURSE: A STUDY OF ISIDORE OKPEWHO’S THE LAST DUTY, ELECHI AMADI’S SUNSET IN BIAFRA AND BIYI BANDELE’S BURMA BOY", "id": 106}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Gender-based violence is not a new problem in the Nigerian society or other societies of the world. Violence against an individual on the basis of his /her gender is common place and is becoming endemic. Various studies have been carried out on what fosters gender violence and what makes it thrive with a view to putting an end to the problem. This has opened up various arguments as to how the problem can best be tackled. This study looks at the analyses of gender violence in the Nigerian novel and how Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie presents this problem in her novels; <em>Purple Hibiscus</em> (2003<em>)</em> and <em>Half of a Yellow Sun</em> (2006<em>).</em>This research interrogates how Adichie presents gender violence in these novels and how it affects the female gender. This study demonstrates that the texts selected by its thematic preoccupation and character delineation show culture and tradition as strong factors in sex differentiation, creation of gender identities and power sharing. It also shows that socially constructed roles and identities contribute to domestic and social violence in patriarchal societies. The study examines the themes, metaphors and symbolic representation of characters through the feminist perspective and Max Weber‘s power theory. This is because the analyses of gender relations must take into cognizance theories of a person‘s biological sex and gender identity and how it affects power sharing and the role of tradition, laws and the dominant ideology in the perpetuation of gender-based violence. Adichie‘s writings portray a strong call against gender violence and the treatment of women as commodities.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1</strong>    <strong>Sex, Gender and Violence.</strong></div> <div>In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to women writing in Africa. Consequently, gender studies dominated the literary scene and the representation of women in male authored works precipitated many critical debates. In other words, there has been more interest in examining the ways in which men behave, particularly in relation to women. Consequently, a literary canon was developed in which women writers give a re-presentation of the female experience by depicting a different image of women in their works in variance wih the earlier works by male authors.</div> <div>In furtherance of the argument on the importance of women writing about the female experience in literary texts, Aidoo (1996) submits that, ―Women writers write about women because when we wake up in the morning and look in the mirror we see women”. Many female writers try to bring into focus their femaleness/femininity and personal experiences in their narratives and in doing so highlight power differences between men and women. As a result, women scholars and activists have pioneered a literary canon built on sexual politics aimed at stamping gender and feminism into both criticism and theory. This is with the aim of replacing a tradition that is viewed as masculine and domineering by female critics like Showalter (1985). She maintains that gender has become an analytic category whether the concerns are representation of sexual difference, (re)shaping masculinity, building feminine values or exclusion of female voice from the literary canon.</div>\n\nGENDER VIOLENCE IN CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE’S PURPLE HIBISCUS AND HALF OF A YELLOW SUN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " GENDER VIOLENCE IN CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE’S PURPLE HIBISCUS AND HALF OF A YELLOW SUN", "id": 107}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <p>This study attempts an exploration of how unity and coherence through contradictions are achieved in Achebe‟s <em>Things Fall Apart</em>, Iyayi‟s <em>Violence</em> and Habila‟s <em>Measuring Time</em>. It is significant to state that the choice of these texts is informed by the need to comprehend how various generations of Nigerian writers have negotiated the contradictions, tensions, distortions and challenges, which have characterized the social, historical and political landscape of Nigeria. In addition, this study reflects the many dimensions of contradictions, distortions, tensions, injustice and disillusionment prevailing in the selected texts. It touches on character juxtaposition, comparative analysis, differences and interrelationships among structures in the texts. It however achieves unity and coherence by showing the connection of representations in the texts. For instance, Achebe‟s<em>Things Fall Apart</em> projects unity and coherence of the African culture as well as Western religion through distortions and tensions evident in the text. The writer‟s skilful portrayal of the two cultures, co-existing side by side, is one of such structuralists binarism achieved in this study. Iyayi explores unity and coherence by pointing out the insensitive nature of the government. He encourages the masses to unite in the struggle towards a desirable and functional social order in the country. Habila‟s <em>Measuring Time</em> depicts family disunity and its effect on the individual character. He achieves unity and coherence in the text, emphasizing on individual contributions towards the unity and development in the community. Structuralism as a reading method is appropriate. This is in relation to its distinctive features of binary oppositions, the primacy of the text and the generation of meaning through differences, etc. The deployment of these features enhances the understanding of the contradictions, distortions and tensions predominant in the texts. The study therefore establishes that in spite of these contradictions, complexities, disintegrations and distortions the texts display some levels of unity and coherence towards a desirable functional society.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0              </strong><strong>Introduction</strong></div> <div>The  study  attempts  to    explore  and  examine    how  literary  texts     achieve  unity  and</div> <div>coherence through contradictions in Chinua Achebe‟s <em>Things Fall Apart</em> (1958), Festus Iyayi‟s</div> <div><em>Violence </em>(1979), and Helon Habila‟s<em> Measuring Time </em>(2006).

The extent to which some office documents in IBB University, Lapai convey wrong information due to wrong use of auxiliary verbs were analysed in the office documents at IBB University, Lapai. The data used for this study were collected;thirty samples of office documents were obtained from the university Library, office of the Registrar, Student Affairs department as well as the following departments: Chemistry, Biology, Political Science, Public Administration, and Counselling Psychology provide the data for the study. The analytical procedure adopted for this study was based on the adoption of the systemic functional grammar and traditional grammar as the theoretical framework, those expressions that contain the use of auxiliary verbs from the office documents were analysed, and interpretations of the auxiliary verbs used to give insights into the difficulties faced by the writers in their use of auxiliary verbs in writing office documents. Their level of understanding of the interpersonal meaning of auxiliary verbs, most especially the non-modal and modal auxiliary verbs was also focused on for analysis. Eight and seven columns were provided to show non-modal and modal auxiliary verbs in the analysis table contained the serial numbers, the text for the analysis, the modality, the verb used, the verb intended, the interpersonal meaning, the writer‟s intention and reference in relation to the data for analysis. The data were analysed using the relevant aspects of eclectic theoretical framework of analysis, specifically, Halliday (1985) and Quirk et al (1972, 1982, 1985) interpersonal meaning of auxiliary verbs. In the course of the analysis of data, the study arrived at the following findings: The writers of office documents used for analysis seem to be selective in the application of English auxiliary verbs (modal verbs) such that they limit their choices to only those they are familiar with. There are exhibitions of indiscriminate use of some English auxiliary verbs like „has‟ and „have‟, will‟ and „would‟ and „can‟ and „could‟. The writers of the office documents use them as if they all have one meaning.The English auxiliary verbs „may‟, „might‟, ‟shall‟ and „should‟ have been scantily used by the writers of office documents in their writing. The writers of office documents experience difficulty in the application of English auxiliary verbs in their documents.The results of the analysis presented leads to the conclusion that all types of auxiliary verbs in English are problematic to some writers of office documents, but the modal auxiliary verbs that pose more problems to the writers of office documents than the primary auxiliary verbs. That is, they have limited knowledge on the uses and proper application of the rules guiding the auxiliary verbs usage. This study recommends that seminars, conferences and workshops should always be organized by the University for writers of office documents. Through attendance of such programmes writers of office documents could also gain more knowledge and even be exposed to those things which they do not know. In addition, writers of office documents should be encouraged to read widely so as to increase their knowledge in English language. That is, they should engage themselves with other educative materials outside their place of work, as these will   improve their spoken and written English.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>Language is very important to human beings. If life is to be lived to the fullest, language must be acquired, taught, learnt and studied well because life without language in modern civilization will be disastrous since each community is formed by the activity of a language (Bloomfield, 1945:13). Therefore, this research considers writing skills in the learning of language to be very essential. The ability to read and write is regarded as very important compared to the ability to speak (Stevense, 1974: 65) and writing is regarded as the most difficult of the language skills. Without writing, the human mind or thought could hardly be read or represented (Ong, 1993: 78)</div> <div>The use of auxiliary verbs by the writers of office documents is what this study is concerned with. Auxiliary verbs are of two kinds: non-modal and modal auxiliary verbs. Nesbitt, (2001) Non-modal verbs are different frommodal auxiliary verbs in the sense that the former can be used as lexical verbs. This means that they sometimes exist on their own, apart from functioning as helping verbs, while the latter cannot; they only perform the function of helping verbs in a sentence where they occur, which shows that they are as important as the lexical verbs. Therefore, any misuse or misinterpretation of the auxiliary verbs can bring about distortion of the meaning meant to be conveyedin office documents. It is interesting to note that proper use of these auxiliary verbs helps to make our writing faultless and to convey meaningful information.</div>\n\nA SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS OF THE USE OF AUXILIARY VERBS IN OFFICE DOCUMENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS OF THE USE OF AUXILIARY VERBS IN OFFICE DOCUMENTS", "id": 109}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This thesis titled “A Pragmatic Interpretation of Child Language: A Case Study of</div> <div>Telegraphic Speech has been carried out to determine the role of context in understanding language use by children or children‟s speech. Pragmatics is the study of speaker context meaning…. It is a component of linguistic study that goes beyond grammatical competence or well formed sentence to find meaning for a particular utterance or discourse exchange. It demonstrates the relationship between what speakers say and what they actually mean and the kind of effects they expect on the minds of the hearers. The motivation for the study emanates from the fact that children‟s utterances are not easily understood, especially when one is not familiar with the child‟s background and speech mannerisms. To a large extent, one needs to rely on context to effectively comprehend what a child says. The study sought to establish whether or not situations and circumstance of speech could be brought to bear in order to discern meaning in children‟s utterances: whether contextual meaning would be needed to complement semantics. The three media recording technique was employed to elicit utterances from Punpun, the case study child. The utterances were later interpreted pragmatically through the Systemic Functional Grammar‟s primary level of linguistic analysis: grammar and situation. Interpretations were also made using the various approaches through which pragmatic study is undertaken. The result of the interpretation shows that to a very great extent, context is indispensable, one cannot rely on grammar or literal meaning alone, one has also to make use of inferences, ask questions from those that understand the child better, take a thought, follow the context – both linguistic and non linguistics. All these point to the fact that an understanding of the child‟s general language situation aids in understanding his speech. The implication of this is that attention should be paid to what a child says, no one uses language without reason. Close attention should be paid to children and what they say, they don‟t speak in vacuum. Even if their speech is not matured as that of adult, yet, it is meaningful and they intend to do one thing or the other through whatever they say: Language is a tool for communication and a child utilizes this tool for various reasons. A child, at any time utilizes his linguistic knowledge to effectively pass across to his hearer, his intentions or desire while expecting the cooperation of the hearer who may need to rely on some background information to attend to him. This study also confirms the fact that children‟s utterances can be subjected to various pragmatic theories such as deixis, conversational analysis, cooperative principles, and so on.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0              </strong><strong>Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>Language is a peculiar gift of nature to man.  It is a central and complex</div> <div>phenomenon to all human beings. It stands at the centre of all human endeavours from the onset of human civilization. Language is the means of acquisition of all manner of knowledge and the tool by which morals, ethics and beliefs that govern human lives are passed on to the succeeding generations. It is the medium of thought and expression of human wants, desires, emotions, ideas, both positive and negative. Clark and Clark (1977) see language as a basic ingredient in virtually every social situation.</div> <div>However, no one is born an adult with full possession of this vehicle of thought and expression. Rather, a man is born an infant who passes through various stages of growth, which significantly impact on his use of language. A child does not also begin to speak automatically when the time comes for him to; he undergoes some stages before and after the onset of meaningful utterances with which he communicates with his environment. As a result of the inevitability of language in human life, parents look forward with great expectation to seeing their children utter the first words.</div> <div>As a special area of human life, psycholinguistics is the field of language studies that handles the issue of language acquisition. As Berry (1975) puts it, psycholinguistics is the discipline that discusses both psychological and linguistic issues in relation to each other. A central question in psycholinguistics is the issue of child language acquisition which could be perceived as the process by which a human..</div>\n\nA PRAGMATIC INTERPRETATION OF CHILD LANGUAGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A PRAGMATIC INTERPRETATION OF CHILD LANGUAGE", "id": 110}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This thesis titled “A Linguistic study of the „Nigerian-ness‟ of Nigerian Pidgin in Selected Literary Works” was embarked upon because of the resistance many Nigerians have to the use of Nigerian Pidgin (NP); they see it as foreign and a corruption of the English Language. Besides, many people, especially non-linguists feel that pidgin Englishes in West Africa are all the same no matter which country the Pidgin exists in. The researcher therefore sets out to investigate the lexical and syntactic features in NP to find out whether they are uniquely Nigerian. Two texts were used for analysis - an earlier text: <em>“Sozaboy”</em> by Ken Saro Wiwa (1985), and a contemporary one:<em>“Abuja na Kpangba an oda Puem-dem” </em>by Eriata Oribhabor (2011).Jowitt„s (1991)<strong>―</strong>Theory of Interlanguage”(whichinvolves borrowing) and Fishman‟s (1971) theory of the “Great Tradition” (which refers to the presence of a national symbol of identity) were useful in identifying various features of NP which are unique to Nigeria. The contributions of various Nigerian Languages to the vocabulary of NP were identified and it was noted that cultural influences from the indigenous languages are important constituents of NP. Our findings confirm the works of many researchers that NP is a language with a fixed and describable grammar like any other living language. Our work shows that NP is clearly distinct from the English Language, even though the bulk of its initial vocabulary was derived from the English Language. Our research also reveals that all things considered- vocabulary, syntax and other linguistic features- NP is uniquely Nigerian.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1.INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div>Many people have a predictable reaction to pidgin languages. They find them amusing, humorous or babyish. Yet research has shown that pidgins are real languages, not baby-talk; that they are and can be used for serious purposes, and that each stable or extended pidgin has a describable and distinctive linguistic structure. As a result the study of pidgins is not new. Decamp as cited in Hymes (1971) says that since the 1880‟s significant studies have appeared. The multilingual nature of many nations of the world has made pidgin come centre stage in linguistic study. Pidgins are seen as a solution to communication problems in multilingual settings. This is why they are called contact languages. Wherever they exist they are a lingua franca used among those who otherwise would not have been able to communicate with one another. They are nobody‟s language, yet used by all.</div>\n\nA LINGUISTIC STUDY OF THE NIGERIAN-NESS’ OF NIGERIAN PIDGIN IN SELECTED LITERARY WORKS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A LINGUISTIC STUDY OF THE NIGERIAN-NESS’ OF NIGERIAN PIDGIN IN SELECTED LITERARY WORKS", "id": 111}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>The boom in the use of social media in our time has no doubt brought a lot alteration in different language conventions. The early users of social media battled with space and time. Since social media language is in the borderline of speech and writing they created unusual acronyms and some other new words, like ‘u’, ur, ‘unfriend’ etc not only to communicate faster but also to maximize the limited space they have. Some linguists began to protest as these coinages were not only used within the circle of social media and informal writing but began to get into the mainstream of the English language. They see it as a threat to their language.</div> <div>This paper takes a different stand as it sees this trend as sign of language change. We know that people’s passion for their language has propelled them to constantly keep vigil to make sure it is protected. This has led to the creation of ‘Dos’ and ‘Don’ts’ which have continued to hinder the operations of the language. But language change is so subtle that the users hardly realize when it occurs. This shows that they do not consciously bring this change. Though they are the drivers of this change, they do not know how it happens. Any language that finally ends up in the cage of ‘dos’ and ‘don’ts’ has fallen into the danger list and may be forgotten soon.</div> <div>We should not lose sight of the fact that both the rigidity and the flexibility of a language are domiciled in the language community, and that calls to mind what Noam Chomsky calls <em>langue</em>. Language tilts towards death any time linguists, in the spirit of protecting theirlanguage, try to stop the language users from exploring their creativity in the language. While Chapter one is the general introductory overview, chapter two gives the conceptual account of Language Change and reviews the literature in this area till date. Being a linguistic study, chapter three presents the nature of the data involved in this study and shows how the data</div> </div> <p><br/></p> <div>were collected and the method and processes involved in their analysis. Chapter four presents the results and analyses them. The summary and the conclusions of the study are made in chapter five.</div> <div>From our findings it is evident that the language of social media is not a threat to the English language. It is, therefore, pertinent that linguists begin to see the language of social media as an agent of linguistic revolution.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div>1<strong>.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></div> <div>Social media is the social interaction among people in which they create, share or exchange information and ideas in virtual communities and networks. In Andreas Kaplan and Michael Haenlein’s definition, social media is ‘a group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content’ <em>(para 1)</em></div> <div>Social Media is the future of communication, a countless array of internet-based tools and platforms that increase and enhance the sharing of information. This new form of media makes the transfer of text, photos, audio, video, and information in general increasingly fluid among internet users. Social media has relevance not only for regular internet users, but for business as well. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Whatsapp have created online communities where people can share as much or as little personal information as they desire with other members. The result is an enormous amount of information that can be easily shared, searched, promoted, disputed, and created.</div> <div>Social Bookmarking tools and news sites such as Digg, Delicious, reddit, and countless others make finding specific information, images, or websites increasingly simple by assigning or “tagging” individual sites with searchable key words.</div>\n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF THE LANGUAGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE INFLUENCE OF THE LANGUAGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE", "id": 112}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1             </strong><strong>Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>Language  is a  unique attribute  of  humans,  which  is  used as a  chief  medium  of</div> <div>communication, for building interpersonal relationships, exchange of ideas and passing of information. Martinet A. defines it as “a formidable instrument of communication... by which human experience is analysed...” (20). As a system of communication, it does not exist in a vacuum, but operates in a context of situation. It is these contexts which determine the variations in language that we call register. Language is very crucial for human survival and existence, because it is the most important, and effective tool for communication. It is the bond that holds societies and nations together. The primacy of language cuts across all facets of human life: government, education, health, religion, politics, and so on. Gideon S. Omachonu puts it as the “facilitator of human essence for all inventions and achievements ever recorded in human existence have their roots in language as a veritable instrument of thought and an indispensable channel of communication” (1).</div> <p>Since this research work analyzes the pragmatics of selected political speeches of President Muhammadu Buhari, it is important for us to understand the relationship that exists between language and politics. In doing this therefore, we subscribe to the view made by Anthony Paul Chilton when he states that politics is “the art of governance and power” while language is “the universal capacity of humans in all societies to communicate” (20). Politics is a struggle for power in order to put certain political, economic and social ideas into practice (Faith Bayram 23). It is concerned with power to make decisions, control resources, and control other people’s behaviour and, at times to control their values. In this process, language plays a crucial role, for every political action is prepared, accompanied, influenced and played by language. </p>\n\nPRAGMATIC ANALYSIS OF SELECTED POLITICAL SPEECHES OF PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PRAGMATIC ANALYSIS OF SELECTED POLITICAL SPEECHES OF PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI", "id": 113}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Language is an indispensible characteristic of every human society.

Of all the gifts God has given to human beings, none is as unique as language. The language we speak tells exactly where a particular person comes from.</div> <div>It is in this realization that Ngonebu (1) states that, “language is one of the most significant features of human kind. There is nothing human beings can do without the function of one form of language or the other. The fact that human being exists and lives together depends purely on the existence of language.” Ngonebu had rightly observed that language is very crucial to human existence. It is very important to note here that if language is removed from any society, such society is no longer alive. If one has language, one has all things because it is the determiner of happiness or sadness of someone.</div>\n\nLANGUAGE AND THE QUEST FOR IDENTITY: A STUDY OF CHINUA ACHEBE’S THINGS FALL APART AND CHIMAMANDA ADICHIE’S AMERICANAH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " LANGUAGE AND THE QUEST FOR IDENTITY: A STUDY OF CHINUA ACHEBE’S THINGS FALL APART AND CHIMAMANDA ADICHIE’S AMERICANAH", "id": 114}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div><em>The use of Pidgin English in the Nigerian context has gone beyond verbal communication to become more of a mode of behaviour as its expression has moved from informal conversation to formal situations. This above scenario necessitated this study which investigates the effects of Pidgin English on Standard English usage among selected secondary schools in Eha-Amufu in Isi-Uzo L. G. A. Using the descriptive research design and the questionnaire as the research instruments, data were collected from a sample of 200 students and 35 teachers from four selected secondary schools in Eha-Amufu. Also, copies of the written essays of the selected students were analysed to complement results from the questionnaire. Findings reveal that the use of Pidgin English is traceable to the students’ homes. However, the finding that students do not use Pidgin English in their written essays were largely contradicted by the avalanche of Pidgin English usage found in the written essays of the students which also reveal an adverse effect of Pidgin on Standard English both in spelling and contextual usage. The researcher, therefore, concludes that the use of Pidgin English creates a form of identity among students and hence recommends that constant monitoring and evaluation of language use in teaching and learning in Nigeria will help check the trend of usage of Pidgin English which will guide policy making aimed at addressing this ugly trend.</em></div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div>1.1 <strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></div> <div>Language in multilingual societies such as Nigeria has always been a matter of concern to educators, educational planners and parents especially with regard to its appropriate use in communication.

Although Nigeria is believed to have more than four hundred (400) languages with over two hundred and fifty (250) ethnic groups, (Emenanjo, 73), the English language is the only language used for all forms of official transaction.

The study adopted a contrastive analysis theory cum contrastive analysis hypothesis which is an area of linguistic studies that deals with the scientific study of two or more languages so as to make critical, howbeit, pedagogical comments on their areas of divergence or convergence. The study discusses and compares some morphological processes such as back-formation, blending alternation, affixation, compounding, clipping, coinage, reduplication, acronym, and borrowing in both languages using the descriptive analysis method. The analyses were based on Kano dialect of Hausa language which is the standard Hausa dialect. From the analyses, it was discovered that, morphology which is the study of grammatical rules of word structures in any language operates in both languages with significant areas of differences and similarities; that English and Hausa use some processes to create some words; that affixation is one of the processes found in both English and Hausa; that some of the processes discussed in this study could be found in one and not in other language; that Hausa language interferes significantly on the teaching and learning of English as a second language. This research work can be used as a source of information or rather reference material to subsequent studies in English and Hausa languages in various components of linguistic structures. It would also provide a premise for the study and analysis of morphological processes in English and Hausa. Recommendations on how to overcome the pedagogical problems were offered and conclusion drawn.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>Chapter One</strong></div> <div><strong>Introduction</strong></div> <div><strong>5.4             </strong><strong>Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>Language, an indispensable tool for human communication, is studied in divergent</div> <div>ways. Irrespective of the area in which it is being studied, the most central to language and relevant to human communication is the word. Words play an integral role in the human ability to use language with an infinite capacity of expressions. As a result of this, word is involved in almost all the levels of linguistic studies and analysis. Words are generally classified into phonological, grammatical, morph syntactic, content and function words.</div> <div>It is important to note that every word in the lexicon of a native speaker is encoded with phonological, syntactic, semantic and, above all, morphological information. A native speaker of a language knows how to structure the words of the speaker in accordance with the morphological rules of the language, and also how to order the sequence of words correctly to form expressions or sentences in accordance with syntactic rules. The aspect of linguistics which deals with words and their entire upshots is morphology. The goal of every morphological study, therefore, is to discover and make explicit the rules or principles, patterns, processes and systems that underlie the morphological processes in a language. It is possible, for instance, to break down Hausa word “budurwai” (girls) into smaller structural units: “budurwai” = “budurwa” + “i\". The analysis here shows that “budurwai” (girls) can be broken down into two parts. This includes the first part “budurwa”, which refers to something in the world (+ young + female + human) and the second part “i” indicates a grammatical category of a number specifying plural. The same approach can easily be applied to the word “faraa” (started), which can be analyzed thus: “Faraa = ‘fara’ (start) + ‘a’, equivalent to English past tense morpheme (-ed). </div>\n\nCOMPARATIVE STUDY OF MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN ENGLISH AND HAUSA LANGUAGES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMPARATIVE STUDY OF MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN ENGLISH AND HAUSA LANGUAGES", "id": 116}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Language is a potent weapon through which ideas, thoughts, opinions, messages and information generally are exchanged between groups of people to ensure inter-personal relationship. It is a symbol of people‟s identity and a means of identifying people‟s value system. This is particularly true of proverbs which are generally believed to be words of wisdom, usually didactic, memorisable and therefore passed down easily from one generation to another. Proverbs are context dependent and culture specific. Since proverbs cannot exist outside of the context of use, pragmatics; the study of contextual meaning, is adopted as the tool of the study. To understand the prevailing context of the selected proverbs, the socio-cultural background and orientation of a group of language users are considered. This implies that culture occupies a vintage position in the study of proverbs in order to explore their contextual meaning and didactic significance. However, cultural diversity of language users, (particularly proverb users) has yet to be given adequate consideration in researches on proverbs. Therefore, the thrust of this study is to deploy the use of a linguistic theory for the analysis of literary texts with the aim of identifying the moral significance of the selected proverbs. One hundred proverbs from four works of Ola Rotimi, are analysed using a descriptive research approach based on modified version of Lawal‟s (1997) pragmatic model. The findings reveal the need for the primary and secondary levels of meaning, the existence of direct and indirect illocutionary acts, and the significance of four context/competence variables out of the six propounded by Lawal. The findings further affirm Malinowski‟s distinction between situational context and cultural context as a basis of meaning explication in pragmatics. In conclusion, the study reveals that selected proverbs perform certain didactic functions and that the functions are revealed through a careful exploration of the prevailing context.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>Introduction</strong></div> <div>This chapter is concerned with the background to the study, statement of the problem, research questions, aim and objectives of the study, justification for the study, scope of the study, methodology and organisation of the study.

Language and social reality are strictly tied together, hence language is said to be culturally transmitted (Heath, 2003). This implies that changes in produce change in language because peoples‟ cultural orientation, attitude, belief, disposition, worldview and social value among others are reflected in their language (including proverbs). Proverbs are products of human experiences and mostly culture specific. They (proverbs) are concise in structure, often known by heart, loaded with philosophical meaning and passed from one generation to another.</div> <div>The role of proverbs in societies where discourse is laced with assorted forms of proverbs for different communicative functions cannot be over emphasized. Proverb is one of the means through which the cultural background of a group of people could be known. It reveals a people‟s historical development, worldview and attitude. Proverb is a special way by which social behaviour is controlled in order to ensure mutual intelligibility among the interlocutors. Proverbs provide hard hitting messages in a profound way rather than in a nasty or demoralizing manner. They pass very weighty messages in a mild or gentle way. </div>\n\nA PRAGMATIC ANALYSIS OF PROVERBS IN SELECTED WORKS OF OLA ROTIMI<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A PRAGMATIC ANALYSIS OF PROVERBS IN SELECTED WORKS OF OLA ROTIMI", "id": 117}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Previous studies on campaign speeches in Nigeria have tended to be a description and analysis of style, innovative and persuasive strategies of politicians, and manipulation of linguistic structures to champion individual interest in presidential election campaign speeches. There is the need to investigate how texts reproduce and sustain power and unequal power relations in campaign texts and how ideological or political undertone was projected in gubernatorial campaign speeches. The study uses Critical Discourse Analysis to examine the role of language in creating and sustaining power relations as well as ideological structures in South-Western Nigeria. These power relations are created, enacted and legitimated by the application of certain linguistic devices. The researcher attempts to unravel hidden meanings and connotations of power in selected gubernatorial campaign speeches in South-Western zone namely: Ekiti, Lagos, Ondo and Osun states. The data for the study were purposively sampled from gubernatorial campaign speeches made in the four states during the 4th republic precisely 2007 - 2014. A total of eight speeches (two from each gubernatorial candidate of Ekiti, Lagos, Ondo and Osun state) were sampled and analyzed. The study drew from Fairclough‟s (2001) Members‟ Resources (MR), Van Dijk‟s socio-cognitive approach (2004), and principles from Halliday‟s system of mood and modality as theoretical bases. The findings show that the South-Western gubernatorial aspirants deployed language as a strategy of domination and supremacy by exploiting lexical items and strong imperatives which allow them to impose their views on others. They created, by means of their campaign texts, asymmetrical power relations of privileged „we‟ and less privileged „others‟. Another form of dominance or power abuse is mind control which is also a form of manipulation through interference with processes of understanding the formation of biased mental models and social representations. This is mainly achieved through persuasion, coercion, and information- giving strategies. Thus, the candidates employ certain declaratives to neutralize the asymmetrical power relations that exist between them and the electorate when they want to liberalise power. This, usually, had the effect of reducing the authority of the candidate. The aspirants also used discourse structures that have implications for ideology as weapons of persuasion and pleading, positive self-representation of „us‟ and negative other representation of „them‟, negotiation and personality projection. Additionally, the findings also reflect figurative expressions that are implicitly used to project different ideological positions of the aspirants. The figurative expressions predominantly used were metaphor, mainly metaphor of religion, time, journey, sports, violence and animal innovations which were used to project positive ideology of self and negative ideology of the other. There were also instances of linguistic items like idiomatic expressions, parallel structures, hyperbolic expressions and rhetorical devices used to unfold hidden ideological meanings. In the sampled data, there are some linguistic items which need to be drawn from the speakers‟ cognition, and this can be accounted for by Fairclough‟s Members‟</div> <div>Resources. Based on these findings, the researcher recommends that text producers and consumers should be aware of the hidden ideologies and coercive elements in</div> <div>texts, and this will inspire them on how to use and accept certain discursive practices. Such empowerment is important to enable the people to determine the true interests of the speeches and for them to be more active and less gullible citizens. The study, therefore, concludes that in actual sense, the plethora of texts produced, distributed and consumed in the 2007-2014 gubernatorial electioneering campaigns in the South-Western Nigeria not only promoted asymmetrical power relations, they also produced, reproduced, legitimized and maintained social structures that sustain domination.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>Background of the Study</strong></div> <div>Discourse is all around us, whether we are looking at the esoteric language of a scholarly report, the imperative appeals to consumerism in advertising or the exchange of words performed in a dialogue. In all of these instances of discourse, there are certain underlying rules, and each of these is in turn dependent on the social context in which the discourse takes place. A dialogue between a parent and a child is different from a political speech, in terms of ideology, power relations and usage of words. Election campaigns and other types of political discourse are all fields of ideological battles which can be subjected to Critical Discourse Analysis. This is not surprising because, as van Dijk (11) says, it is eminently here that different and opposed groups, powers, struggles and interests are at stake. In order to be able to compete, political groups need to be ideologically conscious and organized. Discourse analysis challenges us to move from seeing language as abstract to seeing our words as having meaning in a particular historical, social and political condition. Our words are politicized, even if we are not aware of it, because they carry the power that reflects the interest of those who speak. Discourses can also be used for an assertion of power and knowledge, and they can be used for resistance and critique. One such occasion where discourse can be used to assert, sustain and legitimize power is campaign speeches.</div>\n\nCRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS OF SELECTED POLITICAL CAMPAIGN SPEECHES OF GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES IN SOUTH-WESTERN NIGERIA 2007-2014<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS OF SELECTED POLITICAL CAMPAIGN SPEECHES OF GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES IN SOUTH-WESTERN NIGERIA 2007-2014", "id": 118}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1 Background to the Study……………….…………………………………………………….1</p> <p>1.1.1 Obi Ezekwesili………………………………………………………………………………2</p> <p>1.1.2 Abike Dabiri………………………………………………………………………………...4</p> <p>1.2 Statement of the Problem……………………………………………………………………4</p> <p>1.3 Aim and Objectives of the Study…………………………………………………………..5</p> <p>1.4 Research Questions …………………….…………………………………………………..5</p> <p>1.5 Scope and Limitation of the Study ………….………………………………………………6</p> <p>1.6 Methodology…………………………………………………………………………………6</p> <p>1.6.1 Research Design…….…………………………………………………………………….6</p> <p>1.6.2 Sampling and Sampling Procedures………………………………………………………7</p> <p>1.7 Significance of Study……………………………………………………………………….7</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE</strong></p> <p>2.0 Introduction………………………………………………………………………………….8</p> <p>2.1.

It adopts some conceptual framework such as identity and role, ideology, power and institution, discourse of prejudice, language use etcetera; while socio-cognitive and discourse–historical approaches are adopted as theoretical frameworks. The data used are randomly selected speeches by the two prominent Nigerian women. Findings reveal among other things that: the two Nigerian women leaders studied have feminist tendencies as demonstrated in their various speeches; the sociopolitical statuses of the two women, at every point in time, determine their use of language; their speeches are also conditioned by the institutions they represent at every point in time; apart from their feminist ideologies, they also demonstrated concerns at various levels for the welfare of the country in their speeches such as advocacy for a dignified Nigeria; and the idea of naturalization can be deduced from their speeches as they try to identify with the suffering masses. The study’s contribution to knowledge is simply a marriage of CDA as a linguistic field with feminism. Although, this study is not the first of its kind, as far as this researcher’s knowledge is concerned, it may be the first to consider the data used (that is Obi Ezekwesili and Abike Dabiri’s speeches).</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1  </strong><strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The major thrust of this dissertation is to analyze the speeches of two of Nigeria’s frontline women, Obi Ezekwesili and Abike Dabiri from the Critical Discourse Analysis perspective. The study is motivated by the fact that ‘language as simple as the term seems is not only a means of describing reality but plays significant roles in determining and shaping reality and the world around us’ (Reponen 4). This reality has been observed in the speeches of these women through their language use; hence, there is need to study them. And, the best linguistic tool that suits such a study, in this researcher’s own opinion, is critical discourse analysis because of the relationship between language and discourse. Fairclough (18-19) defines ‘language use’ as “socially determined”, and ‘Discourse’ as “language as a form of social practice”. According to him, language does not exist outside of society but is a part of it. When people use language, they follow certain norms and rules that have been socially determined, and language use affects, for example, people’s world views and reality (Fairclough19). He adds that ‘language’ is a social process, in which both the production and interpretation are included. He continues in explaining that language is a social practice that is conditioned by the context, which includes not only the immediate situation of language use but also society. (19-20)</p> <p>Fairclough (21) further explains that discourse can then be seen to consist of three dimensions: the text itself (written or spoken), the processes of its production and interpretation and the social conditions relating to its production and interpretations. He also says that when we produce and interpret language, we draw upon the knowledge which is already in our heads, for example, about language, values and beliefs. According to him, this knowledge is socially constructed, dependent on our social relations and it is socially transmitted. Because of this social nature, language is closely related to power and ideologies, making it possible to dominate other people and shape societies (Fairclough in Reponen 5). In line with the above assertion by Fairclough, Obi Ezekwesili and Abike Dabiri, as a result of their statuses have voiced their knowledge and opinion of the Nigerian society in many issues especially as they affect the women and children. </p> <p>In addition, Critical Discourse Analysis (henceforth CDA), like a coroner’s office where a dead body, unable to speak, is dissected for the purpose of discovering the cause of death, is the right place to perform an autopsy on the discourse, spoken or written, in order to unveil the underlying  ideologies in it. CDA, as a method of analysis in Discourse, tries to focus on relations between ways of talking and ways of thinking, and highlights “the traces of cultural and ideological meaning in spoken and written texts” (O’Halloran1,946). The ideologies behind the speeches by Obi Ezekwesili and Abike Dabiri are, therefore, relevant for this study.</p> <p><strong>1.1.1    </strong><strong>Obi Ezekwesili</strong></p> <p>Dr. Obiageli ‘Oby’ Ezekwesili is a Senior Economic Advisor at Open Society Foundations (OSF), a group founded by investor and philanthropist, George Soros. She also jointly serves as Senior Economic Advisor for Africa Economic Development Policy Initiative (AEDPI), a program of the Open Society Foundations. In these roles, she advises nine reform-committed African heads of state including Paul Kagame of Rwanda and Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia. Before joining OSF, she was Vice President of the World Bank (Africa Region) in Washington, D.C., responsible for operations in 48 countries and a lending portfolio of nearly $40 billion. From 2002 to 2007, Ezekwesili worked for the federal government of Nigeria as Minister of Education, Minister of Solid Minerals, head of the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence Unit as well as Chairperson of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) where she led the first ever national implementation of the global standards and principles of transparency in the oil, gas and mining sectors. She was a key member of President Olusegun Obasanjo’s Economic Team. Ezekwesili is a founding Director of Transparency International, representing Africa at the global anti-corruption body based in Berlin.</p> <p><strong>1.1.2    </strong><strong>Abike Dabiri</strong></p> <p>Hon. Abike Kafayat Oluwatoyin Dabiri Erewa (Nee Erogbogbo) was Born On 10th October 1962 at Ikorodu Lagos state, Nigeria. She is also an alumnus of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ife, University of Lagos and Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, USA. She is a three term member of Nigeria’s lower chamber (House of Representatives) from Lagos state. During her period in the house, she chaired the Diaspora committee. She is the current Senior Special Adviser on Foreign affairs and Diaspora to President Muhammadu Buhari.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>This study is a critical discourse analysis of speeches by Obi Ezekwesili and Abike Dabiri. It is a study that dove tailed into feminism and other social issues as observed from their various speeches at various social functions. Since CDA is interested in the WHO of the speaker and WHAT of the discourse (message), the study has attributed some importance to these speeches because of the personality of the speakers and the significance of their messages for societal development. Thus, the Power and Ideology embedded in these speeches as a result of the psychological disposition of the speakers are to be unveiled.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Aim and Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>This research, aims at unveiling the embedded ideologies in the speeches of two prominent Nigerian women (Ezekwesili and Dabiri). This will been achieved through the objectives below:</p> <p>i.                   By uncovering the linguistic devices or expressions used to cover their psychological input in these utterances<strong>.</strong></p> <p>ii.                 By establishing reasons why they have spoken the way they did at every point in time.</p> <p>iii.              By establishing the nexus between their social status at the time of making the utterances and the significance of the events where the speeches were delivered; since, they both served in different capacities as stakeholders in nation building.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong> Research Questions </strong></p> <p>i.                   What are the linguistic devices or expressions used to cover the psychological input in the speakers’ utterances?</p> <p>ii.                 What is or are the reason (s) why they have spoken the way they did at every point in time?</p> <p>iii.              What is the relationship between their office at the time of these speeches and the significance of the events that shaped their speeches?</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong> Scope and Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>The work covers solely the speeches of two out of many Nigerian women who have contributed immensely to the social, political and economic development of the country. The women so selected are Obi Ezekwesili and Abike Dabiri. Ezekwesili’s speeches that were selected for the study cover education, economy and feminism. For Dabiri, the study has selected her speeches in relation to Nigerians in the diaspora, political liberation for women and education.</p> <p>No effort crowned with success is without challenge (s). The unavailability of the target women (Obi Ezekwesili and Abike Dabiri) as a result of their daily official commitment hindered the designed interview structured for this research; therefore, the study relies solely on their written speeches as delivered in different fora for want of time.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong><strong> Methodology</strong></p> <p><strong>1.6.1.  </strong><strong>Research Design </strong></p> <p>The study is content analysis relying on secondary data. The data for analysis were Obi Ezekwesili’s and Abike Dabiri’s written speeches delivered at different events. The data for review of literature were scholar’s opinions, positions, assertions, arguments, explanations etcetera as reflected and contained in text books, handbooks, unpublished projects and articles in journals.</p> <p><strong>1.6.2.  </strong><strong>Sample and Sampling Procedure</strong></p> <p>The data samples were randomly selected out of many speeches made by the two women. The choice of selecting Obi Ezekwesili’s and Abike Dabiri’s speeches was not because they are the most out spoken women in Nigeria or Africa but for their experience in private and public services respectively and their political involvement over time.  Also, their incessant comments about trending issues, in order to make their own contributions in nation building as stakeholders necessitated this choice. Out of the many speeches delivered at various fora by both women, sampled speeches that relate to education, feminism, economy, diaspora and politics became relevant for this study. The speeches were partly collected from the internet and Women Development Centre, central area, Abuja. For the literature review, some materials were from the library and others from the internet.  </p> <p><strong>1.7</strong><strong> Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>Future researchers (especially women) will find this study informative, resourceful and encouraging. The work will also be resourceful for students and language teachers especially in gender discourse and critical discourse analysis.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p><strong>2.0 Introduction</strong></p> <p>This chapter presents and review some conceptual frame works to the subject of study. Some of the conceptual frame works in this study include: discourse and critical discourse analysis, text, context and discourse and feminist critical discourse analysis and so on. The chapter also considers the theoretical framework and adopts social cognitive and discourse historical approaches as they are more suitable to the current study.</p> <p><strong>2.1. Discourse and Critical Discourse Analysis</strong></p> <p>Discourse, no doubt, encompasses all aspects of social relation and practices. It is a broad term with various definitions and it “integrates a whole palette of meanings” (Titscher, 42 in Bayram, 26), covering a large area from linguistics, through sociology, philosophy and other disciplines.  According to Fairclough (24) ‘discourse’ refers to “the whole process of interaction of which a text is just a part”. As there are pervasive ways of experiencing the world, ‘discourse’ refers to expressing oneself using words. ‘Discourses’ can be used for asserting power and knowledge, and for resistance and critique. The speaker expresses his/her ideological content in texts as does the linguistic form of the text. That is, the selection or choice of a linguistic form may not be a live process for the individual speaker, but the discourse will be a reproduction of that previously learned discourse. Texts are selected and organized in syntactic forms whose \"content-structure\" reflects the ideological organization of a particular area of social life (Dellinger, 19 in Bayram, 27).</p> <p>Fairclough and Wodak (npn), say discourse is socially constituted and socially shaped, linking a chain of texts, reacting to, drawing in, and transforming other texts. The ideological effects of discursive practices may help produce and reproduce unequal power relations through the representation of actors and events and allow assumptions to go unaddressed as mere common sense. Critical Discourse Analysis (henceforth) CDA, therefore, provides a lens to make visible the opaque aspects of discourse, the power relations and ideology underlying language use. Fowler (62), states that, the “performative power” of language is in its role as a “reality-creating social practice.”  Discourse works to bring into being that which it describes (Fairclough, 2), particularly in relation to groups that share a system of beliefs about reality (Fowler, 63). According to Fairclough (8), texts are elements of social events and are involved in the process of “constituting the social identities of the participants in the events of which they are a part.”  Texts have “causal effects upon, and contribute to changes in, people (beliefs, attitudes, etc.), actions, social relations, and the material world.”  These effects are mediated by meaning-making and play a role in “inculcating and sustaining or changing ideologies” (Fairclough 9). Here, ideologies are taken to mean “representations of aspects of the world which can be shown to contribute to establishing, maintaining and changing social relations of power, domination and exploitation.” (9) Texts are good indicators of social processes, so textual analysis can provide insights into social change. Texts, and particularly media texts, are sites of contestation. They may reflect social control and domination and, therefore, work to reproduce inequity. They may reflect negotiation and resistance as well (Fairclough, 202). Hybridity in texts highlights the potential for texts to include discourses that are reproductive and/or productive, discourses and counter discourses, in the same text. In addition, CDA also requires attentiveness to the potential of discourses and practices of resistance to ultimately contribute to reproductive effects. The relations playing out between voices in public political discourse may take the form of a “conversation” or “dialogue,” in which discourses provoke responses and change over time (Fairclough, 202). In addition to text, the elements of discourse include interactions, the processes of production and interpretation of texts, as well as context, the social conditions of production and interpretation (Fairclough, npn).</p> <p>CDA seeks to further understand power relations and ideological processes in discourse. It offers a “critical perspective on unequal social arrangements sustained through language use, with the goals of social transformation and emancipation” (Lazar 1).</p> <p>It should be noted at this juncture that Critical Discourse Analysis is synonymously used with Critical Linguistics (CL). CDA theory derives from different theoretical backgrounds such as Rhetoric, Text linguistics, Anthropology, Philosophy, Socio-Psychology, Cognitive Science, Literary Studies and Sociolinguistics, as well as in Applied Linguistics and Pragmatics (Wodak et. al.1). CDA is complex and challenging while it requires a multidisciplinary, multi methodological approaches by which the obscure relation between speech, social cognition, power, society and culture is revealed, going beyond mere observation, description and explanation (Fairclough in Van Dijk, 5). Due to the vast heterogeneity of theoretical approaches and methodology, the key practitioners of CDA suggest to define it as a “school” or “paradigm” (Wodak et al. 5). Scholars have offered series of definitions out of which are: </p> <p>CDA sees discourse<em>,</em> language use in speech and writing as a form of social practice. Describing discourse as social practice implies a dialectical relationship between a particular discursive event and the situation(s), institution(s) and social structure(s), which frame it: … The discursive event is shaped by them, but it also shapes them. That is, discourse is socially constitutive as well as socially conditioned. It constitutes situations, objects of knowledge, and the social identities of and relationships between people and groups of people (Fairclough and Wodak, in Wodak et. al. 5).</p> <p>Also, Fairclough says: </p> <p>By CDA, I mean discourse analysis which aims to systematically explore often opaque relationships of causality and determine between: (a) discursive practices, events and texts, (b) wider social and cultural structures, relations, and processes; to investigate how such practices, events and texts arise out of and are ideologically shaped by relations of power and struggles over power; and to explore how the opacity of these relationships between discourse and society is itself a factor securing power and hegemony. (132-133)</p> <p>Therefore, CDA views discourse as a means to structure social life. It scrutinizes visible and opaque structural relationships of dominance, discrimination, power and control that occur in discourse, aiming at the critical exploration of social structuring revealed in the use of language (Wodak 10). Among the various ideologies that CDA tries to unearth, the issue of gender (in)equality is always recurrent as society continues to define and redefine the roles of men and women. This aspect of CDA is Feminist Critical Discourse Analysis (FCDA). </p> <p><strong>2.2 Feminist Critical Discourse Analysis (FCDA) and Feminist Post Structuralist Discourse Analysis (FPDA) </strong></p> <p>According to Lazar ( 2), “feminist critical discourse analysis (FCDA), like CDA examines the “complex and subtle ways in which taken-for-granted social assumptions and hegemonic power relations are discursively produced, perpetuated, negotiated and challenged.” FCDA looks carefully at the complex workings of power and ideology in discourse, but focuses particularly on the way these contribute to sustaining a hierarchically gendered social order. Establishing a feminist politics of articulation within CDA is necessary to theorize and analyze the nature of gender in social practices.</p> <p>The term “gender,” as explained by Lazar (3) functions as an interpretive category that enables social actors to make sense of and structure their social practices. Normatively, people are assigned one of only two commonly accepted genders at birth, resulting in consequences and constraints within concrete social practices. Gender expression is neither materially experienced nor discursively enacted in the same way for women (or men) universally. FCDA requires an acknowledgement of differences among women (and men) and the forms of sexism to which they are differentially subjected as complexly constructed social actors (Lazar, 2-3). Social practices, far from being neutral, are run through with relations of gender, class, race/ethnicity, sexuality, age, (dis)ability, geography, and intersections therein. McCall (1773) addressed the necessity of being mindful of the way people are multiplying position as subjects. Her research engages “provisionally” with “existing analytical categories” as non-static points of understanding, in order to examine changing inequalities among social groups through the complexity of different contexts and social formations. However, Baxter (55) opines that in recent years, a number of doctoral and post-doctoral students have begun to explore and experiment with the use of a <em>new </em>theoretical and methodological approach to gender and language study: that of Feminist Post- Structuralist Discourse Analysis (FPDA). While there is a growing international interest in the FPDA approach, it is still relatively unknown in the wider community of discourse analysis. There is little published work as yet which directly draws on FPDA, but much fascinating work in the pipeline. At the moment, it is just a small fish in the big sea of discourse analysis; its future is far from certain and it may well be swallowed up whole by larger varieties, or choose to swim with the tide of Critical Discourse Analysis, which to some extent it resembles. Of all the leading approaches to discourse analysis in the field, FPDA has most in common with CDA. Yet, FPDA and CDA have quite different theoretical and epistemological orientations. While they share commonalities in theory and methodology, the two approaches arguably have contrasting outlooks on the world and seek divergent outcomes. He later expanded on the background and defined FPDA as: an approach to analyzing and textualizing discourses in spoken interaction and other types of text. It draws upon the poststructuralist principles of complexity, plurality, ambiguity, connection, recognition, diversity, textual playfulness, functionality and transformation. The ‘feminist’ perspective on poststructuralist discourse analysis considers ‘gender differentiation’ to be a dominant discourse among competing discourses when analysing all types of text. It regards gender differentiation as one of the most pervasive discourses across many cultures in terms of its systematic power to discriminate between human beings according to their gender and sexuality. (Baxter 56)</p> <p>This definition of FPDA developed from the ideas of the formalist, Bakhtin (1981), and the poststructuralists, Derrida (1987) and Foucault (1980), in relation to power, knowledge and discourses. It has also been inspired by the feminist work of Walkerdine (1998), and Weedon (1997), among others. Baxter further illustrated that, theoretically, FPDA has definite connections and parallels with current versions of ‘feminist CDA’. He recognises that CDA is in no way a monolithic construct, but rather a multidisciplinary perspective drawing upon diverse approaches. As far as it is possible to generalise, both FPDA and feminist versions of CDA share a key principle: ‘the discursive construction of subjectivity’. CDA research thus, combines what perhaps somewhat pompously used to be called ‘solidarity with the oppressed’ with an attitude of opposition and dissent against thos</p>\n\nA CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS OF SPEECHES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS OF SPEECHES", "id": 119}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>                                                <strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p><em>This study seeks to investigate the highly sensitive utterances of threat by Asari Dokubo in his struggle for the political and economic emancipation of the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria; utterances that clearly portray his ideological leaning.

It is a critique of cognitivism that developed from the 1970s onwards, although it has its roots in the ‘turn to language’ in the 1950s (Woolgar, 1988). Whereas cognitivism speaks of objective, observable, knowable reality, on the other hand discourse analysis speaks of multiple versions of reality, multiple ‘truths’, which are constructed through texts, therefore there are correspondingly multiple versions of analyses. Here, language is viewed as a social performance or a social action – it is productive and constitutive (language both creates social phenomena and is representative of social phenomena). The method explores power relations from a critical standpoint in an attempt to make sense of the social world by providing new critical insights – a positive contribution to both theory and research. </p> <p>According to Van Dijk (1998a) Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) is a field that is concerned with studying and analyzing written and spoken texts to reveal the discursive sources of power, dominance, inequality and bias. It examines how these discursive sources are maintained and reproduced within specific social, political and historical contexts. In a similar vein, Fairclough (1993) defines CDA as discourse analysis which aims to systematically explore often opaque relationships of causality and determination between (a) discursive practices, events and texts, and (b) wider social and cultural structures, relations and processes; to investigate how such practices, events and texts arise out of and are ideologically shaped by relations of power and struggles over power; and to explore how the opacity of these relationships between discourse and society is itself a factor securing power and hegemony. (p. 135) To put it simply, CDA aims at making transparent the connections between discourse practices, social practices, and social structures; connections that might be opaque to the layperson. Critical discourse analysis (CDA) is a type of discourse analytical research that primarily studies the way social power abuse, dominance, and inequality are enacted, reproduced, and resisted by text and talk in the social and political context. With such dissident research, critical discourse analysts take explicit position, and thus want to understand, expose, and ultimately resist social inequality.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Critical Discourse Analysis </strong></p> <p>Critical Discourse analysis is a branch of Critical Linguistics which analyzes a text in connection with the social context of that text. Norman Fairclough(1989:24) sees it as ‘the whole process of social interaction in which a text is just a part’. It is the consideration given to a text in relation to the social context that surrounds it. The critical discourse analyst considers a text as an entity of the social and cultural relations that informed such a text.  Van Dijk (2001) considers it to be ‘a type of discourse analytical research that primarily studies the way social power abuse, dominance, and inequality are enacted, reproduced, and resisted by text and talk in the social and political context’. </p> <p>When analyzing a discourse, the speech act of an utterance is usually put into consideration. This goes to expose the intention of the speaker (illocutionary force) and the effects the utterance has on the hearer (perlocutionary act).</p> <p><strong>1.3 Theoretical Background</strong></p> <p><strong> 1.3.1The Speech Act Theory</strong></p> <p>In this study, we shall adopt the speech act theory to analyze Dokubo’s utterances. The speech act theory introduced by a British language philosopher, J. L. Austin in 1962 in his ‘How to do things with words’ and further developed by American philosopher, J.R Searle concerns itself with the fact that the speaker’s utterances produce so much effects and consequences on the hearer. Keith Allen (2012) believes that the speech act as a pragmatic exercise is created ‘when Speaker makes an utterance U to Hearer in context C and must be interpreted as an aspect of social interaction.’ When an utterance is made, there is a meaning that is naturally attached to it which experts in pragmatics called the locutionary act. Again, it is a fact that when someone speaks, there is a force in him that makes him to produce such an utterance. This is considered to be the illocutionary act or illocutionary force. The utterance is made to achieve a certain effect or result on the hearer. This is the perlocutionary act. Searle claims that there are five major types of actions that human beings can performed by the use of language. They are: representative, declarative, directive, expressive and commissive. For the sake of this study, we shall particularly base our analysis on the <em>commissive</em> aspect of the speech act theory. This is a speech act theory which commits the speaker to some future course of action. This could be a threat, a promise, a vow, a bet, a guarantee, an offer, warning, etc. Dokubo’s utterances majorly fit into the category of threat. In social context, his utterances could be termed an incitement. Already, Dokubo understands very well, the schemata of his audience, in this case, Nigerians. He knows that each time he issues a threat, the chances are that, the unarmed Nigerians are either thrown into fear and confusion or his group (the Niger Delta militants) are reinforced and encouraged to take up arms against the state. John Gary Stobbs(2012) succinctly puts the idea of schemata theory thus: ‘there is a shared cultural, historical and social schema that is used by the speaker to create a common understanding of an ideology. The speaker will utilise the schemata of the hearer. By using shorter utterances, the speaker allows the hearer to form a coherent understanding. The short utterances are complete in themselves but also build towards an overall conclusion.’</p> <p><strong>2.1                                                    EVOLUTION OF CDA</strong></p> <p>In the late 1970s, Critical Linguistics (CL) was developed by a group of linguists and literary theorists at the University of East Anglia (Fowler et. al., 1979; Kress &amp; Hodge, 1979). Their approach was based on Halliday's Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL). CL practitioners such as Trew (1979a) aimed at \"isolating ideology in discourse\" and showing \"how ideology and ideological processes are manifested as systems of linguistic characteristics and processes\" (155). This aim was pursued by developing CL's analytical tools based on SFL (Fowler et al., 1979; Fowler, 1991). Following Halliday, these CL practitioners view language in use as simultaneously performing three functions: ideational, interpersonal, and textual functions. According to Fowler (1991, p. 71), and Fairclough (1995b, p. 25), whereas the ideational function refers to the experience of the speakers of the world and its phenomena, the interpersonal function embodies the insertion of speakers' own attitudes and evaluations about the phenomena in question, and establishing a relationship between speakers and listeners. Instrumental to these two functions is the textual function. It is through the textual function of language that speakers are able to produce texts that are understood by listeners. It is an enabling function connecting discourse to the co-text and con-text in which it occurs.            Halliday's view of language as a \"social act\" is central to many of CDA's practitioners (Hodge &amp; Kress, 1979). According to Fowler et al. (1979), CL, like sociolinguistics, asserts that, \"there are strong and pervasive connections between linguistic structure and social structure\" (185). However, whereas in sociolinguistics \"the concepts 'language' and 'society' are divided…so that one is forced to talk of 'links between the two'\", for CL \"language is an integral part of social process\" (Fowler et al., 189).</p> <p>Another central assumption of CDA and SFL is that speakers make choices regarding vocabulary and grammar, and that these choices are consciously or unconsciously \"principled and systematic\"(Fowler et al., 188). Thus choices are ideologically based. According to Fowler et al., the \"relation between form and content is not arbitrary or conventional, but….. form signifies content\" (188). In sum, language is a social act and it is ideologically driven.</p> <p>On further development of CDA, over the years CL and what recently is more frequently referred to as CDA has been further developed and broadened. Recent work has raised some concerns with the earlier work in CL. Among the concerns was, first, taking into consideration the role of audiences and their interpretations of discourse possibly different from that of the discourse analyst. The second concern has called for broadening the scope of analysis beyond the textual, extending it to the intertextual analysis.</p> <p>Fairclough (1995b) has raised both issues. He claims that the earliest work in CL did not adequately focus on the \"interpretive practices of audiences.\" In other words, he claims that CL has, for the most part, assumed that the audiences interpret texts the same way the analysts do. In a similar vein, commenting on Fowler (1991), Boyd-Barrett (1994) asserts that there is \"a tendency towards the classic fallacy of attributing particular 'readings' to readers, or media 'effects,' solely on the basis of textual analysis\" ( 31).The other issue put forward by Fairclough (1995b) is that while earlier contributions in CL were very thorough in their grammatical and lexical analysis they were less attentive to the intertextual analysis of texts: \"the linguistic analysis is very much focused upon clauses, with little attention to higher-level organization properties of whole texts\" (28). Despite raising these issues with regards to earlier works in CL, Fairclough (1995b) inserts that \"mention of these limitations is not meant to minimize the achievement of critical linguistics--they largely reflect shifts of focus and developments of theory in the past twenty years or so\" (28). The \"shifts of focus and developments of theory\" which Fairclough talks about, however, have not resulted in the creation of a single theoretical framework. What is known today as CDA, according to Bell &amp; Garret (1998), \"is best viewed as a shared perspective encompassing a range of approaches rather than as just one school\" (7). Also, Van Dijk tells us that CDA \"is not a specific direction of research\" hence \"it does not have a unitary theoretical framework.\" But, van Dijk also asserts that given the common perspective and the general aims of CDA, we may also find overall conceptual and theoretical frameworks that are closely related.</p> <p><strong>2.2                                            THE MEDIA AND APPROACHES TO CDA</strong></p> <p>Among the scholars whose works have profoundly contributed to the development of CDA are Van Dijk (1988, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1998b, 1998a), Wodak (1995, 1996, 1999), and Fairclough (1989, 1992, 1993, 1995a, 1995b, 1999). Van Dijk proposed the <em>Socio-Cognitive Model</em>. Among CDA practitioners, Van Dijk is one of the most often referenced and quoted in critical studies of media discourse, even in studies that do not necessarily fit within the CDA perspective (e.g. Karim, 2000; Ezewudo, 1998). In the 1980s, he started to apply his discourse analysis theory to media texts mainly focusing on the representation of ethnic groups and minorities in Europe. In his <em>News Analysis </em>(1988), he integrates his general theory of discourse to the discourse of news in the press, and applies his theory to authentic cases of news reports at both the national and international level. What distinguishes Van Dijk's (1988) framework for the analyses of news discourse is his call for a thorough analysis not only of the textual and structural level of media discourse but also for analysis and explanations at the production and \"reception\" or comprehension level (Boyd-Barrett, 1994).</p> <p>By structural analysis, Van Dijk posited analysis of \"structures at various levels of description\" which meant not only the grammatical, phonological, morphological and semantic level but also \"higher level properties\" such as coherence, overall themes and topics of news stories and the whole schematic forms and rhetorical dimensions of texts. This structural analysis, however, he claimed, will not suffice, for discourse is not simply an isolated textual or dialogic structure. Rather it is a complex communicative event that also embodies a social context, featuring participants (and their properties) as well as production and reception processes (Van Dijk,  2). By \"production processes\" Van Dijk means journalistic and institutional practices of news-making and the economic and social practices which not only play important roles in the creation of media discourse but which can be explicitly related to the structures of media discourse.</p> <p>Van Dijk's other dimension of analysis, \"reception processes\", involves taking into consideration the comprehension, \"memorization and reproduction\" of news information. What Van Dijk's analysis of media (1988, 1991, 1993) attempts to demonstrate is the relationships between the three levels of news text production (structure, production and comprehension processes) and their relationship with the wider social context they are embedded within. In order to identify such relationships, Van Dijk's analysis takes place at two levels: microstructure and macrostructure.                                               </p> <p>          At the microstructure level, analysis is focused on the semantic relations between propositions, syntactic, lexical and other rhetorical elements that provide coherence in the text, and other rhetorical elements such as quotations, direct or indirect reporting that give factuality to the news reports. Central to van Dijk's analysis of news reports, however, is the analysis of macrostructure since it pertains to the thematic/topic structure of the news stories and their overall schemata. Themes and topics are realized in the headlines and lead paragraphs. According to Van Dijk, the headlines \"define the overall coherence or semantic unity of discourse, and also what information readers memorize best from a news report\" (248). He claims that the headline and the lead paragraph express the most important information of the cognitive model of journalists, that is, how they see and define the news event. Unless readers have different knowledge and beliefs, they will generally adopt these subjective media definitions of what is important information about an event. (Van Dijk, 248)</p> <p>For Van Dijk (14-16), the news schemata (\"superstructure schema\") are structured according to a specific narrative pattern that consists of the following: <em>summary </em>(headline and the lead paragraph), <em>story </em>(situation consisting of episode and backgrounds), and <em>consequences </em>(final comments and conclusions). These sections of a news story are sequenced in terms of \"relevance,\" so the general information is contained in the summary, the headline and the lead paragraph. To Van Dijk, this is what the readers can best memorize and recall. Van Dijk essentially perceives discourse analysis as ideology analysis, because according to him, \"ideologies are typically, though not exclusively, expressed and reproduced in discourse and communication, including non-verbal semiotic messages, such as pictures, photographs and movies\" (17). His approach for analyzing ideologies has three parts: social analysis, cognitive analysis, and discourse analysis (30).                        Whereas the social analysis pertains to examining the \"overall societal structures,\" (the context), the discourse analysis is primarily text based (syntax, lexicon, local semantics, topics, schematic structures, etc.). In this sense, van Dijk's approach incorporates the two traditional approaches in media education: interpretive (text based) and social tradition (context based), into one analytical framework for analyzing media discourse. However, what noticeably distinguishes van Dijk's approach from other approaches in CDA is another feature of his approach: cognitive analysis. </p> <p>For van Dijk it is the <em>socio-cognition</em>— social cognition and personal cognition—that mediates between society and discourse. He defines social cognition as \"the system of mental representations and processes of group members\" (18). In this sense, for van Dijk, \"ideologies … are the overall, abstract mental systems that organize … socially shared attitudes\" (18). Ideologies, thus, \"indirectly influence the personal cognition of group members\" in their act of comprehension of discourse among other actions and interactions (19). He calls the mental representations of individuals during such social actions and interactions \"models\". For him, \"models control how people act, speak or write, or how they understand the social practices of others\" (2). Of crucial importance here is that, according to van Dijk, mental representations \"are often articulated along the Us versus Them dimensions, in which speakers of one group will generally tend to present themselves or their own group in positive terms, and other groups in negative terms\" (22). Analysing and making explicit this contrastive dimension of Us versus Them has been central to most of van Dijk's research and writings. He believes that one who desires to make transparent such an ideological dichotomy in discourse needs to analyze discourse in the following way (61-63):</p> <p>a. Examining the context of the discourse: historical, political or social background of a conflict and its main participants</p> <p>b. Analyzing groups, power relations and conflicts involved</p> <p>c. Identifying positive and negative opinions about Us versus Them</p> <p>d. Making explicit the presupposed and the implied</p> <p>e. Examining all formal structure: lexical choice and syntactic structure, in a way that helps to (de)emphasize polarized group opinions.</p> <p>Discourse Sociolinguistics is one of the approaches in CDA associated with Wodak and her colleagues in Vienna (The Vienna School of Discourse Analysis). Wodak bases her model \"on sociolinguistics in the Bernsteinian tradition, and on the ideas of the Frankfurt school, especially those of Jürgen Habermas\" (Wodak, 209). According to Wodak;</p> <p>Discourse Sociolinguistics…is a sociolinguistics which not only is explicitly dedicated to the study of the text in context, but also accords both factors equal importance. It is an approach capable of identifying and describing the underlying mechanisms that contribute to those disorders in discourse which are embedded in a particular context— whether they be in the structure and function of the media, or in institutions such as a hospital or a school— and inevitably affect communication. (3)</p> <p>Wodak has carried out research in various institutional settings such as courts, schools, and hospitals, and on a variety of social issues such as sexism, racism and anti-Semitism. Wodak's work on the discourse of anti-Semitism in 1990 led to the development of an approach she termed the <em>discourse historical method</em>. The term <em>historical </em>occupies a unique place in this approach. It denotes an attempt on the part of this approach \"to integrate systematically all available background information in the analysis and interpretation of the many layers of a written or spoken text\" (209). The results of Wodak and her colleagues' study showed that the context of the discourse had a significant impact on the structure, function, and context of the anti- Semitic utterances\" (209). Focusing on the historical contexts of discourse in the process of explanation and interpretation is a feature that distinguishes this approach from other approaches of CDA especially that of van Dijk. In the <em>discourse historical method </em>approach (similar to Fairclough's) it is believed that language \"manifests social processes and interaction\" and \"constitutes\" those processes as well (12). According to Wodak &amp; Ludwig, viewing language this way entails three things at least. First, discourse \"always involves power and ideologies. No interaction exists where power relations do not prevail and where values and norms do not have a relevant role\" (12). Second, \"discourse … is always historical, that is, it is connected synchronically and diachronically with other communicative events which are happening at the same time or which have happened before\" (12). This is similar to Fairclough's notion of intertextuality. The third feature of Wodak's approach is that of interpretation. According to Wodak &amp; Ludwig, readers and listeners, depending on their background knowledge and information and their position, might have different interpretations of the same communicative event (13). Therefore, they assert that \"THE RIGHT interpretation does not exist; a hermeneutic approach is necessary. Interpretations can be more or less plausible or adequate, but they cannot be true\" (emphasis in original) (13).</p> <p> This point has been raised by Fairclough (15-16), as well. The third main approach in CDA is that of Fairclough whose theory has been central to CDA over more than the past ten years. Fairclough, in his earlier work, called his approach to language and discourse <em>Critical Language Study </em>(1989, 5). He described the objective of this approach as \"a contribution to the general raising of consciousness of exploitative social relations, through focusing upon language\" (4). This aim in particular remains in his later work that further develops his </p> <p>approach so that it is now one of the most comprehensive frameworks of CDA.</p> <p>For Chuliaraki and Fairclough, CDA \"brings social science and linguistics … together within a single theoretical and analytical framework, setting up a dialogue between them\"(6). The linguistic theory referred to here is Systematic Functional Linguistics (SFL), which has been the foundation for Fairclough's analytical framework as it has been for other practitioners in CDA.. Fairclough's approach also draws upon a number of critical social theorists, such as Foucault (i.e. concept of <em>orders of discourse</em>), Gramsci (concept of <em>hegemony</em>), Habermas (i.e. concept of <em>colonization of discourses</em>), among others. Chuliaraki and Fairclough posit that CDA has a particular contribution to make. They argue that, \"the past two decades or so have been a period of profound economic social transformation on a global scale\" (30). They believe that although these changes are due to particular actions by people the changes have been perceived as \"part of nature\" (4), that is, changes and transformations have been perceived as natural and not due to people's causal actions. The recent economic and social changes, according to Chuliaraki and Fairclough, \"are to a significant degree . . . transformations in the language, and discourse\" ( 4), thus, CDA can help by theorizing transformations and creating an awareness \"of what is, how it has come to be, and what it might become, on the basis of which people may be able to make and remake their lives\" (4). With such an objective in mind, Chuliaraki and Fairclough claim that CDA of a communicative interaction sets out to show that the semiotic and linguistic features of the interaction are systematically connected with what is going on socially, and what is going on socially is indeed going on partly or wholly semiotically or linguistically. Put differently, CDA systematically charts relations of transformation between the symbolic and non-symbolic, between discourse and the non-discursive (113). In this approach of CDA, there are three analytical focuses in analysing any communicative event (interaction). They are <em>text </em>(e.g. a news report), <em>discourse practice</em> (e.g. the process of production and consumption), and <em>socio-cultural practice </em>(e.g. social and cultural structures which give rise to the communicative event) (Fairclough, 57; Chuliaraki &amp; Fairclough, 113). These closely resemble van Dijk's three dimensions of ideology analysis: <em>discourse</em>, <em>socio-cognition</em>, and <em>social analysis </em>[analysis of social structures] respectively. What seems to be the main difference between Fairclough's and van Dijk's approach is the second dimension, which mediates between the other two. Whereas van Dijk perceives social cognition and mental models as mediating between discourse and the social, Fairclough believes that this task is assumed by discourse practices— text production and consumption— (Fairclough, 59). In this case, these two approaches of CDA, are \"similar in conception\" (Fairclough, 59).</p> <p><strong>2.3                                 SPEECH ACTS AND ASARI DOKUBO</strong></p> <p>The critical discourse analyst considers a text as an entity of the social and cultural relations that informed such a text.  Van Dijk (2001) considers it to be ‘a type of discourse analytical research that primarily studies the way social power abuse, dominance, and inequality are enacted, reproduced, and resisted by text and talk in the social and political context’. When analyzing a discourse, the speech act of an utterance is usually put into consideration. This goes to expose the intention of the speaker (illocutionary force) and the effects the utterance has on the hearer (perlocutionary act).</p> <p><strong>2.4                                                    METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>The data for this research were collected from the interviews granted to Asari Dokubo by the Nigerian media. The utterances were downloaded from online news media like Premium Times (www.premiumtimesng.com), PM News Nigeria (www.pmnewsnigeria.com) and youtube (www.youtube.com).The utterances were carefully studied and presented to expose the hidden force that informed such utterances.</p> <p><strong>3.1 ANALYSIS</strong></p> <p><strong>Political/Ideological Analysis</strong></p> <p>From the way Dokubo issues threat utterances, one can easily decipher the covert ideology and political affiliation that underlie such utterances. Dokubo was a staunch supporter of former president Goodluck Jonathan of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), contesting for a re-election in 2015. Having come from the same region, the Niger Delta (a minority region) and speaking the same language (Ijaw) with Jonathan, Asari could not hide his feelings as evident in his utterances thus:</p> <p><strong><em>‘There would be bloodshed if Jonathan looses in 2015’</em></strong></p> <p>(Premium Times of September 9, 2013. Posted by Bassey Udo)</p> <p>1.    ‘The way things are going, there is no sitting on the fence in the battle before us. When some people say they have the right to rule and others don’t have, there is no sitting on the fence. All of us will have to be in the ring and fight. We cannot leave Goodluck alone.’</p> <p>It is obvious that this threat was meant to compel Nigerians to vote for Jonathan. An average Nigerian is afraid of war and crisis, having had some measurable share of internal conflicts and insurgency.</p> <p>2.    ‘My support for Jonathan will be biased, because charity begins at home. Monkey no fine, but im mama like am. Goodluck, na my person. 2015 is already a settled matter. Goodluck Jonathan would be president in 2015.’</p> <p>3.    ‘Whether they contest or they don’t. If they say the blood of the dogs and the baboons will be soaked in the streets, or salt water in the streets, we will help them in blood in the streets.’</p> <p><strong>Dokubo’s Populist/EconomicView</strong></p> <p>Dokubo holds a populist view that the political and economic rights of his people are denied by the Northerners which he called ‘Gambari North.’ This view, coupled with his anti-government stance made him to form and lead the Niger Delta People’s Volunteer Force, a very prominent armed group operating in the Niger Delta region. The group believes that since oil, being a resource that generates much of Nigeria’s income, is tapped from the region, they have the right to control this resource and not the federal government. The following utterances portray that:</p> <p><strong><em>‘Resource Control: Asari Dokubo Threatens Northerners’</em></strong></p> <p>(P.M News Nigeria of July 17, 2014. Posted by Eromosele Ebhomele) </p> <p>4.    We hereby equivocate that going back to the creeks may be inevitably preferable rather than allow for the wealth of our people be used to develop or rehabilitate a parasitic, barren yet ignorantly arrogant  Gambari North.’</p> <p>5.    ‘We are fully ready to mobilize our people from across the Niger Delta and even in the diaspora to stand up for definite showdowns and direct actions.’</p> <p>6.    ‘Let us state very emphatically that irrespective of the final determination of the National Conference, our minimum expectation and demand as a people is and remains 100 control of our resources or nothing.’</p> <p>7.    ‘Yes, the National conference can go on and propose even one hundred states, agree to rehabilitate and develop areas ravaged by insurgency and internal conflict, agree to develop solid minerals resources and whatever, but let it be known that not a dime of the resources  of the people of the Niger Delta should be factored into this odious compromise.’</p> <p>8.    ‘The Gambari North must no longer be sustained at our expense, our God given resources belong to us and not Nigeria. The end of Lugard’s Nigeria is now!’</p> <p><strong><em>‘We’ll resume our struggle if Buhari “draws the first blood”- Asari Dokubo</em></strong></p> <p>(premiummtimes of May 18, 2015. Posted by Nicholas Ibekwe) </p> <p>9.    ‘Yes, a new government begins in Nigeria and a next phase of our struggle shall begin also’…. ‘Jonathan Goodluck presidency was like a restraining order now that restraint is lifted. However, we will watch and wait, let them draw the first blood and we shall determine our best way forward. Truly Nigeria will never be the same again, the future is pregnant.’</p> <p>10.           ‘Should Buhari whom like pharaoh has determined in his heart to turn desolate the Niger Delta region, draw the first blood by undermining certain interest of the region then begin the systemic arrest, maiming and murder of our comrades, continue the confiscation of our rights to self-determination and treat the region as a conquered region, then it may be honourable for some of us to die in prison or in the field of war as nobody is afraid of him.’</p> <p><strong>Lexis and Phrase Analysis</strong></p> <p>1.    Dokubo uses the phrase ‘…no sitting on the fence’ repeatedly in his utterance accessed from the Premium Times. He uses this idiom to mean he and his group will be decisive this time to war against the federal government and that no force would make them change that decision.  </p> <p>2.    ‘…draws the first blood’ is metaphor used here to portend danger. This shows Dokubo’s readiness to strike back if, according to him, President Buhari strikes first by ‘undermining’ their interest in form of arrest and murder of their members or people from his region.</p> <p>It should be noted that the Niger Delta militants had since surrendered their arms when amnesty was given to them by the late President Yaradua. To draw the ‘first blood’ here also suggests cancellation of amnesty.</p> <p>3.     There is also the repeated use of ‘yes’ in his utterance to show determination in the fight against the government. </p> <p><strong>Use of Pronominals</strong></p> <p>1.    ‘let us’, ‘all of us’, ‘we’, ‘our’, ‘us’ are all pronominal phrases that run through the selected utterances. This reveals that Dokubo is not alone in the struggle. The pronominals show inclusiveness and togetherness of the group.</p> <p><strong>Biblical Allusion</strong></p> <p>1.    ‘Should Buhari whom like pharaoh…’ There is a reference to Pharaoh, king of Egypt in the Bible days, who was adamant and refused to release the children of Israel to freedom. The consequence of that was total destruction of pharaoh and his people. Dokubo believes that the Buhari led federal government would face the same fate should he draw ‘the first blood’. This allusion also reveals Dokubo’s religious history. (He converted from Christianity to Islam in1990).</p> <p><strong>Diachronic Reference</strong></p> <p>1.    ‘Whether they contest or they don’t. If they say the blood of the dogs and the baboons will be soaked in the streets, or salt water in the streets, we will help them in blood in the streets.’</p> <p>The above statement has a diachronic connotation. There was a statement credited to President Buhari sometime ago in Nigeria that he would make Nigeria ungovernable and that ‘the dogs and the baboons would be soaked in blood’ if the 2015 presidential election was rigged by the then ruling PDP.

Achieving this may be a feat of insurmountable <em>tete a tete</em> analysis using some debuting or re-appearing tools in the entire cologne Adichie had confidently portrayed in this novel. Comprehensive but more scrupulous reviews related to this feat/study was also visualized and acquired for the less supplemented but well nourished desire to set this study’s aim ablaze. This study had chosen <em>HOAYS</em> since not much had really been done towards the Lexico-semantic analysis of Adichie’s award winning novel. Some candid chapters were randomly analyzed using contextual sentences or phrases to portray Adichie’s narrative. At the end, the predominant devices found out to be used by Chimamanda are Compound sentences followed by Compound-complex sentences, Parenthetical expression, Italics, Transliteration and Code-mixing. It is then recommended that other young writers should adopt Chimamanda’s style since it improves the vigour of one’s writing. However, the style of a writer albeit creative may pose a challenge to readers. This study attempts a linguistic stylistic analysis of Chimamanda Adichie’s Half of a Yellow Sun with the aim of identifying some of the linguistic features the writer used and to understand the cultural and historical ideology behind the texts as well as appreciating her style.</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br/> Language in its complex form has been a guiding tool or a <em>convention structure </em>used to interact or present suggestions and verbal expression of one’s mind. There are vehemently several ways one would and could express his/her ideals and ideas either using sounds, symbols as long as they are accepted as a Language form by those at the receiving end (other speakers and language users).</p> <p>According to Lyons,  Languages are: <em>‘The principal systems of communication used by particular groups of human beings within the particular society (Linguistic community) of which they are members’.</em> Language, however, as a sole inheritance of humans have been used in so many ways in our society hence the delving of analysis of reputable and upcoming linguists into the analysis of the complexity of language(s) such as morphology, semantics, phonology, domestic discourse (<strong><em>dodi</em></strong>) and syntax as well as their employed uses (e.g Kakava, 2000; Odebunmi, 2003; Odebunmi, 2006; Odebunmi, 2007; Oni and Osunbade, 2009; Wallace, 2012).</p> <p>Lexical semantics (also known as lexicosemantics), is a subfield of linguistic semantics. The units of analysis in lexical semantics are lexical units which include not only words but also sub-words or sub-units such as affixes and even compound words and phrases. Lexical units make up the catalogue of words in a language, the lexicon. Lexical semantics looks at how the meaning of the lexical units correlates with the structure of the language or syntax. This is referred to as syntax-semantic interface (Pustejovsky, 1995).</p> <p>The study of lexical semantics looks at:</p> <p>●        the classification and decomposition of lexical items</p> <p>●        the differences and similarities in lexical semantic structures cross-linguistically</p> <p>●        the relationship of lexical meaning to sentence meaning and syntax.</p> <p>Lexical items contain information about category (lexical and syntactic), form and meaning. The semantics related to these categories then relate to each lexical item in the lexicon (Loos <em>et al.,</em> 2004) Lexical items can also be semantically classified based on whether their meanings are derived from single lexical units or from their surrounding environment. However, Leech and Short’s (2007) analytical checklist is used to breakdown randomly selected stylistic features into three categories, lexical, grammatical and context.</p> <p>Lexical items participate in regular patterns of association with each other. Some relations between lexical items include hyponymy, hypernymy, synonymy and antonymy, as well as homonymy.</p> <p><strong>Hyponymy and hypernymy</strong></p> <p>Hyponymy and hypernymy refers to a relationship between a general term and the more specific terms that fall under the category of the general term. For example, the colors red, green, blue and yellow are <em>hyponyms</em>. They fall under the general term of color, which is the <em>hypernym</em>. Lexical units, also referred to as syntactic atoms, can stand alone such as in the case of root words or parts of compound words or they necessarily attach to other units such as prefixes and suffixes do. The former are called <em>free</em> <em>morphemes</em> and the latter <em>bound morphemes</em> (Di Sciullo and Williams, 1987). They fall into a narrow range of meanings (semantic fields) and can combine with each other to generate new meanings. This study connects the dots into investigating inherent and available comprehension to <strong><em>dodi</em></strong>as well as a lexico-semantic discus as a form of narrative indeed to comparatively highlight the daily interactive activities of the everyday family sceneries, in Adichie’s <em>Half of a</em> <em>Yellow Sun</em>(NB: We use <em>HYS)</em>.</p> <p>Our choice of Adichie is motivated by a number of factors. Apart from being the new voice of Nigerian literature whose novels have attracted several awards, especially in the contemporary literary scene (suggesting that she is an embodiment of intellectualism who has gained a measure of success that eludes many writers), there is a close relationship between her writing and her world, her society and life (see Adebayo 1995: 64); and her works bear relevance to the espousal of the domestic experiences of the characters among other significant issues that the novels mirror in the depiction of the totality of people’s experiences in the post-colonial Nigeria.</p> <p>This study data consisted of interactive dialogue between randomly selected casts/characters from the selected text (<em>HYS)</em>. Some of the domestic discourses in the novels were sampled and analyzed for occurrences of implicatures, using insights from Gricean Pragmatics. Apart from enhancing a better understanding of implicit meanings of conversational discourse in the texts, the study is also significant for shifting literature on pragmatics forward, and providing a new theoretical insight into the interpretation and understanding of contemporary African fiction.</p> <p>The graphic representation of sounds (speech sounds) on paper is called writing. Writing is done in different ways for various purposes and by different people. It is because of this that the study of stylistics as well as the lexical semantics becomes necessary and an important area to both linguists and critics. According to Syal and Jindal (2010), <em>“Stylistics is that branch of linguistics which takes the language of literary texts as its object of study”</em>. Stylistics is the study of various styles used in literary and non – literary texts which distinguishes the uniqueness of a writer from another. Style is a pattern of linguistic features that distinguish a piece of writing from another; it also distinguishes the personality of an author from another. No wonder the French scholar Buffon said <em>“Style is the Man”</em>. Syal and Jindal (2010) opined that:</p> <p><em>Out of the many types of variations that occur in language, it is the variation in literary style that is most complex, and thus offers unlimited scope for linguistic analysis</em>.</p> <p>Stylistics is very important in Literature because each literary text represents an individual’s use of language which reflects his unique personality, thoughts and style. The study of literary styles shows the linguistics repertoire of a writer. We often hear of the style of Armah; the style of Milton and the simplicity that is associated with Wordsworth. Stylistics looks at the choice of words, the sentence patterns and figurative usage of words by a writer. Figurative expressions which are sometimes called “Rhetorical Expression” helps a writer to be vivid in his description of events and ideas.</p> <p>●        According to Ezugu (2011), Figures of speech, sometimes called “rhetorical” figures are expressions, phrases or words used to convey more than their ordinary literal meaning. These figures, if properly used, not only enrich but strengthen and give life to our writing. Some of the features used in a achieving style include:</p> <p>●        Diction, figurative usage and various sentence structures such as:</p> <p>●        <strong><em>Parenthetical Expressions</em></strong>: These are words, clauses or even another sentence inserted at the middle or end of a sentence such as after thoughts.</p> <p>●        <strong><em>Compound Sentence</em></strong>: A compound sentence is one which consists of three or more simple sentences joined together by a coordinating conjunction or semi – colon.</p> <p>●        <strong><em>Complex Sentence</em></strong>: A complex sentence consists of two parts; the main clause and one or more subordinate clauses.</p> <p>●        <strong><em>Compound complex sentence</em></strong>: This consists of two or more main clauses and one or more subordinate clause.</p> <p>●        Other features of style include:</p> <p>●        Graphology: The analysis of hand writing to interpret character and personality. Aspects of which are “Italics, Bold sentence” and capitalization”.</p> <p>●        Code Switching: A system of switching from one linguistic code to another.</p> <p>●        Code – Mixing: A systematic way of mixing two or more linguistics codes in an utterance or writing.</p> <p>●        Transliteration: This is the literal translation of the syntatical structure of a language into another language</p> <p>Although many works have been done on stylistics, little work has been done on lexico-semantic style used in Chimamanda Adichie’s <em>Half of a Yellow Sun</em> which was published in 2006. Most of the works done were based on general analysis of how her works reflect the realities of the society.</p> <p>This study aims at an identification of the predominant lexico-seminar analysis devices used in Chimamanda Adichie’s <em>HOAYS</em> and the effect these devices have in the overall evaluation of the novel. This study will enable readers identify the predominant stylistic devices used by Chimamanda Adichie in her novel <em>HOAYS</em> as well as the effect achieved by the use of these devices. The study will, in addition, encourage writers to adopt the style of Chimamanda Adichie in their writing. Finally, it will provide materials for researchers in this field. This investigation is limited to an analysis of the predominant lexico-semantic stylistic devices employed in Chimamanda Adichie’s novel <em>HOAYS</em>. The novel comprises four parts namely: PART ONE: The Early Sixties; PART TWO: The Late Sixties; Part Three: The Early Sixties’ PART FOUR: The late sixties. These four parts are made up of a total number of the thirty seven (37) chapters but this study has randomly selected dictions form random chapters for analysis. The study analysis is restricted to such stylistic devices as compound sentences; compound complex sentences, italics, code – mixing, parenthetical expression and transliteration which the researcher encountered several times in the course of reading the novel.</p> <p><strong>LEXICO-SEMANTIC ANALYSIS OF ADICHIE’S <em>HOAYS</em></strong></p> <p>The following are some of the stylistic devices used by Adichie in HOAYS to capture the activities in this text.</p><p> </p> <p><strong>Words</strong></p><p> </p> <p><strong>Meaning/<em>hypernyms</em></strong></p><p> </p> <p><strong><em>Hyponyms</em></strong></p><p> </p> <p>Lustrous</p><p> </p> <p>Shining/<strong><em>Shine</em></strong></p><p> </p> <p>Shiny, radiant, glossy gleaming, shimmering, glistening, sparkly, glittery, <em>etc</em></p><p> </p> <p>Balmy</p><p> </p> <p>pleasantly warm/<strong><em>gentle</em></strong></p><p> </p> <p>Mild, clement, pleasant, temperate, soft, supple, <em>etc</em></p><p> </p> <p>Errand</p><p> </p> <p>a short journey undertaken in order to deliver or collect something, often on someone else’s behalf/<strong><em>duty</em></strong></p><p> </p> <p>task, responsibility, chore, function, job, <em>etc</em></p><p> </p> <p>sonorous</p><p> </p> <p> sound imposingly deep and full/<strong><em>loud</em></strong></p><p> </p> <p>strident, resonant, echoing, booming, thriving, sonorous, deafening, <em>etc</em></p><p> </p> <p>Dismissive</p><p> </p> <p>feeling or showing that something is unworthy of consideration/<strong><em>unconcerned</em></strong></p><p> </p> <p>Indifferent, unconcerned, undaunted, undisturbed, <em>etc</em></p><p> </p> <p>Lurk</p><p> </p> <p>be or remain hidden so as to wait in ambush for someone or something/<strong><em>remain secretly</em></strong></p><p> </p> <p>prowl, loiter, skulk, wait, creep around, hang about, <em>etc</em></p><p> </p> <p>taut</p><p> </p> <p>stretched or pulled tight/<strong><em>firm</em></strong></p><p> </p> <p>tight, rigid, stiff, inflexible, extended, <em>etc</em></p><p> </p> <p>stammer</p><p> </p> <p>speak with sudden involuntary pauses and a tendency to repeat the initial letters of words/<strong><em>flutter</em>/<em>falter</em></strong></p><p> </p> <p>hesitate, stutter. splutter, <em>etc</em></p><p> </p> <p>Shard</p><p> </p> <p>a piece of broken ceramic, metal, glass, or rock, typically having sharp edges/<strong><em>bits</em></strong></p> <p> </p> <p>slice, shaving, splinter, <em>etc</em></p><p> </p> <p>Exhilarate</p><p> </p> <p>feel very happy, animated, or elated/<strong><em>liven</em></strong></p><p> </p> <p>elate, thrill, <em>etc</em></p><p> </p> <p>Incongruous</p><p> </p> <p>not in harmony or keeping with the surroundings or other aspects of something/<strong><em>odd</em></strong></p><p> </p> <p>Bizarre, obscure, wacky, <em>etc</em></p><p> </p> <p>Effervescent</p><p> </p> <p>giving off bubbles, fizzy/<strong><em>bubbling</em></strong></p><p> </p> <p>Bubble, gurgle, murky, <em>etc</em></p><p> </p> <p>Chivalrous</p><p> </p> <p>courteous and gallant, esp. toward women/<strong><em>polite</em></strong></p><p> </p> <p>good-mannered, well-behaved, reserved, <em>etc</em></p><p> </p> <p>Nudge</p><p> </p> <p>prod someone gently, typically with one’s elbow, in order to draw their attention to something/<strong><em>attract</em></strong></p><p> </p> <p>Bump, run into, collide,<em> etc</em></p><p> </p> <p>Coalesce</p><p> </p> <p>come together and form one mass or whole/<strong><em>unite</em></strong></p><p> </p> <p>Combine, join, unison, <em>etc</em></p><p> </p> <p>Androgynous</p><p> </p> <p>partly male and partly female in appearance/<strong><em>neutral</em></strong></p><p> </p> <p>Neutral or mid-way between, middleman</p><p> </p> <p>Regal</p><p> </p> <p>resembling, or fit for a monarch, esp. in being magnificent or dignified/<strong><em>royal</em></strong></p><p> </p> <p>King, queen, emperor, empress, <em>etc.</em></p><p> </p> <p>non sequitur</p><p> </p> <p>a conclusion or statement that does not logically follow from the previous argument or statement</p><p> </p> <p>Incongruous, unwarranted, unrelated, <em>etc</em></p><p> </p> <p>Adichie in her <em>HOAYS</em> displays quite a splendid mastery of language and the art of storytelling by her serviceable and practical disposition of the three types of language style – <em>grand/formal</em>, <em>middle/informal</em>, and <em>low/colloquial</em>. She further stretches her literary devices to accommodate the multi-faceted messages. She uses the appropriate language suitable for each character as occasion(s) demands/demanded. We could see the use of these three literal devices/language styles in the following; from Major Nzeogwu’s <strong><em>formalistic</em></strong> broadcast: <em>“The constitution is suspended and the regional government and elected assemblies are hereby dissolved. My dear countrymen, the aim of the revolutionary Council is to establish a nation free from corruption and internal strife….</em>”(123-4); through Ugwu’s <strong><em>informal</em></strong> expressions: <em>“his people would say that Master had spit this child out”</em> (124), <em>“his stomach tightened; memories of those days of Amala left a difficult-to swallow lump in his throat”</em> (353); to the use of code switching and mixing, from vernacular to pidgin, and liberal use of proverbs: <em>“Kedu afa gi? What is your name?”</em> (5). Examples of <strong><em>informal/low/colloquial</em></strong> expressions are: <em>“The white men will poke and poke and poke the women in the dark but they will never marry them”</em> (80) and <em>“he who brings kola nut brings life. You and yours will live, and I and mine will live. Let the eagle perch and let the dove perch and, if either decrees that the other not perch, it will not be well for him.” </em>(164) The work is rich in imagery, and such other figurative languages as <strong><em>personification</em></strong>: <em>“The fridge breathed heavily in his ears”</em> (6), <em>“even the grass will fight…”</em> (171) <em>“Port Harcourt is going crazy”</em>(171); <strong><em>simile</em></strong>, <em>“shouting like madman”</em> (256), <em>“…she felt like a thief”</em> (270), <strong><em>metaphors</em></strong> <em>“so you will be spreading your legs for that elephant”</em>(35); and <strong><em>alliteration</em></strong>, <em>“fine fighting form”</em> (110), among others.</p> <p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p> <p>This study has carried out an investigation of the pragmatic processes by which implicit meanings of conversations conveyed are interpreted in the domestic contexts of language use in Adichie’s novel, <em>HOAYS, </em>within the ambit of Gricean theory of implicature. The study anchors Gricean pragmatics on a necessary recourse to the inference that hearers draw to arrive at a full understanding of what a speaker meant by an utterance, especially in those cases where what is meant goes well beyond the literal meaning of what is uttered. It then reveals that what a speaker meant in addition to what is said is therefore the extra-information conveyed dubbed implicature, which displays two dimensions in <strong><em>dido</em></strong> in the texts, namely, figurative expression with additional meaning and non-figurative expressions with additional meaning, that project the different thematic foci of Adichie in the domestic discourse in the texts. Implicatures of <strong><em>dido</em></strong> in <em>HYS</em>, on the other hand, thematise love, corruption and inhumanity, which are all communicated through figurative expressions, flouting the manner maxim. Tribalism is also thematised, using non-figurative expressions, with the quantity maxim being flouted<strong>.</strong></p> <p>This study on the exploration of the interaction between <strong><em>dido</em></strong> and implicit meaning in Adichie’s novel facilitates access to a context-sensitive understanding of domestic issues in the text, thereby revealing Adichie’s utilisations of pragmatic tools in espousing the domestic experiences of Nigerians and by extension, Africans, in the fictional realities she has refracted in her novels.</p> <p><strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong></p> <p>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (October 29, 2010).

In actual fact, the ever increasing</p> <p>mobility of the Internet the world over has opened yet other</p> <p>dimensions to the study of language use in computer-mediated</p> <p>environment. This has been attributed to the upsurge in the</p> <p>world’s telecommunication market and its antecedent</p> <p>penetration and adoption of the technology by the populace,</p> <p>coupled with the improvement of the network with the third</p> <p>generation (3G) mobile technology, which facilitates the</p> <p>convergence of the technologies of the mobile phones and that</p> <p>of the Internet. For instance, in 2006, Nigeria had an estimate</p> <p>of about 8 million Internet users, many of whom relied on</p> <p>equipment at cybercafés. In 2007, Internet hosts totaled 1,968.</p> <p>Akande, A. &amp; Odebunmi, A.</p> <p>40</p> <p>In 2006 more than 32.3 million mobile cellular telephones and</p> <p>1.7 million main lines were in use (International</p> <p>Telecommunication Union 2007). However, in 2010 with an</p> <p>estimated population of 150 million, there were 72.78 million</p> <p>active GSM subscribers on all the major networks, with 6.69</p> <p>million active CDMA subscribers. Within the estimated</p> <p>population of the country, there were 10 million Internet users</p> <p>(Miniwatts Marketing Group 2009). Of this estimation, 1.72</p> <p>million Nigerians are said to be on the Facebook, with</p> <p>penetration rate of 1.1%. Nigeria is thus among the leading</p> <p>subscribers in Africa which has a total Facebook population of</p> <p>17,607,440, with global penetration of 1.7% as at August 31,</p> <p>2010 (Internet World Statistics).</p> <p>These growing trends have provided opportunity to</p> <p>study human interactions as they occur across the computermediated</p> <p>environment. However, unlike before, when the study</p> <p>of human-human interactions through the new media</p> <p>technologies of the Internet and the cell phone restricted</p> <p>scholarship to the investigation of language use in the immobile</p> <p>technologies such as the world wide web, email, Yahoo/MSN’s</p> <p>instant messengers (IM or IM’ing), Listserve and short message</p> <p>service (texting) of the global system for mobiles (GSM). In</p> <p>Nigeria, these features have significantly been studied against</p> <p>theoretical frameworks of Conversation and Discourse Analysis</p> <p>Sociology of English in Nigeria</p> <p>41</p> <p>(Herring 2004a, 2004b), Pragmatics (Odebunmi 2009),</p> <p>Stylistics (Taiwo 2008) and Semiotics (Shoki and Oni 2008). It</p> <p>is therefore very significant to explore the implication of the</p> <p>mobility and ubiquity of the Internet on textual constructs and</p> <p>(English) language use of Nigerian in their interactions over the</p> <p>IM and the GSM-SMS platforms. This approach represents one</p> <p>of the contemporary methods of investigating human language</p> <p>textual constructs in computer-mediated communication.</p> <p>The approach in this chapter is to observe and quantify</p> <p>the lexical variations which afford mutual intelligibility and</p> <p>meaning making of the textual constructs of sampled</p> <p>interactions. Earlier studies in Nigeria IM and SMS studies</p> <p>have focused on the forms and functions of textual messages</p> <p>(Taiwo 2008), to the best of our knowledge, little or no</p> <p>attention has been focused on differentiating IM and SMS</p> <p>compositions with a view of understanding pattern of usage</p> <p>especially as it concerns second language users of the English</p> <p>language (Nigerians in this case). The central thesis is thus, to</p> <p>understand the characteristics of textual constructs of Nigerians</p> <p>as second language users of the English language, especially</p> <p>the lexical/sentential differences afforded by the technologies</p> <p>of transmission against their socio-linguistic backgrounds.</p> <p>Akande, A. &amp; Odebunmi, A.</p> <p>42</p> <p>An Overview of CMC Studies in Nigeria</p> <p>Scholarship into human-human interactions across digital</p> <p>platform did not start in Nigeria until the commercialization of</p> <p>the Internet and the GSM networks as earlier mentioned. This</p> <p>notwithstanding, Nigerians resident within and in the diaspora,</p> <p>have contributed immensely to the linguistic and</p> <p>anthropological researches of computer-mediated</p> <p>communication. Specifically, within the linguistic circle, giant</p> <p>strides have been made. Ifukor (forthcoming) has grouped</p> <p>Nigerian textual CMC activities and studies between 1990-</p> <p>2010 into three broad categories viz.</p> <p>(i) Web 1.0 communicative exchanges (e.g.</p> <p>Bastian, 1999; Blommaert &amp; Omoniyi, 2006;</p> <p>Chiluwa, 2009, 2010a; Deuber &amp; Hinrichs, 2007;</p> <p>Moran, 2000; Ofulue, 2010; Olateju &amp; Adeleke,</p> <p>2010; Oluwole, 2009), (ii) mobile telephony and</p> <p>text messaging (e.g. Awonusi, 2004, 2010;</p> <p>Chiluwa, 2008; Ekong &amp; Ekong, 2010; Elvis,</p> <p>2009; Obadare, 2006; Ofulue, 2008; Taiwo,</p> <p>2008a, 2008b) and (iii) social media and multiplatform</p> <p>Web 2.0 discourse (e.g. Ifukor, 2008,</p> <p>2009a, 2009b, 2010; Jonathan, 2010; Oni &amp;</p> <p>Osunbade, 2009; Taiwo, 2010a, 2010b) (cf. Ifukor</p> <p>2011a, 2011b). In terms of technological platform</p> <p>or mode in Murray’s, (1988) term, examples of</p> <p>Nigerian CMC include mobile phone text</p> <p>messaging (Awonusi, 2004, 2010; Chiluwa, 2008;</p> <p>Ifukor, 2011a; Ofulue, 2008; Taiwo, 2008a,</p> <p>2008b); Instant Messaging (Oni &amp; Osunbade,</p> <p>Sociology of English in Nigeria</p> <p>43</p> <p>2009); email (Blommaert &amp; Omoniyi, 2006;</p> <p>Chiluwa, 2009, 2010a, 2010b; Ofulue, 2010;</p> <p>Olateju &amp; Adeleke, 2010); listserv (Bastian,</p> <p>1999); Usenet newsgroup (Moran, 2000); Internet</p> <p>discussion forums (Deuber &amp; Hinrichs, 2007;</p> <p>Ifukor, 2011b; Taiwo, 2010a, 2010b); blog</p> <p>(Ifukor, 2008, 2009a, 2009b, 2010); Twitter</p> <p>(Ifukor, 2010, 2011c); Facebook (Ifukor, 2011d;</p> <p>Jonathan, 2010), and surveys on CMC usage</p> <p>(Ifukor, 2011a; Oluwole, 2009; Pyramid Research,</p> <p>2010; Sesan, 2010).</p> <p>It suffices to say that the year 2010 represents another landmark</p> <p>in CMC scholarship in Nigerian due to the following four</p> <p>reasons as pointed out in Ifukor (forthcoming),</p> <p>First, Taiwo (2010c) published two edited</p> <p>volumes of a handbook on digital behaviours</p> <p>consisting of, among the collection, 16 papers</p> <p>(single and co-authored) on various aspects of</p> <p>text-based Nigerian CMC. Therefore, Taiwo's</p> <p>(2010c) handbook represents the single largest</p> <p>collection on Nigerian CMC to date. Second, it is</p> <p>the same year that published works on Nigerian</p> <p>social networking media (Ifukor, 2010; Jonathan,</p> <p>2010) emerged. For instance, Ifukor's (2010)</p> <p>paper on electoral activities by Nigerians in the</p> <p>blogosphere and Twittersphere highlights the</p> <p>relevance of blogging and social media to modern</p> <p>Nigerian democratization. Thirdly, beginning</p> <p>from his inaugural post on Facebook on June 28,</p> <p>2010, President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan (GEJ)</p> <p>experimented with what, for want of a better</p> <p>Akande, A. &amp; Odebunmi, A.</p> <p>44</p> <p>terminology, can be called the first Nigerian</p> <p>Facebook presidency. On October 1, 2010 CNN</p> <p>named GEJ the Facebook President. This is a</p> <p>remarkable endorsement of not just the person of</p> <p>the Nigerian president, but also of how a global</p> <p>product (Facebook) is being appropriated for</p> <p>internal governance in Nigeria. Eventually, a book</p> <p>based on GEJ's interactions with Nigerian netizens</p> <p>was published and titled My Friends and I:</p> <p>Conversations on Policy and Governance via</p> <p>Facebook (Jonathan, 2010). It is argued here that</p> <p>the embrace of new media technologies by the</p> <p>Nigerian government has ushered in a new era of</p> <p>Nigerian politics, reflecting modern trends in</p> <p>digitally-aided democratization. Finally, but not</p> <p>the least, two national surveys on the digital habits</p> <p>of connected Nigerians were released by Pyramid</p> <p>Research (2010) and Sesan (2010) in the same</p> <p>year.</p> <p>Examining the thrusts of contents of the Taiwo's (2010c)</p> <p>sixteen-chapter handbook in relation to Nigeria, 18.75% of the</p> <p>papers (i.e. Chiluwa, 2010b; Ofulue, 2010; Olateju &amp; Adeleke,</p> <p>2010), examine aspects of Nigerian email communication for</p> <p>identity construction, 419 or hoaxes, and code switching. 37.5</p> <p>percent of the papers (i.e. Akande &amp; Akinwale, 2010; Balogun,</p> <p>2010; Odebunmi &amp; Alo, 2010; Olaosun, 2010; Olubode-Sawe,</p> <p>2010; Taiwo, 2010c) dwell on mobile telephony and SMS as</p> <p>follows: with a view of stressing their positions on the</p> <p>implications of the leprous compositions of the Nigerian</p> <p>Sociology of English in Nigeria</p> <p>45</p> <p>students on written communication as well as contextual beliefs</p> <p>in the 160-character discourse by Nigerian academics, an Ecosemiotic</p> <p>examination of visual codes in mobile phone</p> <p>directories, typography and orthographic conventions in</p> <p>Yoruba NOKIA phone terminologies, and language mixing for</p> <p>phaticity and invocations. The remaining papers (43.75%) are</p> <p>concerned with pedagogical and systemic issues.</p> <p>As rich as all the previous Nigerian CMC studies are,</p> <p>none have focused on the differences in textual compositions of</p> <p>Nigerian Internet users due to notable constraints and</p> <p>affordances of the CMC, notably the mobility, synchronicity</p> <p>and transmission capability of the technologies involve in IM</p> <p>and SMS. This gap will hope to fill in this study.</p> <p>A Brief Account of Lexico-semantic Studies in Nigeria</p> <p>(English)</p> <p>Lexico-semantics (lexical semantics) is an important theory of</p> <p>linguistic description which has gained scholarly attention in</p> <p>earlier works (cf Bamgbose, 1971; Bokamba, 1982; Adegbija,</p> <p>1989; Osunbade and Adeniji, 2005). Alabi (2007), cited in</p> <p>Osunbade and Adeniji (2005:46), lexical creativity, deviations</p> <p>or interference have been noticed in these studies as accounting</p> <p>for lexico-semantic innovations. The crux of lexico-semantics</p> <p>(lexical semantics) is word description, that is, what words</p> <p>Akande, A. &amp; Odebunmi, A.</p> <p>46</p> <p>mean. The three levels of linguistic description of text can be</p> <p>the substance, form or the context of the text (Chiluwa, 2007)</p> <p>explains further:</p> <p>The graphic substance is studied as orthography or</p> <p>graphology. A graphological or graphetic study</p> <p>focuses on the written form of the text to examine</p> <p>the significance of handwriting or typography to</p> <p>the general meaning of text. The form of the text is</p> <p>the grammatical or lexical patterns, or the</p> <p>organization of the graphic and phonic substances</p> <p>to produce meaningful language. Context or</p> <p>semantic is the interaction of substance and form</p> <p>with the situation – a place within a framework of</p> <p>human social activity wider than the text</p> <p>(Gregory, 1974). “Here language transforms itself</p> <p>to become a meaningful part of our human social</p> <p>behaviour (Oyeleye, 1997:90). Semantics is</p> <p>viewed in terms of social meaning; hence, “lexicosemantic”</p> <p>is taken for granted as the general</p> <p>reference to grammatical and lexical statements</p> <p>and what they signify.</p> <p>By and large, lexico-semantics studies the meanings of</p> <p>words; and the focus is on ‘content words’ rather than</p> <p>‘grammatical words’ (Cruse, 2000:25). Some aspects of lexicosemantics</p> <p>have a unifying theme of the idea that only the</p> <p>meaning of words in terms of their association with other words</p> <p>(syntagmatic relations) is stated, while some other aspects are</p> <p>concerned with relation of ‘senses’ between words (see Palmer,</p> <p>Sociology of English in Nigeria</p> <p>47</p> <p>1996). The overall theme is that the meanings of words can be</p> <p>stated.</p> <p>Various works that examined meanings of words in</p> <p>African English have earmarked certain lexico-semantic</p> <p>innovations such as semantic shift, semantic extension,</p> <p>semantic transfer, and deliberate borrowing (cf. Kirk-Greene</p> <p>1971, Sey 1973, Bokamba 1982, Adegbija, 1989; etc.). With</p> <p>respect to Nigerian English (NE), Jowitt (1991:130-131)</p> <p>identifies eight lexico-semantics features namely local coinages</p> <p>that conform with Standard English (SE) morphological</p> <p>principles, extended or restricted meanings of SE words,</p> <p>foregrounded SE words additional to those featuring in 2,</p> <p>foregrounded SE words which have become clichés, words</p> <p>derived from pidgin, loan words, slang, and stylistic usage that</p> <p>differs from SE usage. Showing a negative attitude towards</p> <p>NE, he calls these features constituents/indexical markers of</p> <p>popular Nigerian English (PNE). According to Jowitt (ibid:63),</p> <p>PNE is an English which has, in its repertoire, lexical items that</p> <p>have passed through a stage of use of an interlanguage during</p> <p>which they are regarded as errors and stigmatized before</p> <p>having some measures of acceptability, especially among the</p> <p>educated people. Referring to them as ‘types of lexico-semantic</p> <p>variations’, Odebunmi (2001:70-73) also identifies and</p> <p>discusses five other features of the lexico-semantic variation in</p> <p>Akande, A. &amp; Odebunmi, A.</p> <p>48</p> <p>NE: transfer, neologism, analogy, abbronyms, semantic shift</p> <p>and extension.</p> <p>Bamiro (1994) equally identifies ten categories of</p> <p>lexico-semantic variation in NE: loan shift, semantic underdifferentiation,</p> <p>lexico-semantic duplication and redundancy,</p> <p>ellipsis, conversion, clipping, acronyms, translation equivalent,</p> <p>analogical creation and coinages. Also, Osunbade (2005:64)</p> <p>employs categories from the submissions of various scholars</p> <p>and identifies six lexico-semantic features of Nigerian English,</p> <p>which he adapts to his study of Kegites’ English. These</p> <p>features are semantic extension, semantic shift, coinages,</p> <p>lexical borrowing, alphabetism and narrowing of meaning.</p> <p>This study, however, draws on earlier categorization of</p> <p>text messaging (Shoki and Oni 2008) and Taiwo (2008) for its</p> <p>data categories, while the unit of analysis are different lengths</p> <p>of transactions representing interactions (for IM) and a-unit</p> <p>message culled from the sampled text messages of the</p> <p>respondents.</p> <p>Methodology and Corpus</p> <p>In this study, we adopted content analysis for the quantification</p> <p>of the manifest signs. The data for this study were natural oneto-</p> <p>one instant messaging (IM) exchanges on Yahoo! Messenger</p> <p>program™ retrieved from undergraduate students of three</p> <p>Sociology of English in Nigeria</p> <p>49</p> <p>Nigerian universities who were taking courses in Use of</p> <p>English and five manually written (as they were) recent text</p> <p>messages i.e. SMS. Subjects were asked to record these in sheet</p> <p>of papers provided for them. At the end of the writing session</p> <p>the first 75 messages submitted were re-typed in word</p> <p>processing for analyzing.</p> <p>The three universities were University of Ibadan,</p> <p>Ibadan, Nigeria and Ladoke Akintola University of</p> <p>Technology, Ogbomoso, Nigeria and Osun State University</p> <p>(the Ikire campus), Nigeria. These three institutions were</p> <p>selected on the basis of convenience. The subsets (mostly fresh</p> <p>students with science and humanities backgrounds) were</p> <p>purposively selected for the study. The choice of student</p> <p>population for the study is informed by research which reports</p> <p>that students constitute more than 70 percent of the Net users in</p> <p>Nigeria (Oni, 2002). These subjects were persuaded by the</p> <p>researcher, who also happened to be their full and part-time</p> <p>lecturer to forward, as an attachment, logs of their chat</p> <p>conversations on Yahoo! IM program to the email account of</p> <p>the researchers for language and media research purposes. The</p> <p>choice of an attachment format as against the regular copypaste-</p> <p>and-save method for the IM was to retain all the textual</p> <p>features of the interactions which were vital to the analysis. The</p> <p>retrieval rate was high, and in the first two weeks of the</p> <p>Akande, A. &amp; Odebunmi, A.</p> <p>50</p> <p>announcement, over 150 logs of instant messages on diverse</p> <p>topics and of various lengths, were downloaded. These were</p> <p>exchanges between/among Nigerians. The log-files were</p> <p>printed and the exchanges numbered to differentiate each</p> <p>distinct line of discourse. For the ease of analysis (due to the</p> <p>size and formulaic nature of the exchanges) 75 instant</p> <p>messages, representing half of the exchanges retrieved in the</p> <p>first two weeks of announcement, were purposively selected</p> <p>and subsequently sampled for the task of the study. This data</p> <p>gathering procedure facilitates anonymity of the subject and,</p> <p>consequently, reliability of the data because most of them</p> <p>construct pseudonymous identities for e-chat and their e-mail</p> <p>addresses.</p> <p>Presentation and Discussion of Findings</p> <p>For the first dimension, instances of abbronyms (after</p> <p>Odebunmi, 1996) which include acronyms, abbreviations, and</p> <p>other multifarious shortenings (such as alphabetism and alphanumeric</p> <p>surrogates) were accounted for across the two sets of</p> <p>data. These represent the linguistic signs. Subsequently,</p> <p>percentage representations of both the non linguistic and</p> <p>linguistic items were presented. The findings are presented in</p> <p>table 1 and 2:</p> <p>Sociology of English in Nigeria</p> <p>51</p> <p>Table 1 showing percentage distribution of IM and SMS</p> <p>per transmission.</p> <p>S/N CMC Features % Distribution per</p> <p>Transmission</p> <p>IM’ing (N=75)</p> <p>2715 words</p> <p>Texting</p> <p>(N=75) 10745</p> <p>1 Abbronyms 52 (17%) 620 (74%)</p> <p>2 Vocal Segregates</p> <p>(emotext &amp; vexts)</p> <p>45 (14%) 14 (2%)</p> <p>3 Ellipses (…) 40 (13%) 23 (3%)</p> <p>4 Pidgin (as</p> <p>expressions)</p> <p>26 (8%) 19 (2%)</p> <p>5 Neologism (slang) 24 (8%) 13 (2%)</p> <p>6 Contractions (e.g.</p> <p>can’t)</p> <p>74 (24%) 117 (14%)</p> <p>7 Emoticons 9 (3%) 2 (0%)</p> <p>8 Code switching 16 (5%) 2 (0%)</p> <p>9 Code mixing 26 (8%) 24 (3%)</p> <p>252 834</p> <p>In Table 1 above, texting has the predominance of CMC</p> <p>with differential rate of 3.3. This is evident in the abundant</p> <p>representation of abbronymization (abbreviations, acronyms</p> <p>and various other multifarious lexical shortenings) 74%,</p> <p>Akande, A. &amp; Odebunmi, A.</p> <p>52</p> <p>compared to that of IM’ing with 17%. Text messages averaged</p> <p>8.2 words, while IM transmissions averaged 6.9. Recall that for</p> <p>IM transmissions, sequencing of consecutive transmissions is</p> <p>common. Therefore, while individual text messages were</p> <p>longer than individual IMs, average length of a complete</p> <p>conversational turn was longer in IM due to sequential nature</p> <p>of the text (threading). Thus, the average number of characters</p> <p>per transmission in the texting data was also significantly larger</p> <p>than in IM’ing. Text messages averaged almost 65 characters,</p> <p>while the IM mean was just under 39 characters. Another factor</p> <p>contributing to message length is one-word transmissions.</p> <p>There were significantly fewer one-word text messages (5 out</p> <p>of 75, or 6.6%) than one-word IMs (45 out of 75, or 60%).</p> <p>Almost 95% of texting transmissions contained multiple</p> <p>sentences, compared with 25% of the IM transmissions. The</p> <p>average number of sentences per text-message was 1.2, while</p> <p>that of IM was 2.7. Since IMs are commonly sent as</p> <p>consecutive transmissions without added cost, this finding is</p> <p>not surprising.</p> <p>Due to the socio-linguistic backgrounds of the</p> <p>interlocutors, Pidgin, slang code-switching and code-mixing</p> <p>form part of the textual constructs of the Nigerian net users.</p> <p>Their representation in the corpus further shows the informal</p> <p>Sociology of English in Nigeria</p> <p>53</p> <p>context of the CMC written communication and uniqueness of</p> <p>language use by Nigerians in these media.</p> <p>Table 2 showing results of quantitative analysis of signs</p> <p>NON LINGUISTIC LEXEMES LINGUISTIC LEXEMES</p> <p>Emoticons, Emotexts &amp; Vowel</p> <p>Extension (vexts)</p> <p>Abbronyms (Acronyms, Abbreviations</p> <p>&amp; Other Multifarious Shortening of</p> <p>Lexemes</p> <p>Freq. of</p> <p>Occurrence</p> <p>Av.

Of the total number of</p> <p>messages sampled (N=75) texting occurred 1044 times almost</p> <p>doubling average frequency of occurrence in IM’ing with 729</p> <p>times. Emoticons and vocal segregates (emotexts and vowel</p> <p>extension) – all representing the non linguistic vocal</p> <p>segregates, on the other hand, occurred at the average rate of</p> <p>2.76 per message for IM’ing and 1.2 for texting. There is less</p> <p>representation of emoticons and vocal segregates in texting</p> <p>Akande, A. &amp; Odebunmi, A.</p> <p>54</p> <p>4.4% per message transmission, with average frequency of</p> <p>occurrence at 1.2. The frequency of occurrence for the non</p> <p>linguistic signs was 207 times. This means that the total</p> <p>average frequency of occurrence for all the IM textual signs is</p> <p>12.48. Based on these findings, we can infer that computermediated</p> <p>communication of instant messaging has its</p> <p>peculiarities in the textual signs such as emoticons, emotexts,</p> <p>vowel/letter extension and abbronyms, even in an ESL country</p> <p>like Nigeria. Nigerian students thus construct and interpret</p> <p>messages with the shared assumption of these CMC lexemes.</p> <p>One can also conclude that a IM constructed by an average</p> <p>Nigerian student would reflect predominance of lexical signs</p> <p>(abbronyms) over visual signs (emoticons) and much less of</p> <p>these occurrences for text messaging over the mobile phones.</p> <p>Some of the instances of the linguistic and non linguistic signs</p> <p>are presented, as extracts, as follows:</p> <p>bjrealme: hw sister?</p> <p>bjrealme: na you i should ask</p> <p>bjrealme: una no c each order?</p> <p>westsideoutlawzus2p: stop posting me joo</p> <p>5 westsideoutlawzus2p: na me suppose ask u dat</p> <p>bjrealme: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</p> <p>bjrealme: 8-x</p> <p>bjrealme: you funny ohhh</p> <p>bjrealme: no be ur babe</p> <p>10 bjrealme: you go dey contact each orda now</p> <p>westsideoutlawzus2p: wel no b say i no dey</p> <p>here 4rm her but jst 2 ask abt her welfare</p> <p>bjrealme: she should be in good condition</p> <p>Sociology of English in Nigeria</p> <p>55</p> <p>westsideoutlawzus2p: aw abt ur admision</p> <p>15 bjrealme: you don finish exams'</p> <p>westsideoutlawzus2p: yes</p> <p>bjrealme: we just go do post jamb</p> <p>(EXCHANGE 15)</p> <p>The same goes for extracts 2 (Exchanges 15). Move 7</p> <p>Exchange 15 shows an instance of emoticon, moves 14, 19, and</p> <p>20 show instances of abbronyms peculiar to Instant Messages</p> <p>which interactants may have shared assuption of.</p> <p>It suffices to say here that findings from the sampled</p> <p>text corroborate results of earlier studies on some systems of</p> <p>CMC, especially the email and newsgroup. It has been found</p> <p>that email and e-chat have a peculiar linguistic structure</p> <p>stemming from the use of multifarious word formation</p> <p>processes, emoticons and abbronyms being part of this. These</p> <p>signs make CMC text in Instant Messaging program to appear</p> <p>more like speech than writing communication (cf. Hunnicut</p> <p>and Magnuson, 2001; Sjoberg, 2001; McElhearn, 2000) and</p> <p>much different from that of the text messaging. Let us consider</p> <p>an extract of the sampled text messages:</p> <p>Watz goan, be reminded that our</p> <p>general meeting holds Tue 17/7. Also</p> <p>our society harvest is same day at 9am</p> <p>mass. Pls come wt gifts O! NO</p> <p>SHAKING!Enjoy ya weekend</p> <p>Akande, A. &amp; Odebunmi, A.</p> <p>56</p> <p>Contractions (operationalized here as the use of</p> <p>apostrophe and excludes the possessive case) which typically</p> <p>appear in informal speech and writing are examined. The</p> <p>reason for the analysis stems from the fact that this category of</p> <p>contraction is shorter to type than the full forms, especially</p> <p>when omitting the apostrophe. In computer-based IM,</p> <p>apostrophes require only a single keystroke, while needing four</p> <p>key taps on mobile phones. We calculated percent of full and</p> <p>contracted forms against total potential contractions. For</p> <p>apostrophes, we scored only use in contractions, not</p> <p>possessives. In texting, 14% of all potential contractions were</p> <p>contracted. In IM, only 24% were contracted. Mispells were not</p> <p>accounted for in our quantification and these were much. Being</p> <p>fresher students, it is assumed that the subjects are still battling</p> <p>with the mechanics of the English language.</p> <p>In the dimension for the analysis of punctuation,</p> <p>punctuation at the ends of transmissions and the ends of</p> <p>sentences was examined. We also tallied use of question marks</p> <p>at the ends of semantically-interrogative sentences in</p> <p>comparison with use of periods, exclamation marks, or</p> <p>equivalent punctuation (ellipses, dashes, commas, and</p> <p>emoticons) at the ends of declaratives, imperatives, or</p> <p>exclamations. Texting and IM followed similar patterns, with</p> <p>the proportion of texting punctuation always lower than in IM.</p> <p>Sociology of English in Nigeria</p> <p>57</p> <p>Total sentence-final punctuation was 39% for texting and 45%</p> <p>for IM. Transmission-final punctuation appeared in only 29%</p> <p>of text messages and 35% of IMs. However, for transmissions</p> <p>containing multiple sentences, the sentences not appearing at</p> <p>the ends of transmissions had more sentence-final punctuation:</p> <p>54% of text messages and 78% of IMs, Logically,</p> <p>transmission-medial punctuation is more critical than</p> <p>transmission-final marks in helping recipients interpret</p> <p>messages. In most cases, the act of sending a message coincides</p> <p>with sentence-final punctuation.</p> <p>To compare question marks and periods (or equivalent</p> <p>marks), we divided each corpus into two categories: semantic</p> <p>questions and “other”. More question marks were used to end</p> <p>semantic questions than periods (or equivalents) to end other</p> <p>sentence types. In texting, 23% semantic questions were ended</p> <p>with a question mark, while only 10% of “other” bore sentencefinal</p> <p>punctuation. In IM, all (52%) of questions ended in</p> <p>question marks, while only 41% of the remaining sentences</p> <p>were punctuated. More frequent use of “required” question</p> <p>marks may pragmatically highlight the request for a response</p> <p>from the recipient.</p> <p>Akande, A. &amp; Odebunmi, A.</p> <p>58</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Analyses of texting and IM’ing against the socio-linguistic</p> <p>backgrounds of second language user (English) much enabled</p> <p>as a result of the mobility of the Internet in today’s media</p> <p>landscape have shown peculiarities in the textual constructs of</p> <p>Nigerian students. The paucity of emoticons and heavy use of</p> <p>abbronymizations in both texting and IM corpora is not in</p> <p>consonant with studies of this nature in North America (Ling</p> <p>and Baron 2007) and the UK (Thurlow and Brown 2003).</p> <p>However, sameness in the previous reports on sentential</p> <p>punctuation in texting or IM’ing, shows the degree to which</p> <p>affordances and constraints of the CMC media affect uniformly</p> <p>English language constructs and meaning making in online</p> <p>platforms. Findings have shown that usage patterns are hardly</p> <p>contrastive. Ling and Baron (2007) notes that students often</p> <p>omitted transmission-final marks (especially periods), but their</p> <p>overall punctuation choices tended to be communicatively</p> <p>pragmatic. The fact punctuation was consistently more</p> <p>prevalent in IM than in texting probably reflects greater ease of</p> <p>input in IM. It is however worthy of note that student approach</p> <p>textual composition with differences in their competence level.</p> <p>More so, text messages were consistently longer and contained</p> <p>more sentences, probably resulting from both differential</p> <p>costing structures and the tendency of IM sequences (but not</p> <p>Sociology of English in Nigeria</p> <p>59</p> <p>texts) to be sent in series one after the end to form threads and</p> <p>turn sequences. Text messages contained significantly more</p> <p>abbreviations than IMs, but even the number in texting was</p> <p>small.</p> <p>Texting and IM’ing data, therefore, are in tangential</p> <p>with respect to contractions and apostrophes: more contractions</p> <p>appeared in texting, but texting used only one-third the</p> <p>apostrophes found in IM. Greater use of contractions in texting</p> <p>could reflect the higher tendency to use abbreviated forms to</p> <p>save cost (compared with IM’ing), which in turn is in</p> <p>consonance with an awkward input device of the mobile phone,</p> <p>even with qwert-keyboarded phones. The same applies to</p> <p>apostrophes in texting.</p> <p>References</p> <p>Adegbija, Efurosibina. 1989.

Literary piece (such as novels) somehow contain meaning of style with language; effectively manipulated in ways that signal it as different from “ordinary” language. A stylistic analysis of Chimamanda Adichie’s “Purple Hibiscus” (2003) and Chinua Achebe’s “Anthills of the Savannah” (1987) is carried out to educate, explicate and expose everybody that come across this paper, in guiding them on how to analyse and understand these prose texts. It also examines the uniqueness of stylistics as it concerns both the combination of linguistics and literary study of the texts being reviewed. The data used to illustrate and substantiates our claims are systematically sourced from the selected Nigerian prose texts earlier mentioned. The lexico-semantic patterns and choices, the phonological, morphological, syntactic and graphological devices are the main stylistic elements coupled with rigorous in-depth analysis of the figurative language employed in selected prose texts which are used to prove our claims. Finally, we find that each of the elements however, has identifiable functions which contribute to the effective meaning of the texts. Therefore, it can be concluded that these elements trigger and play important roles in passing the intention of the writers/authors across their audience. Comparatively, this research discovers that Adichie borrows a lot from Achebe’s manner of writing in simple free-flow linguistic and stylistic presentations, there is, nevertheless, a wide disparity in their sexist beliefs and ideological orientations. This implies that; while Achebe tends towards phallocentric predilection, Adichie subtly differs by pitching a camp with her gender lot – Feminism. This creates a wide valley between the two mountains.</em></p> <p><strong>Keywords: </strong>Stylistics, language, figurative language, syntax, graphology, lexico-semantics…</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Stylistics has always had a hard time of it. As an academic discipline it has always been seen, pretty much throughout the twentieth century, as neither one thing nor the other, or, much worse, as all things to all men and women, as sitting uncomfortably on the fence between the linguistic and the literary, and as a bit uneasy within either domain, building bridges that never quite stretch far enough across dividing waters and always, as here, resorting to retreat, repair and reconciliation metaphors of bridges, unfilled gaps and spaces, crossing contested territories, unhappy marriages and paths not taken. In the 1960s and 1970s this was in part to be expected for an essentially inchoate interdisciplinary endeavour. Linguists felt stylistics was too soft to be taken too seriously and tended to introduce irrelevant notions such as performance data and interpretation; literature specialists felt that stylistics was too hard, too mechanistic and too reductive, saying nothing significant about historical context or aesthetic theory, eschewing evaluation for the most part in the interests of a naïve scientism and claiming too much for interpretations that were at best merely text-immanent. And many linguists and literary critics continue to this day to give stylistics a hard time. But, for better or for worse, stylisticians have stayed together. Although, there have been few divorces or major disagreements within the family (G. Watson and S, Zyngier, 2007: R. Carter, 2007).</p> <p>However, stylistics as a term as generally been referred to as the study of style and language. The concept of style itself has had a troubled history in the modern period both within and outside literary study. It has commonly been argued that, we use the term ‘style’ without knowing its meaning. The Work of literature is written and presented in many ways in order to bring out its creative nature. To achieve this, the writer uses his peculiar manners, choice of words and form in presenting his message. This is what is known as style. Style therefore is the peculiar way in which something is done (Nnaji, 2014).</p> <p>Simpson (2004:2) defines style as “a method of textual interpretation in which primary of place is assigned to language”. This shows that language is the key point in stylistic because a writer employs various forms and patterns of language while presenting his message.</p> <p>Stylistics is the description and analysis of the variability of linguistic forms in actual language use. The concepts of ‘style’ and ‘stylistic variation’ in language rest on the general assumption that within the language system, the same content can be encoded in more than one linguistic form. Operating at all linguistic levels (e.g. lexicology, syntax, text linguistics and intonation), stylisticians analyse both the style of specific texts and stylistic variation across texts. These texts can be literary or non-literary in nature. Generally speaking, style may be regarded as a choice of linguistic means; as deviation from a norm; as recurrence of linguistic forms and as comparison.</p> <p>Azuike (1992) in Nnaji (2014) identifies the following rubrics to guide one in stylistic analysis. They are: “Style as a deviation from the norm, style as individual, style as content and form, style as choice, style as a product of context, style as good and beautiful writing”.</p> <p>Style as choice, as one of the six rubrics forms, is the focus of this work. This means that an individual can adopt a special way of writing to make his work unique. Often times, the author’s identity is given away by some details reflecting, habit of expression or thought, and these seem to confirm that each writer has a linguistic ‘thumb-print’, an individual combination of linguistic habits which somehow betrays him in all that he writes. Accordingly, it is a writer’s idiosyncratic way of expressing himself or herself, it is an offshoot of his or her personality.</p> <p>Style may be said to relate communicative performance, which is the demonstration of the speaker’s or writer’s language capacity in generating and understanding specific communicative contexts. Stylistics therefore is the study of style. But style itself, by its nature, is a subject of debate. This paper is thus an attempt to investigate the style of writings of these two authors that make their works distinct from their contemporaries.</p> <p>● <strong>PLOT (PURPLE HIBISCUS)</strong></p> <p>Kambili Achike, the narrator, is a fifteen-year-old girl living in Enugu, Nigeria with her father, Eugene (Papa), mother, Beatrice (Mama), and older brother, Chukwuku (Jaja). The novel begins on Palm Sunday. Jaja refuses to receive communion at church, and Papa throws his missal, breaking Mama’s beloved <strong>figurines</strong>. Kambili then explains the events leading up to this scene. Papa, a wealthy factory owner, is an active philanthropist in public and an upstanding Catholic, but at home is a strict and violent authoritarian. He publishes a newspaper, the <em>Standard</em>, which is the only paper willing to criticize the new Nigerian Head of State.</p> <p>Mama gets pregnant. After Mass one day the family visits Father Benedict, their white priest. Mama feels sick and doesn’t want to leave the car. When they return home Papa beats Mama until she has a miscarriage. Later Kambili takes her exams and comes second in her class, disappointing Papa. At Christmas the family goes to their home village of Abba. Papa’s father, Papa-Nnukwu, lives there, but Papa doesn’t speak to him because his father sticks to his traditional religion and won’t become Catholic. Kambili and Jaja visit Papa-Nnukwu briefly. Aunty Ifeoma, Papa’s widowed sister and a university professor, arrives in Abba as well. She seems fearless and willing to criticize both Papa and the government. Her children; Amaka, Obiora, and Chima: are precocious and outspoken.</p> <p>Ifeoma takes Jaja and Kambili to an Igbo festival. On Christmas Papa feeds the whole village. The next day Papa catches Kambili breaking the “Eucharist fast” as she eats some food along with a painkiller she needs to take for menstrual cramps, and he beats her, Jaja, and Mama. Ifeoma convinces Papa to let Jaja and Kambili visit her in Nsukka. Kambili and Jaja arrive and are surprised by Ifeoma’s poverty, but also the constant laughter in her house. Jaja is fascinated by the purple hibiscuses in Ifeoma’s garden. Father Amadi, a young, handsome Nigerian priest, comes to dinner.</p> <p>As the days progress Jaja opens up, though Kambili remains silent and confused. Ifeoma hears that Papa-Nnukwu is sick, and she fetches him from Abba. Amaka starts painting a picture of him. Father Amadi visits often, and Kambili finds herself attracted to him. One morning Kambili observes Papa-Nnukwu’s morning ritual, which is similar to Catholic confession.</p> <p>Father Amadi takes Kambili to the local stadium. He makes her chase after him and tries to get her to talk. Kambili is confused by her feelings and his “unpriestly” demeanor. Papa finds out that Papa-Nnukwu is staying in the house. The next morning the family discover that Papa-Nnukwu has died in his sleep. Papa takes Jaja and Kambili back to Enugu, and Amaka gives Kambili her painting. Papa punishes Jaja and Kambili for not telling him they were staying in the same apartment as their grandfather, a pagan, by pouring boiling water on their feet. Papa and his editor, Ade Coker, decide to run a controversial story in the <em>Standard</em>. Soon after, Ade Coker is assassinated with a package bomb.</p> <p>One day Kambili and Jaja are looking at the painting of Papa-Nnukwu when Papa comes in. He beats Kambili severely, and she wakes up in the hospital. Papa agrees to let Jaja and Kambili return to Nsukka. Ifeoma worries about losing her job for speaking out against the “sole administrator” appointed by the government. The university closes after a student riot. Men ransack Ifeoma’s flat, trying to intimidate her. Kambili falls more deeply in love with Father Amadi, who seems attracted to her.</p> <p>Mama arrives one day after being beaten into another miscarriage. Papa takes his family home, and the next day is the Palm Sunday on which the novel begins, when Jaja stands up to Papa. After Palm Sunday there is less fear and silence in the house. Ifeoma calls to say that she has been fired and is moving to America. Jaja and Kambili return to Nsukka. Ifeoma takes them on a pilgrimage to Aokpe, where Kambili sees visions of the Virgin Mary and reaffirms her faith. Father Amadi leaves to do missionary work, and Kambili weeps and confesses her love to him. Ifeoma gets a visa and prepares to leave Nigeria. Papa is found dead at his desk, and they all go to Enugu. When Papa’s autopsy is complete, Mama says that she poisoned him. The police arrive and Jaja takes responsibility for the crime.</p> <p>Three years later, Kambili and Mama visit Jaja in prison to tell him he will be released soon. Mama has grown withdrawn and rarely speaks. After the visit, Kambili feels hopeful about the future.</p> <p>●       <strong>PLOT (ANTHILLS OF THE SAVANNAH)</strong></p> <p><strong>Part I</strong></p> <p>Set in the fictitious West African country of Kangan, <em>Anthills of the Savannah </em>opens with a meeting of the regime's president and his Cabinet. The government has been in place for two years, since a coup overthrew the former dictator. Three men, friends since childhood, have assumed important positions in the new system. Sam is the president, Chris Oriko is the Commissioner of Information, and Ikem Osodi is the editor of the government controlled newspaper, the <em>National Gazette. </em>Ikem is an intellectual and a poet who is very outspoken about the need to reform the government. Chris acts as a mediator between Ikem and Sam.</p> <p>Sam has become a leader without regard for his people, seeking only to acquire more power for himself by any means necessary. Chris and Ikem realize that Sam is rapidly becoming a dictator. They helped get him appointed to the position, even encouraging him when he felt that his military background was inadequate preparation for a position of such importance. Now, Chris and Ikem regret their previous support of their friend and seek to control Sam in their own ways. Meanwhile, Sam's obsession with power has made him paranoid and temperamental. When Sam decides he wants to be elected \"President−for−Life,\" a national referendum is called but the region of Abazon refuses to participate. Sam in turn denies the region access to water despite a drought, expecting that without water or food the people will give in. When delegates from Abazon arrive at the capital on a mission for mercy, Sam suspects that they are actually planning an insurrection. In fact, his paranoia leads him to believe that the insurrection is being assisted by someone close to him.</p> <p>Although Chris is aware of how dangerous Sam is becoming, he believes that by staying in his government position he can serve his country. Meanwhile, Ikem's editorials are becoming more radical, and Chris tries to convince him to tone them down.</p> <p>Ikem has a girlfriend, Elewa, who is semiliterate and works in a shop. She is pregnant with his child. Chris's fiancee, Beatrice, is a well−educated woman who holds a position as administrator for one of the state offices. She has known Ikem since youth and works for Sam, so she has connections to all of the major characters. She observes the government's activities and Chris's and Ikem's reactions, and feels that she is the only one sensitive enough to truly understand the situation. She expresses to Chris and Ikem that they are approaching the problem incorrectly because they are not really connecting to the people and the land.</p> <p><strong>Part II</strong></p> <p>Sam commands Chris to fire Ikem from his position as editor, at which point Chris responds in a highly unusual way—he refuses to obey Sam's order. Sam believes that Ikem is involved in the \"protest\" staged by the delegates of Abazon, but Chris knows better. Still, Ikem is fired and soon after addresses a student group at a university. Never one to hold his tongue, he is very vocal about his criticism of the government. He makes a joke about the regime minting coins with Sam's head on them, which is turned into propaganda claiming that Ikem has called for the beheading of the president. Ikem is taken from his home in the middle of the night and shot and killed by the state police.</p> <p><strong>Part III</strong></p> <p>Chris realizes just how dangerous Sam has become and goes into hiding after using his contacts within the international press to publicize the truth about Ikem's murder. With the help of Emmanuel, a student leader who greatly admires Chris; Abdul, a sympathetic cab driver; and a small covert network of supporters, Chris is able to escape the capital city of Bassa by bus and head for Abazon. Meanwhile, the government orders Chris's arrest and threatens anyone found to be withholding information about him.</p> <p>On the bus trip, Chris begins to feel reconnected to his native land and Emmanuel meets a beautiful student named Adamma. The bus is stopped by a mob caught up in a drunken frenzy. They are celebrating the news that Sam has been killed and his regime overthrown in another coup. As Chris and the other bus passengers make their way through the crowd, gathering bits of information, Chris sees Adamma being dragged off by a soldier to be raped. Chris rushes to her rescue, and the soldier shoots and kills him.</p> <p><strong>Part IV</strong></p> <p>Emmanuel, Abdul, and Adamma return to Bassa to tell Beatrice and the others what has happened. Although grief−stricken, Beatrice hosts a naming ceremony for Ikem's baby girl, born after his murder. Men traditionally perform the ceremony, but Beatrice fulfils this role, naming the child Amaechina, a boy's name that means \"May the Path Never Close.\"</p> <p><strong>AUTHOR’S NARRATIVE STYLE (ADICHIE AND ACHEBE)</strong></p> <p>●     <strong>Narrative Style in “Purple Hibiscus”</strong></p> <p>“Purple Hibiscus” is told in the first person narrative style. The language is simple and sometimes lyrical. As stated earlier, it is an account of sights and sounds from the mouth of a quiet witness like Mama, Aunty Ifeoma, Jaja and Ade Coker. In Adichie’s employment of the ‘shift in perspective technique’, Kambili’s focus is beamed beyond the seclusion of the Achike family house in Abba to the wider society. Some reviewers argue that the political sub-plot of Purple Hibiscus does not complement its main plot. This view is incorrect. It is chiefly through this sub-plot that the novel’s setting emerges. Ade Coker reminds us of the late Dele Giwa, who was bombed to death in Lagos during the Babangida’s military regime. By localizing this sub-plot and its drama to Abba, the setting becomes modern Nigeria as a whole. The political sub-plot also aggravates the drama in the main plot by fuelling Eugene’s stress, this help to shake things up towards the climax and hasten the drama and the suspense that brought about his tragedy. </p> <p>Adichie’s language was simple and comprehensible by an average reader in the least however she does endeavour to import some of her native language’s lexicons but she was careful enough to make sure they don’t hinder the simplicity in the text’s language as the English translation of these lexicons were made to follow immediately after them. Also, it helps inform the reader of the cultural inclination of the text.</p> <p>●     <strong>Narrative Style in ‘Anthills of the Savannah’</strong></p> <p>“Anthills of the Savannah” provides a complete view of the action of the novel by offering multiple points of view. Achebe allows the reader to see the situation from the points of view of Ikem, Chris, and Beatrice, and also, in some passages, from that of a third person, omniscient narrator. This technique enables the reader to make judgements for him/herself rather than relying on a narrator or a single character to supply descriptions of people and events. This also is a way in which Achebe retains the part of his African literary heritage that focuses on the community rather than on the individual.</p> <p>Most of the dialogues of the ordinary people of Kangan is written in the dialect of Pidgin English. The unusual grammar and unfamiliar words of this dialect can be difficult for western readers, but its inclusion gives the novel a strong sense of realism. In additional it is easy to identify a character’s level of education or social standing based on his or her manner of speech.  Chris, Beatrice, and Ikem are sympathetic as characters, as they are able to interact with common people by speaking Pidgin English and with powerful political figures by speaking British English. Rather than distance themselves from ordinary citizen, as Sam does. Chris, Beatrice and Ikem routinely abandon their British English in favour of being able to communicate in a meaningful way.</p> <p><strong>TEXTUAL ANALYSIS OF “PURPLE HIBISCUS” AND “ANTHILLS”</strong></p> <p>●       <strong>Morphological Analysis of “Purple Hibiscus”</strong></p> <p>At the morphological level, <strong>Initialisms</strong> are employed in the texts thus abbreviated names or perhaps “lexemes” are used to represent and refer to certain items and concepts. For example, “Television” is represented and referred to as “TV\", “Master of ceremony” is represented by “MC”. Under this light, “Curriculum Vitae” is represented as “CV” and “Vice–Chancellor” as “VC”. These initialized/abbreviated words are used by the writer to familiarize the reader with the objects and concepts being referred to. For instance, abbreviated forms “TV”, “MC”, “CV”, “VC” and “CNN” are commonly used in the informal setting. Thus, this saves the text from being “too formal” and therefore helps to give the audience or reader a sense of familiarity with the text.</p> <p><strong>Word–compounding</strong> is another morphological device employed in the text by the writer to give a perfect description of certain concepts by joining two or more words together with a hyphen to create a new word/lexeme with a new meaning. Examples are;</p> <p>-        “Later, she knot palm front into sagging crop shape and hang on the wall beside our <strong>gold-frame</strong> family photo”. (pg. 11) – i .e. framed with Gold. </p> <p>-        “I tied around my chest, over my <strong>pink-and-white flowered</strong> nightgown.” (pg. 174) - i.e. a nightgown made of pink-and-white colour flower design. </p> <p>-        “Aunty said, laughing in that <strong>proud-coach-watching-the-team</strong> way.” (pg.140) – i.e. this depict that  the person being refer to in this context (Aunty Ifeoma) laughs in the kind of manner in which a football coach who has been made proud : watching his football team play.</p> <p>-        “She lowly ran the cloth over her figurine one of its <strong>match-stick-size legs</strong> raised high in the air, before spoke.” (pg. 43) – i.e. legs like the size of that of matches sticks.</p> <p>-        “We drove past the sturdy tree around the faculty of engineering, past the vast <strong>mango-filled field</strong> around the female hostel.” (pg. 139) – i.e. full of mango trees.</p> <p>-        “I could see the big duplex that nestled behind a canopy of trees with<strong> greenish–yellow leaves</strong>…” (pg. 139) – i.e. yellow leaves with dotted green colour pigments.</p> <p>This technique was deployed in abundance in this text to aid perfect description of objects, concepts and ideas. It also contributes to the simplified nature of language of the text thus making it, easy to read and understand even by an average reader. Other Instance of word compounding is.</p> <p>-        “…she then pointed to the vice chancellors lodge, to the high walls surround it, and said its youth to have <strong>well-tended hedges</strong> of cherry…” (pg. 139)</p> <p>-        “…and the <strong>palm–size flower</strong> brightened the foliage in the yellow polka dots.” (pg. 137)</p> <p>-        “…only for a snack when we sometimes bought the steam cooked <strong>cow-pea-and-palm-oil cakes</strong> on the drive Abba” (pg. 135)</p> <p>-        “…three <strong>long-stemmed roses</strong> so piercingly red, I wondered…” (pg. 122)</p> <p>-        “…to spill over onto a thin strip of road already full <strong>double-parked</strong>…” (pg. 119)</p> <p>-        “…It laid there, a huge <strong>leather-bound missal</strong> that contained the reading for all three cycles of the church year.” (pg. 15)</p> <p>●       <strong>Morphological Analysis of “Anthills of the Savannah”</strong></p> <p>At the morphology level, Initialism and Word–compounding has noticed in Adichie’s “Purple Hibiscus”, are also employed by the writer to propel familiarization of words with the reader’s everyday language. Examples of instance of deployment of these devices in the text are given below.</p> <p><strong>Initialism</strong> as stated earlier helps to familiarize the reader with the text. This is because these instances of initials connote every day or informal language. Thus prevents the text from being too formal in its language. <strong>Instances of Initialism</strong> in the text are as follow:</p> <p>VIP – “Very Important Person” (pg. 23)</p> <p>NTBB – “Not To Be Broadcast” (pg. 34)</p> <p>MM – “Mad Medico” (pg. 35)</p> <p>BB- “Buife, Beatrice” (pg. 36)</p> <p>Initialism is also used to abbreviate characters’ names.</p> <p><strong>Instances of Word-Compounding</strong> in the text are:</p> <p>-          “He was the <strong>all-rounder--good</strong> student, captain of the Cricket Team…” (pg. 36) - i.e. good in all school activities: academic and extra – curricular.</p> <p>-           “Well-chosen words” (pg. 3) – i.e. carefully selected words. </p> <p>-          “...opened the heavy doors of carved panels, stood aside and gave a long, <strong>hand-quivering salute</strong>.” (pg. 5) – i.e. saluting with his hand shaking. </p> <p>-          “And when His Excellency asked me to suggest <strong>half-a-dozen</strong> names for his Cabinet Professor Okong was top of my list.” (pg. 8) – i.e. Half of a dozen, six perhaps.</p> <p>-          “...invited by the even younger <strong>coup-makers</strong> to become His Excellency the Head of State...” (pg. 8) – i.e. those who orchestrated coup.</p> <p>As stated earlier, word-compounding is deployed in the text by the writer in order to help the reader have a detailed description, explanation as well as depicted picture of characters and events by the writer.</p> <p>●       <strong>Graphological Analysis of “Purple Hibiscus”</strong></p> <p>At the Graphological level, <strong>Punctuations marks</strong> such as colons, semi – colons and dashes are employed in abundance in the texts. </p> <p>The <strong>Semi–colons</strong> are used to provide more explanatory information in addition to the previously provided Facts as seen in the samples below;</p> <p>“we had to found civilized in public” he told us; we had to speak English (pg. 21)</p> <p>In the above extract, the first statement had already conveyed a complete thought or information. However, the punctuating semi–colon is used to introduce the second sentence (underlined) which only conveyed the information the speaker intended or was initially trying to pass to the reader in the first sentence. This implies that the speaker is prohibited from speaking their native language when they are in public. Another instance of semi-colon is seen below:</p> <p>“It was mostly Mama’s prayer group members who plucked flowers; a woman tucked one behind her ear once, I saw her clearly from my window” (pg. 17). </p> <p>This implies that although the speaker has never been present when mama’s prayer group plucked the flower but having seen one of them tucked one behind her ear once; she was very sure they are the ones plucking the flowers indeed.</p> <p>In the above extract, the first sentence entails a suggestive statement, while the second sentence introduced with a semi-colon, entails backing evidence provided to validate the speaker’s claim. Other instances of semi colons are:</p> <p>-          “He always encouraged father Benedict to call and win that person back into the fold; nothing but moral sin would keep a person away from communion two Sundays in a row” (pg. 14).</p> <p>The above, serve to reflect the belief if the speaker about anyone who miss(es) holy communion two Sundays consecutively or perhaps absent from the church on two Sundays consecutively.</p> <p>-          “Her green wrapper hung lower than usual on her waist; it had been knotted with a lazy effort at the side” (pg. 42)</p> <p>This serves to suggest that “the wrapper” must have been wore (put on) or tied in a hurry.</p> <p>-          “I could hardly hear her words; instead what I heard clearly was the sound of something catching on her trout” (pg. 46)</p> <p>This serve to suggest that the person being referred to in the above extract (Yewande) was crying, sobbing and talking simultaneously. </p> <p><strong>Dashes</strong> on the other hand, are also used but only to provide additional information or description e.g.; </p> <p>-       “Father Benedict usually referred to the pope, papa and Jesus - in that order” (pg. 12)</p> <p>This serve to suggest that, Father Benedict has always preach this sermon (every sermon) in that pattern; by giving credit, to the pope, Eugene and then Jesus Christ in that hierarchical pattern which shows how much dear, he holds Eugene Achike in esteemed regards. Dash here, is used to provide detail and additional information.</p> <p>-          “She was nervous, I could tell – not just because a fresh cashew tasted nothing like white wine but also because her voice was lower than usual” (pg. 21)</p> <p>This serve to suggest the person being referred to his not only “nervous” but terrified as well as whole trying hard to impress Papa so that he can’t get cooled having been angered previously JaJa.</p> <p>-       “Although papa did not smile at her – he looked too sad to smile – I wished I had to say that before mama did” (pg. 50)</p> <p>The above, serves to suggest that papa was quite impressed by what mama had just said previously. But his sadness overcrowds this impression which shows the kind of agony he borne in him and how dejected he is. </p> <p>Few <strong>Colons</strong> were also employed by the writer to introduce factual messages and informative insights concerning events and characters at hand, some are descriptive but often about a particular concept or idea. For example;</p> <p>-        “…. the same feeling I got after I sneezed: a clear tingling sensation” (pg. 50)</p> <p>In the above extract ‘colon’ is used to introduce and provide a perfect picture of the kind of ‘feeling’ the speaker was initially telling us about. Thus, it serves to suggest that the speaker (Kambili) was proudly impressed (and eventually relived) having her father praised and admired in such manner and with such description.</p> <p>       By and large, all these punctuation marks are employed in the text in order to provide additional information, facts description, explanation, thought and ideas. These help to feed the readers with enough details about the picture being painted by the writer in the story.</p> <p><strong>Italic</strong> is another graphological device deployed by the writer to separate and identify foreign words/lexeme/phrases from the English words. Most especially, “words and phrases” adopted from the Adichie’s indigenous language: Igbo language. It is also used to identify names of particular items or products in the middle of sentences e.g. “Standard” as seen in one of the exact below:</p> <p>-        “But no, he used <em>The Standard</em> to speak the truth…” (page 13)</p> <p>“Standard” is the brand name of papa` s newspaper / editorial company. Italics here, is used to introduce and identify the name of the afore-mentioned “item” or “product” within the sentences. It is written in a manner different from that of other texts/words/letters. Thus; it is foregrounded. Another example is:</p> <p>-        “<em>Nne ngwa</em>, go and change” (pg. 16)</p> <p>Here italics is used to identify foreign word which is used with English adopted from the writer’s Igbo Language (One of the three major Languages in Nigeria).</p> <p>-        “Papa Nnukwu was an <em>ozu</em> now, a corpse” (pg. 121)</p> <p>In the above sentence, italic is use to separate the Igbo lexeme: “ozu” substituted by the writer and used in place of the English word “corpse”. </p> <p>-        “The word <em>fridge</em> floated around my head” (pg. 192) </p> <p>In the sentence above, italic is used to foreground the lexeme: “fridge”. It serves to suggest to us the speaker’s amazement or perhaps, surprise at the fact that “corpse” (dead body: human) are kept in fridge as a means of preserving them. Hence, it sounded strange to the speaker.                 </p> <p>-        “To say <em>ebezina </em>and wipe away her tears” (pg. 193).</p> <p>It is noted that most of the initialized words, phrase and lexemes written in the writer’s native language were deliberately foregrounded. This is because the writer could have simply supply and replace them with their English counter-parts instead of providing them as additional information. Hence, it helps carry with the text: “a cultural identity” (African cultural identity) along with it through language–lexeme importation. It also adds beauty to African literature as a whole. It makes it easy to identify the text as a Nigerian/African literary text.</p> <p><strong>Capitalizations</strong>, another graphological device deployed in the text to deliberately foreground words, phrases or statements by being written in contracted form (capital letter) different from the pattern in which others were written e.g.</p> <p>-       GOD IS LOVE (pg. 15)</p> <p>-       WELCOME TO ABBA TOWN (pg. 63)</p>\n\nA STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF CHIMAMANDA ADICHIE’S “PURPLE HIBISCUS” AND CHINUA ACHEBE’S “ANTHILLS OF THE SAVANNAH”<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF CHIMAMANDA ADICHIE’S “PURPLE HIBISCUS” AND CHINUA ACHEBE’S “ANTHILLS OF THE SAVANNAH”", "id": 123}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>The project work “The advent of Christianity to tiv land and its influence on church growth” traces the origin of Christianity in Tiv land, its impact and progress to the church in Tiv land.

Peter Azuara at Mkar-Gboko, Benue State of Nigeria. The project also adopted secondary sources by using books. In the research carried out, we discovered that, missionaries brought Christianity as far as 19th century with education, agriculture, gospel, medicine, thereby developing our land. But to some people, much was not done by the missionaries rather cause worst to Tiv society. Some with the opinion that, the mission did their best by giving education which is the key to success and most of the missionaries died and were buried in Tiv land for this cause of the gospel. I thereby say that, the missionaries did more good than harm. Therefore, more research should be carried out on this topic for more understanding.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>ORIGIN OF CHRISTIANITY IN NIGERIA;</strong></p> <p>This project focuses on the arrival of Christianity to Tiv land, also how Christianity came to Nigeria in the 15th Century through Augustinian and Capuchin Monks from Portugal to Benin and Warri. In 19th Century most Missionaries arrived in other parts of Africa, Roman Catholics and Anglicans. In 1842, the Church of England was established in Badagry by Townsend. In 1846, Samuel Ajayi Crowther an Ethnic Yoruba and former slave was elected Bishop of Nigeria and the first Black Bishop of Anglican Communion, Lagos, which became a Diocese of its own in 1919(Erivwo 1979). In 1857, the Christianity spread to Jebba People, and the EtSU of Bida was converted to Christianity. The Missionaries to Nigeria established Christianity in Onisha, Bonny became the Headquarters. In 1889, Christianity spread to Hausa land, establishing a Mission in Zaria in 1902.</p> <p>In 1930, other Missionary bodies like the Wesleyans had occupied different part of Nigeria. BENUE STATE IN PERSPECTIVE (2003).</p> <p>On April, 1911, Christianity (NKST ‘’acronym’’ meaning Nongo U Kristu Hen Sudan Ken Tiv),the English meaning is ‘‘The Church of Christ in Sudan among the Tiv’’ now called ‘‘URCC’’ meaning Universal Reformed Christian Church came through the Dutch Reformed Church Missions of South Africa, under the leadership of Rev.Carl Zimmerman toJ.E. Isholibo Sai in Sai Village in Benue State (Rubingh 1969). Few months later, some catholic railway workers started spreading Christianity along Makurdi side still in Benue. (BENUE STATE IN PERSPECTIVE2003).</p> <p>In 1912, Missionaries were granted the permission to travel through Tiv areas, before that time, foreigners were not allowed to enter Tivland, because the Tiv People saw any stranger coming to their land as threat, most especially foreigners. The Tiv land was the last area of conquest in Nigeria to be brought under British control. But today, Christianity grew up in all the Tiv land, Central North Nigeria known as the Middle Belt with Schools, Hospitals, Banks, good Roads, and so on. <strong>‘‘Tiv view on Spiritual matters could be conceptualized under four distinctive parts of the spirit; the concept of Aondo (God) which is the Supreme Being,Akombo(Rituals), Tsav(witchcraft),and Ujijingi(spirits). Ujijijngi includes Adzor’’</strong>.This is because it is on this that the entire traditional religious sect among the Tiv are embedded.</p> <p><strong>Aondo </strong>is the high God, the Creator. Aondo has personality, and He can be angry and expresses his anger even today in his roar of thunder and in spitting out the storms.</p> <p><strong>Akombo rites </strong>was made to communicates to God when men could not reach God because of the pestle a woman struck against God while pounding yam in her Mortal, God(<strong>Aondo</strong>) became angry and left man. Therefore <strong>Akimbo (Ritual</strong>) was used to communicated with God from a far.</p> <p><strong>Tsav-witchcraft;</strong> Tiv people believes that, people can turn to some animals or objects to commit evil, such as kill, run people mad, destroy destines and so, and after committing such evil transform back to human being. This can be done using Tsav.</p> <p><strong>Ujijingi- spirits</strong> are also known as <strong>Adzor,</strong> these spirits have cult were they dwell and also move around. Those spirits could be good or bad. The <strong>Adzor Cult</strong> was believed to have helped others such as in healing, blessing or fighting for others.</p> <p><strong>1.2. STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The problem this project hopes to solves is the issue of the coming or Advent of Christianity and its influence in Tivland, that is, how Christianity entered Tivland,who were the persons that brought Christianity and what important has it given to Tiv people? Has Christianity added or reduced the Tiv people values?</p> <p> The Tiv people were known as united group, in unity of power, language, in human and the Tar may be seen in the early practice of preserving the excrement of leaders who left the tribal area when the time came to go back to his Tar, the leader carried his excrement with him and threw it away at home (tar) but it’s not so today. (Rubingh 1969:66)</p> <p>Tiv people do things in common, love, care and were united together, this is one of the reason Islam could not penetrate Tiv land, with their oneness said no to Islam and Islam faded away in Tivland accept now.</p> <p>In Tiv contemporary Society, there is ‘‘no’’ such unity, now that we have Christianity that can even make the unity stronger, instead, we are in disunity.</p> <p><strong>1.3. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work seeks to know the origin of Christianity in the land.</p> <p>To know how the Tiv people reacted to the arrival of Christianity when they already had their traditional Religion.</p> <p>To know the influence of Christianity to Tivland.</p> <p>To know if Christianity is real growing in Tiv.</p> <p>To know if Christians are not united among themselves in Tivland.</p> <p><strong>1.4. JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The interviews and reviewed of books carried out by me indicates that, Christianity actually came to Tivland at Sai now Katsina-Ala Local Government of Benue State in 1911 by missionaries, with Education, Agriculture, Medicine and Bible. These things mentioned are tools for development. But some persons are still with the opinion that, the Missionaries could not do the best they should, rather, contributed to problems we are having today, well, I can say that, Missionaries gave their best by giving their to die for the gospel, let us continue where they stopped and make it greater by sacrificing and giving out our love to others.</p> <p><strong>1.5. SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This project focuses on the Origin of Christianity in the Tiv land, reaction of Tiv people to Christianity, and also influence on Church growth in Tivland.</p> <p><strong>1.6. METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>The study has adopted the following methods for the research work; it includes primary sources by using oral interviews, conducted by Zungwe Deborah. The persons interviewed were; Rev. Prof. Anjov Ahenakaa, Department of Philosophy And Religions, Benue State University Makurdi and also Seminary School Mkar on 23 June, 2016. And Rev. Peter Azuana. The General Secretary “NKST”  “Nongo U Kristu U i Ser U Sha” meaning Universal Reformed Church Headquarters Mkar on 25th June, 2016. And also secondary sources such as consulting  Textbooks,Journals,Articles,internet,Encyclopedia,Dictionaries,academic project ,data collection and so on for a better research.</p> <p><strong>1.7. RELEVANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work is relevant in the following ways:</p> <p>It serves as a source of reference Book.</p> <p>It serves as research material.</p> <p>It relevant to Churches (to gain more Knowledge).</p> <p>It is a sense of History.</p> <p><strong>1.8. LIMITATIONS</strong></p> <p>Lack of Books for research Purposes.</p> <p>Financial constraints.</p> <p>Insecurity, most people are not open to people even their community because of evil society.</p> <p>The dead of my Daddy while in Mkar-Gboko for the first day of the oral interview.</p> <p><strong>1.9. DEFINATION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Advent</strong></p> <p>Advent means coming or arrival, first appearance.</p> <p>Advent is from a Latin word ‘‘<strong>Adventus’’ </strong>meaning Arrival.</p> <p>Advent also means a season observed in many Western Christian Churches as a time of expectant waiting and preparation for the celebration of nativity of Jesus at Christmas.</p> <p><strong>Latin Adventus</strong> is the translation of Greek word <strong>parousia </strong>commonly used to refer to the second coming for Christians.</p> <p>Advent means the coming of an important event, person, invention, and so on.</p> <p>But in this context, Advent is the coming of Christianity.</p> <p><strong>Christianity</strong></p> <p>Christianity is a ‘‘Monotheistic religion’’ based on the life and teaching of Jesus Christ as presented in the New Testament.</p> <p>Christianity is the World’s largest religion with over 2.4 billion adherent known as Christians.</p> <p>Christianity is based  on the life and teaching of Jesus Christ and the teaching of inspired Apostles and Evangelist as recorded in Acts of the Apostles in the Holy Bible.(Nnaji 2009:3).</p> <p><strong>TIV</strong></p> <p>Tiv has a dual meaning, is a name of group of people in Benue State and the name of the Father of all Tiv People. But in this context, Tiv, a group of people in Benue State, Middle Belt of Nigeria. (Makar 1994:4).</p> <p>Tiv originated from Bantu in Congo to the South East and inside Cameroom, settled on Hills located a few miles South-East of Obudu, Akiga located Swem Karagbe hill (1969:62), finally settled in Benue State.</p> <p> The Tiv bordered to the East by the Hausa-speaking, Mada, Jukum,and  Chamba to the North by the Alago and Akwe to the West by the Idoma and South by theUdam.</p> <p>Tivland stretches from approximately 60 to 300 North and from 80 to 100 East Longitude.Tiv also lived on both Banks of the Benue River about 150 miles from its Confluence with the Niger. (Rubingh 1969:62)</p> <p><strong>Influence</strong></p> <p>Influence means the power to have an effect on People or things that is able to do</p> <p>Influence means to affect or change how someone or something develops, behaves or thinks. (Cambridge advanced learners dictionary and thesaurus).</p> <p>Influence in Spanish is called ‘‘Influencia’’.</p> <p>Influence is the capacity or power of person or thing to be a compelling force on or produce effect on the actions or behavior.</p> <p><strong>Church</strong></p> <p>The word Church is in Greek language and in New Testament is ‘‘Ekklesia’’ which means a ‘‘calling out’’ especially a religious congregation or an assembly (Strong exhaustive concordance 1677).</p> <p>The word Church designates the body of believers of which Jesus Christ is the head, Colossians 1:18.</p> <p>Church is a group of people called out for a special purpose by God.</p> <p>Literally, Church is a building that human beings worship in that the understanding of a layman.</p> <p><strong>Growth</strong></p> <p>Growth is referred to as a positive change in size or maturation often over a period of time.</p> <p>Growth can occur as a stage of Maturation or a process toward fullness or fulfillment.</p> <p>It can also perpetuate endlessness, for example, as detailed by some theories of the ultimate fate of the universe.</p> <p>Growth can also be referring as the mode of growth, example, and numeric models for describing how much a particular quantity grows over time (Wikipedia the free encyclopedia).</p> <p><strong>Aondo</strong></p> <p>The Tiv traditional Religion calls God or god Aondo meaning the Supreme Being. When the Missionaries brought Christianity, they further adopted the name Aondo for the Supreme Being.Tiv contemporary Society calls<strong> small gods</strong> now <strong>Mbaaonda </strong>while the Supreme God (Aondo).</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER 2</strong></p> <p><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p><strong>2.1. INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>This chapter reviews Literature on the subject matter from works of some pioneer Authors or scholars whom have written directly or indirectly to throw light in aiding researchers understands what others wrote on the research Topic.</p> <p>The views of the scholars gave a good understanding of the “Advent of Christianity in Tivland, other parts of African and its influence for Church growth and the benefits of Christianity.</p> <p><strong>2.2       THE ADVENT OF CHRISTIANITY IN TIVLAND.</strong></p> <p>Christianity in Tivland is 105years old now, in 2011, the Church clocked 100years. Dr karl kumm a German who had a vision for Christianity in Africa as he saw Islam advancing South into Africa, felt  there was need to established Christian church throughout Africa, South of the Sahara desert called “Sudan”.</p> <p>The awakening gave rise to the formation of mission Societies. They include: the Baptist Mission 1792,the London Missionary Society 1795 and the Church Missionary Society(Anglican) better known as CMS1799.Other Mission Societies were: Dutch Reformed Missionary Society(DRCM). Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society (WMMS); Scottish Presbyterian Missionary Society (SPMS) among others. The coming together of Missionaries for the advent of Christianity to Nigeria most especially Tivland.(centenary celebration  Brochure2011:12). </p> <p>In 1901, Kumm founded the Sudan pioneer Mission which in 1904 became the Sudan united Mission.</p> <p>In 1904, Kumm led the first part of four persons, himself included, to the North Nigeria; settle in the town of Wase.</p> <p>In 1908, some missionaries including Rev. Botha, Mr.Hosking, Dr.Kumm left Liverpool for Nigeria. At their leaving, they settled to come Tivland. Dr. Kumm was even of the opinion that a station be opened at Udei a village along the Benue River. On arriving Nigeria they were overtaken by events and the idea of coming to Tivland was jettisoned. They decided to settle at a village called Mbula.</p> <p>In 1910, Mr. Botha wrote in a letter that, though they nearly worked a year with Mbula tribe they still do not have a grip on the people; although they are gaining more influence and the confidence through means of the Medical work. The breakthrough in Medical work was because a man with a broken arm was cured, so people were rushing not necessary to receive the gospel but to be treated of their physical ailments. A decision was therefore taken on leave Mbula to Ibi. (Centenary celebration Brochure 2011:12).</p> <p>Rev. Carl Zimmerman of the Dutch Reformed Church (DRCM) of South Africa who first came at Sai on April 17, 1911 at 10.ooam. There is an Eye-witness account given by Akiga Sai and Rev J.E.I. Sai, who were among the people when missionary came. (Avan 2011:1), (Benue State in Perspective 2003:212). (Robert and Udende 2009:3), (Palmer 1996:52, 53), (Rubingh 1969:1).</p> <p>The most an important person in the History of Tiv Church was Mr. Sai, the Father of one of the first four Tiv Pastors Rev. J.E.I. Sai. This man whose village was name after him was instrumental in accepting Missionaries to work in his land and other Tiv areas. (Hopkins and Gaiya 2005:90). Mr. Zimmerman requested from Sai a Child to help him in mission work, Akiga was chosen by Sai among his children with the intension that, let Akiga be wasted, already he was the least among his Children because Akiga one eye could not see well. Also had ulcer on one of foots, so, Sai decided to give him away.Akiga proved to be a gift blessed with intelligence and became the first Tiv man to be Educated and baptized as a Christian.</p> <p>The South Africans settled in “Salatu”,Casaleggio points out that,this was mispronunciation of the Tiv expression Saa i utu,meaning “matters of the night”. Sai is the name of a place .It was a Tiv homestead and its respected Father Mr. Sai, allowed the Missionaries to settle there, one of his Sons J.E.I. Sai was among the first four men to be ordained into the Tiv Church. (Edgar 1972:30).</p> <p>According to them the missionary had four boxes. These as follows:</p> <p>One Box was containing a Bible-The Word of God.</p> <p>Another Box was containing Medicine-Medical or health work.</p> <p>One contains books-Education.</p> <p>Another one was containing Seeds of various plants, Agriculture, (Avan 2011:1).</p> <p>The Church started 1911 but spreading fast was a little delayed because the British Colonial were afraid of the Tivland, according to them, the Tivs were warriors, therefore, preaching the Gospel into Villages was stones, only along the Road from Wukari to Takum.After sometimes, Mr. Carl Zimmerman gained ground by using Medicine for healing through goodness and won the hearts of the Tivs, hereby change his base because sai was extremity in the Eastern side if Tivland.</p> <p>In January 12,1912, one of his Sai’s sons Akiga sai proclaimed or confessed Christ as his savior, another of sai’s son J.E.I sai became the first ordained pastor and also very important in the Tiv Church. On the 19th of March 1912, Hosking and Zimmerman left for South Africa, while Judd stayed behind at Sai. To Zimmerman this was the end of his work in this area; others had to continue where he stopped. Rev Botha and Brink went to Sai to explore ways of erecting a building for personnel.And the Lord opened the way for them to penetrate the whole of Tivland East of the Katsina-Ala River. Flemming and Hosking took off six weeks to explore the area they visited among other places,Zaki-Biam and Katsina-Ala.By this time Judd was perfecting his language  study and in 1914 he wrote the first Tiv reader. That same year, the first Christian, Adamu was baptized in Tivland.  Adamu was not a Tiv man though his baptism was in Tivland. Guinter of Wukari baptized him by immersion. (Centenary Celebration Brochure 2011:13). </p> <p>In 1913 and 1935, seven new mission station were established, such as, Sai -1911,Zaki-Biam-1914,Sevav-1920,Mkar-1923, Adikpo-1923,Kunav-1923,Turan(Jato-Aka)-1926, in addition Mkar which was established in 1923and became the headquarter of the (DRCM) work, Sai station was closed in 1926.(Avan 2011:3.4).</p> <p>January 9, 1957, was the birth date of autonomous Tiv Church, Nongo Kristu U sudan Hen Tiv(NKST) now URCC-Universal Reformed Christian Church. The Missionaries official handed over to the indigenous Pastors and Rev Nevkav Anum Eho was among the first four ordained Pastors in Tivland and was made the first Chairman of N.K.S.T. The other three Ministers were Rev.Shinyi Ugo, Rev.J.E.I Sai, and Rev.Varem Ayaka.</p> <p><strong>Dr. Karl Zimmerman</strong></p> <p><strong>2.3. A Talk Given to the Nigeria Staff of the Mennonite Central Committee August 14, 1980. Christianity in Northern Nigeria: Origin and Problems. </strong><strong>www.socialtheology.com</strong><strong>.</strong></p> <p>To understand the Advent Christianity in Northern Nigeria (NN), one must return back first to 19th Century Great Britain and look at the relationship between Laissez-Faire Capitalism and Evangelicals. The Great Britain had become the leading industrial Nation of the world under the guidance of Laissez-Faire capitalism.</p> <p>The Capitalism was very individualistic; everyone was urged to do his own economic thing. The purpose of the business was first of all to make a profit and also competition-oriented.</p> <p>Evangelicals were very much part of it all. They believed in the above doctrines as God inspired, though they rejected the evolutionist interpretation of the origin of creation and man but adhere to an evolutionistic interpretation of History without recognizing the common source behind the two. Our every Square inch, vol.2, pp.210-211</p> <p>The social economic structure of Great Britain changed under the impact of industrial Revolution, raw materials for production became a problem, and therefore, Great Britain needed a way to solve the problem, so, Great Britain entered Nigeria, that was the basic impulse of Colonialism, it was for them produce these two, raw materials and Market ,the Great Britain interest were represented by a number of Companies especially by the Royal Niger Company that was later taken over by Lever Brothers.</p> <p>In the beginning Nigerians were abused and used when the Britain needed Nigerians, they trained them, when it was in their favor to eliminate them, they would freely do so. By 1960, Nigeria Economic was totally in foreign hands.</p> <p>The Evangelicals in Great Britain were wholly in favor of their domestic Capitalist economy because they themselves had done well under it, so they expected of colonialism Livingstone inspired many Evangelicals, at the very time the attention of British business was down to Northern Nigeria. It begins slowly with the southern Baptists leading the pack in 1855 to be followed by Anglican Church missionary Society and Wesleyans around the 1880s.But towards the end of the century new attempts were made that were eventually to morph into Churches that are now blossoming in Northern Nigeria Anglicans, Sudan interior mission, ECWA, Sudan United Mission, TEKAN, and Southern Baptist.</p> <p>The Sudan United Mission (SUM) was a Conglomeration or umbrella of different Mission Societies whose Missionaries came from all the Caucasian dominated Nation of the common wealth as well as the USA. It included my own Mission, the Christian Reformed Church (SUM/CRC) that eventually partnered with three different denominations.2Boer, 1979, pp.85-85, 1984, pp32-33.</p> <p><strong>2.4. History of Christianity in Nigeria:</strong></p> <p><em>‘In 1485, the Portuguese Missionaries were the first to visit Nigeria .The Oba of Benin sent an appeal overseas that some Missionaries be sent to his Kingdom, some Spanish and Italian Capuchins also visited Benin .Being Catholics they were able to convert the Oba and his royal family. Also some Missionaries of the sacred Congregation of propaganda in Rome came to Benin and Warrin. In Warri the Olu and his Sons were baptized .He later sent his son Domingos to Portugal for studies. In Benin and Warri many people were converted, Churches were built and Christian worship was actively promoted’.</em> (Dauda andGbule: 60).                     </p> <p>In 1771-1806, the course of the Niger River had been discovered by Mungo Park and other explorers, it was know that this River held the vast and populous area. A come together commercial and philanthropic objectives for the introduction of European Civilization on the Niger was undertaken.</p> <p>In 1840, was the Niger expedition promoted by Buxton. Although the first voyage was not successful, subsequent voyage opened the Niger area to Philanthropic efforts and inspired subsequent endeavors in other parts of the continent in later years, such as the Africans Lakes Company in the Lake Nyasa region and the East African Scottish Industrial Mission in Kenya. (Falk 1997:123,124).</p> <p>In 1841, Samuel Ajayi Crowther took part in the Niger expedition aimed at Christianizing the people if Nigeria. (Nnaji 2009:28).</p> <p>The Portuguese main interest was in Commerce, thus, Commerce, Christianity and Colonialism combined to achieve missionary activities in Nigeria.</p> <p>In 1842, some liberated Slaves had become Christian in Sierra Leone who pleaded with the CMS to starts missionary activity in Yoruba land. The Slaves were as five hundred freed Nigeria origins that came back from Freetown to Badagry, Lagos and Abeokuta. And also September 1842, Methodist Church volunteered and sent T.B Freeman to visit the people at Badagry and Abeokuta, William De Graft a Methodist Missionary was made responsible for the Ministry of Badagry and Abeokuta too.(Falk 1997:126),(Fleck 2013:44),(Rubingh1969:47). Henry Townsend founded a (CMS) residence mission at Abeokuta 1846, extended to some parts of Yoruba land like Lagos 1852, Ibadan 1853 and Oyo 1856.(Benue State in Perspective 2003:209),(Dauda and Gbule 2000:67).</p> <p>In 1844, Townsend came back to Abeokuta with C.A.Gollmer, his wife and Samuel Crowther to commence a Ministry in Abeokuta, Shodeke, chief of Abeokuta died in. After his death, Dahomey took the Egba post on the route to Badagry, he closed transportation between Abeokuta and the port, the Church Missionary Society concentrated its efforts at Abeokuta while the Methodist Mission worked at Badagry.Shodeke favorable attitude opened Yoruba Country to Missionary work at a time when Dahomey rejected Missions. (Falk 1997:126).</p> <p>In 1846, the Church Missionary Society and the Methodist Missionary began Ministry on the Niger River and inland from Lagos, the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland began a Mission in Calabar to East of Lagos. In 1847, the Society made important literary contribution, Hugh Goldie, who arrived Calabar compiled a dictionary of the Efik. (Falk 1997) .In 1853, A.C. Mann began a work at Ijaye and also Bowen returned with his bride and two other couple.However, upon arriving at Abeokuta, they contacted Malaria. The J.L. Lacy were incapacitate and sent home, and the J.S. Dennards both die within a year. (Falk1997:129). In that same year, Samuel Ajayi Crowther landed at Badagry.</p> <p>There was a trial to found Mission stations in Niger during the second expedition of 1854, which Crowther was a member of the crew under the leadership of Rev J.C.Taylor an Ibo Liberated Slave who was ordained by the CMS in Sierra Leone. </p> <p>The CMS missionaries to Nigeria founded Christianity in Onitsha, Bonny became the Headquarters, and some stations were also opened up in Niger and Lokoja, now Kogi State.</p> <p>In 1841, a man name Samuel Ajayi Crowther took part in the Niger expedition aimed at Christianizing the people of Nigeria.</p> <p>He was ordained in England as a minister of the Gospel and sent back to Freetown to evangelize his own people in 1843.The Church Missionary Society (CMS) then sent him to work as a Missionary in Nigeria. He started his Missionary Exploits first, among his own people, the Yoruba’s.</p> <p>Samuel Ajayi Crowther landed at Badagry with a team of other Missionaries. He first went to Abeokuta and joined a European Missionary Henry Townsend and wife who had set up a school for the CMS at Abeokuta. They teamed up a converted many people to the Christian faith. At Badagry and Abeokuta, they labored for the numerical growth of the Churches.</p> <p>In 1853, he (Samuel Ajayi Crowther) left Abeokuta for Ibadan on another Missionary work. He worked hard with David Hinderer and co who was sent as European Missionaries. He was very much encouraged to meet this couple and they worked hard to win many converts to Christianity. </p> <p>Samuel Ajayi Crowther took part in another Niger Expedition in 1857.This Expedition nearly cost his life because their boat had almost drowned but God delivered them through the locals. In spite of this threat, he persevered and carried the gospel to the people of Jebba and met with the EtSU of Bida to convert him to Christianity.</p> <p>In 1864, he was consecrated the first Bishop and Pioneer Missionary of the Anglican Church in Nigeria. As a Bishop, he took up the responsibility of overseeing the clergy and the Catechists, as well as the growing Churches and the converts, through his missionary activities. The CMS spread further to the South. Church Missionary Society schools like D.M.G.S saint. Augustine’s Grammar school Nkwerre, saint. Marks T.T.C Nise, Awka, and WTC Umuahia to mention a few started by the Missionary.</p> <p>In 1876, the intrepid Mary Slessor arrived Calabar and through a Missionary was appointed vice-consul by the Government which saw in her the only means or gaining cooperation with the people. The tie of temporal and spiritual authority was not unnatural to the African, and the attempts of Missionaries to separate the two at great pains have not impressed the African to his day (Rubingh 1969:48). In 1880, the CMS could count eleven stations and a thousand adherents, from Badagry, Abeokuta and Calabar, the Missions pressed inland.</p> <p>By 1891,the CSM reached Isikwe-Achi, Oji River-Enugu State from where it spread to neighboring towns like Awlaw,Inyi,Udi,Ngwo,Nsukka,Nike,Agbani,Awkunanaw,Okigwe,Owerri,Mbieri and Calabar and so on.</p> <p>Bishop Ajayi Crowther spent his time and efforts to translate the whole Bible to Yoruba Language to enable his people understand God’s word. Before his death in Lagos on 31st Dec, 1891, he had left a landmark for his generation in Nigeria and Nation. (Nnaji p.28-29). </p> <p>By 1889, they penetrated Hausa land; founding a mission in Zaria 1902.in 1930 other missionary bodies like the Roman Catholic Mission (RCM), the Baptist Church of Scotland and Wesleyans had occupied different parts of Nigeria.</p>\n\nTHE ADVENT OF CHRISTIANITY AND ITS IMPACTS ON TIV RELIGIOUS CIVILIZATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ADVENT OF CHRISTIANITY AND ITS IMPACTS ON TIV RELIGIOUS CIVILIZATION", "id": 124}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p><em>This essay delves into the study of literature in northern Nigeria.

But not everything expressed in words—even when organized and written down—is counted as literature. Those writings that are primarily informative—technical, scholarly, journalistic—would be excluded from the rank of literature by most, though not all, critics. Certain forms of writing, however, are universally regarded as belonging to literature as an art. Individual attempts within these forms are said to succeed if they possess something called artistic merit and to fail if they do not. The nature of artistic merit is less easy to define than to recognize. The writer need not even pursue it to attain it. On the contrary, a scientific exposition might be of great literary value and a pedestrian poem of none at all.</p> <p>The essay was once written deliberately as a piece of literature; its subject matter was of comparatively minor importance. Today most essays are written as expository, informative journalism, although there are still essayists in the great tradition who think of themselves as artists. Now, as in the past, some of the greatest essayists are critics of literature, drama, and the arts. Some personal documents (autobiographies, diaries, memoirs, and letters) rank among the world’s greatest literature. Some examples of this biographical literature were written with posterity in mind, others with no thought of their being read by anyone but the writer. Some are in a highly polished literary style; others, couched in a privately evolved language, win their standing as literature because of their cogency, insight, depth, and scope. One can conceive of Literature as a body of written works. The name has traditionally been applied to those imaginative works of poetry and prose distinguished by the intentions of their authors and the perceived aesthetic excellence of their execution. </p> <p>Definitions of the word literature tend to be circular. The 11th edition of Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (2007:136) considers literature to be “writings having excellence of form or expression and expressing ideas of permanent or universal interest.” The 19th-century critic, Walter Pater referred to “the matter of imaginative or artistic literature” as a “transcript, not of mere fact, but of fact in its infinitely varied forms.” But such definitions assume that the reader already knows what literature is. And indeed its central meaning, at least, is clear enough. Deriving from the Latin littera, a letter of the alphabet, literature is first and foremost humankind’s entire body of writing; after that it is the body of writing belonging to a given language or people; then it is an individual piece of writing. Thus, every group possesses a literature peculiar to them and which defines the individual writings that make up that group.</p> <p>But already it is necessary to qualify these statements. To use the word “writing” when describing literature is itself misleading, for one may speak of “oral literature” or “the literature of preliterate peoples.” The art of literature is not reducible to the words on the page; they are there solely because of the craft of writing. As an art, literature might be described as the organization of words to give pleasure. Yet through words literature elevates and transforms experience beyond mere pleasure. Literature may be classified according to a variety of systems, including language, national origin, historical period, genre, and subject matter. Literature also functions more broadly in society as a means of both criticizing and affirming cultural values. This means that the literature of a people spells out the identity of such people. Literature in Northern Nigeria is hinged on the cultural heritage of the Hausa-Fulani people which in a sense is an offshoot of the Arab tradition.</p> <p>This essay is about the literature of Northern Nigeria, popular culture and the language use. It is noteworthy that Northern Nigerian literature combines various art forms of drama, music, poetry, orature, etc. and such literature aims to communicate values to the audience as well as to entertain.</p> <p><strong>2.0 An Overview of Literature</strong></p> <p>The online Encyclopædia Britannica (2015:7) catalogues the development and the criteria of what constitutes literature from pre-literate to modern times noting that the content of literature is as limitless as the desire of human beings to communicate with one another. The thousands of years, perhaps hundreds of thousands, since the human species first developed speech have built up the almost infinite systems of relationships called languages. A language is not just a collection of words in an unabridged dictionary but the individual and social possession of living human beings, an inexhaustible system of equivalents, of sounds to objects and to one another. Its most primitive elements are those words that express direct experiences of objective reality, and its most sophisticated concepts on a high level of abstraction. Words are not only equivalent to things; they have varying degrees of equivalence to one another. A symbol, according to the 11th edition of Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (2007:506), is something that stands for something else or a sign used to represent something, “as the lion is the symbol of courage, the cross the symbol of Christianity, the crescent and the star as a symbol of Islam.” In this sense all words can be called symbols, but the examples given—the lion, the cross and the crescent and star—are really metaphors: that is, symbols that represent a complex of other symbols, and which are generally negotiable in a given society (just as money is a symbol for goods or labour). Eventually a language comes to be, among other things, a huge sea of implicit metaphors, an endless web of interrelated symbols. As literature, especially poetry, grows more and more sophisticated, it begins to manipulate this field of suspended metaphors as a material in itself, often as an end in itself. Thus, there emerge forms of poetry (and prose, too) with endless ramifications of reference, as in Japanese <em>waka</em> and <em>haiku</em>, some ancient Irish and Norse verse, and much of the poetry written in Western Europe since the time of Baudelaire that is called modernist. It might be supposed that, at its most extreme, this development would be objective, constructive—aligning it with the critical theories stemming from Aristotle’s <em>Poetics</em>. On the contrary, it is romantic, subjective art, primarily because the writer handles such material instinctively and subjectively, approaches it as the “collective unconscious,” to use the term of the psychologist Carl Jung, rather than with deliberate rationality (online Encyclopædia Britannica, 2015:7).</p> <p>By the time literature appears in the development of a culture, the society has already come to share a whole system of stereotypes and archetypes: major symbols standing for the fundamental realities of the human condition, including the kind of symbolic realities that are enshrined in religion and myth. Literature may use such symbols directly, but all great works of literary art are, as it were, original and unique myths. The world’s great classics evoke and organize the archetypes of universal human experience. This does not mean, however, that all literature is an endless repetition of a few myths and motives, endlessly retelling the first stories of civilized man, repeating the Greek Epic of <em>Odyssey</em> or Sophocles’ Oedipus the King. The subject matter of literature is as wide as human experience itself. Myths, legends, and folktales lie at the beginning of literature, and their plots, situations, and allegorical (metaphorical narrative) judgments of life represent a constant source of literary inspiration that never fails. This is so because mankind is constant—people share a common physiology. Even social structures, after the development of cities, remain much alike. Whole civilizations have a life pattern that repeats itself through history. </p> <p>As time goes on, literature tends to concern itself more and more with the interior meanings of its narrative, with problems of human personality and human relationships. Many novels are fictional, psychological biographies which tell of the slowly achieved integration of the hero’s personality or of his disintegration, of the conflict between self-realization and the flow of events and the demands of other people. This can be presented explicitly, where the characters talk about what is going on in their heads, either ambiguously and with reserve, as in the novels of Henry James, or overtly, as in those of Dostoyevsky. Alternatively, it can be presented by a careful arrangement of objective facts, where psychological development is described purely in terms of behaviour and where the reader’s subjective response is elicited by the minute descriptions of physical reality, as in the novels of Stendhal and the greatest Chinese novels like <em>the</em> <em>Dream of the Red Chamber</em>, which convinces the readers that through the novel it is seeing reality itself, rather than an artfully contrived semblance of reality.                         Literature, however, is not solely concerned with the concrete, with objective reality, with individual psychology, or with subjective emotion. Some deal with abstract ideas or philosophical conceptions. Much purely abstract writing is considered literature only in the widest sense of the term, and the philosophical works that are ranked as great literature are usually presented with more or less of a sensuous garment. Thus, Plato’s <em>Dialogues</em> ranks as great literature because the philosophical material is presented in dramatic form, as the dialectical outcome of the interchange of ideas between clearly drawn, vital personalities, and because the descriptive passages are of great lyrical beauty. Karl Marx’s <em>Das</em> <em>Kapital</em> (1867–95) approaches great literature in certain passages in which he expresses the social passion he shares with the Hebrew prophets of the Old Testament. Euclid’s <em>Elements </em>(1883-85) and St. Thomas Aquinas’ <em>Summa</em> <em>Theologica</em> (1947) give literary, aesthetic satisfaction to some people because of their purity of style and beauty of architectonic construction. In short, most philosophical works that rank as great literature do so because they are intensely human. The reader responds to Blaise Pascal’s <em>Pensées</em> (1660), to Michel de Montaigne’s <em>Essays </em>(1580), and to Marcus Aurelius’ <em>Meditations</em> (1634) as he would to living men. Sometimes the pretence of purely abstract intellectual rigour is in fact a literary device. The writings of the 20th-century philosopher, Ludwig Wittgenstein, for example, owe much of their impact to this approach, while the poetry of Paul Valéry (1871-1945) borrows the language of philosophy and science for its rhetorical and evocative power.</p> <p>In preliterate societies oral literature was widely shared; it saturated the society and was as much a part of living as food, clothing, shelter, or religion. Many tribal societies remained primarily oral cultures until the 19th century. In early societies the minstrel might be a courtier of the king or chieftain, and the poet who composed liturgies might be a priest. But the oral performance itself was accessible to the whole community. As society evolved its various social layers or classes, an “elite” literature began to be distinguishable from the “folk” literature of the people. With the invention of writing this separation was accelerated until finally literature was being experienced individually by the elite (reading a book), while folklore and folk song were experienced orally and more or less collectively by the non-literate common people. Elite literature continuously refreshes itself with materials drawn from the popular. Almost all poetic revivals, for instance, include in their programmes a new appreciation of folk song, together with a demand for greater objectivity. On the other hand folk literature borrows themes and, very rarely, patterns from elite literature. Many of the English and Scottish ballads that date from the end of the Middle Ages and have been preserved by oral tradition share plots and even turns of phrase with written literature. A very large percentage of these ballads contain elements that are common to folk ballads from all over Western Europe; central themes of folklore, indeed, are found all over the world. Whether these common elements are the result of diffusion is a matter for dispute. They do, however, represent great psychological constants, archetypes of experience common to the human species, and so these constants are used again and again by elite literature as it discovers them in folklore.</p> <p>There is a marked difference between true popular literature, that of folklore and folk song, and the popular literature of modern times. According to the online Encyclopædia Britannica (2015:9), Popular literature today is produced either to be read by a literate audience or to be enacted on television or in the cinema; it is produced by writers who are members, however lowly, of an elite corps of professional literates. Thus, popular literature no longer springs from the people; it is handed to them. Their role is passive. At best they are permitted a limited selectivity as consumers. Certain theorists once believed that folk songs and even long, narrative ballads were produced collectively, as has been said in mockery “by the tribe sitting around the fire and grunting in unison.” This idea is very much out of date. The Encyclopædia Britannica notes that folk songs and folk tales began somewhere in one human mind. They were developed and shaped into the forms in which they are now found by hundreds of other minds as they were passed down through the centuries. Only in this sense were they “collectively” produced. During the 20th century, folklore and folk speech had a great influence on elite literature—on writers as different as Franz Kafka and Carl Sandburg, Selma Lagerlöf and Kawabata Yasunari, Martin Buber and Isaac Bashevis Singer. Folk song has always been popular with bohemian intellectuals, especially political radicals (who certainly are the elite). Since World War II the influence of folk song upon popular song has not just been great; it has been determinative. Almost all “hit” songs since the mid-20th century have been imitation of folk songs; and some authentic folk singers attract immense audiences.</p> <p>Popular fiction and drama, westerns and detective stories, films and television serials, all deal with the same great archetypal themes as folktales and ballads, though this is seldom due to direct influence; these are simply the limits within which the human mind works. The number of people who have elevated the formulas of popular fiction to a higher literary level is surprisingly small. Examples are H.G. Wells’s early science fiction, the western stories of Gordon Young and Ernest Haycox, the detective stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Georges Simenon, and Raymond Chandler.</p> <p>The latter half of the 20th century witnessed an even greater change in popular literature. Writing is a static medium: that is to say, a book is read by one person at a time; it permits recollection and anticipation; the reader can go back to check a point or move ahead to find out how the story ends. In radio, television, and the cinema the medium is fluent; the audience is a collectivity and is at the mercy of time. It cannot pause to reflect or to understand more fully without missing another part of the action, nor can it go back or forward. Marshall McLuhan in his book <em>Understanding</em> <em>Media</em> (1964) became famous for erecting a whole structure of aesthetic, sociological, and philosophical theory upon this fact. But it remains to be seen whether the new, fluent materials of communication are going to make so very many changes in civilization, let alone in the human mind—mankind has, after all, been influenced for thousands of years by the popular, fluent arts of music and drama. Even the most transitory television serial was written down before it was performed, and the script can be consulted in the files. Before the invention of writing, all literature was fluent because it was contained in people’s memory. In a sense it was more fluent than music, because it was harder to remember. Man in mass society becomes increasingly a creature of the moment, but the reasons for this are undoubtedly more fundamental than his forms of entertainment.</p> <p>Literature, like all other human activities, necessarily reflects current social and economic conditions. Class stratification was reflected in literature as soon as it had appeared in life. Among the American Indians, for instance, the chants of the shaman, or medicine man, differ from the secret, personal songs of the individual, and these likewise differ from the group songs of ritual or entertainment sung in the community. In the Heroic Age, the epic tales of kings and chiefs that were sung or told in their barbaric courts differed from the folktales that were told in peasant cottages. The more cohesive a society, the more the elements—and even attitudes—evolved in the different class strata are interchangeable at all levels. In the tight clan organization that existed in late medieval times at the Scottish border, for example, heroic ballads telling of the deeds of lords and ladies were preserved in the songs of the common people. But where class divisions are unbridgeable, elite literature is liable to be totally separated from popular culture. An extreme example is the Classical literature of the Roman Empire. Its forms and its sources were largely Greek—it even adopted its laws of verse patterning from Greek models, even though these were antagonistic to the natural patterns of the Latin language—and most of the sophisticated works of the major Latin authors were completely closed to the overwhelming majority of people of the Roman Empire.       At first, changes in literary values are appreciated only at the upper levels of the literary elite itself, but often, within a generation, works once thought esoteric are being taught as part of a school syllabus. Most cultivated people once thought James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> (1922) incomprehensible or, where it was not, obscene. Today, his methods and subject matter are commonplace in the commercial fiction of the mass culture. A few writers remain confined to the elite. Mallarmé is a good example—but he would have been just as ethereal had he written in the simplest French of direct communication. His subtleties are ultimately grounded in his personality.</p> <p>According to Ali (2014:2), literature in Northern Nigeria draws heavily from the socio-political situations of the region and the country at large. Abubarka Gimbar and the writings of Helon Habila exemplify this. It also features prominent aspects of folklores like the works of Usman Bukar that have been written in English and Hausa languages. Such works as <em>The Hyena and the Squirrel, Tsurondi, Dan Agwai Da Kura, Dankutungayya, Dankucaka, </em>etc. are among the many of such literatures.</p> <p>Hausa drama generally has a popular appeal and owes much to the dramatic style of traditional storytelling; it has focused on social problems, particularly those involving the Hausa family, with its tradition of polygamy. This practice has been criticized in many plays—for example, <em>Tabarmar Kunya</em> (1969; “Matter of Shame”) by Adamu dan Gogo and Dauda Kano. Some plays satirize the dependence of uneducated people on Muslim scholars and some—for example, Umaru Balarme Ahmed’s <em>Buleke</em> (1970)—depicts characters who lead a hectic modern life but are nevertheless still rooted in tradition. Hausa Plays are performed often in schools and are featured frequently on radio and television. </p> <p><strong>2.1 Literature and other Art Forms </strong></p> <p>Literature has an obvious kinship with the other arts. When presented, a play is drama; when read, a play is literature. Most important films have been based upon written literature, usually novels, although all the great epics and most of the great plays have been filmed at some time and thus have stimulated the younger medium’s growth. Conversely, the techniques required in writing for film have influenced many writers in structuring their novels and have affected their style. Most popular fiction is written with “movie rights” in mind, and these are certainly a consideration with most modern publishers. According to Yusuf (2014:1), Literature provides the libretto for operas, the theme for tone poems—even so anomalous a form as Friedrich Nietzsche’s <em>Thus</em> <em>Spake</em> <em>Zarathustra</em> was interpreted in music by Richard Strauss—and of course it provides the lyrics of songs. Many ballets and modern dances are based on stories or poems. Sometimes, music and dance are accompanied by a text read by a speaker or chanted by a chorus. The mid-19th century was the heyday of literary, historical, and anecdotal painting, though, aside from the Surrealists, this sort of thing died out in the 20th century. Cross-fertilization of literature and the arts now takes place more subtly, mostly in the use of parallel techniques—the rational dissociation of the Cubists or the spontaneous action painting of the Abstract Expressionists, for example, which flourished at the same time as the free-flowing uncorrected narratives of some novelists in the 1950s and ’60s.</p> <p>Critics have invented a variety of systems for treating literature as a collection of genres. Often these genres are artificial, invented after the fact with the aim of making literature less sprawling, more tidy. Theories of literature must be based upon direct experience of the living texts and so be flexible enough to contain their individuality and variety. Perhaps the best approach is historical, or genetic. What actually happened, and in what way did literature evolve up to the present day?</p> <p>According to the online Encyclopaedia Britanica (2015:11), there is a surprising variety of oral literature among surviving preliterate peoples, and, as the written word emerges in history, the indications are that the important literary genres all existed at the beginning of civilized societies: heroic epic; songs in praise of priests and kings; stories of mystery and the supernatural; love lyrics; personal songs (the result of intense meditation); love stories; tales of adventure and heroism (of common peoples, as distinct from the heroic epics of the upper classes); satire (which was dreaded by barbaric chieftains); satirical combats (in which two poets or two personifications abused one another and praised themselves); ballads and folktales of tragedy and murder; folk stories, such as the tale of the clever boy who performs impossible tasks, outwits all his adversaries, and usually wins the hand of the king’s daughter; animal fables like those attributed to Aesop (the special delight of Black Africa and Indian America); riddles, proverbs, and philosophical observations; hymns, incantations, and mysterious songs of priests; and finally actual mythology—stories of the origin of the world and the human race, of the great dead, and of the gods and demigods. </p> <p>Like lyrical poetry, drama has been an exceptionally stable literary form. Given a little leeway, most plays written by the beginning of the 20th century could be adjusted to the rules of Aristotle’s <em>Poetics</em>. Before World War I, however, all traditional art forms, led by painting, began to disintegrate, and new forms evolved to take their place. In drama, according to Yusuf (2014:3), the most radical innovator was August Strindberg (1849–1912), and from that day to this, drama (forced to compete with the cinema) has become ever more experimental, constantly striving for new methods, materials, and, especially, ways to establish a close relationship with the audience. All this activity has profoundly modified drama as literature.</p> <p><strong>2.2 An Overview of Northern Nigeria</strong></p> <p><em>Jihar Arewa Ta Tarayyar Jumhuriyar Najeriya; Motto: Aiki da Ibada: \"Work and Worship\"</em></p> <p>According to Auyo and Mohammed (2009:4), the above defines the stance of Northern Nigeria. Northern Nigeria was an autonomous division within Nigeria, distinctly different from the southern part of the country; it had independent customs, foreign relations and security structures. Ibrahim (2010:11) notes that in 1962, the region acquired the territory of the British Northern Cameroons, which voted to become a Province within Northern Nigeria. The pre-history of Northern Nigeria can be traced to the era of the Nok culture. The Nok culture, an ancient culture dominated most of what is now Northern Nigeria in pre-historic times, its legacy in the form of terracotta statues and megaliths have been discovered in Sokoto, Kano, Birinin Kudu, Nok and Zaria. The Kwatarkwashi culture, a variant of the Nok culture centred mostly around Zamfara in Sokoto Province is thought by some to be the same or an offshoot of the Nok.</p> <p>Ibrahim (2010:11) chronicles that the Fourteen Kingdoms unify the diverse lore and heritage of Northern Nigeria into a cohesive ethno-historical system. Seven of these Kingdoms developed from the Kabara legacy of the Hausa people. In the 9th century as vibrant trading centres competing with Kanem-Bornu and Mali slowly developed in the Central Sudan, a set Kingdoms merged dominating the great savannah plains of Hausa land, their primary exports were leather, gold, cloth, salt, kola nuts, animal hides, and henna. The online Encyclopaedia Britannica (20115:17) gives the names of the Seven Hausa states as: Daura ? – 1806, Kano 998 – 1807, Katsina C. 1400 – 1805, Zazzau (Zaria) C. 1200 – 1808, Gobir ? – 1808, Rano, and Biram C. 1100 – 1805. The growth and conquest of the Hausa Bakwai resulted in the founding of additional states with rulers tracing their lineage to a concubine of the Hausa founding father, Bayajidda. Thus they are called the 'Banza Bakwai’ meaning Bastard Seven. The Banza Bakwai adopted many of the customs and institutions of the Hausa Bakwai but were considered unsanctioned or copy-cat kingdoms by non-Hausa people. These states include: Zamfara, Kebbi, Yauri (also called Yawuri), Gwari (also called Gwari land), Kwararafa (a Jukun state), Nupe (of the Nupe people), Ilorin (a Yoruba state), Hausa States.</p> <p>According to the Kano Chronicle (2014:9), between 500 CE and 700 CE, Hausa people who are thought to have slowly moved from Nubia and mixing in with the local Northern and Middle Belt population, established a number of strong states in what is now Northern Nigeria and Eastern Niger. With the decline of the Nok and Sokoto, which had previously controlled Central and Northern Nigeria between 800 BCE and 200 CE, the Hausa were able to emerge as the new power in the region. They are closely linked with the Kanuri people of Kanem-Bornu (Lake Chad), the Birom, Gwari, Nupe and Jukun. The Hausa aristocracy, under influence from the Mali Empire adopted Islam in the 11th century CE. Auyo (2009:7) notes that by the 12th century CE the Hausas were becoming one of Africa's major powers. The architecture of the Hausa is perhaps one of the least known but most beautiful of the medieval age. Many of their early mosques and palaces are bright and colourful and often include intricate engraving or elaborate symbols designed into the facade. By 1500 CE, the Hausa utilized a modified Arabic script known as Ajami to record their own language; the Hausa compiled several written histories, the most popular being the Kano Chronicle.</p> <p>Usuman dan Fodio led a jihad against the Hausa States and finally united them into the Sokoto Caliphate. The Sokoto Caliphate was under the overall authority of the Commander of the Faithful. Under Dan Fodio, the Empire was bicephalous and divided into two territories each controlled by an appointed vizier. Each of the territories was further divided into autonomous Emirates under mainly hereditary local Emirs. The Bornu Empire was initially absorbed into the Sokoto Caliphate of Usman dan Fodio, but broke away after a few years later.</p> <p>The Kano Chronicle (2014:9) notes that nitially the British involvement in Northern Nigeria was predominantly trade-related, and revolved around the expansion of the Royal Niger Company, whose interior territories spread north from about where the Niger River and Benue River joined at Lokoja. The Royal Niger Company's territory did not represent a direct threat to much of the Sokoto Caliphate or the numerous states of Northern Nigeria. This changed, when Fredrick Lugard and Taubman Goldie laid down an ambitious plan to pacify the Niger interior and unite it with the rest of the British Empire.</p> <p>Auyo (2009:7) states that the protectorate of Northern Nigeria was proclaimed at Ida by Fredrick Lugard on January 1, 1897. The basis of the colony was the 1885 Treaty of Berlin which broadly granted Northern Nigeria to Britain, on the basis of their protectorates in Southern Nigeria. Hostilities with the powerful Sokoto Caliphate soon followed. The Emirates of Kabba, Kontogora and Ilorin were the first to be conquered by the British. In February 1903, the great fort of Kano, seat of the Kano Emirate was captured, Sokoto and much of the rest of its Caliphate soon catapulted. On March 13, 1903, the Grand Shura of Caliphate finally conceded to Lugard’s demands and proclaimed Queen Victoria, Queen and sovereign of the Caliphate and all its lands.</p> <p>The Governor, Frederick Lugard, with limited resources, ruled with the consent of local rulers through a policy of indirect rule which he developed into a sophisticated political theory. Lugard left the protectorate after some years, serving in Hong Kong, but was eventually returned to work in Nigeria where he decided on the merger of the Northern Nigeria Protectorate with Southern Nigeria in 1914. Agitation for independence from the radically different Southern Protectorate however led to a formidable split in the 1940s. The Richards constitution proclaimed in 1945 gave overwhelming autonomy to the North including eventually in the areas of foreign relations and customs policy.</p> <p>According to the Kano Chronicle (2014:11), Northern Nigeria was granted independence on the 15th of March 1957 with Sir Ahmadu Bello as its first premier. The Northern Peoples Congress under Sir Ahmadu Bello dominated parliament while the Northern Elements Progressive Union became the main opposition party. Northern Nigeria was divided into 13 provinces namely: Bauchi, Benue, Borno, Ilorin, Kano, Katsina, Plateau, Zaria, Niger, Adamawa, Kabba, Sokoto, Sardauna Kano, the largest of the provinces in terms of population and economy is in the North-Central part of the country. The Kano Native Authority, an offshoot of the Fula Kano Emirate inherited the ancient trade industries that fuelled the trans-Saharan trade with North Africa. The Province of Zaria is home to the City of Kaduna, an autonomous capital city that serves as the nation’s capital and home to its national institutions.</p> <p>Groundnut and cotton industries in the province of Kano provide the main source of revenue for Northern Nigeria. Tin mining in the Province of Plateau, Steel mining in the Province of Benue and other metal industries in the Province of Sokoto; build up the diverse mining industry of the Country. Cement industries in Sokoto and Bauchi and leather processing industries in Kano constitute the main manufacturing sector.</p> <p>Auyo (2009:11) observes that Northern Nigeria is an ethnically and religiously diverse state. The Hausa, Fula and Birom peoples dominate much of the North Western and Central parts of the Country. While the Hausa and Fula are chiefly Muslims, they have a very rich Christian history, the Ancient Hausa Kings of Gobir 'Masu Sakandami' - the Cross Bearers were Christians long before the coming of European evangelists and a large Christian Hausa and Fula minority thrives in many of the North Western Provinces. A substantial part of the Hausa population also adheres to ancient religion of Hausa Animism. The culture of Northern Nigeria is mostly dominated by the culture of the Fourteen Kingdoms that dominated the region in prehistoric times, but these cultures are also deeply influenced by the culture of the over one hundred ethnic groups that still live in the region.</p> <p><strong>2.3 Northern Nigeria and Popular Culture</strong></p> <p>Auyo (2009:11) states that Northern Nigeria inherited much of the literary legacy of the old Sudanic states. The Hausa Sultanates from the 9th to the 18th century produced numerous literary works. Thousands of such works mostly in Ajami, Hausa and Arabic still remain uncatalogued throughout Northern Nigeria. Since the colonisation by the British Empire, English and the Latin script has superseded the Ajami script. Ali (2014:5) notes that Abubakr Imam Kagara is regarded as one of the fathers of modern Northern Nigerian literature, his works such as <em>Ruwan Bagaja</em> and <em>Magana Jari Ce</em> published in the 1930s served as a bridge between the old sudanic literary tradition and western ways. Others like Yabo Lari and Muhammed Sule- author of the <em>Undesirable Elements</em> made equally important contributions in the 1960s. In the 1980s popular authors like Abubakar Gimba and Zainab Alkali served to keep the North’s literary tradition alive and distinct from the Nigerian south. The 1990s saw the emergence of authors from Abubakar Othman, Ismail Bala and Ahmed Maiwada in poetry to Maria Ajima and Victor Dugga in drama. Contemporary Northern Nigerian literature is mostly produced in Kano, Kaduna, Jos and Minna. Writers like B. M. Dzukogi, Ismail Bala, Yusuf Adamu, Musa Okpanachi, Razinat Mohammed and E. E. Sule are still active.</p> <p>According to Yusuf (2014:6), Northern Nigeria's movie industry known as Kannywood was one of the first commercial film industries in sub Saharan Africa. The industry was created by veteran journalists and actors from Radio Kaduna and RTV Kaduna in the 1950s. As at 2012, there are over 2000 Cinema companies operating in Northern Nigeria. Today actors like Ali Nuhu, Adam A. Zango, Sani Danja, Ibrahim Maishukku are popular within the region. Since the 1990s the slow rise of Islamic fundamentalism through the proselyte campaigns of the Izala Society, Northern Nigerian cinema has witnessed considerable setbacks and has now been dwarfed by its Southern Nigerian counterpart more commonly known as Nollywood.</p> <p>Adah and Chiama (2014:3) observe that while the old Sudanic tradition mostly concentrated on poetry and sung poetry, from the 1950s influx of British influence served to fertilise Northern Nigerian Music. Music and dance are an integral part of Nigeria’s rich cultural heritage. The diverse cultures, each with its techniques and instruments, have different kinds of music, ranging from folk to popular music, some of which are known worldwide. Adah and Chiama also note that the period of the late 1960s through the ’70s and ’80s was an extremely fertile era for music in Nigeria, as indeed it was around the world. While Afro-juju music was making waves in the Southwest with musicians the likes of Sunny Ade, Ebenezer Obey and Fela Anikulapo Kuti as its proponents and in the Southeast, Oliver de Coque, Osita Osadebe and Bright Chimezie were institutionalising Highlife music, Northern Nigeria was bubbling with the functional and entertaining songs of the local Folk music genre. Some notable names in Northern Nigerian music include the likes of Dan Maraya Jos, Mamman Shata, Barmani Choge, Aliyu Dan Kwairo and a host of others who are regarded as the founders of the distinct Northern Nigerian stylistic musical genre. Others like Fatima Uji continue to be popular. The profiles of some of these are discussed below according to Adah and Chiama  (2014):</p> <p><strong>Mamman Shata Katsina</strong> (1923-1999) was a Katsina-born Nigerian, well known as an accomplished griot among the Hausa people of West and Northeast Africa. His vocals, which were often accompanied by talking drums known as kalangu, provided a formidable source of entertainment for the people of Northern Nigeria for more than half a century. Shata built his long career in entertainment against his father’s wish for him to become an established farmer. Shata was involved in petty trading in Kola nuts and sweets (alewa) before he dumped that to embrace music full time. Many who had the privilege of encountering Shata in his day usually had the best of entertainment and relaxation times with him. This great folklorist was one of the bestselling Polygram artistes from Northern Nigeria in the ’80s. Shata also delved a bit into politics, especially at the grassroots, serving his people in the ’70s as a councillor in Kankia Local Government Area of Katsina State. In the Third Republic, he served as the chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Funtua Local Government.                                                <strong>Dan Maraya Jos</strong> (born Adamu Wayya in 1946 in Bukuru near Jos in Plateau State of Nigeria) is a Hausa griot (folklore custodian/singer) best known for playing the Kuntigi, a stringed lute-like instrument used in Nigerian Hausa music. He is a living legend in the Hausa music world until just recently. His songs are mainly about life and living. How did he come about the name Dan Maraya Jos, which literally means “the little orphan of Jos”? Well, his father, who was from Sokoto, died shortly after his birth and his mother also died while he was still an infant. So he became an orphan at a very tender age, hence the name “Dan Maraya Jos”, by which everybody knows him. His choosing a career in folk music was not an accident. His father was a court musician for the Emir of Bukuru, who took Dan Maraya into his care following the death of his parents. Dan Maraya showed interest in the art of music at a very early age and came under the influence of local professional musicians. “I had to start music at the age of seven” was his response to a question asked him by journalists some years ago. During a trip to Maiduguri as a preteen, he was impressed by musicians there and he made a Kuntigi, an instrument he has used as accompaniment ever since. In his active days, he composed over 500 songs.</p> <p>The mainstay of Dan Maraya’s repertoire is praise singing, addressing his own heroes who are usually not the rich and famous. His first and perhaps still his topmost hit song is “Wak’ar Karen Mota” (Song of the Driver’s Mate), a song in praise of young men who are bus conductors and do the dirty work of changing the tyres, pushing the buses when they break down, etc. He was taken to the battlefield during the Nigerian Civil War, to boost the morale of the men of the Federal Army with songs in which he vividly incorporated scenarios from the war.</p> <p><strong>Barmani Choge</strong> was a renowned Hausa female singer whose birth name was Sa’adatu Aliyu. She spent 52 years of her life composing and singing the Amada genre of Hausa folk music, accompanied by a water-filled calabash instrument beaten lightly like a drum. Her all-female group usually entertained women. Her themes dealt with issues like women’s empowerment and education. She also scolded jealous and lazy women, among other family issues she addressed in her songs. The name “Barmani Choge” was only a nickname, the first courtesy of her being the only surviving child of her parents and the other because of the way she would mimic a cripple’s walk in the early days of her career. When once asked, she explained, “Choge, as I use it, is a particular dance step attached to Amada music. It was in vogue a long time ago. The name was later appended to my real name by my fans.” Born in 1945 in what is now Katsina State, Choge died at 80 in Funtua town in 2013.</p> <p><strong>Bongos Ikwue</strong> was one of the most popular singers in the Nigerian music scene back in the day, whose personalised style of music made him a unique artiste. The music maestro, who is from Otukpo Local Government Area of Benue State, North-Central Nigeria, could be viewed as an intimate, earthy singer-songwriter, who delivered home truths with soulful, unpretentious vocals. Bongos was one of the very few Africans whose album hit platinum under PolyGram records in Europe. His career peaked in the 1970s through ’80s, a period when most of his hit tracks were released. Bongos’ light, however, could not shine on through the 1990s, but his numerous fans, who he won for himself through the rich messages of his folk-soul songs, still miss his stage performances. He is most remembered as the voice in the signature tune of famous television series “Cock Crow at Dawn”, as well as for numerous hits including Mariama, Teardrops, Still Searching, What’s Gonna Be and his vernacular tracks Eche w’ Une (Life is a Swing) and Ihotu (Love), among others.</p> <p><strong>Alhaji Abubakar Ladan, </strong>A famous poet well known for his songs and music on African unity, was born in 1935 at Kwarbai in Zaria City, Kaduna State in Northern Nigeria. After graduating from Alhudahuda Middle School (now Alhudahuda College) in the 1950s, Ladan started working as a veterinary officer in Malunfashi (now in Katsina State). He was inspired into music by reading the songs of other Hausa singers like Sa’adu Zungur, Muazu Hadija and a singer from Sudan called Abubakar Al-Kabirun. Abubakar Ladan has travelled widely across the African continent, visiting countries like Sudan, Morocco, Ethiopia, Somalia, Congo, Niger and Eritrea, among others. The honour of the Order of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (OFR) was conferred on him by Shehu Shagari’s government.</p> <p><strong>Alhaji Musa Dankwairo </strong>is another famous classical Hausa folklore singer in modern times. Dankwairo’s career in music was inherited; his father, Usman Dankwanda, served as a singer for the Emir of Maradun. Dankwairo grew up to know his father as a singer and at the age of seven, he began to accompany his father as he went around singing. After his father’s death, Dankwairo continued to go with and assist his brother, Aliyu Kurna, who directly inherited the father’s possessions. He got the name “Dankwairo” from a man by that name who happened to be a boy with lovely vocals in his father’s ensemble. The then young Dankwairo began to imitate him and gradually picked up in the art and rose to fame, and people began to call him Dankwairo. He served as a personal singer for the Sardauna of Sokoto. The first song he sang for the Sardauna was Mai Dubun Nasara.</p> <p><strong>Sanni Aliyu Dandawo</strong>, born about 67 years ago in Argungu in Kebbi State, is one northern musician who has touched the lives of many through his music. Dandawo’s father, the late Alhaji Aliyu Dandawo, was also a popular musician. Dandawo began his musical career in 1964. His praise music concentrates on traditional rulers, whom he eulogises in his songs. In traditional Hausa culture, he belongs to the class of singers known as Mawakinfada (singers for traditional rulers). As time went on, he also sang for politicians and the wealthy in society. He sang many songs for the late premier of the Northern Region and Sardauna of Sokoto, Sir Ahmadu Bello. Despite the advent of modern musical instruments, Dandawo still clings to his old traditional instruments, because according to him, they are what he inherited from his forefathers. His songs include Manir Jafaru, Sarkin Sudan Kontagora, Shehu Kangiwa, Ahmadu Aruwa, among others.</p> <p><strong>Alhaji Haruna Uji</strong> is a popular Hausa musician, who endeared himself to the hearts of the rich and the poor alike, as well as the young and the old through his music. Uji was born in Unguwar Gandun Quarters in Hadejia, present day Jigawa State in 1946. His father was an Islamic cleric. At the age of six, Uji was enrolled into a Qur’anic school and graduated five years later. A highly intelligent student, while in school, he would take charge and teach the class whenever the teacher was absent. Before his debut in music, he was a hunter, a farmer and also a driver. He gave up driving entirely when he became prominent as a musician. Uji was inspired into music after meeting a musician named Dan Mato in Kano, who played the Gurmi (a traditional instrument) that Uji also played. He went into music for the love of it and not for money, as he often rejected financial offers.</p> <p><strong>Hajiya Fatima Lolo</strong> was one of the traditional singers from Northern Nigeria. She was a Nupe folklorist from Niger State. Hajia Lolo was reputed to have brought Nupe music to national and international recognition. Lolo was a delight to watch, a sonorous vocalist to listen to. She, no doubt, brought beauty and glamour into Nupe music with her spectacular performances at various national and international festivals. Some of the events at which she performed include the Kaduna Durbar and Festac ’77 cultural and arts exhibition. This great and admirable folksong icon is late and will continue to be greatly missed by the world, especially music lovers in Northern Nigeria and her admirers in particular.        Since the 1990s influence of pop culture has led to rise of Northern Nigerian R&amp;B singers. Northern Nigerian Singers like Adam Zango, Ice Prince Zamani and Idris Abdulkareem etc. are popular throughout Africa.</p> <p><strong>2.4 Poetry and Social Commentary</strong></p> <p>            In his introduction, Shija (2008) observes that contemporary Nigerian poetry produced in the last three decades of the 20th century is often viewed as mere social and political propaganda. These new generation poets, unlike those in the earlier generation of Wole Soyinka and Christopher Okigbo, are often said to be too anxious to communicate their message of social advocacy and thus employ ordinary language. Hence, they are brushed aside as not worthy of serious academic study. Viewed through the prism of poetry, colonialist philosophy, shija argues, with references to the poetry of Tanure Ojaide and Niyi Osundare, that these allegations are merely political and therefore misplaced. Contemporary Nigerian poets according to him question the assumptions of superiority ascribed to Western standards of poetry as they positively deploy their indigenous African techniques of musicality, ritual imagery and local Idiom to fight social ills on their countries. (152)</p> <p>            Poetry has been one of the literary tools used for enforcing social change. The compressed and pregnant language of poetry necessarily makes it a strong tool for influencing the society through its paintings of facts and figures in symbolic and picturesque languages.</p> <p>The Post colonialism is a late 20th century concept used variously to depict a historical or political movement, a literary genre or indeed a cultural theory that spans the gamut of life of colonized people. As a historical or political movement, it is a fact that European nations colonized and shared out African territories at the Berlin conference of 1884-85 in tandem with their economic and strategic interests. These colonies were later granted independence in the second half of the 20th century (Shija: 152).</p> <p>            However, as a general rule, the semantic basis of the use “post” does not limit the concept only to activities after independence but indeed it covers the state of being of the colonized people from onset of colonialism. Bill Ascroftet al (1989) in Shija (2008) explain further that, “We use the term “post-colonial” however, to cover all the culture affected by the imperial process from the movement of colonization to the present day. This is because there is a continuity of Pre-occupations throughout the historical Process initiated by European imperial aggression” (2).</p> <p>As a literary genre, critics say all the literatures of the colonized people all over the world written right from the point of contact with the so-called superior cultures are post-colonial literature since they exhibit the same tendencies of resistance, ambivalence or sometimes subservience. As Shija puts it, it is estimated that about three quarters of all the people living in the world today have had their lives shaped by the experience of colonialism (153). Hans Bartens (2001) in Shija (2008) unjustifiably calls post-colonial criticism, racial in spite of the fact that the colonial experience sometimes takes place within the same race (80).Modern African poetry, like those of other post-colonial societies, is a product of conflict- the conflict of the mind arising from the denigration of colonialism and slavery, social inequalities, political conflict and neo-colonialism. According to Shija, so far there are three broad categories of modern poets that can be identified in Nigeria or even Africa today. The first generation of African poets includes writers who wrote their poetry before independence. They were mainly politicians. Examples are Sir Dennis Osadebey and Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe; D.I.E Dhlomo, Benedict Wallet Vilakazi of South Africa; kwame Nanquah, Micheal Dei Anang and Glady Casley Hayford of Ghana. These poets were not really concerned about techniques but were concerned with themes of race, nationalist struggles, Christianity and heroism (155). Shija further says that the second generation comprises among others, outstanding writers like Wole Soyionka, Gabriel Okara, J.P Clark, Christopher Okigbo, Denniis Brutus, Okot P. Bitek, Kwesi Brew, Kofi Awoonor and Lenrie Peters of Anglophone Africa. From the French speaking countries were poets like Leopald Sedar Senghor, Tchicaya U’ Tansi, Birago Diop and David Diop. The Lusophone countries had poets like Agostinho Neto, Autonio Jacinto, Vasco Cabral and Noemiade Gousa while the Arabic speaking countries boasted of the likes of Salah Abdul Sabr, Ahmed Hijazi and Mohammed Al-Faituri. This generation of peots, as observed by Ojaide and Sallah in “<em>The African Poetry</em>” is critical of colonialism and its members express their unease at the cultural crossroads as well as deploy political satire to criticize corruption in government, (156).The third generation, according to Shija (2008), has embraced and developed in various directions, more elements of written poetic traditions than their literary predecessors brought to global attention. They borrow techniques from both older poets and their local traditional art and setting. Since most of the poets have a populist approach towards poetry, the medium of dissemination of poetry has been democratized to involve all media of mass communications like the television, radio and newspaper. It is quite futile to mention a</p>\n\nLITERATURE IN NORTHERN NIGERIA: LANGUAGE AND POPULAR CULTURE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " LITERATURE IN NORTHERN NIGERIA: LANGUAGE AND POPULAR CULTURE", "id": 125}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>Attempting to look into the drama and theatre of the Asian world is like saddling one with the task of looking into the deep blue sea to fish out all the species of fishes therein. W. B. Worthen, based on the multifacetedness of the Asian world and it versatile political histories, authoritatively asserts that \"the drama and theatre of the Asian world has a history as complex and multifaceted as the histories of the many civilizations, peoples and nations\" (99). The Korean Arts Management Service affirms this position in a book, Asian Arts Theater Research on the Actual Condition of Performing Arts in Asia that:</p> <p>Unlike the Western World, Asia has such a long history and traditions thereby presenting a variety of cultural diversity, which cannot be generalized into a single definition. Together with its own artistic heritages and newly accepted modern performing arts, Asia became the home to a number of new artistic possibilities. Various performing arts forms of Asia have already made a significant impact on the modern performing arts of the Western, gaining growing attention from the rest of the world (5).</p> <p>Therefore, this paper only attempts to consider the contemporary Japanese theatre, however, it is noteworthy to state that the history of the development of theatres in Asia are somewhat interrelated because of the political and religious dominances of some countries over others. Take for instance the Indian literature of <strong><em>SANSKRIT </em></strong>and <strong>KATHAKALI </strong>(dance and music drama) which have lasted for more than three thousand years old still have their place of influence and popularity. The conventions of Indian theatre have pervasively influenced the theatre of Southeast Asia; the Sanskrit epic poems <em>Mahabharata </em>and <em>Ramayana </em>offer the characters and settings for the beautiful shadow puppet theatre of Java in Indonesia – <strong><em>WAYANG KULIIT</em> – </strong>and related forms of performance using dolls or live actors. </p> <p>In a similar pattern, the masked dance drama of Korea which is called <strong><em>KAMYONGUK</em></strong> is also related both to Chinese and Japanese theatre, and Korea, like other Asian countries, has developed an important contemporary theatre. No one theatre can be said to represent the rich and diverse theatrical traditions, the classical theatre of Japan shares many features common to other Asian theatres: it blend aristocratic and popular affiliations; it descends from social and religious ritual traditions; it coordinates acting, dance, music and spectacle; many of its plots and characters are derived from familiar literary and historical narratives and legends; its performance conventions are elaborately stylized and refined; and it performers are often trained with level of formality not found in western theatre. Since this paper concerns the contemporary Asian theatre and its practice today, it is then canny to avoid its verse history of the theatre. </p> <p>The Contemporary Japanese Theatre Activities</p> <p>To understand Japanese theatre activity as a whole, it is important to say that there are four different types of theatre that one can find at virtually any given time: the traditional theatres doing <em>Noh, Kyogen, Kabuki, Bunraku</em> and classical Japanese dance; the commercial theatres performing Japanese versions of the latest hits from around the world; <em>Shingeki </em>(modern or conventional drama) groups presenting a range of western-style comedies and dramas from both the past and the present; the experimental or alternative theatres known in Japan as Small theatres.</p> <p>The traditional theatre forms can be found in Tokyo at either the national theatres or at some of the privately operated theatres such as Kabuki-za (or Minami-za in Tokyo). Noh and Kyogen can still be seen in various cities while <em>Bunraku </em>is generally limited to performances in Tokyo at the National Bunraku Theatre or during shorter seasons of the National Theatre in Tokyo. The commercial theatres are generally run by major producing companies such a Tobo (which operate several theatres in Tokyo) and Shochiku (which operates the Kabuki-za and Shimbashi Enbujo. Many Japanese productions of West End or Broadway hits have played in Tokyo under the auspices of these managements. The <em>Shingeki </em>theatre was an attempt by Japanese theatre artists to create a European-style theatre, a form of drama that is different from the classical forms. The Small Theatre was a reaction against <em>shingeki</em> and against society as a whole. The small group experimented with new styles and new work methods (see Don Rubin, Chua Soo Pong and Ravi Chaturvedi, 222-234). For instance the <em>Angura</em>, literally meaning “underground”, was a loose theatre movement created in the 1960s and 1970s, it reacted against the formal realism of the Shingeki to create wild, anarchic productions in theatres, tents and outdoors. It explored primitive and provocative themes, and was associated with avant-garde contemporary cinema as well as groundbreaking art and graphic designs. </p> <p>Therefore, what could be termed as contemporary Japanese theatre is a combination of both the old and the new, which is, production of the classical theatre and the conventional theatre. The contemporary Japanese theatre is centered on the aforementioned forms of theatres in Japan.</p> <p><strong>The Kabuki theatre </strong></p> <p>The Japanese classical forms of theatre are still in existence, especially the Kabuki theatre, with some levels of modernization, which apparently has given it strong audience appreciation and sustenance among the Japanese and foreign audiences, even in this 21st. century. For nearly four hundred years Kabuki theatre has been a popular entertainment among the common people in town areas in Japan. In fact, the practitioners of this aged long theatre have been touring major cities of Japan since July eight till September this year, using the Kabuki-za Theatre and the National Theatre which are located in various places within Tokyo in order to reach all demography of audience. The famed Shochiku group runs a number of permanent kabuki theaters, including the Kabukiza Theater in Ginza, Shimbashi Enbujo Theatre and Theater Cocoon in Shibuya (all in Tokyo), as well as the Kyoto Minamiza Theatre and the Osaka Shochiku-za Theatre. </p> <p>They are mindful of business and entrepreneurially innovative that in some of their performances they allow non-native audience to rent tablets that will provide English subtitles or headsets offering the plot and other interesting information as the action happens onstage. A kabuki performance is a great way to spend a day indoors. Unlike a Western theater experience, which will last up to perhaps three hours, a kabuki performance will typically start before noon and run with periodic breaks until evening, with scenes from multiple plays of varying lengths strung together throughout the day. You can get single-act tickets in some theaters, but you'll likely have to wait in line for them. And seats are not only limited, you may end up standing at the back of the room.</p> <p><strong>What is Kabuki Theatre?</strong></p> <p>Kabuki is a rich blending of realism and formalism, of music, dance, mime and spectacular staging and costuming. The Chinese word- compounds in current use by the 16th century was kabu. At the beginning the Japanese added to this their own ending ‘su’ (meaning-‘to do’), and arrived at a verb, meaning ‘to sing and dance’. Then the word used by the Japanese people is kabusu, meaning is ‘to do singing and dancing’, can be considered as a verb. However, today what is known as ‘Kabuki’ is a broad concept.  In modern Japanese, the word is written with three characters; ‘ka’ signifying ‘sing’; ‘bu;’ ‘dance, and ‘ki;’ ‘skill’. So, Kabuki is the skill of sing and dance can be considered as a noun. With the influence of the west and new types of theatrical performances in Japan, the meaning of the word ‘Kabuki’ became more restrictive. It now refers to a specific and particular type of classic theatre, and communicates the synthetic idea of a special and rarefied style of acting, certain types of plays, and a set and inflexible repertoire. </p> <p>      There is evidence that the word ‘Kabuki’ was used as early as the ninth century to describe actors. However, this use was not continued. The meaning of the word had changed completely by the sixteenth century. </p> <p>      Kabuki is a type of acting based on the arts of singing and dancing, occurs during the course of the development of a story characterized by dramatic elements. Kabuki’s roots lie in musical theatre. Evidence of this ranges from the onstage accompaniment by singers and players of drums, flutes and, most importantly, of the three- stringed sha misen to the offstage background music provided by the geza musicians who add immeasurably to the atmosphere and emotion of any scene. In the case of dances, of course, music and especially songs are of vital importance. Kabuki actors also have to study traditional Japanese dance called Nihon buyo. Dances make up around one third of the existing repertoire, and while some are more skilled than others. All Kabuki actors are to some degree also dances. Kabuki, in fact, began as dance drama.  Many Kabuki dances were created as part of longer plays. Even when there is no particular story to tell, the dancer will still be in character. Kabuki dance is never separated from acting. Acting also is the very essential part of Kabuki drama. All young Kabuki actors, as part of their training, have to learn the basic movement patterns, postures, and speech of typical male and female roles. While some clever actors can play both male and female characters successfully. The whole performance is executed as a highly refined art. To be exact the Kabuki may be described as a play more like a revue than a drama. However, the Kabuki is a kind of classical drama for the masses and is rich in artistic qualities. Moreover, the Kabuki can be considered as a very complicated dramatic form.  </p> <p>     The Kabuki drama is so complicated in its nature that it is a difficult task to define it in a few words. Kabuki plays are also known as kyageki or plays of the old school. Kabuki is referred to by the Japanese as ‘Living pictures’ and ‘Living history’. Both terms convey, the colour, beauty, and faithful representation of ancient customs and manners embodied in the art. </p> <p>      Kabuki, the national theatre of Japan, is generally conceded by scholars, both Asian and Western, to be the most perfect and elaborate classical theatre extent. Kabuki theatre is so vivid, spontaneous and dynamic that it throws open a door and gives us a clear view of the Japanese people, customs and art.  <strong>Seeing Kabuki is to see Japan’s traditional stage arts which have been established for over 400 years. </strong>The Japanese Government had a seclusion policy in place for more than two hundred years. In this period, the administration was stabilized and a period of peace ensued bringing with the unique cultural development. Kabuki is one of the best examples of this. Kabuki, which is the most popular of the traditional Japanese stage arts, is still hugely popular in Japan. It is said that there are so many kabuki plays in existence. However, only about 400 of these have retained their popularity over time. Kabuki has developed by taking many elements of the traditional stage arts, such as Noh theatre and Bunraku puppet theatre and combined them with the Japanese sense of beauty. There are many unique features of kabuki performance including acting techniques, costumes, wigs, stage setting mechanisms etc. that can only be seen in kabuki. It has been said that kabuki is the closest you can get to a true sense of Japanese aesthetic beauty, kabuki is unpretentious, easy to enjoy and much more accessible than other traditional performance such as Noh theatres.</p> <p><strong>Rakugo Theatre</strong></p> <p><em>Rakugo</em> is a kind of comic storytelling that sits on the crossroads between stand-up comedy and a one-man show. Each performance begins with a self-introductory narrative that's just like a stand-up comedian's opening monologue, which will gradually transition into a setup for a humorous story—some of which are new, and some have been beloved for generations. <br/> The storyteller remains kneeling the entire time, and can only use a <em>tenugui</em> hand towel and<em>sensu</em> fan as props, meaning quite a few ingenious techniques need to be used to create the various characters in each scenario. <br/> You can use the calendar function at Hanashi to check for <em>rakugo</em> performances pretty much anywhere in Japan, with a particular focus on Tokyo and Osaka. Since much of the humor is based on puns, you have to have very strong Japanese to follow along. That said, there are a handful of storytellers who perform <em>rakugo</em> in English or a combination of English and Japanese, with the most notable being Katsura Sunshine, who's the first formally trained foreign-born <em>rakugo-ka</em> in a century—and also hilarious!</p> <p><strong>The English Community Theatre in Japan</strong></p> <p>There are a number of English community theater groups in Japan, many of which produce professional-quality plays and musicals. Runs tend to be short—usually just a few days or even a single weekend. <br/><br/> Founded in 1896, Tokyo International Players (TIP) is the largest English theater group in the Tokyo area, typically producing three or four shows per year on different stages in the city, as well as offering a handful of second-stage productions. Other groups in the Kanto area include Yokohama Theatre Group (YTG), Black Stripe Theater (BST) and Tokyo Artistic Theatre Ensemble (TATE). If you have little ones, you may also want to check out Tokyo Theatre for Children (TTFC). The schedules for many of these groups, as well as Tokyo-area comedy and improve troupes, can be found at Tokyo Stage. Outside of the Tokyo area, the Nagoya Players have been active since 1975, typically producing two plays per year. Nameless Theatre and Kan Theatre (Kangeki Theatre) are two other offerings in the Aichi Prefecture capital. Around Kyoto.</p> <p>The Tokyo International Players is a theatrical organization comprised primarily of the Tokyo foreign community, which provides quality English-language entertainment for international audiences. It presented ‘Romeo and Juliet’ on February 03, 2014 and February 27 – March 2, 2016, and it was directed by Wendell T Harrison, this marks the first time in its 117-year history that TIP will perform this play. Romeo and Juliet is the classic story of two warring families, and their children who manage to find love. One major change to this production is taking the fabled “star-crossed lovers” out of Verona, Italy and transporting them to Dejima, off the coast of Nagasaki. In 1639, tensions were high between the Japanese and the Portuguese settlers, who were all but exiled to the artificial island. TIP’s production revisits this brief moment in Japanese history to shed light on the future of Japan, with an original twist where the Capulets are Japanese and the Montagues are expatriates, speaking in both English and Japanese.</p> <p>This show broke new ground for Tokyo International Players. Last year, the TIP produced of Waiting for Godot whereby they used Japanese subtitles. While in Romeo and Juliet they expanded the use of Japanese subtitles and English subtitles for the Japanese lines. “Our fresh re-telling of this classic and timeless story will explore what it means to love without boundaries in a society that has trouble accepting it,” says Frances Somerville, TIP Box Office Manager, “a concept which remains relevant today.”</p> <p>The cast includes TIP veterans Brian Berdanier, Sarah Macdonald, Rika Wakasugi, Rodger Sonomura, Paul Howl, and Ra’Chelni M. Weir II and stars newcomers Sal Randazzo as Romeo and Tomomi Kikuchi as Juliet.</p> <p><strong>The Tokyo Globe</strong></p> <p>The neighborhood of Shin-Okubo, nondescript and seldom visited, is an unlikely spot for a grand cultural experiment. Yet here, in full sight and sound of the railroad tracks, stands the Tokyo Globe, a reconstruction of Shakespeare’s theater that opened its first season with a series of his history plays – in English and without translation.</p> <p>Other offerings this season will include productions of Shakespeare’s late romances by Britain’s National Theater and a visit by the Royal Dramatic Theater Company of Sweden, presenting Ingmar Bergman’s production of ”Hamlet” and Strindberg’s ”Miss Julie” in Swedish.</p> <p>In an age when Japan has vaulted to the top in trade and finance, the ambition, even the vanity, of the Tokyo Globe project is somehow fitting. ”It says something about Japan,” said Michael Pennington, joint artistic director of the English Shakespeare Company, the British troupe that performed the Wars of the Roses cycle beginning with ”Richard II” and ending with ”Richard III.” ”If you imagine an expensive new theater opening in the middle of London and the first companies invited are two Kabuki companies and then Ingmar Bergman,” he said, ”eyebrows would be raised.” ‘Most Popular Playwright’</p> <p>Yet the Globe’s producers are confident of Shakespeare’s appeal to Japanese theatergoers. ”If you ask who is the most popular playwright in Japan, we would have to say Shakespeare,” said Seiya Tamura, senior managing director of the Shinjunku-Nishitoyama Development Company, the real estate concern that built the Tokyo Globe as the price for being allowed to construct condominium apartments on Government-owned land. ”Shakespeare is universal,” Mr. Tamura said. ”He does express the character of human beings. We feel that the current century is a time of big changes similar to the time between the Middle Ages and the modern age, and in that kind of time, Shakespeare’s plays are important.”</p> <p>Shakespeare scholars here agree. ”There is no one else here comparable to Shakespeare,” said Yushi Odashima, a professor of English at Tokyo University and perhaps Japan’s foremost Shakespeare translator. ”There are 15 productions a year of plays I have translated. So I think it’s natural to have a balance, one theater mainly for Shakespeare.” #3 Historical Sources The theater’s planners decided to model the Tokyo Globe on the second Globe theater, opened in 1614 after the first burned. The architect for the project was Arata Isozaki, who designed the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and the Palladium discotheque in New York City. Mr. Isozaki and the Japanese Shakespeare scholars who advised him drew upon three historical sources -a sketch of the second Globe from the outside, a sketch of the interior of another Elizabethan theater, the Swan, which offered clues about seating arrangements and stage construction, and a contract for the building of the 17th-century Fortune theater, which specified that many features of the Globe be copied. To these Mr. Isozaki applied his imagination and his own interest in the neo-classical principles of much Renaissance architecture.</p> <p>He came up with a 24-sided near-circle, complete with Shakespeare’s thrust stage jutting into an audience seated in three tiers. Mr. Isozaki has pointed out that in some ways, the Elizabethan stage resembled Japan’s Noh theater (dating from the 14th century), with a thrust stage with pillars only partly roofed over. He also discarded some conventions – the Tokyo Globe is not made of wood and is not partly open-air. And he added some distinctive touches of his own -the Tokyo Globe is salmon-pink on the outside, high-tech gray on the inside, with grids and portholelike windows. The new theater, which seats 650 to 700 people, cost $16 million.</p> <p>As part of their program, the members of the English Shakespeare Company mounted a stylish, modern-dress production of ”Henry V,” which alluded, among other things, to the British war in the Falklands as a parallel to the zealous nationalism that infused Henry’s centuries-earlier invasion of France. Mr. Pennington said the company decided to make no concessions to the Japanese audience, and indeed, some of the characters spoke with appropriate, although to Japanese ears probably unintelligible, Welsh, Irish and Scottish accents.</p> <p>The audience sat attentively, several following along in Japanese-language texts of the play and listening to earphones that gave a few seconds’ synopsis in Japanese between scenes. With a seriousness characteristic of the Japanese approach to both work and culture, many said they had read the play carefully. Several in the crowd said they were Shakespearean scholars, university professors or English teachers.</p> <p> <strong>Contemporary Japanese Theatre and “Global Fusion”</strong></p> <p>The most common practice of theatre tradition in Japan today is what could be called theatre of global fusion or international/intercultural theatre and drama productions, especially in Tokyo and other prefectural district like Shizuoka. The theatre culture in Japan is very strong and seems not to be threatened by the interface of the media technology or the new media. It still holds fast the orthodoxy or convention of the total theatre unlike the west. Many Western plays, from those of the Ancient Greek theatre to William Shakespeare and from those of Fyodor Dostoevsky to Samuel Beckett, are performed in Tokyo. An incredible number of performances, perhaps as many as 3,000, are given each year, making Tokyo one of the world’s leading theatrical centers.</p> <p>            There are different forms of theatre outlets and festivals in various cities of Japan wherein theatre productions are display. One of these festivals that is beckoned with a wealth of top-class performing arts and is so popular today, and that is really patronized by theatre professionals, fans and goers from major countries is the annual World Theatre Festival Shizuoka under Mt. Fuji, holding in the coastal city of Shizuoka, midway between Tokyo and Nagoya. This festival is organized by the director of Shizuoka Performing Arts Centre (SPAC) for the past ten years.</p> <p>This year’s festival included top artists from eight countries who presented seven varied programs between April 29 and May 8 at venues around the city — including SPAC’s Shizuoka Arts Theatre and a stage specially built in the central Sumpujo Park — as well as at SPAC’s Udo open-air theater in the rolling hills of Nihondaira Park. </p> <p>Since this festival started, its attendances have been growing numerically, basically because of the variety of drama performances from different culture and traditions. As to why attendances are growing year after year, Miyagi, a SPAC’s member, when he was asked by a local newspaper reporter how such a great festival could be happening in a tiny prefecture like Shizuoka, he said that “the answer is really that more and more people are recognizing how it is quietly but steadily becoming a showcase for some of the best of the world’s theater at a time when commercial constraints are allowing fewer chances to see top-class foreign programs even in Tokyo.”</p> <p>His comments were amplified by the leading playwright, director and founder of the Seinendan Theater Company, Oriza Hirata. “Because of this international festival,” he says, “theater people here can actually see and learn about current trends around the world, and also become more aware of how to connect with the worldwide market.”</p> <p>According to Yoko Narushima, SPAC’s managing director, the festival is growing steadily, with paying audience numbers last year up more than 15 percent on 2013. In addition, she says, more and more visitors from outside Shizuoka are tending to stay in the city for a few days.</p> <p>In her view, these positive trends have gathered pace since SPAC moved the festival’s dates from June to Golden Week in 2014, allowing holidaymakers to add a little culture to their leisure (along with some of the country’s freshest and most reasonably priced seafood), while giving theater buffs every excuse to unwind and indulge themselves away from the big-city bustle. To help ensure the success of that shift in timing, SPAC also revised its programming to utilize more outdoor venues, including the city’s streets and parks, and even residential areas, so a wider range of people can encounter theater in their daily lives.</p> <p>In addition, this year SPAC added an element called <strong>Strange Seed</strong>, <strong>which features 14 free street performances in the city center</strong> which consist of contemporary dance, physical comedy and mime. Explaining his approach, Masahiro “Worry” Kinoshita, Strange Seed’s program director, says, “I invited artists who are able to perform for very mixed audiences, and who have a real pop sensibility, because I especially want this program to reach out to people who’ve never seen theater or dance before.”</p> <p>To further foster bonds between festival audiences and local people, this year SPAC will also repeat its unique <strong>Nedoco accommodation</strong> project that proved such a hit when it was launched last year — <strong>allowing audience members to stay at such places as temples and public halls for a nominal ¥3,000 per night to cover the cost of meals.</strong></p> <p><strong>International Theatre Professionals at SPAC in Shizuoka</strong></p> <p>As a result of all this, the festival is playing a greater role in Shizuoka society — but how is it resonating around the theater world?</p> <p>Certainly, many overseas artists have been coming back after their first visit, sometimes to collaborate with SPAC’s actors and staff and create new programs together.</p> <p>Prominent among these was French director Claude Regy, who debuted in 2010 with his acclaimed solo drama “Ode maritime” — then returned in 2013 to create and perform a new play, titled “Allay,” with SPAC actors, before taking it on tour in Europe and Asia with the same Japanese cast.</p> <p>This year’s lineup included: Olivier Py, the artistic director of France’s Avignon Festival who returned with a new version of his “The Girl, the Devil and the Mill” from his acclaimed “Grimms’ Fairy Tales” trilogy. Premiered to great reviews at the 2014 Avignon Festival, Py this time staged the work at SPAC’s Udo theater.</p> <p>Another returnee is the Lebanese-Canadian playwright, director and actor Wajdi Mouawad, who made his Japanese debut at the 2010 festival with his award-winning play “Littoral,” and this time brings his solo autobiographical masterpiece “Seuls.” </p> <p>Australian artist Tim Watts is another one of many with fond memories of SPAC’s upland base. As he prepares to make his second festival appearance, this time with “It’s Dark Outside,” his nonverbal short play involving imaginative puppetry, animated films and original music, he recalled in an email how, “Six years ago, drinking green tea freshly harvested from the fields just outside the theater I’d just performed in, and staring out at Mount Fuji towering above me, I felt dwarfed by the breathtaking setting of Shizuoka that is infused with art and culture.”</p> <p>In a slightly different way, returning Singaporean director Ong Keng Sen, who is one of the biggest names in Asian theater, reported that SPAC’s “unique character” helped to lure him back.</p> <p>“The sense of adventure in a festival is very important and SPAC has this,” he said. “I don’t believe in bourgeois festivals that are about bringing ‘the best’ together. A festival in its deeper meaning is about a time and space outside of our normal lives; it’s an escape valve, a carnival which enriches our life afterward.”</p> <p>Ong is certainly putting on a carnival this year, combining kabuki, <em>kyōgen</em>(Japan’s traditional comedy theater) and contemporary theater actors with ones from Singapore and Indonesia in his self-styled “global fusion” production of leading Japanese playwright Hideki Noda’s “Richard Sandaime” (“Third-generation Richard”), based loosely on Shakespeare’s “Richard III.”</p> <p>Explaining that he is “particularly interested in intercultural interfaces, meaning dialogues between cultures,” Ong says he is eagerly awaiting Miyagi’s new work “The White Hare of Inaba-Navajo.”</p> <p>In this play, which will have its world premiere at the festival, Miyagi introduces the well-known Japanese fable, “The White Hare of Inaba,” and a strangely similar story common among Native Americans — then proceeds to create a third version.</p> <p>In exploring how the ancient fable may have crossed the Pacific and then been transformed, the festival’s artistic director says he was happy to be pursuing the kind of “intercultural interface” beloved by Ong. He also says he has every intention of inviting more great foreign artists as well as introducing the world to Japanese plays by taking his “White Hare” to France in June, for instance, following his Avignon Festival triumph with “Mahabharata” two years ago. Besides these five programs by returning artists, two first-timers will join the festival this year.</p> <p>Already well-known here for his prints and drawings, South African artist William Kentridge will debut with “Ubu and the Truth Commission.” Created in collaboration with compatriots from the famed Handspring Puppet Company, this work combining Kentridge’s puppetry with live acting, animation and documentary films is intriguingly billed as an updated version of Alfred Jarry’s powerful and groundbreaking 1896 absurdist play “Ubu Roi” — but set in the post-apartheid era.</p> <p>The other newcomer this year is Lebanese actress Sawsan Bou Khaled, who will perform “Alice,” a nightmarish solo play she wrote and directs that had its world premiere in Beirut in 2013.</p> <p>All in all, Miyagi seems to be well on course to giving Japan its own outstandingly welcoming, top-notch variant on Avignon’s renowned annual international arts event — and one held in a similarly marvelous natural setting, too.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>The contemporary theatre professionals and buffs have not been cornered by the technological advances of the old and the new media which seem to pose a great threat on conventional theatre practices, because they have chosen to hold tenaciously onto their traditional theatre heritage, though now modified with modern elements, and have also entertain international/inter-cultural drama in their land, that is opening up doors for various artists from different parts of the world to enrich the aesthetics of theatre, especially in terms of cultural exchange of values and themes. This practice and reverence of theatre is worthy of emulation in order to sustain the life of the live theatre irrespective of technological interface.  </p> <p><strong>Works Cited</strong></p> <p>Harris, J Wesley.

Some of the topics dealt with are summarized in the research and findings are stated accordingly.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0            </strong><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>Leadership is an important aspect of management. Indeed it exists in various segment of the population that is studies, military, business, home, mosque, church, etc.</p> <p>Leadership is only one part of management the two terms are not interchangeable. While leadership is an important part of management, particularly at the supervisory level, a good manager or leader must have conceptual and technical skill as well as human leadership skill. </p> <p>A leader who is successful at directing worker to strike toward group objective, which he has identified goals are attainable and can be periodically achieved.</p> <p>The word leadership can be regarded as influence or process of influencing people so that they will strive willing and in flusiatcally toward the achievement of group goals or organizational goals, there are certain designable traits or style which makes a leader to be effective for example charisma, foresight, initiative, integrity persuasiveness and intevigence etc.</p> <p>Leaders can be replaced if we could identify the style associated with leadership then our ability to select effective leadership behavior and a technique is therefore improved. </p> <p>Nevertheless, leadership is both effectuate that bond works group together and the catalyst that triggers employer’s motivation. As a result of this, the leader’s straight comes primarily from the support of the sub-ordinates; without their support and co-operation, the leader finds It practically impossible to reach the planned objective and the come generally in effect. </p> <p>Moreover, leadership occurs within a specific situation. In the social setting there is a person, a position and a situation despite all that has been written about leadership, these has been no consensus concerning the primary role, or function of leadership. </p> <p>Finally, leadership becomes necessary in all area of management either in trading concern or non-trading organization because it help those who direct others or influence others to know why it is necessary to allow fairness and justice in their decision making. </p> <p><strong>1.1     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong></p> <p>Leaders, in most of the organization are political appointees who may not be professionally competent; these political appointees interfere in the day to day activities of the organization. As a result of these political and in-competent interference, many organizations cannot perform their responsibility effectively and efficiency, in most organizations. There are poor leadership systems. As a result of improper control and directives become rampart in most of the organization. Poor attitude of leadership toward obligation also militate against efficiency.</p> <p><strong>1.2     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this project work as to give an in-depth research or examination of leadership style effectiveness in the organization performance: Some of the objectives are as follows: </p> <p>          i.            To identify some of the general characteristic of a leader and show the situation in which a group find its seat in determining the choice of a leader. </p> <p>       ii.            To determine how the leaders behavior affects the behavior of others in different fields. </p> <p>                         iii.            To examine the various ingredients and function of leadership. </p> <p>                         iv.            To examine the factors affecting leadership styles and </p> <p><strong>1.3     RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>i.       How dose effective leaders gain the power to control and influence other to achieve organization objectives?        </p> <p>ii.      How can the behaviors of leaders affect the behaviors of their subordinates?</p> <p>iii.     What are the various ingredient and function of leadership?</p> <p>iv.     What are the major problems associating with leadership and how they can be solved? </p> <p><strong>1.4     RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>Presented below is a set of hypothesis used for this research work.  </p> <p><strong><em>          Ho:</em></strong>   Style of leadership does not determine the attainment of organization goals and objective.</p> <p><strong>1.5     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Apart from the fact, it will also be useful to companies and organizations, this is because the country is striving hard to make necessary effort to improve leadership style in all the sectors of the organization and this would help the economic growth and development of Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6     SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The research work covers the major factors, which leaders need to know, this includes the style of a good leader to improve productivity and attainment of the organizational goals and also to meet the team of expert, the behavior and style of leader well as the existing type of leadership. </p> <p>There are certain constraints, which were encountered during the course of this study. </p> <p><strong>1.7     OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS </strong></p> <p>The following terms are hereby briefly defined</p> <p>                i.         <em>Leader: </em>A leader is defined as someone who guides others action and opinion, it’s also entail one who checks activities of others in any big enterprise. </p> <p>          ii.               <em>Leadership:</em> leadership is defined as the prominent of one or few individual in a group which is the process of control and co-ordination. </p> <p>       iii.            <em>Organization:</em> Is a system by which manager’s co-ordinate human and materials resources within the formed structure of task or authority.</p> <p>       iv.            <em>Style:</em> Can be define as a way of performance in an organization, in order to retain satisfies her customer according to their demand. </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW AND THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</strong></p> <p><strong>   2.1  INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p>There is no universal agreement on what leadership is or how it is conceptualized. Akpan (1982:3) defined leadership as “ability to influence subordinate to do what they have to do. It has been defined as the art of inducing subordinate to accomplish their assignments seal and confidence”.</p> <p>According to Montgomer (1962) defined leadership as the capacity and will to rally men and women to a common purposed, and the character which inspires confidence. Thus, leadership has to do with character, inspiration and capacity in guiding the conduct of subordinates. Lord Slim further attempted to differentiate between leadership and management. He said “There is different between leadership and management. Leadership is of the spirit, compounded of personality and vision; its practice is an art. Management is of the mind, more a matter of accurate calculations, of statistics, of methods, timetables, and routines, its practice is science, managers are necessary; while leaders are essential”. Viewed from the standard point of result, leadership can be defined as getting people to what the leader wants them to do because he has influenced or inspired them to believe it is what they want to do. </p> <p>Leadership is viewed from other contest by Robert C. Klekamp, Daniel W. Geesing in their work entitled <em>Management Principles and Practices (1982). </em>They defined leadership as a way of stimulating and motivating subordinates to accomplish assign task. Apart from stimulating leadership is also concerned with guiding, conducting and directing. </p> <p>He/she moves the group within the constraints of it maximum capabilities to attain certain specified objectives. Their group response will depend upon capacities of the leaders. </p> <p>Leadership has a greater relevant in activating and controlling sector, one should assume that leading is synonymous with managing. A good manager is a good leader, may not increase to be a manager. </p> <p>Leadership was defined by Mallam Hammed Yanga (1960) in management as the “Process of influencing members of the organization or to work willingly with zeal and confidence so that organizational or the group’s objective can be accomplished. To lead is to guide, direct and proceed” According to Apple (1961), leadership simply refers the ability of management to induce subordinate to work toward organizational goals with confidence and Drucker (1962) argues that when we talk of leadership, we are talking common men. Leadership “Is the lifetime of a man’s vision to higher sights, the raising of man’s performance to a higher standard, the building of man’s personality beyond its normal limitation”. Therefore, leadership occurs whenever one person influence and other to work toward some prediction goals, willingly and enthusiastically. </p> <p>Leadership is term used to describe a position in an organizational hierarchy. Following this definition, the president of chief executive officer of a firm is a leader by virtue of holding a high office. Others use the term to describe particular personal characteristic under this definition, a person is fudged a leader because of possessing certain style (for example; perseverance, maturity, intelligence, fairness, spirit of competition inquisitiveness, honesty and integrity, among others). </p> <p>Finally, the term leadership is also used to describe a category of behavior, following this development, leadership refer to a dynamic process in which individual behaves in a certain manner thereby influencing other to follow stating. To those view point, leadership is the art of individual or group activities towards achievement of enterprise goal. Leadership has given a variety of definition in behavioral science; leadership is social influencing process for the attainment of goals. </p> <p>A leader is the most influential person in organization who provides direction to follow, guide group activities and ensures group objective are realize. The function of leadership pervades all organizations. A good leader therefore, is one who of personating other to move enthusiastically toward the achievement of group goals. An example of a charismatic leader could be creative, initiative and moving on his speech, actions including his style of interaction with other people in his society. </p> <p>Leaders characteristically induce or inspire other to achieve leadership because it occurs within a specific situation on the role or function of leadership. According to Nwachukwu (1962) maintained despite all that has been written about leadership, there had been no consensus on the primary role or function of leadership. </p> <p>In other views, the topic leadership is not an easy one to tackle, who is a leader? What does leadership mean? Ask these questions from any randomly selected group and a multitude of conflicting answers will ensure. </p> <p>We have been told that some people are born leaders; other shave leadership trust upon them. But today, psychologist agrees that leaders can in fact be made. Leadership consists of certain fundamental positive style which can be learned and applied to anyone. </p> <p>Moreover, the concept goal derived from leadership theory. These theories suggest that leaders are effective because of their position impact on flowers motivation, ability at performance and satisfaction. It is called path-goal, due, in essences to the leadership influence on the subordinates’ perceptions of work goals; itself develop goals, and attainment. The basic of goal concept is expectancy motivation which state that an individual’s attitude, job satisfaction behavior is seen as leading to various out comes that is the valances/or the preference for those outcome.</p> <p><strong>2.2     CONCEPT OF LEADERSHIP</strong>  </p> <p>According to Chester (1938), leader defined “the goals that organization purses the develop, the planning and control system that guide and monitor the organization destiny they construct structure appropriately for the tasks undertaken and they motivate their subordinate to complete these tasks”. </p> <p>International encyclopedia of social defined leader as somebody who rapidly perceive to perform the act of leadership. Traditionally the term leader applied to power status and disparity. Stodgill defined a leader as person who occupies a high level of responsibilities. </p> <p>Manager (1996) defined manager could be defined as person who make things happen through the efforts of other people because without the use of people, there are not means of achieving the objective or goals of an organization. A manager is a person who own business or employed by the entrepreneur to manage the business on behalf of broader perspective. A manager therefore, is persons who carry out the following process (planning, organizing, staffing leading and controlling) and they study management in order to improve the management skills. At this stage of growth, there must be men women whose job is to plan, organize, and control the works of the others. The above mentioned types are a concise function of a manager and the role he/she is expected to perform in any institution or organization. </p> <p>A leader who works hard will have followers that will learn to emulate him. Gorman think as their leaders think and men known unerring how their leaders think. </p> <p>Because of importance of leadership to all kind of group action there is a considerable volume of theories and research concerning it difficult to summarize such a large body of research in a form of relevant today management? However, in the succeeding page we shall identify several major types of leadership theory and outline some basic kind of leadership styles. </p> <p>It is no wonder that when Stogdill completed his survey of leadership theory and research in 1974, he found it necessary to abstract and analyzed over zoo books and articles in the field. </p> <p>These theories include the following: </p> <p>                               i.            <strong><em>The Trait/Great Man Theory:</em></strong> The earliest studies of leadership were based largely on an attempt to identifying the traits that leader actually possessed stating with the “Great Man” theory that leader are born and not made, to belief dating back to the ancient Greek Romans inquires where made to identify the physical mental and personality trait of various leaders. The Great Man theory lost much of its acceptability with rise in influence of the behaviorist school of psychology, which emphasis that people are not born with traits over them inherited physical characteristic and perhaps tendency toward good health. In general, the study of leader traits has not been a very faithful approach to explaining leadership. Not all the leader possesses most or all of them, also, the trait a person should have furthermore, and out of dozens of studies, there is no uniformity of identified traits or any significant correction of traits with actual instance of leadership. </p> <p>As psychologist Engene E. Yennings has said “research has provide such a variegated list of traits presumable to describe leadership that for all practical purpose it describe nothing” Stogdill found from a review of the literature that “there was a definite correction between the traits of intelligence, scholarship, dependability, responsibility, social participation and socio-economic status of leadership compound with non-leader”</p> <p>Ghisell (1967) found significant correction between leadership effectiveness and the traits of intelligence supervisory ability, initiative, self-assurance and individuality in the way work done.   </p> <p>                            ii.            <strong><em>Fielder’s Contingency Theory: </em></strong>Fielder’s theory implies that leadership is any process in which the ability of a leader to exercise influence depends upon the group task situation and degree to which the leaders’ “People become leaders not only because of the attributes of their personality but because of various situational factor and interaction between the leaders and the situations”. </p> <p>                         iii.            <strong><em>The Situational Theory:</em></strong> After increasing disillusionment with great man and trait approaches to understanding leadership, intentioned turned to the study of situation and belief that leaders are the products of a given this multidimensional approach. Leadership was dictated early in the studies of Stogdill and his associates when it was discovered that in analyzing 470 Navy officers occupying forty-five (45) different position, their leadership ability was heavily affected by such situational factors as their jobs, the organizational environment in which they operated and the characteristic of people they were assigned to lead. Other studies made over the years have shown that effective leadership depends upon response to such environment factors as the history of the enterprises, the community in which the organization operate the psychological climate of the group being of led, group members, personalities and cultural influences, and time required for making decisions. </p> <p>This approach obviously has much meaning for managerial theory and practice. Therefore, it has meaning for practicing manager who makes into account of the situation it’s entirely when they design environment for performance. </p> <p><strong>2.2.1  TYPES AND QUALITIES OF LEADERSHIP </strong></p> <p>In a broad term, we can say leaders are representatives of a group of a people and of course exercise some control over the group. In social psychology, leadership is frequently treated in the analysis of small groups. In sociology, it is designed as the exercise of influences or power in social collectivities. </p> <p>According to Abenge (1995) “Leadership is that force that direct and co-ordinates organization resource toward attaining its goals and standard”. Leadership cannot take place in the vaccum, it resumes and reciprocal relationship. Weberian sociology has identified three (3) types of leadership corresponding to different forms of authority; there are:       </p> <p><em>a.      </em><em>Charismatic Leadership: </em>This rests on belief in the extra-ordinary personal style of leadership, charisma has no replacement, leaders such as Alexander the great, Hill Car Barca, Hannibal, Napoleon, Bolivar, Macco, Lenin, Gandhi, Mao Nrunah, Lumumba and Murtala Mohammed had personal style of leadership separate from whatever office they occupied, charismatic, also refer to the claim or leadership by which people claim or are believed to posses rare style refer to the possession of some divine appeal and approval. People fear, respect and honor leader that posses the wise style as their believe to have some outstanding impersonality and appeal. </p> <p><em>b.     </em><em>Traditional Leadership:</em> Traditional legitimizes power by endowing certain statutes, offices and person with mystical, divine or secular authority.  </p> <p><em>c.      </em><em>Rational Leadership:</em> This rests on the “Belief in the validity of legal status and function” “Competence” based on rationally created rules; “Here belief no longer rests on tradition or personality but on reason”.  </p> <p>Katz and  Kalu (1966) maintain that “the term leadership has three major meanings, and a category position and who behaves in certain ways”. The influence of a leader in power and the degree and extend of his power depends on his prestige i.e. the degree to which is actions are regarded as significant relevant and important by others. In other hand, rational legal this is the types of leadership which derives from and the constitution. It comes from the position holds as set out the constitution of the society. Examples of these types of position of leadership in Nigeria are the president and the state governor, this is the usual type to be found in work organization; there is no automatic succession. </p> <p><em>d. Autocratic Leadership: </em>Autocratic leader centralize power and decision making in him and exercise complete control over the subordinate. He holds over the head of his subordinate, the threat of penalties and punishment. He sets the group goals and structure the work. He runs his own show the leader give orders and subordinate are to follow them ungrudgingly and unquestioned. The problem with this is that subordinates are aware of what to do but not why, it may be satisfying for the leader to dictate terms to other continuously but for subordinates, this may be totally frustrating. He breathes so closely down the necks of his subordinates that he makes effective action impossible. Subordinates are compelled to follow the leader’s direction to the later even though they may be wrong. Latter when errors creep in, subordinate will avoid responsibility since they were merely obeying. In autocratic situation, frustration, low moral and conflict develop easily. Subordinates are induced to avoid responsibility. Initiative and innovative behavior. </p> <p>Moreover, autocratic leadership is good when leader is; if the leader is weak and incompetent, the followers will be weak and incompetent.</p> <p>Autocratic style permits quick decision making and hence can be applied with success, situating where:</p> <p><em>                                           i.            </em>The subordinates lack knowledge of company goals </p>\n\nAN EXAMINATION OF LEADERSHIP STYLES AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN THE ORGANIZATION PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN EXAMINATION OF LEADERSHIP STYLES AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN THE ORGANIZATION PERFORMANCE", "id": 127}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The study was a stylistic analysis of the syntactic features and cohesive devices in the columnists‟ use of language in Nigerian Newspapers. The corpus for the study consisted of five texts selected from different Nigerian Newspapers. The result of the study revealed that dependent clauses are prevalent which serve as extension of the ideas in the independent clauses. There also abound simple sentences which are used by the writers to achieve logical and step by step presentation of ideas. The reader finds them easy to understand since they convey only single idea. Complex sentences were as well noted as common syntactic features in the columnists‟ use of language. Through the use of complex sentences, columnists supply additional information to what obtains in the main clause either by serving subordinate clause before the main clause or after it. Similarly, compound sentences were employed by the columnists as a means of conveying more than a single idea in a stretch of language. Coordinating conjunctions therefore were used as joining or linking devices. The analysis of the cohesive device showed that substitution and reference cohesions were the predominant cohesive devices used. Both the cataphoric and anaphoric references were predominant. The columnists based on the outcome of the study used intermixed styles to convey their message to the audience. Keywords: Stylistics, Syntax, Cohesion, Columnist and language.</p> <p>INTRODUCTION The languages used by journalists enable them to create and maintain relationship with the target audience or readers. In doing this, journalists perceive the world correctly through the power of language. The creation of relationship between them and the audience is done through the language that the reader can understand. It is usually through the language of journalism that communities get their information (Rhetorica, 2010). The language of the print media by extension the language of journalism is not the same with the language of medicine, law, engineering etc. It has a different language usage entirely because journalists use their own kind of register that is only peculiar to the media profession. Crystal and Davy (1969) explain that journalese language is an important aspect of journalism, because it tends to be explicit and precise devoid of jargons. As a rule, journalists do not use long sentences while a short one will serve.</p> <p>However, every newspaper has its own style. The different styles adopted by the different newspaper houses means the form of the language adopted to meet their target audience. The basic quality of the Language of Journalism is clarity, and its most desired effect is for the language to be understood. This language serves as a watching to the reader because it is the language used that determines what the reader can get from the story.</p> <p>The simplicity of thelanguage of journalism makes the reader to have confidence in the kind of print media he choose to read, because the reader believes that what is being reported is the truth. Journalists in their use of language make use of terms that are understood among them. It is the peculiarities of the language used that sets apart the field from others. For instance, words and phrases like „watching‟ „man, 25, drowns in well‟ „As INEC‟s deadline clicks; this does not really connote the real interpretation that an individual outside the profession can easily understand. The language of the media is used in such a way that the language is used to erase the barriers between the producers of the news and the consumers thereby fostering a good relationship between them. Statement of the Problem Newspaper writing derives its meaning from the word “News” and the word news refers to a story that has never been seen or heard. Before the invention of newspaper, official government bulletins and edicts were circulated at times in some centralized empires. In ancient Rome, government announcement bulletins were made public by Julius Caesar. They were carved on metal or stone and posted in public places (Wikipedia, 2011). Commonly, newspaper the world over is a useful tool for promoting literate communities, because of its invaluable functions of informing, educating and entertaining. According to Cheyney (1992), Newspaper is the textbook that provides up to date information on local, state/provincial national and world affairs; the most current analysis and criticism on executive and legislative decision-making; the latest in music, theatre, television and even columns and comics to make people laugh. Newspapers are among the most accessible texts available to the vast majority of people – literate, illiterate, young and old, students, workers, elites and peasants in any community. This is because every category of reader mentioned above can find something they care about inside the newspaper‟s pages. Academic American Encydopedia (1989) describes newspaper in a broad sense as an unbound publication issued at regular intervals that seeks to inform, analyze, influence and entertain. Hynds (1975) provides nine criteria for classifying newspaper. Some of these are frequency of publication that is a newspaper can be published at various intervals but usually appears weekly or daily; time of publication, purpose, circulation, geography, method of production and intended audience, etc. The universal format of a newspaper according to Babalola (2002) presents information in a predictable way. In a straight news story, the headlines give the reader the main idea of the story, the lead paragraph gives a summary of the story, answering the important newspaper questions – who, what, when, where, why and how the remainder of the news story provides additional details and the least important information at the end of the story. Language use in Newspaper reporting and indeed in reporting issues by respective columnists in newspapers, like any other form of language use for mass communication and public orientation, should take cognizance of rules that govern the use of the language. This is referred to as syntactic rules. The rules of syntax of any language regulate the way the language is used to provide common understanding and acceptable utterances and constructions. Therefore, meaning of a written or spoken discourse resides in the way and manner the writer or the speaker observes the rules of syntax of that language.</p> <p>As users of English language as a second language, the columnists of Nigerian Newspapers, and indeed other article contributors, are faced with dilemma of selecting the theme on which to write and the choice of how to put it in a way that an average user of English language in Nigeria could understand the message the written discourse is conveying. Reconciling these two important ingredients of writing by the columnists and indeed most users of English language becomes a problem that Liu (2000) says it plagues many English users as second language (ESL). This according to Malgwi is manifested in ESL writing as incoherent ideas, misuse or insufficient use of functional connectives and deficiency in content lexical ties. These features of ESL writing were earlier described by Oluwadiya (1990) as cited by Malgwi (2007) that learners and indeed users of English language in Nigeria write they way they speak and the resultant effect is the production of text that are full of colloquialism, awkward sentences, careless punctuation, mechanical errors, wrong word formation, poor use of homonyms and homophones, use of super flux adjectives, adverbs and prepositions, inability to use grammatical rules of agreement and concord and so on. Both people with good language proficiencies and learners of English language in Nigeria write and read articles in newspapers. The models of writing learners read in these papers may contribute significantly in shaping and reshaping the language abilities and skills of such learners and indeed all other readers. Therefore, the style of language use in newspapers need to be evaluated and analyzed to help both writer and readers to understand the ways it is used by the various papers. This provides the need for a study to be carried out on a syntactic analysis of the language use by columnist in Nigerian Newspapers in order to find out how the columnists use the language. Aim and Objectives of the Study The aim of the study was to analyze the syntactic features of the use of language by columnists in Nigerian Newspapers. In order to achieve the aim, the following objectives were drawn:</p> <p>1. To examine the prevalent syntactic features used by the columnists in their articles.</p> <p>2. To identify and analyze the phrases and clauses used by the columnists in treating the theme of their discourses to the readers.</p> <p>3. To identify the sentence types used by the columnists with the view to discuss the nature of the sentences and how they help in relating what they have for the readers.</p> <p>4. To identify and analyze the cohesive devices that the columnists use to make their ideas coherent.</p> <p>Research Questions The following research questions were formulated to guide the study:</p> <p>1. What is the syntactic features use by the columnists to address their audience?</p> <p>2. What are the phrases and clauses used by the columnists in treating the theme of their discourses to the readers?</p> <p>3. What are the sentence patterns and structures that help the columnists in relating what they have for the readership?</p> <p>4. What are the cohesive devices the columnists use in the articulating their subject matter of the columns?</p> <p>METHODOLOGY</p> <p>This study was basically on the language of newspaper columnists in some selected Nigerian newspapers. It was therefore, a corpus based study that analyses the language used by the columnists to assess how they present their contributions. Descriptive and discursive approach was adopted in this study. Being a corpus based analysis, the selected texts were presented, analyzed and the identified syntactic features and cohesive devices were discussed. It was paramount to adopt the descriptive study because it exposes linguistic features as used in it is natural context. The corpus on which this study was based consisted of selected columns from five selected Nigerian newspapers which included: The Daily Trust, New Nigeria, The Nation, The Punch and the Leadership Newspapers. Two columns were selected from each of the five newspapers based on systematic sampling which made up ten texts. As there were numerous newspapers, the selection of the corpus was carried out using convenient sampling technique. The convenient sampling refers to the ease by which the texts are obtained. It is the availability of the newspapers to the researcher that determine their selection. There are different approaches to the stylistic analysis of texts but for the purpose of this study Leech and Short‟s (1985) approach would be adopted for the analyses. The method is based on linguistic checklist that focuses on the analysis of literary texts which can as well be applicable to nonliterary texts. The checklist consists of four (4) categories as follows: lexical category, grammatical category, figures of speech and context and cohesion. The Leech and Short (1985) approach is adopted because it provides the detail levels of analysis. Crystal and Davy‟s (1969) linguistic levels of analysis which encourages focusing on graphetic and graphology, phonetics and phonology vocabulary and Grammar or syntax was adopted. The descriptive method used was therefore eclectic. These approaches helped to look at language the use; the variations, how the columnists generally select language etc.</p> <p>FINDINGS AND DISCUSSIONS</p> <p>In this section, the texts in the corpus were analyzed and discussed under the following headings: Syntactic Features The study of how words are combined together to form phrases and sentences is referred to as syntax. Radford (1997) opines that syntax studies the level of language that lies between words and the meaning of utterance; that is, sentence structures. It is the level that mediates between sounds that someone produces and organizes into words and what they intend to say. The following are the syntactic features identified and discussed. Use of Phrases A phrase is usually a group of words that denote a single idea and form a separate part of a sentence, but not containing a subject and predicate. It is a string of words that form a grammatical unit, usually within a clause or sentence, Ewuzie (2009). They are used by the columnists to achieved different purposes in communication contexts. The text from leadership newspaper of Friday July 15, 2011 contains prepositional phrases used possibly to draw the attention of the reader on distance and time in history.</p> <p>While in the federal Government College, Enugu, in the early 70s, my primary mode of transportation from Kaduna rail to Enugu was the train. The rail track that runs from Kaduna – Kafanchan – Makurdi –Enugu to Port Harcourt was very active. Trains were on time, and reserved coaches for young students from all over the country were common place. In the text, phrases are stylistically used by the writer, possibly to colour the story and catching the attention of the reader in order to develop a curiosity that will make him see to the end of the story. The prepositional Phrases in the above texts depicting distance and time include: „in the federal government college; „from Kaduna to Enugu; „in the early 70s; on time:The writer did not bring out clearly what he wants to say but these phrases depict specific distance at a point in time that the writer covered by rail transportation. Furthermore, special use of phrases it can also be seen in an article in the New Nigeria of Monday July 4, 2011, how phrases are used as a style of the writer “ I carried a small basket, in front of me, wheeling a shopping trolley was a senator from….In front of us, was the women sanitary ware tray, he parked different type of pads as they are so called.” The prepositional phrases “in front of me” and “in front of us” are as a matter of importance show a physical relationship between one and another. “in front of me” for instance shows a relationship between the person who carried the basket, the narrator and the person wheeling a trolley, a distinguished Nigerian Senator. This relation is unusual in Nigerian context. The phrases „in front of me‟ and „in front of us‟ are used in the text to indicate the proximity of the writer to the scene of the incidence that he got his story from. These indicate that the writer was really present at the place of the incidence he was narrating. Use of Clauses Clauses according to Oluikpe (2002) are group of words which contains a subject, a verb, a modifier and occasionally an object. It is classified into an independent and a dependent clause. The independent clause sometimes called a principal or main clause is actually a simple sentence, a complete sentence. The dependent or subordinate clause on the other hand, is joined by a conjunction to a principal clause. It depends on the principal clause in order to fully communicate. The following text is studied to analyze this concept. I learnt they were disappointed that he was a turncoat. How could anyone be disappointed at El-Rufai? A man who is capable of any emotion is capable of any betrayal. So he was once in government. Does that mean he should not take on government? What makes the government sacrosanct? We want more people in government who will lash out at government and unveil its seedy underside.At one time; El-Rufai was the good guy of the security forces. He was the one with whom the Owu chief was pleased, the one who knew who was safe for Nigeria and who should go to jail. He was the quite essential patriot, and he condemned others for lack of favour for Nigeria. (THE NATION, JULY 11, 2011)</p> <p>The dependent and independent clauses are commonly used. The following dependent clauses were identified from the text: „that he was a turncoat,” „who will lash out at Government,” “that the time had not come,” „who is capable of any emotion” „whom the Owu Chief was please,‟ etc. None of these give any clear interpretation. The independent clauses were also observed in the text, some of them are; „I learnt they were disappointed,‟ „we want more people in government.‟etc. These clauses that are independent in nature do not need any support to bring out their meaning. They are just simple sentences. Furthermore,similar style on the use of clause is found in the Daily Trust of Tuesday January 25, 2011. The following clauses were identified in the title of the text „So Kwankwaso thought he could go scot-free? His supporters surprised me when they pretended to be shocked that they lost.” The above is a combination of both independent and dependent clauses. “His supporters surprised me” is an independent clause whose meaning is complete, while „when they pretended to be shocked that they lost‟ did not provide a clear interpretation. Simple Sentences A simple sentence has one clause beginning with a noun group called the subject, one finite verb, which may be followed by a noun group or an adjective or a noun group and an adverb called the predicate, Ewuzie (2009). These kinds of sentences are stylistically used by writers, because it is often short and straight to the point. They are simply recognized by the number of verbs they contain and not by length. The simple sentence expresses an assertion, a question, a command, a wish or an exclamation that usually begins with a capital letter and ends with a full stop, a question mark or an exclamation mark. Examples of which include “It‟s all about El-Rufai‟s interest even if it masquerades as a national pride. He is one of our enduring peacocks. He is also a chameleon of interest. (THE NATION, Monday July 11, 2011)” The columnist in his approach to reach out to the readers uses sentences that are simple in nature. Sentence like „He is one of our enduring peacocks‟: His is also a chameleon of interest,‟ are simple sentences used by the writer. These sentences are clear and easy to comprehend by the reader, because they are direct and contained just a noun representative as subjects and auxiliary verb as predicate. In the New Nigerian of Monday July 14, 2011, the use if simple sentence is also found as follows “I love Nigeria. Things change and remain the same all at the same time. He interjected. “I did not know, I actually thought…, he muted in my language and we both laughed.” To create emotion and curiosity about the text, the columnist uses simple sentences like „I love Nigeria.‟ „He interjected‟. Complex Sentence A complex sentence is one that has a main clause and one or more subordinate clauses. The main clause normally contains the most important information on which the subordinate clause or clauses depend. The subordinate clause may come at the beginning or end of the sentence (Sharndama 2008). The use of complex sentences is found in a text such as: Now it is senator Bello HayatuGwarzo who is signing a protest on behalf of his colleagues insisting that it was wrong for the national working committee of their party to cancel the results, and order a re-run of the gubernatorial primaries in Kano State. (Daily Trust, Jan 25, 2011) Apart from the main clause that came at the beginning i.e. „It is senator Bello HayatuGwarzo‟, the supporting information that contain a relative pronoun „who is signing….‟ a that clause, „that it was wrong….‟ and a conjunction and, „and order a re-run…‟,provide additional information to the main clause. Furthermore, it can also be seen in another text how complex sentence is used as follows:</p> <p>He does not respond to attacks or abuse on his person, despite the fact that he has in abundance, the brash and dare-devil underlings who are free to return the attack and abuse with all the rudeness and venom they can muster. (New Nigerian July 4, 2011) In the sentence above, which is complex in nature, „that he has in abundance, the brash and dare-devil underlings‟, „who are free to return the attack and abuse‟, are subordinate clauses in the sentence, which depend on the main clause and expand its meaning; „He does not respond to attacks or abuse on his person‟,to be meaningful. The complex sentences are also identified in another text as can be seen in the following “The rail track that runs from Kaduna- Kafanchan-Makurdi-Enugu to Port Harcourt was very active (Leadership July 15, 2011)” It is very easy to say that „that rail track was very active‟ is having a complete sense that can be referred to as a simple sentence which is the same as the main clause. But the subordinate clause „that runs from Kaduna – Kafanchan – Makurdi – Enugu to Port Harcourt‟, cannot provide a clear interpretation of the sentence alone. From the above, it is observed that columnists use complex sentences, because it is the most important and effective types of sentence structures in the English Language that reduce the monotony of using „and‟ or „but‟. Use of compound sentence Oluikpe (2002) explains that a compound sentence is one in which two or more simple sentences are coordinated, each independent of the other and joined with the conjunction and, but, or etc. Sentences of this nature are identified in the texts under study as can be seen in the following “ I got there and started greeting people from all over Nigeria who were able to make it that early morning to Zaria with short condolences and moving from one person to another without seeming end. (Leadership Friday July 15, 2011”) In the text under study, sentences of this nature are identified. For example in; „I got there and started greeting people ……….who were able to make it that early morning to Zaria with short condolences and moving from one person to another….‟ It can be analysed that each segment of the compound sentence can stand alone as a grammatical structure of its own, for instance; „I got there‟, „I started greeting people‟, „I move from one person to another‟. However, what is significant is that the use of the conjunctions provides a link to make the segments in one inclusive sentence that provide a straight forward message. The following sentences are also observed in other texts: Trains were on time, and reserved coaches for young students from all over the country were commonplace. (Leadership: July 15, 2011) He shoots but he does not always hit the target. (The NATION: July 11, 2011) We agree that for example that Akwa-Ibom gets more than Plateau, Nasarawa and Bauchi put together, but the governors of the same state would buy same luxury SUVs, and strangely the one from Bauchi would have more aides, more cars, go on more foreign trips for investments that never come and we allude to sanity when we are at best delusional. (New Nigeria: July 4, 2011)</p> <p>The excerpt above shows the functions of „and‟ and „but‟ as coordinating conjunctions. “And” is an additive conjunction that joins one sentence to another. It provides moreinformation, surprising or unexpected information, or a general or specific statement about the precious sentence. In the texts portions above, all those characteristics of the andgroup are reflected. ‘But’ as a conjunction is used in sentences to suggest contrast, concession, reservation etc. In this compound sentence: ‘He shoots but he does not always hit the target’, it can be analysed that the ‘but’ is a concession word that highlighted that although he attacks, and he does not make much impact. It is also used to contrast the revenue of AkwaIbom with that of Plateau, Nasarawa and Bauchi as well as their spending. Cohesion Cohesion means the connection of ideas at the sentence level which makes ideas coherent.It refers to relations of meaning that exist within the text, and that define it as a text. There are two types: Grammatical and Lexical cohesion. Halliday and Hasan (1976) opine that cohesion expresses the continuity that exists between one part of a text and another. Cohesion is one of the internal cues that speakers/writers use to create desired meanings. It refers to the ties and connections that exist within a text (Yule 2006). Cohesions are commonly considered and described in terms of specific syntactic units. They are seen as a property of syntactic units which are not interpreted by elements that do not belong to them. Words are generally cohesive, that is they are not interpreted by other words or elements that belong to other words (Matthews 2007). This implies that there are ties or connections which exist in the texts that aid the understanding of the meaning of the text. In most of the texts under study there are some lexical items that are used as cohesive devices. Analysis of the texts in the corpus has shown that reference is prevalent. Reference cohesion shows the relations which holds between an element of text and something else by reference to which it is interpreted in the text. The text below contains examples. His supporters surprised me when they pretended to be shocked that they lost……. As a former insider he knew there never was any genuine intra-party democracy in there. Now it is senator Bello HayatuGwarzo who is signing a protest on behalf of his colleagues insisting that it was wrong for the national working committee…… According to them no reason was given for the re-run. (Daily Trust, January 25, 2011). </p> <p>CONCLUSION Based on the outcome of this study, it can be deduced that the vocabulary used by the columnists are simple everyday words, though abstract and concrete nouns are common, it is not difficult to uncover meanings. Complex and compound sentences were found common which enable the columnists to lump up ideas in a single stretch. However, immature readers may find it difficult to explicate the lump information. Rhetorical devices are commonly used to show linguistic expertise and to colour the stories in order to dress the content of their texts and encourage search for meanings. Looking at the analysis corpus used in the study, it would also be concluded that syntactic devices such as reference cohesion, phrases, clauses, compound and complex sentences characterize the write of the columnists.

Thenature of code-switching in the films, as well as reasons for code-switching are all examined.It is noted that code-switching in Kanywood films is mostly influenced by characters’emotional situation (love or sadness). Only in few cases the characters use the phenomenonto share an identity with a member of their group. The paper also argues that code-switching in Kanywood films is a conscious behavior as opposed to unconscious one in spontaneousconversation.</em></p> <p><strong>1.1 Introduction</strong></p> <p>According to Yusuf (2014:2), Kanywood is the name for the Hausa film industry based in Kano. Due to the cosmopolitan nature of Kano and the fact that most of the production is placed there, in 1999 a journalist working with a Hausa newspaper called Tauraruwa coined a name <em>Kanywood</em> for the industry. Yusuf goes ahead to state that the first commercial Hausa film <em>Turmin Danya</em> (1990, directed by Daudu Galadanci) was produced by Tumbin Giwa Production, Kano. After the successful marketing of the film many people became engaged in film production. Currently it is estimated that over 2000 companies are registered with Kano State Film Makers Association apart from others across Northern Nigeria and Nigeria at large. The language of communication in the film is Hausa. However as a result of contact between the Hausa with the British in 1903 and the use of English as Nigeria’s official language and language of instruction at schools, some of the film actors are bilingual which is reflected in their conversations in films and this has brought about the issue of bilingualism or code-switching in Northern Nigerian films. </p> <p>Code-switching is broadly studied in linguistics and related fields. Amin (2011:4) notes that linguistic research on code-switching usually focuses on grammatical perspective and sociological point of view. A grammatical approach focuses on the structural aspects of code switching which determine the syntactic or morpho-syntactic constraints on language alternation (e.g. Poplack 2000; Sankoff and Poplack 1981; Joshi1985; Belazi et al. 1994; and Halmari 1997). A sociolinguistic approach is concerned with the role of social factors in the occurrence of code switching, such as context and speakers’ role relationships. (see Bloom and Gumperz’s 1972; Gumperz 1974; 1982; Myers-Scotton 1993; Rampton 1995; Benson 2000; Milroy &amp; Muyasken 2005 and Danyaro 2011).   Sociolinguists define code-switching as “the use of more than one language in the course of a single communicative episode” (Heller 1988:1). Grosjean (1982:147) mentions that “Code-switching is the alternation in the use of two languages (or even more) in the same discourse. The switch can happen within words, clauses, or sentences. However, there is only a switch in the language, not an integration of the word, clause or sentence into the other language.” Gumperz (1982:59) defines it “as the juxtaposition within the same speech exchange of passages of speech belonging to two different grammatical systems or subsystems”.    </p> <p>Sociolinguists define code-switching as “the use of more than one language in the course of asingle communicative episode” Heller’s (1988:1). Grosjean (1982:147) mentions that “Code-switching is the alternation in the use of two languages (or even more) in the same discourse. The switch can happen within words, clauses, or sentences. However, there is only a switch in the language, not an integration of the word, clause or sentence into the other language.” Also Auer &amp; Myers-Scotton, who largely disagree on how or why code switching occurs, nonetheless sound quite similar in their definitions of the phenomenon. Auer (1984:1) refers to code-switching as “the alternating use of more than one language,” while Myers-Scotton (1993: vii) mentions that it is “the use of two or more languages in the same conversation.” Then Gumperz (1982:59) defines it “as the juxtaposition within the same speech exchange of passages of speech belonging to two different grammatical systems or subsystems”.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Reasons for Code-Switching</strong></p> <p>There are several reasons for Code-Switching. Bilingual speakers switch from one language variety to another for many communicative purposes. But what is important is a close observation of behaviour in particular settings than to generally applicable explanations of linguistic capability. As Gumperz (1982) emphasizes, close analysis of brief spoken exchanges is necessary to identify and describe the function of code-switching. Also Bollinger (1975:257) points out that code-switching may be carried out so as to clear any obstacle that may arise in the course of communication. He further claims that switching is carried out sometimes by a speaker whose deliberate intention is to deceive, disguise or brag to the hearer. In addition, Karen (2003) listed a few possible conditions for code switching as follows:  -Lack of one word in either language -Some activities have only been experienced in one of the languages -Some concepts are easier to express in one of the languages -A misunderstanding has to be clarified -One wishes to create a certain communication effect -One continues to speak the language latest used because of the trigger effect -One wants to make a point -One wishes to express group solidarity -One wishes to exclude another person from the dialogue.  Similarly, Malik (1994) accounts ten reasons for code-switching   Lack of Facility, Lack of Register, Mood of the Speaker, To emphasize a point, Habitual Experience, Semantic significance, To show identity with a group, To address a different audience, Pragmatic reasons, To attract attention, etc. This aspect discusses code-switching in contemporary Hausa films as an aspect of Northern Nigerian literature and analyzes characters’ dialogues which show how the phenomenon is manifested. The technique of contextual analysis was employed for interpretation of the data with reference to the situation and hero’s status. The nature of code-switching in the films, as well as reasons for code-switching, are all examined.  </p> <p><strong>1.3 Methodology</strong></p> <p>The data used here was collected from three Kanywood films namely: <em>Khaleesat 1</em> (2011, directed by Alkali Kamal), <em>Wasila 1</em> (2010, directed by Nuhu Ali) and <em>Mata da Miji</em> (directed by Saira Aminu). The films differ in terms of directors, production companies, years of production and places of production.  <em>Khaleesat 1</em> tells a story of a couple Ibrahim and Khaleesat. The title is the name of the main female character Khaleesat. Khaleesat is a successful banker and Ibrahim is a school teacher. They live a happy life of mutual understanding, trust and respect. The situation changes when Ibrahim receives some text messages from a stranger that he should be careful about his wife’s activities in the bank and watch her coming home late due to the nature of her work. That leads Ibrahim to suspicious behaviour towards his wife. The audience knows however that the man who sends the text messages to Ibrahim wanted to have affairs with Khaleesat and promises her to open a bank account and deposit a huge amount of money in the bank if she agrees to his proposal, but she rejects it. The suspicion between Ibrahim and Khaleesat leads to their separation.                                                                                                                                 <em>Wasila 1</em> is a love story about Jamilu a banker and his educated wife Wasila. The film shows that Jamilu has not enough time to stay at home with his wife due to his work. As a result, one day, the wife invited her former boyfriend Muda to their house after the husband left for the office. When Jamilu gets to the office his manager asks him for a file that he had given him to keep. Jamilu left the file at home. So, he returns to take it. When he reaches the house he sees his wife with her former boyfriend in the bedroom, which causes the end of their relationship.   </p> <p><em>Mata da Miji</em> describes a story of working class couple, Abdurra’uf a medical doctor and Maijidda a banker. The film shows that the couple is not able to take care of their son Sudais due to their work. They decide to hire a nanny called Rukayya. Sudais and Rukayya become so intimate like a son and a mother. As a result, the son refuses to get back to his parents, which annoys the father. Abdurra’uf suggests to his wife that one of them should give up work in order to take care of their son. The wife refuses to stop working, so he is forced to give up his job to take care of the boy. His resignation does not solve the problem due to the close relation between the son and his nanny. Then the father decides to marry the nanny but his wife opposes the plans. But Dr. Abdurra’uf was able to marry the nanny with all oppositions from the wife. After the marriage, the father finally gets his son’s attention and Maijidda is left with guilt and remorse.        </p> <p><strong>1.4 Data Presentation </strong></p> <p>The data presented here are samples of Hausa-English utterances from the randomly sampled films. English is written in plain, while Hausa is italicized. Each utterance is numbered for easy reference in the discussion.  The samples are presented as follows:</p> <p>(1). Thank you sir. <em>Sai an jima</em>. Khaleesat-manager Thank you sir. See you next time (2). Aliyu <em>kar ka manta ni matar aure ce, idan ka manta na tuna maka.</em> Leave my office now. Khaleesat-Aliyu Aliyu do not forget that I’m married if you forget let me remind you. Leave my office now (3). You are very stupid.  <em>Kinyaudare ni</em> Ibrahim-Khaleesat You are very stupid.  You have deceived me. (4). Please wait! <em>Duk wadanda suke taimakona babu kamar ki</em>. Manager-Khaleesat Please wait! Among all my assistance there is no one like you (5). Okay <em>zan tafi ofis</em>. Khaleesat-Ibrahim Okay I will leave to office (6). <em>Wasila yi hakuri</em>! I love you. Jamilu-Wasila Wasila be patient! I love you (7). <em>To ai ya kamata ka dauki </em>casual leave. Wasila-Jamilu You suppose to take a casual leave (8). <em>Na ji maganarku amma ina so naga </em>Jamilu. I just missed him. Wasila-Friends   I heard your views but I need to see Jamilu. I just missed him (9). <em>Gaskiya ne</em> corruption is a cancer to us. Jamilu-Manager You are right corruption is a cancer to us.  (10). This is an expensive joke. <em>Gaskiya kar ku sake yi mini wannan</em>. Jamilu-Saliha  This is an expensive joke. Please do not do it again. (11). Look sweet heart <em>a bar wannan maganar</em>. Jamilu-Wasila Look sweet heart let leave this issue (12). Look! <em>Kar ki tsai da ni sai na dawo</em>. Jamilu-Wasila   Look! Do not delay me, see you later (13). <em>Bari na je ayi mana</em> take away. You spoiled my mood today. Let me go an have a take away for us. You spoiled my mood today. Jamilu-Wasila (14). <em>Na kirawo ka ne don na gaya maka</em> I’m now free. Wasila-Moda I just called to inform you that I’m free now (15). Haba Abdul! <em>Yaron nan </em>is just a small boy. Maijidda-Abdurra’uf  Oh Abdul! This boy is just a small boy (16). <em>Za ki iya kashe</em> T.V? I want discuss an important issue with you. Abdurra’uf- Maijidda  Can you switch off the T.V? I want discuss an important issue with you. (17). I’m sorry. <em>Gaskiya ni ba zan iya aji ye aikina ba</em>. Maijidda-Abdurra’uf I’m sorry. To be sincere I can not resign from my job.  (18). Okay. <em>Ni zan aji ye nawa aikin</em>. Abdurra’uf- Maijidda  Okay. I will resign from my job. (19). Shakuwar <em>yaron nan da matar nan</em> is too much. Maijidda-Abdurra’uf  The intimacy between this boy and his nanny is too much. (20). <em>Sai dai ki ce ba ta da aiki</em> but she is educated enough. Abdurra’uf- Maijidda  You can only say that she is jobless but she is well educated. </p> <p><strong>1.5 Analysis</strong>                                                                                                                                        The procedure for the analysis was based on insights from other studies. Following Gumperz (1982), situational code-switching, but different from what happens in situations described by Ferguson (1972) and others as diglossia, where two languages or varieties co-exist and are specialized according to functions. Wardhaugh (2006) describes how situational code-switching occurs:  Situational code-switching occurs when the languages used change according to the situations in which the conversant find themselves: they speak one language in one situation and another in a different one. No topic change is involved. Instances of situational code-switching are usually fairly easy to classify for what they are. What we observe is that one variety is used in a certain set of situations and another in an entirely different set. However, the changeover from one to the other may be instantaneous. Sometimes the situations are so socially prescribed that they can even be taught, e.g., those associated with ceremonial or religious functions (Wardhaugh 2006:104). However, code-switching in Kanywood films could be described as situational as most of the given examples were made during a certain situation. Therefore, two factors account for code-switching in the films emotional situation (love/sadness) or what Malik (2004) describes as mode of a speaker and showing of an identity which corresponds with one of the reason for code-switching described by Karen (2003), ‘one wishes to express group solidarity’. This shows that Kanywood films’ characters usually switch to English when they are in emotional state or if they want to share identity with a person or group. </p> <p>In example 1, Khaleesat switches to English to thank her manager after given her some advice on not to quit her job, after she tenders a letter of resignation to him for approval. She does so, as a result of excessive pressure from her husband and his mother due to her job conditions. It shows that her switch to English was motivated by her situation of annoyance and disorientation. Also in Example2, Khaleesat switches to English when she was angry to remind her co-worker Aliyu that she is married, when he tells her that she is close to the manager.  Example3 shows that Khaleesat’s husband, Ibrahim speaks English to her when she comes home late from the office. The husband went to the bank and peeps through the window where he sees her discussing with the manager in the manager’s office which annoys him and causes him to suspect her of having affairs with the manager. Code-switching in examples4 was motivated by sadness because the manager informs Khaleesat that she is important to the bank after she submits a letter of resignation.  Examples 5&amp;9 could be described as sharing of identity. In example5 Khaleesat shares her identity of an educated person with her husband Ibrahim while in example 9, Jamilu switches to English to share identity with his manager of having knowledge of the English language. That is why in all the conversations with their parents, parent in-laws, and elderly people, characters do not switch to English, they use Hausa instead. As Wardhaugh (2006:110) explains that ‘Code-switching can allow a speaker to do many things: assert power; declare solidarity; maintain certain neutrality when both codes are used; express identity; and so on.  Examples 6, 7 &amp; 8 were made by Jamilu a banker and his educated wife Wasila when they were still in mutual love. The wife complains to the husband that she does not want him to leave her alone. The husband pleads with her to be patient and says he loves her. Example 14 also indicates intimate situation as Wasila tell her former boyfriend, Moda that they can continue their relationship. Similarly, example 10 is a statement made by Jamilu when he sees his wife Wasila in good condition after having been in coma. Examples 11, 12 &amp; 13 were pronounced when the characters were in dismay. In example11 &amp;13 Jamilu switched to English after being told by his wife that the person he sees talking to her while he pays the food bill was her former boyfriend, Moda. Example 14 was uttered when Wasila delays Jamilu in office. Example 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 &amp; 20 were made by Maijidda and her husband, Abdurra’uf to each other when they were in distress. Abdurra’uf wants to marry the second wife in order to get his son’s attention while Maijidda opposed the plans and felt dismayed. Code-switching in Kanywood film can be linked to an emotional situation (love/sadness) and sharing of an identity with a person or group. The use of code-switching in the films could be described as a conscious phenomenon as opposed to Wardhaugh (2006) assertions in spontaneous conversation that it is an unconscious behaviour. As a phenomenon code-witching normally appears in younger generation’s dialogue in the films. The younger generations do not switch to English when speaking to their parents or elders in the film only in some situations when they want to portray a character’s behaviour like someone who was brought up in the Western countries or stayed there for a long period of time. </p> <p>Looking at the nature of code-switching in Kanywood Films, Romanie (1994:57) divide code-switching into three types, Inter-sentential switching, intra-sentential code-switching and tag-switching.  Inter-sentential switching involves a switch at a clause or sentence level, while each clause or sentence is in one language or another. This kind of switching exists in examples 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 16 and 17 of the given data.  It should be noted that inter-sentential code-switching in Kanywood films involves the use of English clauses which form part of a statement as in examples, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 10.   </p> <p> Intra-sentential switching is characterized by a switch from one language variety to another within a single utterance, or a switch within the clause or sentence boundary. Inter-sentential code-switching appears in examples 7, 9, 11, 14, 15, 19 and 20 in the data. Tag-switching on the other hand involves the insertion of a tag in one language into an utterance which is otherwise entirely in the other language. (E.g. well, you know, okay, I mean, right, etc.) This type of code-switching manifests in examples 5, 12, and 18.  It is clear that the inserted tags function in Kanywood films as they do in English context as seen in the above examples.  </p> <p>In summary, this shows that code-switching in Kanywood films was motivated mostly by character situation in a dialogue. It has also been revealed that two functions of code-switching are noticeable in the film: to display emotional situation and to share identity with a group member. Situations and participants determine the use of code-switching in the film as the phenomenon is not shown in a dialogue between younger generations with their parents, elders or between elderly characters. The characters used Hausa in their dialogues as the language of narration, assertion and interpretation while English was used as the language of status.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Conclusions</strong></p> <p>This paper shows that code-switching in Kanywood films was motivated mostly by charactersituation in a dialogue. The paper also showed two function of code-switching in the film: todisplay emotional situation and to share identity with a group member. It also shows thatcode-switching usually appears in dialogues of a younger generation and it hardly appearswhen a young person talks to his parents or to elders. However, situation and participantsdetermine the use of the code-switching in the film as the phenomena is not shown in adialogue between younger generations with their parents, elders or between elderly characters.The characters used Hausa in their dialogues as the language of narration, assertion andinterpretation while English was used as the language of status. The frequent use ofcode-switching in the films makes it difficult for monolingual and elder audience to followthe film and to decode the characters’ dialogues.</p> <p><strong>Works Cited</strong></p> <p>Amin, B.

This present paper is a re-visitation of the Nigerian English lexicon, taking cue from the lexicographic efforts of Igboanusi (2002). We have sociolinguistically x-rayed some common usages among Nigerians in different socio-political cum cultural and metaphorical course contents. Gumperz‟s diffusionist theory was borrowed to strengthen our theoretical base. Gumperz (1968) proposes a diffusionist theory of the speech community. The theory postulates the spread of linguistic change/transfer in intersecting waves that emanate from different centres of innovation.</p> <p>Word coinage, compounding and acronyms surfaced as the characteristic features of Nigerian English coinages. The first feature refers to the process of creating words to fit particular purposes while compounding on the other end is the process whereby two or more words are brought together to form a single lexical item, hyphenated or not. Acronyms are also identified as means of deriving peculiarly Nigerian nomenclatures of certain phenomena as words derive from the initials of several words. Borrowing on its part, was identified in Nigerian English as many words evolving from cultural and religious backgrounds of Nigerians. These are referred to as loan or foreign words. These features among others are recognized as very prominent in the varieties of English being spoken in Nigeria. Nigerian English lexical forms, therefore find expression in linguistic perspectives to language change, shift, transfer and dialectology.</p> <p>Introduction</p> <p>When a word or an idiom is employed to express a meaning which it does not hitherto convey, the meaning and referent are said to have been expanded. In other words, a change in the sense of a word causes a modification in the mental content that constitutes the meaning of such lexical item. A word can be given a new meaning by an individual or by the general public At times, a coinage receives public acceptance if it is considered the most appropriate word to capture a concept among a speech community. This is because the meaning ascribed to a word by its use in particular context will take precedence over its etymological derivation. In a nutshell, what this implies is that it is the use of the words that determines the meanings of words in a sentence (Allan 1986:77-78). This paper will analyze how word derivations and coinages in Nigeria generate meaning. The words will be discussed from the perspective of factors leading to their emergence and use. First, to be discussed in this essay is the „Nigerianess‟ in English.</p> <p>Nigerian English is a term used to describe the kind of English that reflects second language incompetence of the target standard forms of English. It is a phenomenon that has been described widely along the lines of differing fields of linguistic studies. Popular, among these studies have investigated English language usage in Nigeria, from the variational, phonological, grammatical or syntactico-semantic purviews. Among all these studies, lexical nativization, acculturation, Idiagbon and Olaniyi, Coinages in English</p> <p>79</p> <p>domestication, etc. have been used to describe the kind of English being spoken as a second language in Nigeria.</p> <p>Lexical and semantic collocations in the Nigerian contexts are primary, in this paper. The contextual usages of lexical items in Nigeria have come through several processes. The most productive of these, in the words of Adegbija (2004:23) include:</p> <p>- Coinages</p> <p>- Hybridization</p> <p>- Analogization</p> <p>- Direct translation and transliteration</p> <p>- Transfer</p> <p>- Affixation</p> <p>- Accronymization, etc.</p> <p>Coinages, our focus in this paper, have been situated variously by researchers within the sociolinguistics of Nigerian English (cf. Odumuh 1987:69-126, Adegbija 2004:23) among several other references. Coinages or neologism are identified as new terms created for new experiences, especially where the speaker of the language either experiences dearth of correct standard lexical item to express himself or uses a word or an expression to satisfy the communicative purpose of his immediate environment. Such coinages are sometimes metaphorically explainable and could be a result of interference or transfer of traits from a speaker‟s first language to the target language.</p> <p>Adegbija (2004:24) refers to the sub-standard forms of English as results of „transfer from culture, sense or meaning from the native language into English, or reinterpretation or extension of an existing meaning in English to cover new areas of experience in Nigerian English. Our purpose in this study is to provide explanations to some common Nigerian English coinages observed around us in different speech contexts. The effort here is an attempt to break off from the formalist approaches to linguistics which is common among researchers. For quite a while linguists oriented toward formal analysis, showed very little interest in transfer phenomenon and the entailments of linguistic behaviour and social communication.</p> <p>Theoretical Background</p> <p>Words are sounds. They are graphics when written. They are also the essentials of a language through which speakers and writers express themselves. When we speak, we put our thoughts into words. Knowing a language entails having knowledge of the words or morphemes and sound sequence in that language. It entails a lexico-semantic knowledge of what they mean. This knowledge affords one to use the words appropriately in sentences and understand them when one hears them.</p> <p>The totality however of words in language constitutes its lexicon. Any additional information of lexical items in a language comes about as a result of one or more of the following processes mentioned earlier above: coinage, acronym, blend, abbreviations, borrowings and compounding, among others. The introduction of a new word into a language strikingly draws the attention of the speakers. It must however be noted that just as new lexical items are added into a language, the language also losses words due to lack of use.Word coinage, which is our focus in this paper refers to the process of creating words to fit particular purposes while acronyms are words derived from the initials of several words. Compounding on the other end is the process whereby two or more words are brought together to form a single lexical item, hyphenated or not. Borrowing on its part, refers to the process by which some linguistic items of one language or dialect are incorporated into another language. These are referred to as loan or foreign words. These features among others are very prominent in the varieties of English being spoken in Nigeria.</p> <p>Sociolinguistic approaches to Language Change</p> <p>The literatures in sociolinguistics that appear relevant to this study on coinages in Nigerian English are historical in nature. They find expression in linguistic perspectives to language change, shift, transfer and dialectology; all insights from Gumperz (1968). Gumperz (1968) proposed a diffusionist theory of the speech community. The theory postulates the spread of linguistic change/transfer in intersecting waves that emanate from different centres of innovation with intensity proportionate to the prestige of their human carriers.</p> <p>In contrast with the diffusionist principles is the geneticists. While geneticists regarded modern language distribution as the result of the segmentation of older entities into newer and smaller groups, duffusionists viewed the speech community as a dynamic field of action where phonetic change, borrowing, language mixture, and language shift all occur because of social forces. Our interest in this theory is its recognition of the result of two languages in contact. Gumperz (1982:223) states that “wherever, two or more speech communities maintain prolonged contact within a broad field of communication, there are cross-currents of diffusion. The contact between English language and the over four hundred Nigerian indigenous languages (see Bendor Samuel, et al 1994; Adegbija 2004:40-45; Gut and Milde 2002; Grimes 1996; Bamgbose 1971 among others) has necessitated lexico-semantic shifts and changes in the standard forms of English. These changes are prominently observed in forms of transfer – linguistically, culturally, metaphorically and socially.</p> <p>Cultural Interference and Social Meaning</p> <p>The Sapir-Whorfian hypothesis is recognized in sociolinguistics because of its affirmation of the cultural content of language and his view of culture as the means by which members of the society express their thoughts and ideas to one another. They add that the anthropological view that basic differences exist in the thought process of individuals give rise to a diversity of patterns of a body of knowledge for each society. Taking a cue from a recent work as that of Cameron (1997:60), linguistic behaviours of humans are explainable in terms of the existence of social meaning. For instance, an expression such as “we need a very long leg to get a good job” requires the understanding of the Nigerian worldview and the socio-cultural background of the interlocutors before any meaning can be made out of the statement by a non-Nigerian. To a Nigerian, the statement would make meaning because of the existence of a similar experience in the Nigerian indigenous languages, where ese (leg) is required for certain privileges and influences. Thus, the transfer of such mother tongue experience into English informs the use of „long leg‟ in the statement above. Individual culture is observable in the linguistic behaviour of a people.</p> <p>Hymes (1997:12) demonstrates his preoccupation with social meaning via cultural content of language when he submits that “there is more to the relationship between sound and meaning than is dreamt of in moral linguistic theory”. He adds that “in meaning, there is social as well as referential import‟. In the words of Babatunde (2006:150), Hymes (1997) affirms that in between the social and referential layers of meaning, there are other relationships which, though present in social life, are not evident in ordinary grammar. Hymes‟ concern for social meanings as contained in linguistic materials is relevant in this study. He sees means of speech as inseparable from the meanings made of it by the users of the language. The imports from the discussion above is that varieties of English as a second language should rather be appreciated from the socio-cultural perspective than from the linguistic codes.</p> <p>The implication of the absence of a direct relationship between language and culture and social meaning is felt more in the educational system of the society. The assertion that „when the language employed in the education of a people does not reflect their culture, the recipients of such an education are bound to be limited in educational success (Croghan 2000:76-79). This assertion is based on the premise that African languages exert unavoidable influences on English and without an attempt to understand these influences, „the evolution of languages in the New World cannot be clearly explained or understood (Babatunde&amp; Shobomehin 2006:151)”.</p> <p>The resultant Nigerian English has been discussed over and over again in articles and research projects. Quite a number of related articles however have discussed Nigerian English as an Interlangauge (see Jowitt 1991:53) and sociolinguistic variations of Second Language Acquisition (see Preston 1989:239; Adesanoye 1973). In Second Language Acquisition in relation to cultural influences, articles such as (Sapir, 1974:48-49, Cameroon 1997:66, Panley 1997:1, Trudgil 1974:24; Selinker 1972; Corder 1967, 1971 and Dulay and Burt 1973) among others have stated that language use is a function of its immediate environment.</p> <p>On Nigerian English, Jowitt (1991:56) considers the generally agreed (among linguists) disparity between Nigerian English and the Standard British English as traits of the learning process. He describes the NE Interlangauge situation as one replete with so many limitations that training and education could possibly reduce rather than completely eradicate; the non-standard forms which have resulted from the learners‟ socio-cultural environment. Adjemian (1976) cited in Preston (1989:239) sees no difference between a source language and the Interlanguage. On a positive note he points out that Interlanguages are “permeable‟. In other words, there is room for shifts, change and transfer of mother tongue and other socio-cultural features into the source language and used as such in the new speech community. Adjemian‟s position supports the reason for the socio-cultural influences in NE which are observable as coinages. In the next section we shall explore some of the transfer phenomenon as we have observed in Nigerian English expressions around us and especially in some of our current dailies.</p> <p>Data Presentation and Analysis</p> <p>Coinages in Nigerian English present themselves in different morphological dimensions. While some of them are used as compound words, some are one word terms which remain permanent in the lexicon of Nigerian English (see Igboanusi 2002). The compound words are strung together to express concepts of the speakers‟ intent. There are several ways by which words are derived through compounding. It could be through a combination of noun+noun, adjective+adjective, adjective+noun, verb+noun, etc.It should be pointed out that most of the compound words identified in this paper are not context restricted. That is they are meaningful within the language and have their denotative or connotative relevance even outside those contexts of use.</p> <p>The first category of coinages in Nigerian English that would be discussed in this paper includes those with particular semantic implication in the Nigerian Socio-Political system. Such examples are listed follow: Long –Leg, Free-and Fair, Come-of age, Carpet crossing, no-go-area, Man-of timber and caliber, money bag, political juggernaut/heavy-weight, political bride, accord Concordia, bottom power etc., to mention but a few. Many of these lexical items are more or less transitional in nature. In other words, they are short-lived, they hardly attain any permanent use because their short spans do not accrue legitimacy and acceptability to them in order to be incorporated into the standard Nigerian English lexis. As such, they have restricted use and are easily lost over time.</p> <p>The second category referred to as acronyms include NADECO (National Democratic Electoral Commission), FEDECO (Federal Electoral Commission), ECOMOG (Ecowas Monitoring Group), MAMSER (Mass Mobilization for social and Economic Reliance)etc. Others include government agencies such as NEPA, (National Electric Power Authority), now PHCN (Power Holding Company of Nigeria) NIPOST, (Nigeria Postal Service) NITEL, (Nigeria Telecommunications) NAN, (News Agency of Nigeria) NICON (National Insurance Cooperation of Nigeria) etc. As earlier stated, most of these words do not stand the test of time. They reach climax in terms of relevance after they have been introduced, the birth or death of which are always dictated by a circumstance. For instance, WAI was very prominent in the mid 1980 when it was introduced by the Buhari-Idiagbon regime.</p> <p>The third category of coinages is extracts from pages of Nigerian newspapers. The newspapers consulted include: The Nation, The Nigerian Tribune, and The Herald among others. They include: Allah, overjoyed, the person, quick quick, maiguard, Khaki boys etc. Some of these examples have been compiled in a dictionary by Igboanusi (2002). As earlier stated above the NE coinages experience expiry dates; as long as the government or the governor who sponsored it vacates the position. Thus the coinages reach climax in terms of relevance after they have been introduced, the birth and death of which are always dictated by a circumstance. For instance, WAI was very prominent in the mid 1980 when it was introduced by the Buhari-Idiagbon regime. The acronym was then on the lip of every Nigerian. It provided a basis for the nation‟s ethic and psyche. It was synonymous with transparency, honesty, dedication to duty, patriotism and orderliness. But when the programme was cancelled by the succeeding Babangida regime the word lost its potency and faded out.</p> <p>Similarly, the cases of FEDECO, NADECO and MAMSER are noteworthy. FEDECO was prominent in the 2nd Republic but phased out when it was replaced with NEC during the 3rd Republic and now it has been replaced with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) during the current 4th Republic. National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) was prominent at the peak of the struggle for the actualization of the annulled June 12 election but has gradually faded out with the end of military rule. MAMSER is also another coinage that has lost the attention it received during the Babangida era before it was renamed – the National Orientation Agency (NOA). Lack of continuity in most of the nation‟s policies also contributed to the emergence and loss of these words.</p> <p>The word „settlement‟ especially is another word coined to give a more acceptable picture of bribe, gratification or palm greasing used as means of winning favour. Although, the word „egunje‟ is more widely used, „settlement‟ appears more acceptable in official circle. „Settlement replaces kickback and 20% which were in use at various times in the past. The scope of use of „settlement‟ is wider than „kickback‟ and 10% because the duo merely cover contract awards. Settlement on the other hand may include payment for someone to carry out an illegitimate assignment like payment to influence people‟s decision with money; cover up crime and fraud, buy or suppress information that is considered detrimental to one‟s career; to illegitimately pass examination or get a job, etc. The settlement syndrome often transcends monetary benefit in terms of times. It involves sexual harassment and bribery. „Bottom power‟ and „long leg‟, are other coinages that involve the use of sexual intercourse and money respectively to lobby. In Nigeria, success is at times determined by one‟s „long leg‟, i.e., who one knows at the topmost echelon of an organization or the society at large. The use of the word came to limelight as a result of influence of women‟s sexual influence popularly referred to as „bottom power‟.</p> <p>The politicians of the 2nd Republic most especially K.O. Mbadiwe are credited with coinages such as “accord Concordia”, “man of timber and caliber”, “juggernaut”, “political heavy weight”, “political bride,” etc. Mbadiwe coined “accord Concordia” to qualify the soundness of coming together of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN) and Nigeria Peoples Party (NPP) symbolized by its presidential candidate, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe. In fact, the ruling and opposition parties did not form a clear majority in the parliament. Both required the 3rd largest party in the parliament (NPP) either to assume clear leadership or pose strong opposition respectively. It is in the attempt to woo Dr. Nnamdi Azikwe and his NNP to either side that he was nicknamed „political bride‟. Mbadiwe K.O. also coined „man- of timber and caliber as well as „political juggernaut‟s of an individual‟s popularity and followership in his party and constituency. „Carpet crossing‟ referred to decamping from one political party to join another. A canvasser‟ is one who is paid to go round to campaign for a particular candidate and make sure that the people turn up en masse at polling stations on election day. „Money bags‟ are individuals who assumed leadership of political parties because they have the enormous financial capacity. They pay the piper and dictate the tune. This was rampant in the 2nd Republic.</p> <p>„Maradona,‟ „no go area,‟ „419‟, etc., „step aside‟ are coinages prominent during the regime of President Babangida. Babangida was nicknamed Maradona because of the manner of his rulership. It was even a popular assertion that the only thing that was consistent about him was his inconsistency. Diego Amando Maradona, a soccer wizard, on the other hand, as the Argentina football captain in the 1986 world cup dazzled the entire world with his soccer artistry and scored a controversial goal with „the hand of God‟. He led Argentina to win the cup and contributed immensely towards the feat. His soccer prowess is likened to the way Babangida dribbled Nigerians, and the fact that he was a master in his own game of unpredictability.</p> <p>Sociolinguistically, a word such as Allah, i.e., the Arabic language word for God is traceable to the Arabian nations and Northern Nigeria. Metaphorically, certain words derive their meanings. For instance the word „cool‟ in the phrase „cool down‟ is indicative of calming down or relaxing one‟s temper. The metaphor of calming is thus cooling. Other examples include „fresh blood‟ to mean „new hands‟ which mean „new set of employees‟ or „worker‟ to perform specific roles. The sense in freshness is newness while the sense in blood or hands indicates „people‟. Metaphors could be understood and used by educated speakers of English. Thus the usage of metaphoric expressions in Nigerian English confirms the users‟ cognitive superiority over the ordinary learners of English. Several other metaphorical expressions are compiled in Babatunde and Shobomehin (2007:145-172).</p> <p>Finally, the emergence of most of the words discussed in this paper is merely circumstantial, a reflection of the situation that bred and nurtured them. However, these words have no place in Nigerian English because they do not stand the test of time. They are mere creations of particular situations and they die gradually with the circumstance that gave them nature. Most of them exist only in history and not in the vocabulary of any language.</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>This paper has attempted to explain the sociolinguistic reasons for new forms of expressions identified as peculiarly non-native and Nigerian. We are concluding on the note that most of the coinages in Nigerian English are a result of the diffusions occurring between two cultures, i.e., the attempt to express the socio-political and cultural experiences of Nigeria in Standard English. Were there standard forms of English in the dictionary or other referential sources, Nigerians would have consulted such rather than describe events, matters, opinions and above all ideologies in their own innate experiences.</p> <p>It is also important that we note that the ability of a non-native speaker of English to use metaphoric expressions, appropriate to describe some ideas, is indicative of the speaker‟s level of competence in the second language. For instance, metaphors shape thoughts and how thoughts are harnessed is culture bound or dependent. This is the situation in a non-native English speech community such as Nigerian English. We hope this paper has corroborated earlier findings or better still has revealed a new perspective from which Nigerian English coinages can be viewed.</p> <p>References</p> <p>Adegbija, E. 2004.

It can also be said to be an incompatibility, as of two things that cannot be simultaneously fulfilled.</p> <p>The word conflict is as old as mankind. This is because the word has been in existence in all area of man life since the inception of the world. The word conflict is derived from the Latin word configure, meaning to strike together. Conflict also means contradiction arising from differences in interest, ideas, ideologies, orientations, beliefs perceptions and tendencies.</p> <p>Conflicts usually occurs primarily as a result of a clash of interests in the relationship between parties groups and states, either because they are pursuing opposing or incompatible goals.</p> <p><strong>CAUSES OF CONFLICT IN AFRICA</strong></p> <p>          Conflict arising from the militarization of the society: abundance of weaponry and trained soldiers and untrained volunteers available to any would be warlord with resources and determination.</p> <p>1. Poor economic performance: a more basic and long term cause of conflict has been the catastrophic economic performance of many African countries. Coupled with the debt problem. Poor flows of private capital into some African countries and foreign and programs often inefficient as Neil. Economic discomfort can bail out into conflict. The deepest causes of the conflict; economic despair, social injustice, and political oppression. In the midst of poverty, African ruling classes or the elite group who happen to hold power at a particular time, have enriched themselves and become the targets of envy or of rivalry by other elite groups.</p> <p>2. Political/Domestic: Power struggles hostile groups over population economic or religious disparities oppression and demand for democracy communal or ethnic violence related to economic social religious cultural or ethnic issues.</p> <p>3. Political/International:These takes the form of ideological or political campaigns territorial claims and religious expansionism against other states regional rivalries terrorism, coercion or discrimination respecting the trade or economy of other states </p> <p>4. Ethnicity;a major cause of Africa conflicts been ethnicity and it has continued to be so, the creation of independence was accompanied urgent calls for nation building by the new African leaders who werewell aware of the difficulty in transcending Africa ethnic and regional loyalties .There have been a number of separatistmovement causing attempts of secession such as Katangain Zaire, Biafra in Nigeria and others in SudanEthiopia and Somalia</p> <p>5. Military: Interstate aggression annexation intervention or hostility for example support for the rebels of other states or for separatist movement </p> <p>6. Inter-state borders: Commonto many conflicts is the unsatisfactory nature of interstate borders. Nearly all the borders were inherited from colonial times and were the product of negotiations and treaties between the colonial power decided in Europe with the aid of poor maps and with scant attention to Africa peoples, the African government shield away from making adjustments and in any case these was difficult as they did not all reach independence at the same time.</p> <p>7. Persecution: It connotes violation of human rights mass movements of refuges poverty or instability caused by the mismanagement or ineptitude of the government including evident andperceived levels of corruption by the government beyond and acceptable limit of traditional toleration.</p> <p>8. Conflict over psychological needs: Conflicts over psychological needs of group and individuals are conflict which cannot be seen but affect the psyche of the individual and groups self-actualization need for individual and group respect attempt to protect on group to be better than the others.</p> <p>9. Conflicting involving values: Contradicting value system such as religious belief and ideological position and general worldview is another factor responsible for social conflict among the interacting parties.</p> <p>10. Conflict over resources: These kind of conflict are usually easy to identify because they can be seen and amore potentially easy to resolve. This conflict occurs when two or more people are competing for inadequate (or perceived to be inadequate) resources over a period of time .The competition may assume negative or destructive dimension when the available resources are not evenly and judiciously distributed.</p> <p>TEN CONFLICT RESOLUTION MECHANISM BY THE UNITED NATIONS </p> <p>          The United Nations primary mission is symbolized by the opening words of the charter. They dedicate the united nation to saving “succeeding generations from the scourge of war which has brought untold sorrows to mankind and the maintenance of international peace and security. Theunited nation through diplomatic intervention has direct role in assisting and encouraging countries to settle their disputes peace and security contributeto world peace and security in this regard the United Nations performs the following function.</p> <p>1. Inquiry: fact finding by neutral investigation, they find fact by neutral investigation they investigate about things they also inquire about things that happen in the nation.</p> <p>2. GoodOffices: encouraging parties to negotiate. TheUnited Nations encourages parties to negotiate they preferother parties to relate with each other to do things in common</p> <p>3. Mediation: making suggestions about possible solutions acting asan intermediary between two parties to suggest about possible solution. They also serve as middle men between two different parties to help them suggest about possible solution.</p> <p>4. Arbitration: Using a special panelto find a solution that all parties agree in advance to accept they find solution to all parties.</p> <p>5. Adjudication submitting disputes to an international courts such as the United Nations international court of justice (I.C.J)</p> <p>6. Enforcement ofsanction: peace maintenance involve three distinct but interrelated activities.</p> <p>7. Peacekeeping: It involves coordinated efforts to ensure stability and relative            chaoticsituation. Peace keeping has no express constitutional legislation in the UN carter it’s a pragmatic response to the program.</p> <p>8. United Nation extend goal is to create conditions conducive to establish lasting political settlement they help to create a conducive environment for last longing political settlement.</p> <p>9. UnitedNations resolves conflict in Africa by using mediation conducted by the use of good will eminent personalities mandated by the assembly of head of states and government .They help to develop tools which were quite effective in the mediation of interstateconflict.</p> <p>10. Another mechanism was the mounted operations by the United Nations the Africa union and other organization such as the commonwealth ECOWAS ranging from political missions andelection monitoring missions to military and civil policy observer groups, or to peace keeping and peace enforcement missions.</p>\n\nCONFLICTS AND CAUSES OF CONFLICTS IN AFRICA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CONFLICTS AND CAUSES OF CONFLICTS IN AFRICA", "id": 131}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong> INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1.</strong> <strong>Background to the study</strong></p> <p>Film has been in existence since time immemorial, it serves many generations as a tool of understanding and passing across vital information and ideas generated by individual different communities. Since some people lack reading cultures, there is a need to engage films to disseminate information to the public for better understanding. Film, in the generic sense is the basis of all motion picture forms and most pervasive form of communication and entertainment in the postmodern world, Tomase (2005).</p> <p>Films play an important role in the fabric of our society.  It is like a food which people cannot joke with, because of the satisfaction of hunger. The need to ensure that ideologies and values that need public participation is transformed into social thinking and debate has been a serious concern to people and governments. To avail themselves this golden opportunity, they resorted to various films which are extensively used because of the important role they play in the comity of nations, especially on how they command extensive audience participation. Films transpose the discourse of social life into cinematic narratives, Ryan and Keller (1988). The film producers are supposed to be deeply rooted in the language and culture of its audience. The manner adopted by film producers to express themselves in various languages of their choices is very important to the audience because they show the importance of understanding the message the producer of any film is passing across to audience. Film is a   popular cultural form which is regarded as a gauge of social attitudes and change, Kuhn (1990). </p> <p>Masoud (2010) defines film as the currency of intellectual debate. Films help the audiences both old and new to rethink their places in the world and critically motivate them to do something about the injustice and exploitation to which they are witnessed Pietari (2013). </p> <p>From the foregoing, it is suffice to say that film is a subtle way in which producers utilize to express their opinions to the public.</p> <p>In spite of the magnitude of film as a powerful vehicles for moulding  public opinion and determining people's perception of social reality, it is  worrisome that women are unfairly  portrayed in Nigerian home videos .Nigeria is still dominated by stereotyped portrayal of gender relations and negative images of women. The explosion in the number of local video films is truly astounding. Aihe (1996:7) cited Chinyere (2013) points out that at least one video film enters the market every week . According to him \"The result is that in a single year since the past three years, more than three hundred local films have been pumped into the Nigerian market”. The negative images of women by the large local home video films producers have eroded the positive feelings of the audience both within and outside the country. This has made a growing number of Nigerian women have in recent years expressed misgivings about the portrayal of women in Nigerian home video films (Ezeigbo, 1996: Layor, 1995).</p> <p>To investigate the representation and images of women in Nigerian film, this research will adopt a thematic and semiotic analysis of Nigerian film of  ‘’Thunderbolt’ (2000) produced by Tunde Kilani ,one of the films belonging  to Nollywood . This popular film belongs to the melodramatic genre that characterizes contemporary filmmaking in Nigeria. Most interestingly, despite the films is characterized  with socio-cultural history, it employs the genre and  theme in relation to women’s position in the narrative structure. </p> <p>The selection of this film is based on its popularity, which occurs due to the popularity of the filmmaker, more importantly the melodramatic, heartwarming plot, love and narrative of the film. The film revolves about two different tribes in which the protagonist (woman) proves to her husband beyond any reasonable doubt of her love and hope that two different tribes can live in harmony in spite of their cultural differences. The film portrays a woman is loyal to her family vows and abhor any sort of sexuality outside marriage. Thunderbolt is decidedly progressive<strong>. </strong>It is beyond any doubt that the audience’s identification with Ngozi as a (relatively) strong female main character somewhat subverts societal norms of male dominance.</p> <p>This examination of sexual politics is suitable to the video-film’s overarching discourse of modern (or Western) beliefs versus African tradition. While it is somewhat Western in its treatment of sexual politics, however, it sides overtly with traditional beliefs in many other ways. The film portrays a modern African woman educated and well-to-do, and she works instead of staying home to take care of her baby, and her modern beliefs nearly cause her downfall, as she scoffs at the idea that she has been placed under some sort of curse. it is faster-paced, more focused on character psychology, and far more melodramatic than canonical films.</p> <p>This study indicates empirical evidence to support or disprove such misgivings of women in our society. This is demonstrated by the widespread condemnation of violent and socially deviant contents of the Nigerian films, stereotyped and negative portrayals of vulnerable social groups like women. The film narrates mystical love victimization.</p> <p>Theoretically, this research employs the feminist perspective to identify the images of women in the selected film using the semiotics approach as its method. Semiotics concepts are applied when analyzing the film. Semiotics as originated from linguistics can be applied to cinema although care must be taken when doing so because cinematic language is not like the normal verbal language in everyday use Abubakar (2014)</p> <p> Considering the popular definition of Semiotics as the scientific study of signs (Saussure, 1983), this study uses the conceptualisation of semiotics found in the works of various researchers on semiotics to explain sign usage in this study. Signs take the form of words, images, sounds, odours, flavours, acts or objects, but such things have no intrinsic meaning and become signs only when we invest them with meaning common to a particular society. According to C.S. Peirce (1931:58), 'nothing is a sign unless it is interpreted as a sign'. Anything can be a sign as long as someone interprets it as 'signifying' something - referring to or standing for something other than itself. We interpret things as signs largely unconsciously by relating them to familiar systems of convention. Since the science of sign has been a major medium of communication across races, tribes and people over the ages, it is pertinent for us to consider it as a vehicle for disseminating themes for this study.Greimas (1990)cited Oso (2016) postulates that nothing, in semiotic has meaning in and of itself because context is very important to meaning-making.  For this study to be complete, the subject matter must be understood well. Themes in any work of fiction are the key or central ideas of the producer of films and through these themes; comments on life generally are made (Kofa, 2010).</p> <p>Adágbádá (2009:31) postulates that the source of the theme is that which forms the basis of a poem, prose or play, and it is normally the society with its cultural norms and values. Authors’ way of using signification as a means of conveying their thematic concerns is the major thrust of this study; hence, it is the meaningful use of signs which is at the heart of the concerns of semiotics that is dwelt on in this study.</p> <p>However, according to the feminist film perspective, most of the films produced in Nigeria reproduce and distort the images of women in comparison to their real social images and roles. While describing the way women are portrayed in Nigerian video films, Adekunle argued that <em>“there is a noticeable trend in the Nigerian film industry...the women in the films come as wicked, manipulative, loose in morals, diabolic and inferior to the men” (Adekunle, 2010, p. 1). </em>The controversy here involves whether the films distort or reproduce reality. Some of the social situations reviewed in this research attest to the film images situating women as they are in real life.</p> <p><strong>1.2   History of Nollywood.</strong></p> <p>The emotionally traumatizing “Master – Servant” relationship, apparent in the constant assaults, batteries, intimidation, segregation, victimization, carried out while using Colonial masters on the colonized, with darkened clouds of resentment, vengeance, thirst for freedom, offering option to splattering drops of such thoughts, instinctively projected consequently of the colonized intermittent in-subordinate actions, began to distribute one of many blacks. The British realized they had to thread with caution when they even now desired to take part in “god” inside their lives when films just like Tales of Manhattan, Trailer horn, Tarzan series began to stir up a revolution in the hearts of Blacks around the globe.</p> <p>Aware of the lethal energy of insurgency which could be unleashed consequently of the movie medium, the British out of fearfulness for his or her lives and achievable the loss of the Queen’s sovereignty took the bull while using horn, and swiftly created a Colonial movie Censors Board (FCB) in 1933 to censor and classify films just before they were released for visual consumption while using public. Following the establishment of the board, Films just like “The primitive, primitive man, Dixie, Buffalo Bill, The Keys of the Kingdom, Sleepy village Girl were tagged ‘suitable’ to be watched , while Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Clive of India, The Isle of Forgotten Sins, home of Frankenstein were considered as unsuitable for viewing .</p> <p>The list of documented films created for the duration of the 70′s era and transcending somewhat into the 80′s is simply astonishing and goes to demonstrate that the Movie Industry has been near to much longer, contrary towards ‘1992 perception syndrome’ most are already injected with .Such works include Kongi Harvest (1971), Alpha (1972), Bull Frog in the sunlight (1974),  Amadi (1975), Ajani Ogun (1975),  Muzik Man (1976),  Bisi, Daughter of the River (1977), Ija Ominira (1978), Aiye (1979), Kadara (1980), Jaiyesimi (1980) Efunsetan Aniwura (1981), Cry independence (1981),Ija Orogun (1982) Owo L’Agba (1982)</p> <p>Several researchers have written Literatures on Nollywood ranges from the historical aspects of the industry to the theme, plots, production and distribution of films for local and global audiences. The film has been a source of expressing and understanding the Nigerian culture as well as an influence on the lifestyles of Nigerian people. origin  of movies  to the 1960s when the first set of Nollywood movies were produced by great historical filmmakers, the likes of Hubert Ogunde, Jab Adu, Ola Balogun, Moses Olaiya (Baba Sala) and Eddie Ugboma. These professionals are considered to be the first generation of Nigerian filmmakers. Moses Olaiya a.k.a Baba Sala, brought the modern Nigerian comedy to life with his comic movies. Sam Loco Efe’s name can’t be left out in this nomenclature with his humorous comedies. Hubert Ogunde was a pioneer in the field of Nigerian opera. He was known for the establishment of the Ogunde Theatre in 1945, which was the first professional theatrical company in Nigeria. He was also referred to as the father of the Nigerian theatre because of his great contribution to the birth of the Nigerian film industry<strong>.</strong></p> <p>The Nigerian movie industry (Home video Industry) a.k.a Nollywood has been typically accepted to have started-- immediately following the success of Ken Nebue’s “Living in bondage”. From then on, its expansion and attendant complications are known (by fascinated parties).The Nigerian film industry is increasing the level of scholarship with several researchers investigating the genres, production, distribution and challenges faced by the film with the country the number of films produced, as well as the themes and storyline of Nigerian films (Ebewo,2007; Haynes and Okome 1998, Obayiuwana 2011)cited Elizabeth (2004).</p> <p>Nigerians became fully involved in the production of films, and by 1970, the first indigenous feature film, <strong>“KONGI’S HARVEST”</strong>, written by Wole Soyinka, was produced in Nigeria. However, it was directed by an American and many of its crew members were foreigners. Later, more individuals became involved in the production of indigenous films, the likes of, Ola Balogun, Eddie Ugbomah, Ladi Ladebo and others.</p> <p>With several studies done in the past about the emerging Nollywood film industry,the Nigerian film industry is viewed in both negative and positive ways.</p> <p><strong>1.3. Statement of the Problem and Research Questions </strong></p> <p>This study was motivated by the researcher’s observation that the representation of women in cinema today is a matter of debate. Nigerian cinema practices are influenced by the patriarchal ideologies and fantasies of the male filmmakers where women are placed in a lower social status, often domesticated as housewives, secretaries, nurses, and child breeders Abubakar (2014).</p> <p>However, this kind of maligning of womanhood did not stop but was augmented through negative representations. In most Nigerian films, women are portrayed as home breakers, prostitutes, materialists, victims of poverty, and evil doers. This type of representation is not restricted to films produced by men in Nigeria; even those produced by women situate women in such ominous positions. Women are suppressed and maligned within the film industry; they play secretaries, prop girls, odd-job girls, receptionists, and similar characters. They are oppressed by being packaged as images (sex objects, victims, or vampires) and they are oppressed within film theory by male critics who celebrate auteur (Thornham, 1999).The above prescribed roles attached to female cinematic representation are passive, very low status roles. None of the roles is active, and women tend be under men as their masters, husbands, or fathers. However, in some societies, these features might not offend based on the status of women in those societies because media, including film, reflect a society, although feminists suspect the male auteur of distorting the real social images of women in their films</p> <p>It is against this backdrop that this study investigates the best method to represent the features and images of  Nigerian women in Nollywood films. This research work revolves around Nigerian film Nollywood and examines one film. However, the theoretical approach is feminist film theory while the methodology for analysis remains the semiotics approach</p> <p>This research investigates the dominant images of women in Nigerian film industries, Nollywood. To do so, the following questions will be answered: </p> <p>1. What are the major features and images of women in Nigerian cinema? How are they represented in the context of their social status? Are they positively or negatively represented in the film? </p> <p>2. How does Nigerian cinema reproduce or subvert cultural hegemony? Do the films promote patriarchy or feminism? </p> <p><strong>1.4.    Aim and objectives</strong></p> <p>The aim of the study was carried out to critically examine how women are being portrayed in Nigerian film:</p> <p>i. to bring out the major features and images of women in Nigerian cinema.</p> <p>ii. to ascertain the level of representation of women in the context of their social status. </p> <p>iii. to determine whether or not Nigerian films promotes patriarchy or feminism.</p> <p>iv. to investigate whether the Nigerian cinema reproduces or subverts cultural hegemony. </p> <p>.</p> <p><strong>Chapter Two: Theoretical framework</strong></p> <p><strong>2.1 Feminist film theory </strong></p> <p>Many competing approaches and theories guide film analysis, including anthropological theory, semiotics theory, neo-structuralism theory, feminist theory, and neo-Marxist theory (Ukata, 2010).  Feminist film theory emerged in the 1970s and is rooted in the women’s movement of the 1960s. The central discourse of the feminists involves how film texts are worked and constructed to impose patriarchal ideology on females.</p> <p>However, the desire of the female to counter and criticize the mainstream cinema, while advocating alternative cinema and filmmaking in which women were given favorable, active, and leading roles as the main protagonists led to the birth of feminist film discourses. Additionally, in their bid to counter the masculine-oriented cinema, feminists even delved into criticism of the mainstream media representation of women, such as in television programmes, newspapers and magazines (Hollinger, 2012) cited in Abubakar (2014).</p> <p>Feminist documentary and films reveals what motivated feminists to start their films: They (feminists) found that women traditionally seen on the screens were the reproduction of the experience, imagination, and fantasies of male filmmakers. Feminists, both academics and radicals, at all levels are fighting to bridge the cultural gaps between men and women. Feminists works in the humanities have aimed both at eliminating the disadvantages that women directors, authors, visual artists, and composers have in relation to their male colleagues and supplying missing historical information about women (Buikema, 1995). </p> <p>McCabe maintains that the primary intention of feminist films is to understand the ways in which women are represented in film and to expose the sexist and women-centered content of cinema narratives as well as  to reveal the media description of women as sexual objects for men’s pleasure (McCabe, 2004).Feminists in film studies are also concerned about the sexist image of women in the works men produce, which led to coining of the term ‘sexual difference.’ Feminist studies have focused on establishing a female aesthetic independent of the cultural norms and values set by men (Buikema, 1995). Nevertheless, Haskell (1973) and Rosen (1993) reveal that  feminist arguments on films are about representation and spectatorship, the stereotypes of women in cinema, and the distortion of women’s images from reality.</p> <p>Moreover, feminists are accusing the media, script writers and the film producers of misrepresenting women, portraying them in a stereotypical manner, denigrating them, and always showing them in the home and subordinate to men (Nelmes, 2007, p. 227). It is necessary that women should be shown in a variety of roles; they should be depicted as heroines, not only in the roles of loving a man, homemaking, and bearing children. The women should be represented as active.</p> <p>They should not face ridicule or unhappy or tragic endings; women should be given high positions, depicted in adventures that do not center on sexual attraction for a man or in working with other women without cattiness (Thornham, 1999). Moreover, Claire Johnson, in her paper “Women Cinema, a Counter Cinema,” showed how women have been portrayed in films since the days of silent cinema. Women are always seen as an extension of a man. Thus, she castigated the narrow roles women have been given in films (Nelmes, 2007).</p> <p>The other feminist theories that help in examination of the feminist movement concerning cinematic representations are reflection theory, equality theory, and theory of difference. Reflection theory of women and film says that the cinema reflects and represents the social reality. The way women are depicted in films is the way society treats them. These depictions are false and distorted; hence, they should be changed (Hill &amp; Church, 2000). </p> <p>If the cinema reinforces the social reality, feminists must first change the societal perceptions of women and the way they are treated, starting from the grassroots rather than attacking the male auteur to the extent of deconstructing the cinema contents with regard to female representations. Reflection theory, describes societies where women are highly valuable and respected, their cinematic images are the same as in reality. Moreover, feminists have strongly opposed reflection theory, arguing that it allows a reconstruction and distortion by the filmmakers (White, 2000).</p> <p>Feminists agitating for equality are trying to emancipate women, to have them seen as coherent, rational, and autonomous. De Beauvoir provided an example of equality emancipating theory. She argued that women should live the way men do and their social roles should go beyond motherhood and subalterns to men; rather, they should be equal and shoulder to shoulder with men. Moreover, part of their struggle is to acknowledge the ignored women historical figures, authors, visual artists, playwrights, and composers (Buikema, 1995). </p> <p>Feminists who apply the theory of difference campaign for the abolition of sexual differences, for females to have full access to social and cultural structures. They want women’s social and cultural positions to be strengthened, using different means to promote women’s interests and raising questions regarding women’s aesthetics. However, Buikema argues that sexual difference is constructed by society. In addition, while demarcating gender and sex, Buikema maintained that ‘sex’ refers to biological differences between women and men and ‘gender’ to the identity and social position that accompany this biological difference in particular cultures (Buikema, 1995). This entails that the feminist discourses on film and cinematic representations justify the patriarchal domination and ideology imposed on females within the popular culture. However, without a tangible vision of feminism, it is impossible to fully understand how gender shapes the cinema. </p> <p>To crown it all, the arguments and discourses of feminists in all spheres and disciplines revolve around three basic perspectives: representation, spectatorship, gender and sexual difference.</p> <p><strong>2.2 Semiotics and the semiotic approach in film studies</strong></p> <p>African literary artists have used and are still using various theories to analyse and evaluate literary works. Among such theories are Formalism, Structuralism, Marxism, Feminism, Semiotics and Sociology of Literature among others. These theories are aesthetics of discourse; they are tools for deeper literary interpretations . Semiotics is the theory and study of sign and symbols, especially as elements of language or other systems of communication (Umberto Eco, 1987) cited Oso (2016). </p> <p>Semiotics is a method used for textual analysis in social science disciplines and linguistics. It is concerned with how combinations of signs communicate and make meaning in a given text. The text can be sound, image, or a combination of the two. Semiotics is the study of the means that can be used to communicate, such as words, images, traffic signs, flowers, music, and medical symptoms (Taylor &amp; Willis, 2007; see Berger, 2000). Saussure (1916) maintains that semiotics is a science that deals with study of the life of signs within society (Noth, 1995; see Lapsley &amp; Westlake, 1998).</p> <p>However, semiotics can be said to come out of linguistics as some early semioticians borrowed certain concepts of semiotics application from linguistics structures. Buckland argued that “<em>early semioticians borrowed from structural linguistics the communication test, a deductive method of analyzing how the underlying level lends structure to surface level”(Buckland 2004, p. 36). </em></p> <p>Chandler (2000) maintains that Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1857-1913) was a pioneer who regularly referred to semiotics. According to Chandler, the other key role players in the early development of semiotics are American philosophers Peirce (1839-1914) and Morris (1901-1979). Chandler also acknowledged Eco, Barthes, Kristeva, Metz, Jacobson, Halliday, and Greimas as leading contemporary semiotic theorists. Moreover, semiotics cannot be separated from structuralism; Levi-Strauss in anthropology and Lacan in psycho analysis are also considered important in the field (Chandler, 2000). </p> <p>In addition, semiotics also deals with how meanings are produced within a given media text. Seiter (1999) identifies the benefits of semiotics analysis thus, <em>“It allowed us to describe the workings of cultural communication with greater and enlarged our recognition of the conventions that characterize our culture” (Taylor &amp; Willis, 2007 p. 19). </em>Moreover, Berger argues that <em>“semiotics helps us to understand how to decipher the messages we are sent and understand better the messages we send about ourselves to others” (</em>Berger, 2000, p. 43). Moreover, Vanzoonen (1994) defines semiotics analysis thus, <em>“semiotics analysis can be seen as formalization of the interpretative activities ordinary human being undertakes incessantly” (Taylor &amp; Willis 2007, p. 19). </em>Fiske maintains that when dealing with semiotics we concentrate on terms like denote and connote (Fiske, 1990). He further argued that semiotics systems <em>“concentrate on analyses of a structured set of relationship which enable a message to signify something. Moreover, semiotics works tend to contribute in demystification and </em><em>neutralizing representations and making them as constructed signs” </em>(Westlake &amp; Lapsley 1998, p. 33).</p> <p>Based on the above definitions of semiotics from different scholars, semiotics involves the study of different linguistic and cultural signs and the way they make meanings in a given text. Text can be sound, image, spoken words, or a combination of all. The meaning for semioticians should have cultural significance </p> <p>Through various types of signs, everything in this world entails and imparts a certain meaning of its own in the eyes of the receivers. Chandler (2000) explains that in semiotics, signs are perhaps everything from which meanings can be deduced, like words, images, sounds, gestures, and objects. To analyze semiotics in Saussure’s approach, every sign has two concepts: a signifier, the form the sign takes, and the signified, the concept it represents. </p> <p>Semiotics has been criticized because its approach tends to be subjective based on the researcher’s level of perception of what he or she is analyzing. If two people are given the same text to analyze, their results will differ, particularly at the connotative level. Nevertheless, semiotics provides researchers with unifying concepts and sets of methods. It is the approach that made available different methodological terms to follow in analyses. Semiotics serves as a textual analysis method that gives more room to researchers to express their thoughts, while also giving them the chance to dig beyond the surface and manifest meaning of a text. Metz( 1974).  continued to argue that <em>“film, like a verbal language can be used merely as a vehicle without any artistic intention, with designation (denotation) governing alone and consequently, the art of the cinema like verbal art is, so to speak, driven one notch upward” </em>.</p> <p>Semiotics has been criticized because its approach tends to be subjective based on the researcher’s level of perception of what he or she is analyzing.

However, the problem of film expressiveness as Metz put it is that cinema is not like a language system because it contrasts important linguistics facts, while a language is a system of signs with rules used for inter-communication (Metz, 1974). Metz continued to argue that <em>“film, like a verbal language can be used merely as a vehicle without any artistic intention, with designation (denotation) governing alone and consequently, the art of the cinema like verbal art is, so to speak, driven one notch upward” (Metz, p. 77). </em>He further maintained that the semiotics should be applied to cinema studies with the greatest caution</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p> <p><strong>METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p><strong>3.0     Introduction</strong></p> <p>This chapter presented research method adopted for the study.

The <em>Thunderbolt</em> resulting from jealousy  caused by the evil plot of a man in the central theme of the film. However, <em>thunderbolt  </em>is presented in the chronological order of its narrative using different types of shots and scenes. The film also depicts the conflict life style  between two different tribes  and jealousy . </p> <p>Moreover, in terms of ideology, this film appeals less to ideology than the patriarchy embedded in most Nigerian societies. The Yoruba culture  encourages patriarchy in that the men are the leaders at home. However, the critiques of ideology are concerned with deconstructing the ideological practices through assessment of their legitimacy. Rodriguez maintained that <em>“a central aim of ideology critique therefore consists of assessing the legitimacy of a practice of subordination” </em>(Rodriguez, no date, p. 269). With regard to the above statements, Nigerian elites are yet to wake up to using the film medium for influential aims in society. This is because filmmaking is not seen as a respectable activity but rather a profitable business. In Nigeria, filmmakers are considered immoral and agents of moral decadence. </p>\n\nDIGNITY OR SUPPRESSION: THE PORTRAYAL OF WOMEN IN THUNDERBOLT  NOLLYWOOD HOME VIDEO  FILM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DIGNITY OR SUPPRESSION: THE PORTRAYAL OF WOMEN IN THUNDERBOLT  NOLLYWOOD HOME VIDEO  FILM", "id": 132}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong><em>ABSTRACT                                                                                             </em></strong></p> <p><em>Discourse and communication are two interrelated concepts, intricately interwoven and grossly assumed as overtly synonymous.

In other words, the whole essence of language boils down to communication and communication is or entails discourse. The centrality and significance of language in relation to mankind has made it the concern of linguists. Prior to modern trends in linguistics analysis, scholars were chiefly concerned with describing the structures and frameworks of languages, in this case, the traditional grammarians. However, the development of new approaches in language study shifted emphasis to functionalism, marking a quantum leap from linguistic prescriptivism to linguistic descriptivism. This brought about attempts to explain the roles or functions of language in different context, thus leading to new disciplines like discourse analysis and communication studies that view language as discourse and as a means to exchange ideas or knowledge. </p> <p>Discourse can be regarded as communication because they are invariably linked such that the manifestation of one presupposes the occurrence of the other. This scenario could be likened to two sides of a coin; intricate parts of a whole. According to Wodak ‘discourse is a social performance, a relative social phenomenon that depends on a wide range of discipline…’ (49). Simply put, it refers to conversations or utterances in a social context. On the other hand, communication is an umbrella term for processes that involve the exchange of information and this includes conversations or utterances (discourse). Keyton (52) states that ‘communication presupposes discourse and all discourse forms’. In this regard, the concepts of discourse and communication will be examined in detail to further understand there interrelatedness and minor differences.</p> <p><strong> 2.0 DISCOURSE &amp; DISCOURSE ANALYSIS</strong></p> <p>The term <em>Discourse</em> is broad with many definitions. It ‘integrates a whole palette of meanings’ (Horvath, npn). The Wikipedia states that the word <em>discourse</em> is derived from the Latin word <em>discursus</em> which means <em>to </em>and<em> from</em>’ (npn). Literally, discourse refers to communication of thought by words or a formal discussion of a subject in speech or writing. A plausible definition of discourse is offered by Stubbs as ‘language above the sentence or above the clause’ (2). In the same vein, Tenorio (4) states that discourse ‘is the highest unit of linguistic description; phonemes, morphemes, words, phrases, clauses, sentences and text are below’. This definition offers a syntactic description or explanation of discourse. Adopting a different view, Van Dijk asserts that discourse is ‘text in context’ (3). Dijk’s position offers a sociolinguistics outlook on the notion of discourse by taking cognizance of the situation it occurs. The context is very significant because discourse does not take place in a vacuum and must be by definite participants or interactants. </p> <p>Despite the various definitions offered by linguists, Schiffrin conceives that ‘discourse can be interpreted in wider range than any other term in linguistic areas, yet it has been least accurately defined’ (40). This is relatively in consonance with Richardson’s view which implies that discourse is a term that is used fashionably in various disciplines and becomes ‘one of the most well used words in academics today’ (21). In other words, the term is frequently used and adopted in other academic fields, thus leading to its diverse definitions.  Paltridge (2) offers that Zellig Harris; a well known linguist was the first to use the term ‘discourse’ in 1952 during a paper he presented on Discourse Analysis. However, Discourse as a field only gained much interest during the 1970s when it eventually developed as a critique of cognitive process in communication. It is based on the notion that language needs a context for it to function properly. In this regard, Ahmad (1) stressed that it is ‘difficult to understand the linguistic items used in discourse without a context’. </p> <p>The context is so relevant in discourse such that it is part of the three perspectives outlined by Van Dijk to define or critically understand discourse. They are: linguistic, cognitive and socio-cultural. First, he argues that discourse is described at the syntactic, semantic and stylistic levels (linguistics perspective). Secondly, he adds that it needs to be understood from the interlocutors’ processes of production, reception and understanding (cognitive) and finally he points to the social dimension of discourse which he sees as a sequence of contextualized, controlled and purposeful acts that occur in the society: context (socio-cultural). In sum, discourse is multidisciplinary. It is a social performance, an interpersonal activity whose form is determined by its social purpose.</p> <p>Discourse Analysis is a cover term for the many traditions by which discourse may be analysed. Osisanwo (8) notes thus, ‘popular as discourse analysis is among modern linguists, coming up with a comprehensive and acceptable definition of the term has been a herculean task’. To solve this linguistics conundrum, Brown and Yule in Osisanwo provided an apt definition as ‘the analysis of discourse is necessarily the analysis of language in use’ (8). This definition implied that discourse overtly presupposes communication; therefore discourse analysis is the method of studying discourse. Stubbs in Osisanwo offered a syntax-oriented view of discourse analysis as an attempt to study ‘the organization of language above the sentence or above the clause, and therefore to study larger linguistic units, such as conversational exchanges or written texts’ (8). </p> <p>Schriffin explains that ‘it is a critique of cognitivism (objective, observable/knowable reality) that developed from the 1970s onwards, although it has its roots in the <em>turn to language</em> in the 1950s’ (34). Crystal in Mills asserted that ‘discourse analysis focuses on the structure of naturally occurring spoken language, as found in such discourses as conversations, interviews, commentaries and speeches’ (3). This corroborates Van Dijk’s view on Discourse analysis as a modality for construction of theories in clarifying the existing relations between language use, thoughts or beliefs and social interactions. He goes further to correct the general misconception that discourse analysis can only be done on spoken language since there is an evident interaction between speakers. On the contrary, written materials can also be analysed because readers assimilate what they are reading in spite of what may seem as passive interaction between a reader and the text. </p> <p>In a nutshell, Mills (135) agreed that ‘discourse analysis could be seen as a reaction to a more traditional form of linguistics (formal, structural linguistics) which focused on the constituent units and structure of the sentence and which does not concern itself with an analysis of language in use’. It is concerned with translating the notion of structure from the level of the sentence to the level of longer text.</p> <p><strong>2.1 DISCOURSE STRATEGIES</strong></p> <p>A strategy ordinarily refers to a modality, procedure or method in achieving a set goal or aim. Van Dijk conceived strategy as ‘cognitive representations of action sequences and their goals’ (79). This means that one’s desires or wants are compared to what one knows about one’s abilities, the action, context, the possibilities and probabilities of outcomes and so on. In this regard, he viewed discourse strategies as ‘intuitive notions that underlie semantic relations between sentences and in terms of rules relating sentences with semantic macrostructures’ (80). These intuitive notions bring about proper linking of ideas or semantic relations in discourse. Therefore, the basic discourse strategies are cohesion and coherence. </p> <p><strong>2.1.1 Cohesion:</strong> This refers to the grammatical or lexical linking within a text or sentence that holds a text together and gives it meaning. There are two main types of cohesion: lexical and grammatical cohesion. </p> <p>Lexical cohesion involves making use of the features of words as well as the group relationship between them. There are two main types of lexical cohesion which are: reiteration and collocation. Reiteration occurs in form of repetition, synonymy or hyponymy. On the other hand, collocation deals with words that co-occur in discourse.</p> <p>Grammatical cohesion centres on the logical and structural form of words used in discourse. There are four main types of grammatical devices: reference, substitution, ellipsis and conjunction. Reference deals with definiteness and can be divided into two: anaphoric and cataphoric reference. Substitution entails replacement of linguistic element(s) while ellipsis involves outright deletion of these elements (words).</p> <p><strong>2.1.2 Coherence:</strong> This covers the semantic aspects of discourse. Simply put, discourse is said to be coherent when it makes sense. Coherence in discourse is achieved through syntactical features, cognitive processes and semantic relations such as the use of deictic, anaphoric and cataphoric elements, implications and presuppositions.</p> <p><strong>2.2 Critical Discourse Analysis</strong></p> <p>Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) is a contemporary approach to the study of language and discourses in social institutions. It focuses on the way and manner language exercises its power in the society. Critical Discourse Analysis began from the assumption that systematic asymmetries of power and resources between speakers and listeners, readers and writers can be linked to their unequal access to linguistic and social resources. It hinges on the notion that language use is a social practice which does not function in isolation but in a set of cultural, social and psychological frameworks. CDA accepts this social context and studies its connections with textual structures. It also takes the social context into account and explores the links between textual structures and their function interaction within the society. The terms Critical Linguistics (CL) and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) are often used interchangeably. However, the latter is often preferred and used to denote the former theory previously identified as Critical Linguistics. CDA is a relatively new approach in discourse studies, whose emergence could be traced to a small symposium of discourse scholars in Amsterdam in 1990 and headed by Van Dijk. He views CDA as;</p> <p>a type of discourse analytical research that primarily studies the way                       social power abuse, dominance and inequality are enacted, reproduced and resisted by text and talk in the social and political context. With such dissident research, critical discourse analysts take explicit position and thus want to understand, expose and ultimately resist social inequality. (23)</p> <p><strong>2.2.1 Theories in Critical Discourse Analysis</strong></p> <p>Based on Wodak’s submissions, there are about six (6) known theories of Critical Discourse Analysis. These theories are often referred to as approaches and shall be subsequently discussed.</p> <p><strong>2.2.1.1 Dispositive Analysis:</strong> According to Carbon, Foucault conceptualizes the term dispositive as a ‘decidedly heterogeneous ensemble of elements ranging from buildings to laws to scientific statements… but also for example, the users exclusive knowledge of a code’ (2). Carbon notes that one important aspect of Foucault’s definition is the importance of connections between elements. Using Jager’s taxonomy, Carbon outlines three elements which she considers as the bedrock of dispositive analysis. They are: discursive practices, non-discursive practices (actions) and physical objects. Discursive practices addresses or refers to processes by which cultural meanings are produced and understood. The basis of discursive practices is the insistence that discourse is action and not merely representation. In this regard, attention must be given to what is accomplished through discourse. For instance, proverbs are treated not just as bits of cultural wisdom but as resources available for use in certain situations. The emphasis will be on how are proverbs used and not what they mean or say. The key objective of discursive practices is to understand and develop techniques relevant to the analysis of meaningful behaviour in actual situations. </p> <p>The non-discursive practices refer to actions which are accompanied by knowledge. For instance, the act of going to a particular location requires a perfect or partial knowledge of the area. The third element literally refers to the place or role of physical objects in deciphering meaning. This brings about the idea of referent in the real world. Although not all words have exact referents, which is of course one of the limitations of the theoretical aspect. Other approaches in CDA are: </p> <p>          ● sociocognitive approach: centres on the socio-psychological aspect of CDA for explaining phenomena of social reality based on the triad of discourse, cognition and society;</p> <p>          ● discourse historical approach: it establishes the relationship between fields of action, genres, discourses and text, focusing on issues of nationalism and national conscientisation;</p> <p>           ● corpus-linguistics approach: a linguistic extension of CDA which deploys the use of linguistic devices for analysis;</p> <p>           ● social actors approach: a merger of sociological and linguistic theories which explains actions in order to establish social structure; and</p> <p>          ● dialectical-relational approach: focuses on social conflict in tandem with Marxist traditions and tries to detect its linguistic manifestations in discourse with interest on elements of dominance, difference and resistance. The approach holds that every social practice (productivity, means of production, social relations, social identities and cultural values and consciousness) has a semiotic element. </p> <p><strong>2.3 DISCOURSE AND SEMIOTICS</strong></p> <p> Chandler defined semiotics as ‘the study not only of what we refer to as signs in everyday speech but of anything which stands for something else’ (56). In a semiotic sense, signs take the form of words, images, sounds, gestures and objects. In discourse analysis, semiotics comes to play because every text is a semiotic element in every respect because it communicates with a target or general audience. Semiotics looks at the science of signs and symbols in relation to the meanings they express and discourse analysis shares this concern as well. In other words, discourse and semiotics are interrelated.</p> <p><strong>3.0 NOTION OF COMMUNICATION</strong></p> <p>The word <em>communication</em> was derived from the Latin word <em>communis</em> which denotes common. According to Keyton in Lunenburg, communication is ‘the process of transmitting information and common understanding from one person to another’ (25). This definition underscores the fact that unless a common understanding results from the exchange of information, there is no communication. Communication like any other skill requires practice. It is a process that requires the effective participation of all parties (elements) involved. </p> <p><strong>3.1 Basic Forms of Communication</strong></p> <p>The basic forms of communication are of two types: verbal and non-verbal communication. This could be in form of meetings, speeches or writings, gestures or expressions. </p> <p><strong>3.1.1 Non-Verbal Communication: </strong>This is a primitive or crude form of communication that does not involve the use of words. Rather, it uses mediums like gestures, cues, body movements, vocal qualities and spatial relationships to convey message(s). It is commonly used to express emotions like love, respect, dislike and unpleasantness. Non-verbal communication is less structured compared to verbal and often spontaneous. As it is not planned, sometimes it is considered more reliable because it reflects communicator’s true feelings. Also, it enhances the effectiveness of the message as gestures and body language are registered quicker and easier with a perceived than verbal communication. However, when combined with verbal communication, it is more effective and has greater impact(s).</p> <p><strong>3.1.2 Verbal Communication:</strong> This involves the arrangement of words in a structured and meaningful manner to convey a message or exchange information between communicators in spoken or written form. The spoken form (oral communication) is effective in reaching a focused target audience as it affords the speaker the opportunity of interacting with the perceived audience while the written form is suitable when trying to reach a large audience that is concentrated in a place or due to proximity challenges. On the whole, verbal communication does have significant advantages over the non-verbal communication. Perhaps, this explains why it is the most adopted form in recent times.</p> <p><strong>3.1.3 Oral Communication:</strong> This is the process of verbally transmitting information and ideas from one individual or group to another. With advances in technology, there are new forms of oral communication like video phones and video conferencing (teleconferencing). Other modern forms of oral communication include Podcasts (audio clips accessible on the internet) and Voice-over-internet Protocol (VoIP) which allows phone users to communicate over the internet and avoid telephone charges. Example is Whatsapp, Facebook, etc. Oral communication can be either formal or informal. Formal type of oral communication refers to presentations at business meetings or seminars, classroom lectures or speeches. The informal type of oral communication includes face-to-face conversations or telephone conversations. </p> <p><strong>3.1.4 Written Communication:</strong> This involves any type of message or information transfer that makes use of symbols or words (printed or handwritten). It is the most important and effective of any mode of business communication. Written communication is the opposite form oral communication. Examples of modes of written communication are proposals, lecture notes, seminar papers, postcards, brochures, press releases, memos, etc. </p> <p><strong>3.2 THEORIES OF COMMUNICATION</strong></p> <p>The term theory is a multi-faceted term as this implies that it means a number of things depending on the context. In other words, there is no exact definition of the word ‘theory’. Dixon defines theory as; </p> <p>a provisional explanatory proposition or set of propositions concerning some natural phenomena and consisting symbolic representations of the observed relationships among (measured) events, the mechanisms or structures presumed to underlie such relationships or observed data in the absence of any direct empirical manifestation of the relationships. (240)</p> <p>Similarly, Kerlinger defined theory as ‘a set of interrelated constructs (concepts), definitions and propositions that present a systematic view of phenomena by specifying relations among variables with the purpose of explaining and predicting the phenomena’ (36). In line with the definitions of the term theory, communication theory could be defined as a set of constructs linked together, relational statements consistent with each other that explains what happens in communication. A set of propositions that show the relationship between the various variables that are at work in the communication process. Theories are very important in communication because they provide a foundation upon which the practice of communication operates. Communication requires very sound theories for there to be an effective communication process. Hence, Kerlinger asserts that ‘there is nothing so practical as a sound theory’ (38).</p> <p>In communication studies, there are many theories of communication which can be collapsed into five broad types. They are: normative theories, media and culture theories, active audience theories, sense theories and behavioural theories of mass communication.</p> <p><strong>3.2.1 Normative Theories (Theories of the Press)</strong></p> <p>According to Siebert et al, (45) the normative theories ‘describe the way an ideal media system should be controlled and operated by the government, authorities, leaders and the public’. These theories are basically different from other communication theories because normative theories of press do not provide any scientific explanations or predictions. Otherwise known as the ‘four theories of the press’, these theories do not have a single source. In other words, media practitioners, social critics and academics were involved in the formulation of the normative theories. The normative theories comprise the following theories: authoritarian media theory, libertarian media theory, soviet communist media theory and social responsibility media theory. These theories will be discussed based on Siebert et al submissions.</p> <p><strong>3.2.1.1 Authoritarian Media Theory:</strong> Developed in the 16th and 17th century Europe (England), this theory stemmed from the authoritarian philosophy of Plato who thought that the state was safe only in the hands of a few wise men. It also had the backing of British academic; Thomas Hobbs who argued that the power to maintain order was sovereign and individual objections was to be ignored. It upheld the absolute power of the monarch where the state is the master. According to this theory, mass media, though not under the direct control of the state, had to follow its bidding. In other words, those who control the government have monopoly of the truth and of information approach. The media in this set up (private or public owned) worked to protect the interest of the government in power. The implication was that the media was not to publish anything that is under censorship and anyone who did otherwise was punished severely. Under an authoritarian approach in Europe, freedom of thought was jealously guarded by a few people (ruling class) , who were concerned with the emergence of a new middle class and were worried about the effects of printed matter on their thought process. Hence, steps were taken to control the freedom of expression. The result was advocacy of complete dictatorship.</p> <p><strong>3.2.1.2 Libertarian Media Theory:</strong> This theory originated in England in the 17th century and spread to America. It stemmed from enlightenment thoughts and natural rights. This theory was also informed by Milton’s idea of the self-right process of the free market place of ideas. This meant that good ideas would outlive and outwit bad ones if all ideas were guaranteed free expression. The underlying principles of the theory can be summed up as follows: </p> <p>      attacks on government, official party or political party should not be punishable,</p> <p>       no media organization should be compelled to publish anything</p> <p>        no media restriction should be placed on any legal means of eliciting information and</p> <p>   there should be no restrictions on sending or receiving messages across national frontiers.</p> <p>Apart from Milton, other exponents of this theory are John Locke, Adam Smith, Lao Tzu and John Stuart Mill. In the nutshell, the theory advocates power without social responsibility. </p> <p><strong>3.2.1.3 Soviet Communist Media Theory:</strong> This theory originated from the former USSR in the 20th century and stemmed from the ideologies of Marx and Engel that the ideas of the ruling classes are the ruling ideas. It was a modification of the authoritarian theory. The aim of the press under this system is to support the Marxist (socialist) system and ensure the sovereignty of the working class (proletariat) through the Communist party. In this scenario, the media is theoretically owned by the people but controlled by the Communist party. The media cannot criticize party objectives. Rather it propagates party them. This theory differs from the authoritarian model because the Soviet media is not subject to arbitrary and unnecessary interference of the government. The principles of this theory can be summed up thus:</p> <p>        media should serve the interest of the working class</p> <p>        media should not be privately owned</p> <p>        media should present a complete and objective view of the society and the world according to Marxist Leninist principles. </p> <p>The advocates of this theory were Karl Marx, Lenin, Stalin, Gobarchev, Castro and Mao. Meanwhile, this theory is still practiced in Communist countries like China, North Korea and Cuba. </p> <p><strong>3.2.1.4 Social Responsibility Media Theory:</strong> This theory was developed in the mid 20th century in United States of America. It stemmed from the virulent criticisms of the libertarian theory and based on the recommendations of Commission of The Freedom of Press in the US in 1949. The commission found out that the free market approach to press freedom (Libertarian Theory) had only increased the power of a single class (wealthy) and had not served the interests of the less privilege or lower class. This theory therefore, was formulated to reconcile independence with obligation to societies. It advocated some obligation on the part of the media to society. It emphasized that ownership and control of the media should be seen as a kind of stewardship; serving and promoting the interest of the public. Hence, the press should be opened to anyone who has something to say. The theory hinges on the notion that the social responsibility of the press is more important than its freedom. The essence of the theory is premiered on plurality of the press in and a duty to one’s conscience which is the primary basis of the right to free expression. </p> <p>In sum, the Soviet Communist and Social Responsibility theories were derivations of the Authoritarian and Libertarian theories respectively. Therefore, these four theories are sometimes called the ‘four-in-two press theories’. However, there are other subsequent additional theories by scholars. </p> <p><strong>3.2.2 Media and Culture Theories</strong></p> <p>Baran &amp; Davies classify the media and culture theories into the following categories: spiral of silence theory, knowledge gap theory, media dependency theory and modernization theory.</p> <p><strong>3.2.2.1 Spiral of Silence Theory:</strong> Propounded by Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann (a German political scientist), the focus of the spiral theory is on how public opinion is formed. The theory states that the media publicizes opinions that are mainstream and people adjust their opinions to avoid being isolated. It explains why people feel often feel the need to conceal their opinions, preference or views, especially when they fall within or belong to a minority group. This implies that individuals who perceive their own opinion as being accepted will express it while those who think themselves as minorities will suppress theirs. The tendency of one to speak up and the other to be silent starts off a spiral process which increasingly establishes one opinion as prevailing one. In this regard, the media which wields power can canvass popular views so that individual views in opposition of the media become unpopular.</p> <p><strong>3.2.2.2 Knowledge Gap Theory:</strong> This theory explains the distribution of knowledge in the society and the role of the mass media in this distribution. It posits that as the infusion of mass media information into a social system increases, those in the upper socio-economic class tend to acquire or access this information faster than those in the lower socio-economic class. This leads to a gap in knowledge between both classes. The propositions of this theory can be summarized thus: </p> <p>     a. people in a society exhibit great psychological differences due to socio-economic classes.</p> <p>     b. individuals with sound or more education tend to have better developed cognitive and communication skills, broader social spheres and more diverse social contacts than those with less educative irrespective of their social-economic class.</p> <p><strong>3.2.2.3 Media Dependency Theory:</strong> This theory was originally proposed by Sandra Ball- Rokeach and Melvin DeFluer in 1976. The key idea behind this theory is that audiences depend on media information to meet needs and reach goals and social institutions and media systems interact with audiences to create and imprint needs, interests and motives in them. Therefore, the more a person depends on the mass media for self fulfillment, the more important the media will be to that person. According to Rokeach and DeFluer, three media needs determine how important media is to a person at any given moment. These needs are: </p> <p>     a. the need to understand one’s social world (surveillance)</p> <p>    b. the need to act meaningfully and effectively in that world (social utility)</p> <p>    c. the need to escape from that world when tensions are high (fantasy-escape)</p> <p>Furthermore, the theory states two specific conditions under which people’s media needs and dependency are heightened. They are: (a) when the number of media and the functions of media in the society are high (e.g. as a tool for information dissemination, entertainment, escape, etc) and (b) when a society is undergoing social change like protest, uprisings, instability and conflict.</p> <p><strong>3.2.2.4 Modernization Theory:</strong> This theory looks at the effects of the modernization process on societies or human communication. It explains the changing ways of communication and media use in traditional and (post)modern societies. It is also an attempt at identifying the social variables which may contribute to social progress and development of societies. Baran &amp; Davis assert that the modernization theory has evolved in three waves: first wave, second wave and third wave. The first wave centres on the role of the mass media in economic development, literacy and cultural development and national identity development; all between the 1950s-60s. The second wave was popular in the 70s and 80s and it criticized the influence of western cultural and economic imperialism. The third was moderate in approach on international influences on emerging societies. It was prominent during the 90s. </p> <p><strong>3.2.3 Active Audience Theories</strong></p> <p>Siebert categorizes the audience theories into three sub-types: uses and gratification theory, diffusion of innovations theory and cultivation theory.</p> <p><strong>3.2.3.1 Uses and Gratification Theory (Functional Theory):</strong> Propounded by Katz, Blumler and Gurevitch in 1970, it is concerned with how people use media for gratification of their needs. The theory aligns with Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs in the sense that people choose what they want to see or read and the different media compete to satisfy each individual’s needs. According to the theory, media consumers have a free will to decide how they will use the media and how it will affect them. In general, researchers have found four kinds of gratification: information, personal identity (looking for role models), integration and social interaction and entertainment.</p> <p><strong>3.2.3.2 Diffusion of Innovations Theory (Multiple Step Flow Theory):</strong> Pioneered by Bryce Ryan and Neil Gross of Iowa University in 1943, the theory traces the process by which new idea (innovation) is communicated through certain mediums over time among members of a social system. The media and interpersonal communication are active and potent instruments in spreading information on a new idea or innovation and also influence people to adopt the innovation. Greg in Siebert (89) notes that ‘successful efforts to diffuse an innovation depend on characteristics of situation. To eliminate a deficit of awareness of an innovation, mass media channels are most appropriate’. Also opinion leaders influence the diffusion of innovation because they provide advice and information about an innovation to members of a social system. The opinion leaders have this advantage because they serve as a model for others and also support the norms of the social structure. Rogers summarizes members of the social system innovative decision as a five step that includes: </p> <p>      a. Knowledge- person becomes aware of an innovation and has some idea of how it functions,</p> <p>      b. Persuasion- person forms a favourable or unfavourable attitude towards the innovation,</p> <p>      c. Decision- person engages in activities that lead to a choice to adopt or reject the innovation,</p> <p>       d. Implementation- person puts an innovation into use and</p> <p>      e. Confirmation- person evaluates the results of an innovation-decision already made.</p> <p><strong>3.2.3.3 Cultivation Theory</strong>: This theory explains how television shapes concepts of social reality. This implies that the more people are exposed to television, the more it shapes their perception social reality and influences their conformity to what is spread by the television.          Propounded by George Gerbner et al, the theory stresses that television exerts a great tremendous influence by altering individuals’ perception of reality. Gerbner stressed that the television, among modern media, has acquired such a central place in daily life, asserting that ‘the television set has become a key member of the family, the one who tells most of the stories most of the time’ (56). It is assumed that the more time people spend watching television, the more their world-views will be like those spread by the television.</p> <p><strong>3.2.4 Sense Theories </strong></p> <p>These comprise of play theory, media richness theory, medium theory and reflective projective theory.</p> <p><strong>3.2.4.1 Play Theory</strong>: Proposed by British psychologist; William Stephenson in 1967, the theory focuses on the division of man’s activities. The basic assumption of the theory is that people are divided into work and play. Work involves serious activities while play is not too serious an activity like entertainment and relation. Stephenson explained that people use the media for play rather than work because they see it as a means of entertainment and pleasure than a means for information and improvement. He posited that the most significant function of the media is to facilitate subjective play to give people pleasure, an interlude from pressing issues that concerns them most of the time. He viewed the media as serving two basic functions. The first is to provide play, influence customs, normalize manners and give people something to talk about while the second function is to help shake up society.</p> <p><strong>3.2.4.2 Reflective Projective Theory:</strong> This posits that the media is the ‘mirror of the society’. The theory explains that though the media mirrors society, the mirror they present is an ambiguous one. The media reflect society as an organized group while the audience or members project their own individual reflections into the images presented. For instance, people get different satisfaction from the same programme watched on television as a result of their attitude, sex, mood, experience and ethnic differences. The overall implication of the media as a mirror is that the media has the ability to form or make somebody into nobody and otherwise.</p> <p><strong>3.2.4.3 Medium Theory:</strong> Postulated by Marshal McLuhan, the theory focuses on the characteristics of each medium that make it physically, socially and psychologically different from each other. It also examines how communication through a particular medium affects face-to-face interactions. This theory was borne out from McLuhan’s challenge of conventional definitions by claiming that the medium is the message. With this claim, he stressed how channels differ not only in terms of their content but also in regard to how they awaken thoughts and senses. He distinguished the media by the cognitive processes each requires. Thus, the medium theory looks at the relationship between human senses that are required to use a medium and the structure (face interaction, visual, etc) of the medium itself. </p> <p><strong>3.2.4.4 Media Richness Theory:</strong> The pioneers of this theory are Daft and Lengel in 1984 and it is based on the Contingency theory and Information Processing Theory. The theory posits that the effectiveness of communication is based on the effectiveness of the media used to relay the message. In other words, the richer the media; the nearer the top of the continuum. Daft and Lengel presented a richness hierarchy which incorporates four media classifications: face-to-face, telephone, addressed documents and unaddressed documents.</p> <p><strong>3.3 The Communication Process</strong></p> <p>Human beings are neither passive nor predictable in terms of interpreting meanings and reacting in a specified way. Also, communication is not a passive or predictable one way event. Rather, it could be viewed as an active process influenced by all the complexities and ambiguities of human behaviour. It is also fraught with potential points of breakdown. Clampitt in Dixon notes ‘we actively construct meanings within a unique vortex that includes the words used, the context of the utterances and the people involved’ (238). It is more simplistic to look at the communication process as a cyclic process where information is generated from an element and transferred to another element through a medium with corresponding effects in terms of a feedback. On the contrary, there would be no communication process without the role of key elements like the sender, message, medium, receiver, feedback, context and noise. Dixon argues that ‘many models have been developed to simplify and summarize the complex reality of the communication process and to aid our understanding. Some of these are helpful but all have their shortcomings’ (239). To solve this conundrum, she adopts Clampitt communication model which is presented below.</p><p> </p> <p> </p> <div> <p>Decode</p> <p><strong>Receiver</strong></p> <p>encode</p> </div><p>    </p>\n\nDISCOURSE AND COMMUNICATION: A COMPARATIVE STUDY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DISCOURSE AND COMMUNICATION: A COMPARATIVE STUDY", "id": 133}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p>In the wake of a revolutionary change of interest from language form to language function, attention of many language scholars have been shifted from the structural pattern of language to the function the language is used to perform in social discourses. The present study is one of such endeavours, and essentially explored the fields of Discourse and Stylistics by pointing out their different, but related, methods of text analysis. A brief analysis of an excerpt of President Muhammadu Buhari’s Democracy Day Speech of 29th May, 2015 revealed that Discourse investigates more and reproduces more meaning from a textthan Stylistics. Stylistics is only a tool used in Discourse.</p> <p><strong>1.0.            </strong><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>Prior to the advent of Discourse Analysis and Stylistics, the preoccupation of many linguists was basically the study of the structural pattern and form of language without much regard for the context and other features that shape meaning. Over the years however, the attention of language scholars has been shifted from language form to language function. Consequently, many scholars in humanities and social sciences have become keenly interested in the study of Discourse and Stylistics (Olateju 7).</p> <p>Discourse and Stylistics are two different but closely related linguistic disciplines that are inseparable. The relationship between them can be likened to the proverbial controversy in the actual maternity of the hen and the egg. This is because it is very difficult to draw a line of demarcation between Discourse and Stylistics. While on the one hand, there is hardly any exercise on Discourse without a bit of Stylistic input, Discourse,on the other hand, “is broader in its analysis (Aziz n.pag).While Discourse is essentially communication, Stylistics on the other hand is concerned with the study of the pattern and style of what is communicated. In this study, we shall attempt to discuss Discourse and Stylistics and explore the various ways each of them approach analysis of a given text. To do this properly, we shall analyze paragraph five of President Muhammadu Buhari’s Democracy Day Speech on 29th May, 2016 to reveal thelevels or methods of text analysis in Discourse and Stylistics.</p> <p><strong>2.0.            </strong><strong>What is Discourse?</strong></p> <p>The word 'discourse' comes from Latin '<em>discursus</em>' which denotes 'conversation, speech'(Taiwo 14). According to Johnstone, it is “actual instances ofcommunication in the medium of language” (2). Discourse is a discipline that has no stable definition. This is because so many scholars have given varied definitions to it based on their views of the subject matter. The common definition is given by Stubbs. He describes Discourse as “language above the sentence or above the clause” (1). Discourse is meaning communicated far above what is said. The study of Discourse is indeed the “study of many aspects of language use (Fasold 65). Discourse is essentially the study of language in use.</p> <p>The term Discourse was first used by Zellig Harris in a paper he presented in 1952.As a structural linguist, he did not use Discourse in the sense that is commonly used now. He used it only as a sequence of utterances. It was in the late 1960s that scholars began to use the term as an approach to the study of social interaction. (Taiwo 16). Discourse was fully developed in the 1970s as a critique of cognitive process in communication. It is based on the notion that language needs a context for it to function properly. Thus, it becomes very impossible to understand the linguistic items used in discourse without a context (Ahmad 1).</p> <p>Discourse is viewed as social performance or a social action. It is a relative social phenomenon that depends solely on wide range of disciplines, such as Psychology, Anthropology, Philosophy, Anthropological Linguistics, Sociology, Cognitive and Social Psychology. This fact is corroborated by Fairclough when he opines that “Discourse constitutes the social. Three dimensions of the social are distinguished- knowledge, social relations, and social identity-and these correspond respectively to three major functions of language” (8).</p> <p>Discourse, viewed from the linguistic perspective, is, in turn, composed of a wide range of disciplines, such as Stylistics, Pragmatics, Conversational Analysis and Speech Act Theory (Ahmad 2).</p> <p><strong>2.1.            </strong><strong>Discourse, Discourse Analysis and Critical Discourse Analysis</strong></p> <p>Discourse, Discourse Analysis and Critical Discourse Analysis could be described as a three- in-one discipline mostly used interchangeably especially by non linguists. Discourse is not the same as Discourse Analysis. While Discourse is communication, Discourse Analysis on the other hand is a way of analysing communication (Aziz n.pag). When the analysis of a particular discourse aims at exposing the covert ideology embedded in such a discourse, it can then be said to be at the domain of Critical Discourse Analysis. To put it very simple, when Discourse Analysis becomes more critical (when the hearer or reader uses all linguistic features available in the said to generate meaning of the unsaid in a manner that exposes power and abuse of power, dominance, inequality and invested ideologies) , it becomes Critical Discourse Analysis.Generally speaking, every discourse is structured by dominance and the dominant structures are legitimated by the ideologies of powerful groups (Wodak and Meyer 3).</p> <p>Discourse Analysis basically studies and examines how an addresser structures his linguistic messages for the addressee and how the addressee in turn uses some linguistic cues to interpret them (the messages) (Brown and Yule qtd. in Taiwo 15).</p> <p>Social context plays a vital role in generating meaning in a discourse. In fact, it determines the meaning that is to be communicated. Similarly, certain contextual features equally shape the language people use. These are: the interlocutors themselves, their discourse roles and the physical environment of the discourse, the worldview and cultural practices in the domain of the discourse. Discourse Analysis considers language,used together with the aforementioned features, to determine meaning. Discourse Analysis thus generates data for analysis based on the observation and the intuition of the language users. This is why Taiwo believes that a discourse analyst can analyze virtually every conversation, like “(casual, telephone, gossip, <em>etc</em>), speeches (campaigns, formal speeches delivered by political figures, <em>etc</em>), written discourse (novels, plays, news, written speeches, editorials, <em>etc</em>)” (15).</p> <p>Discourse analysis picks up from where stylistics stops. The tasking questions discourse often asks are: What makes the speaker or writer use language the way he or she does? How does the hearer or reader interpret what the speaker or writer says or writes? Of course, this is where discourse shares a common boundary with Pragmatics. Indeed, the speaker or writer has total control of the choice of words to use but he or she certainly does not have control of the meaning the listener or speaker would derive from what is said or written (Aziz n.pag). </p> <p><strong>2.2.            </strong><strong>Basic Concepts in Discourse</strong></p> <p><strong>•Text</strong></p> <p>In Discourse, text simply means any instance of language in use. This comprises not only written language but also spoken language. A text could be as small as a word or sentence and could also be as large as a paragraph (Aziz n. pag). A text could equally be a whole chapter, a news item or a conversation. For a piece to be qualified as a text, Halliday and Hassan believe, it must form a “unified whole”(1). When that happens, it can then be regarded as a semantic unit. </p> <p>A text is meant to have a texture. Texture, as used here, is the parameter that distinguishes a text from something that is not a text. Information in a text flows within and among sentences through the interplay of coherence and cohesion.</p> <p><strong>•Coherence and Cohesion </strong></p> <p>Coherence concerns with sense in a text. That is to say that when a text makes sense to a reader or a hearer, it is said to be coherent (Osisanwoqtd. in Ogunsiji 48). Cohesion on the other hand is a Latin word for “striking together” (Stern qtd. in Ogunsiji 48). It is a term in Discourse that relates to how texts are held together lexically and grammatically as a whole. A text without cohesion is only a disjointed speech which may not generate any meaning. The following examples can be used to illustrate coherence and cohesion:</p> <p>1.      Mr. Oko slapped his wife. His wife did not cook for him. (Coherent but not cohesive).</p> <p>2.      Mr. Oko slapped his wife because she did not cook for him. (Coherent and cohesive).</p> <p>Note: The conjunction “because” and the pronouns “she” and “him” in the second text are cohesive ties or devices employed to enhance coherence and cohesion in the text. They are conjunctive cohesion and referential cohesion respectively.</p> <p>3.      Mr. Oko slapped his wife because South Sudan is the newest African country.(Not coherent but cohesive).</p> <p>4.      Mr. Oko slapped his wife. South Sudan is the newest African country. (Not coherent and not cohesive).</p> <p><strong>•Coherence in Discourse</strong></p> <p>Coherence in a discourse manifestsby the extent to which a particularinstance of language in use is able to match a shared belief, knowledge and social conventions of interlocutors in a social context. Unlike cohesion which establishes the linguistic connectivity of sentences and utterances using cohesive ties, coherence in discourse relates basically to the establishment of some relationships between utterances through an interpretation of illocutionary acts. There is an obvious manifestation of coherence in the following conversation between two interlocutors:</p> <p>Speaker A:                        Sir, the visitors from Daura are already waiting at the</p> <p>reception.</p> <p>Speaker B:                         I’m taking my lunch.</p> <p>Speaker A:                        It’s alright Your Excellency.</p> <p>The discourse above can be interpreted vis- a- vis the social conventions of interaction which include:</p> <p>Speaker A requests speaker B to perform an action.</p> <p>Speaker B gives the reason why he cannot comply.</p> <p>Speaker A understands and proceeds to perform a legitimate action (his duty).</p> <p> It is discovered that there are no cohesive ties in the above discourse but the needed cues to identify coherence are conventional structures of interaction, and this is a shared understanding by the interlocutors.That is the crux of coherence in discourse.</p> <p><strong>•Context</strong></p> <p>Context is a set of facts that surrounds a particular situation. Viewed from the angle of linguistics, context means everything that surrounds the production and reception of a piece of communication.According to van Dijk,“context is subjective mental model of communicative situation” (n. pag).Communication is better understood in context. Taiwo corroborates this fact in his explanation of context and its features which include:</p> <p>the physical situation in which the communication takes place, the interactants or interlocutors, the knowledge of the communicators of their cultural norms and expected behaviour, and the expressions that precede and follow a particular expression. All these features of context help language speakers to interpret meaning appropriately.(19)</p> <p>Discourse dwells so much on the context of language use in social setting.</p> <p><strong>3.0.            </strong><strong>What is Stylistics?</strong></p> <p>Stylistics, in a simple sense, refers to the study of style and pattern of use by a writer or a speaker. It is the identification of patterns of usage in speech and writing (Ahmad 2).  According to Ogunsiji, “Stylistics is also defined as a study of the different styles that are present in either a given utterance or a written text or document” (2).It is a term that is mostly associated with the literary genre but modern linguistic exercises have clearly shown that there is much of stylistic analysis to be done on non literary texts as is done on literary texts. A literary genre can be seenas style characteristics that is collectively recognized and agreed upon. Some of the aspects of literary stylistics include the use of dialogue, the description of scenes, the use of active and passive voice and the distribution of the sentence length (Ahmad 2).</p> <p>Stylistics primarily attempts to explain the principles that informed the choices made by communicators which clearly manifests in their use of language. This is skillfullyunraveled by the reader or writer by studying the style of the initiator of the communication (writer or speaker). Style on its own is aptly described by Lucas as “the effective use of language, especially in prose, whether to make statements or to rouse emotions. It involves first of all the power to put fact with clarity and brevity” (9).The study of style is central to stylistics. It is a selection and arrangement of linguistic features which are open to choice- a choice of words and expression by a particular person in a particular situation. One major concern of stylistics is the investigation into the continuous and consistent appearance of certain structures, items and elements in a speech utterance or in a given text. Thus, when a text is replete with some certain recurring predominant words or expressions, a stylistician becomes more interested in his investigation. Stylistics is particularly important because it enhances and maximizes our enjoyment of a text.</p> <p>The relevance of stylistics can never be over emphasized. It is a technique used to explicate both linguistic and non linguistic text by objectively defining what an author does in his use of language. A stylistic analysis of a text in most cases reveals the good and or the bad qualities of a writing or speech.</p> <p><strong>3.1.            </strong><strong>Nature of Stylistics</strong></p> <p>Stylistics, according to Ogunsiji, is a “borderline discipline between language and literature”(9).  This is because it focuses on language use in both literary and non literary text.</p> <p>Stylistics, like Discourse, is multidisciplinary in nature, even though it has its own focus. It draws insights from disciplines such as Literature, Psychology, Sociology, Philosophy, and so on.</p> <p>As earlier explained, Stylistics, majorly, is the study of style of a text. It looks at style in so many dimensions. They include:</p> <p><strong>•Style as Choice</strong>: This considers style as a choice the speaker or writer makes in a text that ultimately makes his utterance or text to stand out. It becomes the responsibility of the stylistician to identify such a style in his (stylistician) analysis.</p> <p><strong>•Style as Deviation</strong>:</p> <p>What does not conform to a certain standard could be a style to a writer or speaker. This is mostly noticed in poetry where the poet has the poetic license to deviate from an acceptable norm to use language in a way that pleases him.</p> <p><strong>•Style as Situation</strong>: A style could be adopted by a speaker or writer based on the situation in question. A text comes to life through the context or situation. This could be physical, socio-cultural or pragmatic.  </p> <p><strong>•Style as the Individual</strong>: There are specific features that are associated with a particular speaker or writer due to his choice of style. That becomes his ideolets. A speaker or writer stands recognized basically due to his style.</p> <p><strong>•Style as Time/ Era</strong>: This has to do with time relevance of a style. It deals with whether a particular style is in vogue or obsolete; whether it is ancient or modern. It is the task of the stylistician to point this out.</p> <p><strong>3.2.            </strong><strong>Text Analysis in Stylistics</strong></p> <p>The focus of Stylistics is the text. In analyzing a text, the business of a stylistician is to look at many features of the text. Stylistic features like graphology, syntax, lexis and semantics are looked into. These are discussed under the following captions</p> <p><strong>•Graphological Features </strong></p> <p>This concerns the physical appearance of a text. The primary focus here is foregrounding. That is an act of bringing to fore, certain words to give them prominence. This can be identified by looking at words in italics, capital letters, bold letters, words that are underlined, and so on. The use of punctuation marks can equally create stylistic effects. It is the task of the stylistician to explore and give description of these graphological features in a text.</p> <p><strong>•Syntactic Features:</strong></p> <p>The focus here is on sentence types and the effect they create in a text. A text may contain a combination of simple, complex, compound and compound complex sentences or just simple sentences. Aspects of ellipsis, parataxis, hypotaxis, right and left- branching sentences are equally considered significant here (Ogunsiji 11).For example, a dislocation in syntax of a text could mean the dislocation in human thoughts. James Joyce’s novels are replete with this style.</p> <p><strong>•Lexico- Semantic Features</strong>:</p> <p>In any stylistic exercise, attention is specially given to words. This is because words may be used by the speaker or writer to produce connotative, denotative, associative, collocative, affective, thematic, idiomatic and even stylistic meanings. The stylistician watches out for the various meanings conveyed by the use of such words.</p> <p><strong>4.0.            </strong><strong>Discourse and Stylistics: Methods of Analysis</strong></p> <p>Discourse and Stylistics are two linguistic disciplines that are analyzed using different methods and tools. The text is the object of analysis for boththe discourse analyst and the stylistician. One noticeable difference however is the manner in which they approach their analysis. In fact, a close study of the two methods of analysis shows that Discourse begins from where Stylistics stops. In this section, we shall attempt analyses of an excerpt from President Muhammadu Buhari’s Democracy Day Broadcast on 29th May, 2016 from both the angle of Discourse and Stylistics in order to point out the slim line of demarcation between them.</p> <p><strong>•Analysis of President Muhammadu Buhari’s Democracy Day Speech</strong></p> <p><strong>Paragraph eight:</strong></p> <p><em>From day one, we purposely set out to correct our condition, to change Nigeria. We reinforced and galvanized our armed forces with new leadership and resources. We marshaled our neighbours in a joint task force to tackle and defeat Boko Haram. By the end of December 2015, all but pockets and remnants had been routed by our gallant armed forces. Our immediate focus is for a gradual and safe return of internally displaced persons in safety and dignity and for the resumption of normalcy in the lives of people living in these areas.</em></p> <p><strong>4.1.            </strong><strong>Stylistic Analysis:</strong></p> <p>In doing a stylistic analysis of the above text, certain linguistic features such as graphology, semantics and lexis will be explored.</p> <p><strong>•<em>Graphological Features</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Foregrounding </strong>is one predominant feature used in this paragraph by the speaker which is realized through a particular lexical item. For example, the first person plural pronoun <strong><em>“we”</em></strong> as used in the paragraph is a foreground. It is repeated three times in the paragraph. This is used to show that the achievement recorded so far in area of security is a collective effort by both the government and other well meaning Nigerians.</p> <p><strong>Parallelism</strong> is one vital stylistic device that is equally used to reiterate and emphasize the idea of collectiveness. The speaker willfully uses the word “<strong><em>we</em></strong>” to begin both sentence 1 and 2 to further emphasize this.</p> <p><strong>•Syntactic Features</strong></p> <p>The paragraph contains five sentences with about ninety three words. All but the last sentence are simple sentences. This is a device used to enhance audience comprehension, considering the reality of the time. Of course, this was a time many Nigerians were becoming impatient with the government which had earlier promised a change in the status quo in governance. The speaker was obviously aware of this and therefore skillfully set out to use simple sentences for everyone to understand very quickly and feel, without difficulties, what the government has been able to achieve in one year.</p> <p>One other device used in this paragraph is parataxis, which is an act of placing togethercohesive clauses without an intervening conjunction or connective words to achieve coherence. For example:</p> <p><em>From day one, we purposely set out to correct our condition, to change Nigeria. We reinforced and galvanized our armed forces with new leadership and resources. We marshaled our neighbours in a joint task force to tackle and defeat Boko Haram.</em></p> <p>The use of linking words like “Therefore” and “Also” to begin the second and third sentences respectively would have, possibly, been used by the speaker. His style becomes obvious by not using such linking words to tie up the three sentences which are seen to be cohesive but not coherent.</p> <p>In the paragraph, there are words that are intentionally omitted by the speaker and yet the meaning is communicated. This device, which is called ellipsis, shall be discussed in detail under discourse analysis.</p> <p><strong>•<em>Lexico- Semantic Features</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Collocation</strong>: A close study of this paragraph shows that the speaker chooses his words to collocate. This points out the meaning conveyed in the paragraph. </p> <p>Examples:</p> <p>“<em>correct</em>” and  “<em>condition</em>” (Sentence 1).</p> <p>“<em>reinforced, galvanized</em>” and  “<em>armed forces</em>” (Sentence 2).</p> <p>“<em>tackle”</em> and “<em>Boko Haram</em>” (Sentence 3).</p> <p>“<em>resumption</em>” and “<em>normalcy”</em> (Sentence 5).</p> <p>From the above collocativewords, it can be deduced that there was a problem (represented as “<em>condition”</em>) that was solved (<em>corrected</em>) through the deployment (reinforcement and galvanizing) of the armed forces. The problem was “<em>Boko Haram</em>” that was “<em>tackled</em>”, thereby restoring (<em>resumption of</em>) normalcy to the nation.The meaning of the paragraph becomes so glaring due to the deployment of collocation.</p> <p><strong>Connotation</strong>: Also, the use of words like “<em>correct”</em>, “<em>change</em>”, “<em>reinforced”</em>, “<em>galvanized</em>”, “<em>marshaled</em>”, “<em>defeat</em>”, “<em>routed”</em>, “<em>gallant”</em>is highly connotative. They are military terms that show action. They remind the hearer of the military era. In fact, those words connote action put up by the government to end insurgency.</p> <p><strong>4.2. Discourse Analysis:</strong></p> <p><strong>•<em>Cohesion and Coherence</em></strong></p> <p>In doing a discourse analysis of the paragraph, we shall first investigate if the paragraph passes the test of coherence and cohesion. A cursory glance at the sentences shows that they are coherent.Though there is no explicit lexical cohesion, the paragraph is however tied up by grammatical cohesion. Related ideas and thoughts are connected and tied up in such a manner that the entire paragraph presents a unified wholemessage. Sentence 1 establishes a point and the rest of the sentences develop and build upon it. There is a linear progression of ideas from beginning of the paragraph to the end, and that essentially brings out the beauty of cohesion. This ultimately explains government’s efforts in tackling insurgency, beginning from 29th May, 2015 to 29th May, 2016 (the day the speech was delivered).This exercise is, of course, a major preoccupation of discourse.</p> <p><strong>•<em>Ellipsis</em></strong></p> <p>Omission of some words and phrases is obviously intentional. Examples of ellipsis as used in the paragraph are:</p> <p>1.      <em>From day one, we purposely set out to correct our condition,[…..] to change Nigeria</em> (Sentence 1).</p> <p>The phrase, <strong><em>“</em></strong><em>that is”</em> is intentionally omitted, obviously to create certain effects on the hearer. This means that <em>“to correct our condition”</em> as used in the sentence means <em>“to change Nigeria.”</em></p> <p><em>2.      </em><em>By the end of December 2015, all but pockets and remnants </em>[…..]<em> had been routed by our gallant armed forces</em>(Sentence 4).</p> <p>There is equally a willful omission of <em>“of Boko Haram”</em> in the fourth sentence. This device is used here to avoid undue repetition.</p> <p><strong>•<em>Reference</em></strong></p> <p>There is the use of anaphoric reference in the paragraph. Anaphoric reference draws the attention of hearer or reader to a preceding text. In this case, <em>“all”</em> in sentence 4 refers to Boko Haram mentioned in the preceding sentence </p> <p><strong>•<em>Revelation of Power and Ideology</em></strong></p> <p>The choice of words and tone of the speaker obviously unearths power and ideology. Such words as: “<em>correct”</em>, “<em>change</em>”, “<em>reinforced”</em>, “<em>galvanized</em>”, “<em>marshaled</em>”, “<em>defeat</em>”, “<em>routed”</em>, “<em>gallant”</em> connote militarist ideology of the speaker. This portrays power and essentially unveils the opaque ideology hidden in the speech. There is no gainsaying the fact that President Muhammadu Buhari has a military background, and that ultimately reflects in his choice of words.</p> <p><strong>5.0.            </strong><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>Discourse and Stylistics are linguistic disciplines that analyze text in an attempt to establish principles in explaining the particular choices made by individuals and social groups in their use of language(Ahmad 2) which,by extension, produces and reproduces meaning.Though it is a herculean task in trying to locate a demarcating line between the two disciplines, it has been discovered that they approach the analysis of a text with different,but similar, methods. While a discourse analyst approaches his analysis by looking for such things as the textuality, coherence and cohesive interplay of the text which by extension could reveal ideology and power inherent in a discourse, the stylistician on the other hand analyzes the style and pattern of language use in a text. Discourse is concerned with language in use, analysis of language in social, political, religious and cultural contexts, Conversational Analysis, Speech Acts, Co-operative Principles and so on. In a nutshell, Discourse relies so much on various other disciplines. Stylistics’ major concern is the idea of style and what informs the choice of such style. One common denominator between Discourse and Stylistics is that both have text as the object of analysis. </p> <p><strong>Works Cited</strong></p> <p>Ahmad, Zulfiqar. “Stylistics and Discourse Analysis: A Contribution in</p> <p>Analysing Literature.”<em>Academy of the Punjab in North America</em>.Web.</p> <p>20 June 2016.</p> <p>Aziz, Taofik. “ENG 706: Discourse Analysis”.

With the seeming differences between these fields, there exist a lot of relationships that connect the three areas of study together. This study is an attempt to examine the similarities in relationships between discourse, pragmatics and stylistics in their interpretation of language in communication. The methodology adopted is a descriptive/library research. Findings from the study reveal that discourse, pragmatics and stylistics are different but inter-related fields that share a lot of relationships in language analysis even though their goals and methods of analyzing language are different.</em></p> <p><strong>1.0.            </strong><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>The concern of linguists before the advent of Discourse Analysis, Pragmatics and Stylistics, was basically to study the structural pattern and form of language without much regard for the context and other features that shape meaning.According to Olateju (7), much later, however,‘the attention of language scholars was shiftedfrom language form to language function. Consequently, many scholars in humanities and social sciences became keenly interested in the study of Discourse, <em>Pragmatics</em> and Stylistics’ (italics mine).</p> <p>Discourse, Pragmatics and Stylistics are different but closely related linguistic disciplines that are inseparable. There is as much relationship between them as there are differences in their linguistic approach to interpreting meaning. It is,sometimes, not easy to draw a line of demarcation between Discourse, Pragmatics and Stylistics asthere is hardly any exercise on Discourse without a bit of Pragmatic or Stylistic input. However, Discourse is much broader in its analysis than the other two disciplines.While Discourse is essentially communication; Stylistics is concerned with the study of the pattern and style of what is communicated; while Pragmatics examineswhat is being communicated from the speaker-intended meaning. This study is an attemptto discuss the intricate relationship between Discourse, Pragmatics and Stylistics in order to examine the differentways they each approach linguistic meaning. </p> <p><strong>2.0.            </strong><strong>An Overview of Discourse</strong></p> <p>Discourse is a discipline that has no stable definition. This is because a lot of scholars have </p> <p>given varied definitions to it based on their views of the subject matter. The common definition is given by Stubbs. He describes Discourse as ‘language above the sentence or above the clause’ (1). According to Johnstone, it is ‘actual instances ofcommunication in the medium of language’ (2). Discourse is meaning communicated far above what is said. The study of Discourse is indeed the “study of many aspects of language use (Fasold 65). Discourse is essentially the study of language in use.</p> <p>The word 'discourse' is from the Latin '<em>discursus</em>' which denotes 'conversation, speech' (Taiwo 14).The term Discourse was first used by Zellig Harris in a paper he presented in 1952.As a structural linguist, he did not use Discourse in the sense that it is commonly used today. He used it only as a sequence of utterances. It was in the late 1960s that scholars began to use the term as an approach to the study of social interaction. (Taiwo 16). Discourse was fully developed in the 1970s as a critique of cognitive process in communication. It is based on the notion that language needs a context to function properly. Thus, ‘it becomes very impossible to understand the linguistic items used in discourse without a context’ (Ahmad 1).</p> <p>Discourse is viewed as a social performance or a social action. It is a relative social phenomenon that depends solely on a wide range of disciplines, such as Psychology, Anthropology, Philosophy, Anthropological Linguistics, Sociology, Cognitive and Social Psychology. Fairclough corroborated this idea when he opines that ‘Discourse constitutes the social. Three dimensions of the social are distinguished- knowledge, social relations, and social identity-and these correspond respectively to three major functions of language’(8). When viewed from the linguistic perspective, ‘discourse is composed of a wide range of disciplines, such as Stylistics, Pragmatics, Conversational Analysis and Speech Act Theory’ (Ahmad 2).</p> <p>There is a relationship between Discourse, Discourse Analysis and Critical Discourse Analysis as they could be described as a three- in-one discipline mostly used interchangeably and sometimes, erroneously especially by non-linguists. Discourse is not the same as Discourse Analysis. While Discourse is communication, Discourse Analysis is a way of analysing communication (Aziz n.pag). When the analysis of a particular discourse aims at exposing the covert ideology embedded in such a discourse, it can then be said to be at the domain of Critical Discourse Analysis. To put it very simple, when Discourse Analysis becomes more critical (when the hearer or reader uses all linguistic features available to generate meaning of the unsaid in a manner that exposes power and abuse of power, dominance, inequality and invested ideologies), it becomes Critical Discourse Analysis.Generally speaking, ‘every discourse is structured by dominance and the dominant structures are legitimated by the ideologies of powerful groups’ (Wodak and Meyer 3).</p> <p>Discourse Analysis basically ‘studies and examines how an addresser structures his linguistic messages for the addressee and how the addressee in turn uses some linguistic cues to interpret the messages’ (Brown and Yule in Taiwo 15).Social context plays a vital role in generating meaning in a discourse. In fact, it determines the meaning that is to be communicated. Similarly, certain contextual features equally shape the language people use. These are: the interlocutors themselves, their discourse roles and the physical environment of the discourse, the worldview and cultural practices in the domain of the discourse. Discourse Analysis considers language,used together with the aforementioned features, to determine meaning. Discourse Analysis thus generates data for analysis based on the observation and the intuition of the language users. This is why Taiwo believes that a discourse analyst can analyze virtually every conversation, like ‘(casual, telephone, gossip, <em>etc</em>), speeches (campaigns, formal speeches delivered by political figures, <em>etc</em>), written discourse (novels, plays, news, written speeches, editorials, <em>etc</em>)’ (15). This observation by Taiwo above makes discourse analysis to relate with other linguistic branches like Stylistics and Pragmatics which examine meaning in these communication media. To understand this relationship between discourse and these linguistic branches, it is imperative to understand what stylistics and pragmatics are concerned about.</p> <p><strong>2.1 The Nature of Pragmatics</strong></p> <p>Adrian Akmajian conceives of pragmatics as a term that ‘covers the study of language use, and in particular the study of linguistic communication, in relation to language structure and context of utterance.’ (361)When Charles Morris proposed his famous trichotomy of syntax, semantics and pragmatics, he defined the last as ‘the study of the relation of signs to interpreters’ (6). But he soon generalized this to ‘the relation of signs to their users’ (29). What this implies is that pragmatics interprets meaning from the angle of the speaker (i.e. speaker-intended meaning).</p> <p>Norrick (4) conceives of pragmatics as the study of the context-dependent aspects of meaning which are systematically abstracted away from in the construction of logical form. In the semiotic trichotomy developed by Morris, Carnap, and Peirce in the 1930’s, syntax addresses the formal relations of signs to one another, semantics the relation of signs to what they denote, and pragmatics the relation of signs to their users and interpreters.</p> <p>According to Wolfram and Norrick (2), even though its roots can be traced back to early classical traditions of rhetoric and stylistics, to Immanuel Kant’s conception of pragmatics as empirical and purposive and to William James, who pointed out its practical nature, modern pragmatics is a fairly recent discipline. Its inauguration as an independent field of study within semiotics took place early in the 20th Century by C. Morris, R. Carnap and ultimately C.S. Peirce. The classic division between syntax, semantics, and pragmatics goes back to Morris, who distinguished three separate “dimensions of semiosis” within his science of signs. </p> <p>There were and are differences of opinions on where exactly to draw the line between semantics and pragmatics. Some thirty years elapsed before pragmatics finally made its way into modern linguistics in the late 1960s, when linguists began to explore the performance phenomena. To this end, they adopted ideas developed and advanced by L. Wittgenstein, G. Ryle, P. Strawson, J.L. Austin and other eminent (ordinary or natural) language philosophers. It seems safe to claim that the ensuing ‘pragmaticturn’was most notably induced by J.L. Austin, J.R. Searle and H.P. Grice, who were interested in utterancemeaningrather than sentence or word meaning, i.e. in studying unique historical events created by actual speakers to perform linguistic acts in actual situational contexts in order to accomplish specific goals. </p> <p>Other scientific movements that nourished pragmatics include anthropology (B. Malinowski, P. Wegener, A. Gardiner), contextualism (J.R. Firth), functionalism (K. Buhler, R. Jakobson, D. Hymes), ethnomethodology (H. Garfinkel, E. Goffman, H. Sacks) and European sociology (J. Habermas). Since the pragmatic turn, pragmatics has developed more rapidly and diversely as a linguistic discipline. Since the 1970s, the early Anglo-American framework of pragmatic-linguistic study has been immensely expanded and enhanced by research in Continental Europe and elsewhere. With historiographic hindsight, it can be seen that the broadening, i.e. the interdisciplinary expansion, of the field of pragmatics has been a cumulative process; the broader conception of pragmatics chronologically (and causally) followed the narrower one.</p> <p>Despite its scientific acclaim, the notion of pragmaticsremains somewhat enigmatic and is still difficult to define. This holds for its readings in everyday discourse as well as in scholarly contexts. Nonetheless, when people refer to attitudes and modes of behaviour as pragmatic, they mean that they have a factual kind of orientation in common. People who act pragmatically or take a pragmatic perspective generally have a preference for a practical, matter of fact and realistic rather than a theoretical, speculative and idealistic way of approaching imminent problems and handling everyday affairs. To put it differently, they share a concrete, situation-dependent approach geared to action and usage rather than an abstract, situation-independent and system-related point of view. To assume a pragmatic stance in everyday social encounters as well as in political, historical and related kinds of discourse, means to handle the related affairs in a goal-directed and object-directed, common-sense and down to earth kind of way. Such an understanding of pragmaticsas an attitude in non-scientific discourse has obviously left its traces on the scientific definitions of the term. By and large, one can say that in semiotics and philosophy, ‘pragmaticscharacterizes those theoretical and methodological approaches that are oriented toward use and context rather than toward some system, and that they regard use and context as creating a high degree of analytical surplus’ (Wolfram and Norrick 2).</p> <p>While essentially the same is true for linguistics in general, there is no commonly accepted definition of pragmaticsin linguistics which would refer to a single, unified and homogeneous field of study. In contemporary linguistics, scholars can identify a narrow and a broad way of delineating pragmatics (of which the former is sometimes allocated to an “Anglo-American” and the latter to a “Continental [European]” tradition of pragmatics, (Huang xi). According to the narrow view, Wolfram and Norrick (2) observe that pragmatics is understood as ‘the systematic investigation of what and how people mean when they use language as a vehicle of action in a particular context and with a particular goal in mind.’ Thus, the context-dependency of utterance meaning is the central component of more narrowly defined accounts of pragmatics, which focus on a few key issues that can be juxtaposed with related issues in other modules of language theory such as grammar and semantics. Those issues include ‘indexicality/deixis (versus anaphora), presuppositions, implicatures (versus entailments) and speech acts (versus types of sentences), to name only the most conspicuous topics’ (Wolfram and Norrick 4).</p> <p>According to Wolfram and Norrick (4), in a much broader point of view, pragmatics is ‘the scientific study of all aspects of linguistic behaviour. In particular, pragmatics includes patterns of linguistic actions, language functions, types of inferences, principles of communication, frames of knowledge, attitude and belief, as well as organizational principles of text and discourse’. Wolfram (3) summarizes the thrust of pragmatics as ‘a discipline which deals with meaning-in-context, which for analytical purposes can be viewed from different perspectives (that of the speaker, the recipient, the analyst, etc.). It bridges the gap between the system side of language and the use side, and relates both of them at the same time.’</p> <p>Many considerations come to mind when trying to examine the scope of pragmatics. First is the definition of pragmatics by Yule which has a four dimensional approach. He sees pragmatics as ‘the study of speaker meaning, contextual meaning, how more gets communicated than is said, and the study of the expression of relative distance.’(3)  By this definition, he has accounted in a way for the scope of this discipline. According to Osisanwo (26), the second definition has to do with our own views of the scope of pragmatics which include:</p> <p>-          The message being communicated</p> <p>-          The participants involved in the message</p> <p>-          The knowledge of the world which they share</p> <p>-          The deductions to be made from the text on the basis of the context</p> <p>-          The implications of what is said or what is left unsaid</p> <p>-          The impact of the non-verbal aspect of interaction on meaning.</p> <p>Osisanwo went ahead to state that the goals of pragmatics can be understood if we frame the following questions bearing in mind that pragmatics has been said to be the study of language in use in a particular context or situation.</p> <p>-          How do utterances convey meaning?</p> <p>-          What are the roles of context in encoding and decoding messages in an utterance?</p> <p>-          How do interlocutors respond to messages and meaning?</p> <p>-          What are the causes of wrong message encoding?</p> <p>-          What are the causes of wrong message decoding?</p> <p>From the above points, if there are the goals of pragmatics, then the goals should be to explain how utterances convey meaning in context, how meaning is decoded from utterances in context and in particular situation, how context contributes to the encoding and decoding of meaning, how speakers and hearers of utterance perceive them, how speakers say one thing and mean something else, and how deductions are made in context with respect to what meaning has been encoded in particular utterance. The next section will examine stylistics as a branch of linguistics.</p> <p><strong>2.2 What is Stylistics?</strong></p> <p>Scholars have attempted to define stylistics from their own perspectives. Crystal (34) opines that ‘stylistics is the study of aesthetic use of language in all the scopes of linguistics.’ Contrary to this definition by Crystal of stylistics to be of ‘all linguistic domains’ is Short, who asserts that ‘Stylistics is an approach to the analysis of (literary) texts using linguistic descriptions’ (1). Short views stylistics as the scrutiny of fictitious texts in accordance with linguistic guidelines; he therefore limits the scope of stylistics to literary text neglecting the non-literary aspect of it. To Freeman, ‘stylistics is a sub-discipline which started in the second half of the 20th Century. It can be seen as a logical extension of moves within literary criticism early in the 20th century to concentrate on study texts, rather than authors’ (1). Leech and Short say ‘stylistics is simply defined as the (linguistic) study of style; it is rarely undertaken for its own sake, simply as an exercise in describing what use is made of language’. (13) They believe style is studied basically to explain something and in general, literary stylistics has, or implicitly or explicitly, the goal of explaining the relation between language and artistic function. </p> <p>           Short and Candlin are of the view that ‘stylistics is a linguistic approach to the study of the literary texts. It thus, embodies one essential part of the general course – Philosophy; that of combining language and literary study’ (183). Widdowson defines stylistics ‘as the study of literary discourse from a linguistic orientation.’ (3) He takes the view that what distinguishes stylistics from literary criticism on the one hand is that it is a means of linking the two. He also proposes that stylistics occupies the middle-ground between linguistics and literary criticism and its function is to mediate between the two. In this role, its concern necessarily overlaps with those in terms of expediency and effect. </p> <p>The above definitions show that it is not an easy task in giving a universally acceptable definition to the discipline called stylistics. However, it is generally agreed among linguists that stylistics is the study of style. This idea of defining style becomes another challenging task because style means a lot of things to different people. The definition of style as an addition can be further sub-grouped according to which effect of the addition is stressed in each definition. Bally, like many other rhetoricians, has explicitly expressed that style is a dry and scholarly recapitulation of facts.  To him, stylistics studies ‘…the effective value of the features of organized language and the reciprocal action or the expressive features that together form the system of the means of expression of a language.’ (53)</p> <p>           Bally (54) emphasizes that language is a set of means of expression which are simultaneous with thought. He distinguishes between internal stylistics, which studies the balance and the contrast of effective versus intellectual element within the same language, and external or comparative stylistics which compares such features of language with those of another. He stresses that style is a definite emotional effect achieved by linguistic means in a text. Style, therefore, stretches without breaking.</p> <p>           Enkvist (10) distinguishes among three points of view in defining style. According to him, style can be defined from the point of view of the writer where he/she attempts to penetrate and reveal the inner form of his/her subjects. Secondly, there are definitions which deal with the characteristics of the text itself, attempting the analysis of style entirely in terms of objective investigation of textual features. Thirdly, he gives a definition based on impressions of the readers. Enkvist further asserts that a thorough definition of style must take into consideration stylistic analyses that are operationally concrete and based on linguistic features. </p> <p>With this in mind, Enkvist (12) defines the style of a text to be the ‘aggregate of the textual probability of its linguistic item.’ This definition, however, looks at “contextual probability” as being central to every text and such includes an autonomous reference to a relevant norm conditioned by past experience. Thus, Enkvist’s view holds the idea that phonological, grammatical and lexical items constitute contextual probabilities that are integral to the study of style. He, however, fails to recognize pragmatics which is more of a “contextual probability” while the former set constitutes probability that all have to do with the total option available in language use.</p> <p>           According to Wales, ‘style refers to the perceived manner of expression in writing or speaking’ (373).  In this case, the style of writing can be radical, tragic, comic, etc., depending on the ultimate intentions of the writer. In the above definition, style enables the writer to express his/her feelings to the outer world; because literature is not written in a vacuum, there must be a message a writer has in mind to pass across, the way the writer uses language to convey his/her message to the world is referred to as the style of the writer. To buttress this definition, Malie as cited in Lawal says ‘the style of an author has a consistency due to the habitual nature of the writing process and this consistency can be determined, measured and used to determine consanguinity between an unknown and a set of authenticated text.’ (134)  </p> <p>Stylistics is a term that is mostly associated with the literary genre but modern linguistic exercises have clearly shown that there is much of stylistic analysis to be done on non-literary texts as is done on literary texts. A literary genre can be seen as style characteristics that is collectively recognized and agreed upon. Some of the aspects of literary stylistics include the use of dialogue, the description of scenes, the use of active and passive voice and the distribution of sentence length (Ahmad 2).</p> <p>Stylistics primarily attempts to explain the principles that informed the choices made by communicators which clearly manifests in their use of language. This is skillfully unraveled by the reader or writer by studying the style of the initiator of the communication (writer or speaker). Style on its own is aptly described by Lucas as ‘the effective use of language, especially in prose, whether to make statements or to rouse emotions. It involves first of all the power to put fact with clarity and brevity’ (9).</p> <p>One major concern of stylistics is the investigation into the continuous and consistent appearance of certain structures, items and elements in a speech utterance or in a given text. Thus, when a text is replete with some certain recurring predominant words or expressions, a stylistician becomes more interested in his investigation. Stylistics is particularly important because it enhances and maximizes our enjoyment of a text.</p> <p>The relevance of stylistics can never be over emphasized. It is a technique used to explicate both linguistic and non-linguistic text by objectively defining what an author does in his use of language. A stylistic analysis of a text in most cases reveals the good and or the bad qualities of a writing or speech.</p> <p>Stylistics, like Discourse, is multidisciplinary in nature, even though it has its own focus. It draws insights from disciplines such as Literature, Psychology, Sociology, Philosophy, and so on. As earlier explained, Stylistics, majorly, is the study of the style of a text. It looks at style</p> <p>in so many dimensions. They include:</p> <p><strong>Style as Choice</strong>: This considers style as a choice the speaker or writer makes in a text that ultimately makes his utterance or text to stand out. It becomes the responsibility of the stylistician to identify such a style in his (stylistician) analysis.</p> <p><strong>Style as Situation</strong>: A style could be adopted by a speaker or writer based on the situation in question. A text comes to life through the context or situation. This could be physical, socio-cultural or pragmatic.  </p> <p><strong>Style as Deviation</strong>:</p> <p>What does not conform to a certain standard could be a style to a writer or speaker. This is mostly noticed in poetry where the poet has the poetic license to deviate from an acceptable norm to use language in a way that pleases him.</p> <p><strong>Style as Time/ Era</strong>: This has to do with time relevance of a style. It deals with whether a particular style is in vogue or obsolete; whether it is ancient or modern. It is the task of the stylistician to point this out.</p> <p><strong>Style as the Individual</strong>: There are specific features that are associated with a particular speaker or writer due to his choice of style. That becomes his ideolets. A speaker or writer stands recognized basically due to his style.</p> <p><strong>3.1 Discourse, Pragmatics and Stylistics: What Relationship?</strong></p> <p>Even though discourse, stylistics and pragmatics have attained the statuses of independent disciplines, there are relationships between the three areas of studies. These relationships are examined below:</p> <p>1. For one thing, they are all a sub-branch or sub-field of linguistics which comes under the level of meaning (semantics, pragmatics, stylistics and discourse analysis). Other levels of linguistics are those of sound (phonetics and phonology) and form (morphology and syntax)</p> <p>2. Also, they are all inter-disciplinary areas of study. Stylistics, like Discourse and Pragmatics, is multidisciplinary in nature, even though it has its own focus. It draws insights from disciplines such as Literature, Psychology, Sociology, Philosophy, and so on. In the same vein, the scientific movements that nourished pragmatics include anthropology (B. Malinowski, P. Wegener, A. Gardiner), contextualism (J.R. Firth), functionalism (K. Buhler, R. Jakobson, D. Hymes), ethnomethodology (H. Garfinkel, E. Goffman, H. Sacks) and European sociology (J. Habermas). As a matter of fact, it is the relationship between pragmatics and sociology that gave birth to the sub-field of socio-pragmatics. Discourse, similarly, is a relative social phenomenon that depends solely on a wide range of disciplines, such as Psychology, Anthropology, Philosophy, Anthropological Linguistics, Sociology, Cognitive and Social Psychology. </p> <p>3. It is difficult to give a universally accepted definition of these disciplines. Despite its scientific acclaim, the notion of pragmaticsremains somewhat enigmatic and is still difficult to define. This holds for its readings in everyday discourse as well as in scholarly contexts. Pragmatics may be defined from a purely linguistic or non-linguistic angle which makes it complex to pin-point the exact meaning of the term. The sentences below explain this idea:</p> <p>(i). Pragmatics is a linguistic discipline. (ii). This study is a pragmatic analysis of Adichie’s text. (iii). Nigerian leaders need to be pragmatic rather than leave things to chance.</p> <p>Discourse and Stylistics as linguistic disciplines have also eluded scholars as it is complex to give a universally acceptable definition of the two fields.</p> <p>4. They all focus on the interpretation of meaning in communication.  This means that they share similarities in their focus. Discourse analysis picks up from where stylistics stops. The tasking questions discourse often asks are: What makes the speaker or writer use language the way he or she does? How does the hearer or reader interpret what the speaker or writer says or writes? Of course, this is where discourse shares a common boundary with Pragmatics. Indeed, ‘the speaker or writer has total control of the choice of words to use but he or she certainly does not have control of the meaning the listener or speaker would derive from what is said or written’ (Aziz n.pag). </p> <p>Osisanwo notes that ‘since both of them (discourse and pragmatics) deal with human interactions through language, they should be seen as cousins or linguistic relations’ (5). According to Brown and Yule (26), ‘in discourse analysis as in pragmatics we are concerned with what people using language are doing, and accounting for the linguistic features in the discourse as the means employed in what they are doing.’</p> <p>Discourse and Stylistics are two linguistic disciplines that are analyzed using different methods and tools. The text is the object of analysis for both the discourse analyst and the stylistician. One noticeable difference however is the manner in which they approach their analysis. ‘In discourse, there is the concern for language in use in social contexts, and in particular with interaction or dialogue between speakers. In essence, the discourse analyst is concerned with what language is used for and not the formal properties of a language.’ (Osisonwo 8) </p> <p>5. Context is key to the interpretation of meaning in discourse, stylistics and pragmatics. The three subfields of linguistics take into considerations the role of context in interpreting discourse or communication in language. This includes all the kinds of context available in linguistics such as physical, psychological, socio-cultural and linguistic.</p> <p>6. There are certain linguistic terms that are synonymous to, or cut across for the discourse analyst, the stylistician and the pragmatist. Some of these include:</p> <p><strong>Text: </strong>In Discourse, text simply means any instance of language in use. This comprises not only written language but also spoken language. A text could be as small as a word or sentence and could also be as large as a paragraph (Aziz n. pag). A text could equally be a whole chapter, a news item or a conversation. For a piece to be qualified as a text, Halliday and Hassan believe, it must form a ‘unified whole’ (1). When that happens, it can then be regarded as a semantic unit. </p> <p>A text is meant to have a texture. Texture, as used here, is the parameter that distinguishes a text from something that is not a text. Information in a text flows within and among sentences through the interplay of coherence and cohesion.</p> <p><strong>Cohesion and Coherence: </strong>Coherence concerns with sense in a text. That is to say that when a text makes sense to a reader or a hearer, it is said to be coherent (Osisanwoin Ogunsiji 48). Cohesion on the other hand is a Latin word for “striking together” (Stern in Ogunsiji 48). It is a term in Discourse that relates to how texts are held together lexically and grammatically as a whole. A text without cohesion is only a disjointed speech which may not generate any meaning.There is an obvious presence of coherence in the following conversation between two interlocutors:</p> <p>Speaker A:                        Honey the phone is ringing</p> <p>Speaker B:                         I’min the bathroom</p> <p>Speaker A:                        ok</p> <p>The discourse above can be interpreted vis- a- vis the social conventions of interaction which include:</p> <p>Speaker A requests speaker B to perform an action.</p> <p>Speaker B gives the reason why he cannot comply.</p> <p>Speaker A understands and (inexplicitly) proceeds to perform the action.</p> <p>It is discovered that there are no cohesive ties in the above discourse but the needed cues to identify coherence are conventional structures of interaction, and this is a shared understanding by the interlocutors.That is the crux of coherence in discourse.</p> <p><strong>Context: </strong>Context is a set of facts that surrounds a particular situation. Viewed from the angle of linguistics, context means everything that surrounds the production and reception of a piece of communication.According to van Dijk,“context is subjective mental model of communicative situation” (npn).Communication is better understood in context. Taiwo corroborates this fact in his explanation of context and its features which include:</p> <p>the physical situation in which the communication takes place, the interactants or interlocutors, the knowledge of the communicators of their cultural norms and expected behaviour, and the expressions that precede and follow a particular expression. All these features of context help language speakers to interpret meaning appropriately(19).</p> <p>Discourse dwells so much on the context of language use in social setting.It should be noted that discourse, pragmatics and stylistics belong to functional linguistics. According to Osisonwo (5), ‘a number of features are common to discourse analysis and pragmatics. These include speech acts, context, inference, presupposition and implicature, but with slightly different goals and levels of emphasis.’</p> <p>7. Similarly, since discourse is broader than stylistics and pragmatics, the two sub-fields thus, become an approach or tool of analysis in discourse. As such, they become intertwined, sharing concepts and boundaries in linguistic analysis. However, where stylistics and pragmatics cannot thread, discourse has traversed. This makes it possible to find such aspects of analysis in all the fields like: </p> <p><strong>Graphological Features </strong>whichis concerned with the physical appearance of a text. The primary focus here is foregrounding. That is an act of bringing to fore, certain words to give them prominence. This can be identified by looking at words in italics, capital letters, bold letters, words that are underlined, and so on. The use of punctuation marks can equally create stylistic effects. It is the task of the stylistician to explore and give description of these graphological features in a text.</p> <p><strong>Syntactic Features:</strong>The focus here is on sentence types and the effect they create in a text. A text may contain a combination of simple, complex, compound and compound complex sentences or just simple sentences. Aspects of ellipsis, parataxis, hypotaxis, right and left- branching sentences are equally considered significant here (Ogunsiji 11).For example, a dislocation in syntax of a text could mean the dislocation in human thoughts. James Joyce’s novels are replete with this style.</p> <p><strong>Lexico- Semantic Features</strong>:</p> <p>Here, attention is specially given to words. This is because words may be used by the speaker or writer to produce connotative, denotative, associative, collocative, affective, thematic, idiomatic and even stylistic meanings. The discourse analysts, pragmatists and stylisticians watch out for the various meanings conveyed by the use of such words.</p> <p>8. Lastly, the text is the subject of analysis for the discourse, stylistic and pragmatic analysts. However, the text must be interpreted as communicative utterances for the pragmatists.</p> <p><strong>4.0.</strong><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>Discourse, Pragmatics and Stylistics are linguistic disciplines that analyze text in an attempt to establish meaning in communication.Although, it is a complexendeavour in trying to draw a demarcating line between these disciplines, it is still possible to speculate the limit to which the scope of one field can cover over another due to their concerns or goals. These sub-branch of linguistics share similarities even though they approach the analysis of language use with different,but similar, methods.One thing that is common Discourse, Pragmatics and Stylistics is that theyhave the text as the object of analysis. </p> <p><strong>WorksCited</strong></p> <p>Ahmad, Zulfiqar. “Stylistics and Discourse Analysis: A Contribution in Analysing Literature.”</p> <p><em>Academy of the Punjab in North America</em>.Web. 20 June 2016.</p> <p>Austin, J.

Feminists stress the relevant of gender segregation in society and it present these segregation as working to the overall advantage of men. Although feminists are united with their shared desire for sexual justice and their concern for women’s welfare, there is a range spectrum of feminist views.</p> <p><strong>TWO OF THE MORE FAMOUS PROPONENTS OF FEMINISM ARE:</strong></p> <p><strong>Ann Oakley,</strong> a British sociologist and writer, born 1944. Her works include ‘Women Confined: Towards sociology of childbirth.’(1980)  and ‘Who’s afraid of Feminism?’ (1997). her father was a social policy theorist.</p> <p><strong>Claire Wallace,</strong> a British sociologist and writer. Wallace was a professor at Aberdeen University. Her most famous work is ‘An Introduction to Sociology: Feminist Perspectives’ (1990). Wallace was president of the European Sociology Association 2007-09.</p> <p><strong>FEMINIST LITERARY CRITICISM</strong></p> <p>Feminist literary criticism is informed by feminist theory . It can be understood as using feminist principles and ideological discourses to critique the language of literature, its structure and being. This school of thought seeks to describe and analyze the ways in which literature portrays the narrative of male domination in regard to female bodies by exploring the economic, social, political, and psychological forces embedded within literature.</p> <p>Feminist literary criticism is literary analysis that arises from the view point of feminism, feminist theory and/or feminist politics. Basic methods of feminist literary criticism include:</p> <p>Ø Identifying with female characters: This is a way to challenge the male-centred outlook of authors. Feminist literary criticism suggests that women in literature were historically presented as objects seen from a male perspective.</p> <p>Ø Re-evaluating literature and the world in which literature is read: This involves questioning whether society has predominantly valued male authors and their literary works because it has valued males more than females.</p> <p> A feminist literary critic resists traditional assumptions while reading. In addition to challenging assumptions which were thought to be universal, feminist literary criticism actively supports including women's knowledge in literature and valuing women's experiences.</p> <p>The notion is that men use the smoke screen of culture, politics, economic, tradition, and all other sectors of the society to adulate patriarchy at the expense of the female gender. Even in the dramatic concept we hardly see many of these female writers except for the likes of Osonye Tess Onwueme who is the god mother of feminism in Nigeria, Tracy ChimaUtoh, the late Zulu Sofola and few others. This impression is misleading, as some male writers like J.P Clark, Femi Osofisan, KoleOmotosho, NgugiWaThiongu, Ola Rotimi and others have all addressed feminism in their various works. However, we shall analyse Ola Rotimi’s our husband has gone mad again and J.P Clark’s “The wives Revolt” as the address the issue of feminism.</p> <p><strong>LITERATUE REVIEW</strong></p> <p>An intellectual x-ray of scholarly write-ups on the subject of feminism creates the notion that the subjugation of Africa women is a product of a society dominated by male. Women are exploited and oppressed in all sectors of the economy. Observably, his call for social change has been the subject of discourse by many contemporary dramatists. </p> <p>However, one aspect of olarotimi’s feminist literary criticism has been glossed over by many, in his call for female empowerment in the political circle or scenario. Rotimi does not hide his disgust for political class who is bereft of creating ideas, yet continue to hold the nation captive. Toying with the idea of female empowerment in such a set up, therefore, amount to tacit call for revolt.Rotimi is however, not unaware of the fact that men dominate the political, economic, social, education and even in the traditional setting where women are reduced to house wives not allowing them to contribute important matters of the state. Therefore, his recipe for a new system that will empower female as collective actions by the women; casting away the garments of subservient, ignorance and passiveness.Salami(2001:158) is of the view that:</p> <p>          One way of breaking unto the male political circle and</p> <p>          Destroying the myth of male political monopoly in Nigeria </p> <p>is to get involved in politics and government, so as to influence</p> <p>Legislation and policies to favor women</p> <p>This can only happen when the women develop a new political consciousness and drive within themselves to fight for power transfer. The women can exploit the high handedness, political naivety and dictatorial tendencies characteristic of most men.</p> <p><strong>OUR HUSBAND HAS GONE MAD AGAIN</strong></p> <p><strong>ANALYSIS</strong></p> <p>Emmanuel Gladstone olarotimi until his death was a recognized political analyst and strong advocate of social change. He has explored cultural, historical, religious and social means of effecting the type of change, which places emphasis on the welfare of the masses. Saint Gbilekaa (1997:151) says rotimi uses his plays to “avail his audience of the knowledge of the past, for the reconstruction or social engineering of the present and future”. In the process, he has frequently denounced the political elite as being corrupt, exploitative, oppressive, and self –centered.</p> <p>In his play our husband has gone mad again, he condemns via satire, the political system of the nation where the best candidates are not elected to political positions.</p> <p>However, so many issues were raised on feminist literary criticism. He calls for female empowerment in the political circle. His call is prompted by the fact that pre- and post independence governance, characteristically dominated by male politicians, has plunged most African nations into the dark abyss. Thus their continued stay in the political scene will further destroy the surviving social structures which guarantee societal well being. If men have failed consistently to provide good leadership, then a credible alternative needs to be tried out, this time, the female politicians. Therefore, his recipe for new political arrangement that will empower female politicians is premised on a collective action by the woman after casting out the old order.</p> <p><strong>THEMES</strong></p> <p><strong>SLAVERY/INEQUALITY</strong></p> <p> A case study of Lejoka Brown who is defeated by Sikira the emergency wife and the daughter of Madam Ajanaku and becomes the flag bearer of the party in the place of her erstwhile husband with the help of her mother and Lisa’s new female empowerment and consciousness.</p> <p>Ola Rotimi chronicles some set of politicians who refuses to appreciate the fact the society is dynamic and would require dynamism to be able to cope with challenges of governance; rather than cling to archaic ideas. Thus:</p> <p>“Are you there…..? Politics is the thing now in Nigeria, </p> <p>  Mate. You want to be   famous? Politics. You want to </p> <p>  Chop life? No, no you want to chop a big slice of the</p> <p>National cake? Na politics….. (p.4).</p> <p>This creates the impression of a society dominated by male chauvinism. The notion derives from the presence of the loquacious Lejoka-Brown who pervades the political terrain like a mighty colossus. On the other hand, the woman is conceived as a Lilliputian who is completely domesticated.  Lejoka brown is the boss, who must be obeyed and served. He rides on both the political and traditional performs to wield his power. While he discusses “important” matters of the state with Okonkwo, Sikira is made to run errands and provide comfort for her “Lord” (p.6). Sikira, who must kneel while greeting her ‘lord’, is regarded as a mere property, a thing recently acquired by Lejoka Brown as a for political convenience, while mama Rashida is being domicile by culture. Thus both women are subservient, enslaved by the duo of tradition and illiteracy</p> <p>Again, Sikira also takes a critical look at her position in the house and returns a harsh verdict on herself- a slave. This verdict is an expression of the despair and frustration arising from patronizing attitude of Lejoka brown. She sees herself as mere ‘possession’, acquired by her husband for political expediency. Her frustration is reflective of the plight of women who are purchased, caged and inhibited from political aspiration by a male dominant society. Thus </p> <p>          …….in this house? A slave that is what I am. </p> <p>Did he marry me because He loves me or </p> <p>because of crazy politics? </p> <p>Furthermore, Mustafa’s visit to Lejoka Brown’s house is used to accentuate the captive position of the women in the society. While Mustafa’s precautionary measures and entrance (p.16) are hypocritical and exaggerated, they help to highlight the degradation and subjugation of womanhood. This is because the Africa woman has never been given an equal status with her male counterpart, so she has had to play an unedifying subordinate role and to also accept that it was her place to do so. Thus Mama Rashida and Sikira must draw their veils and make their faces well shrouded (p.16) like masquerades before they can attend to their male visitors. They kneel and remain so, all through Mustafa’s discussion with them; indicative of a relio-cultural servitude status conferred on the women by the society. The subjugation remains in force, until Liza is introduced and the ‘man’s world begins to disintegrate.</p> <p><strong>WOMEN LIBERATION/EMPOWERMENT</strong></p> <p>Lisa is a beautiful young Kenyan lady, who got married to Lejoka Brown in the court registry, during the Belgian wars. She rendered a voluntary service with the Red Cross organization before proceeding to America to study medicine. These intimidating credentials portray Lisa as an educated and liberated young lady who would fight for her rights, much in the same way as her pedigree the Kenyan Mau Mau warriors. This might explain Rotimi’s choice of the Kenyan lady, in preference to her timid Nigeria counterpart, to instigate the revolt against female oppression. This Lisa’s credentials are enough to unnerve the undulation Ijebuijesha farmer, who collapses from his colossal status into a mere political minion. Her telegram to Lejoka Brown about her home coming is disconcerted to him. Two issues is crop up how to explain the presence of the other two women to Liza and possibility of security the market women’s votes with her intrusion becomes his main problems.</p> <p>Lisa’s arrival changes the atmosphere of slavery in LejokaBrowns’s house. Although brown attempts to maintain the status quo, he is rebuffed and cut down by Lisa. She speaks above him, unintentionally widening the social gap, and reinforcing the inferiority complex that drove Lejoka Brown to his political pursuit.</p> <p>Lisa turns out to the embodiment of feminism, which believes in equality of human beings, irrespective of gender. Her belief runs counter to the prevalent ideology within the political class, which eulogizes male superiority. This evidence in the unequal appointment of leadership positions due to gender factors. Thus one of the lessons Lisa that Sikira learns through Lisa’s indoctrination is the expression that men and women are born equal. This effects a new mental orientation and creates another visionary disposition in Sikira. Mama Rashida also rises to new level of awareness. The economic principles of demand and supply, which she learns about her egg business frees her from the chains of domestic chores. She is captivated by the thought of making enough   which Lejoka Brown can borrow for his political campaign, on interest. Deductively, economic empowerment will enhance her social status. She further discovers that she can live independently, by going to the village to set up her business.</p> <p>Lekoka Brown fails to notice the change in the women. He also fails to recognize the fact that the women have developed new personality profiles and a change in their attitude and disposition to life. Thus, he backs out an order to Sikira.</p> <p>          You are one of the crazy headaches I ve</p> <p>been crazy enough to get into my crazy </p> <p>head! Now get out of here</p> <p>Sikira(to Liza). You heard that? (Lejoka</p> <p>Brown, backing away) all right, i</p> <p>          Will! I will get out of here. (rushes towards</p> <p>the rear door, Stops, pokes her head round, </p> <p>and coos) men and women </p> <p>          Are created equal!(bolts out, slamming </p> <p>door shut quickly behind her).</p> <p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p> <p>Men have dominated the political landscape within much visible development in the live of most Africa and nations. Most nations are wallowing in abject poverty because of corruption and fraudulent practices of male politicians, whose political drive is personal economic empowerment. The women have been discriminated against on the basis of sex, thereby depriving them of the opportunity to serve. A change from male dominated and sterile governance to one that will bring about a development through feminine input becomes desirable. It becomes sensible therefore to advocate for female empowerment; with the expectation that the society will change for the better.</p> <p><strong>THE WIVES REVOLT</strong></p> <p><strong>ANALYSIS</strong></p> <p>One of the modern Nigeria's foremost literary figure, J.P. Clark-Bekederemo, known for the first part of his career as John Pepper Clark, is also one of the country's most versatile thinkers. His work has moved back and forth between Nigeria and the West, between traditional modes of expression and European-derived forms ranging from ancient Greek tragic drama to modern image centered poetry. Clark-Bekederemo caused controversy in both worlds; he felt distinctly out of place when he visited the United States dismaying his hosts, but his unsparing depictions of Nigerian civil war likewise unsettled his countrymen. J.P. Clark-Bekederemo was, in short, a modern writer who raised questions and crossed boundaries wherever he went and whatever he did.</p> <p><strong>THEME</strong></p> <p><strong>INEQUALITY/INJUSTICE</strong></p> <p>The play, ‘The Wives Revolt’ begins with Okoro,  Koko’s husband. Okoro, equipped with the gong, announces the enforcement of a new law banishing goats in the oil-rich Erhuwaren village that law sparks a feud in the community between the men and the women as the latter are the owners of these forbidden domestic animals. The law was considered as repressive by the women. Already, the sharing formula for the oil wealth has been in three parts namely the elders, men of particular age-group and women. The women reason that the elders are the men and the implication is that the men folk hold the two-thirds of the oil revenue.</p> <p>Hence, the women plan to make men their “domestic animals”. In their bid to be heard, they deserted their homes and their children, leaving their husbands to do the domestic chores such as cooking, sweeping and other menial tasks that the men would otherwise treat as masculine abomination. The women travel through Otughieven, Eijophe, or Igherekan, Imode to Eyara while expecting to be quickly recalled by their lonely husbands. But their husbands are prepared for the worse. At Eyara, the women are accommodated and cared for by Ighodayen, a notorious prostitute. When the men receive the agonizing news of their wives’ sojourn, they plead for their return without any inkling that the worst is yet to come. The women returned with deadly diseases, having been infected by Ighodayen. They became the subjects of ridicule of their husbands who had been brought to their knees to revoke the obnoxious law.</p> <p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p> <p>Men have dominated the political landscape within much visible development in the live of most Africa and nations. Most nations are wallowing in abject poverty because of corruption and fraudulent practices of male politicians, whose political drive is personal economic empowerment. The women have been discriminated against on the basis of sex, thereby depriving them of the opportunity to serve.  While urging custodians of the African culture to revisit some of our value system and come up with standards that give the male and female folks their real place. A change from male dominated and sterile governance to one that will bring about a development through feminine input becomes desirable. It becomes sensible therefore to advocate for female empowerment; with the expectation that the society will change for the better.</p> <p><strong>REFERENCES:</strong></p> <p>OUR HUSBAND HAS GONE MAD AGAIN OLA ROTIMI</p> <p>WIVES REVOLT JOHN PEPPER CLARK</p> <p>Gillis, Gillian Howie &amp; Rebecca Munford</p> <p><strong>FEMINIST APRROACH</strong></p> <p>The basic assumption shared by all feminists is that women suffer certain injustices on account of their sex. Feminists stress the importance of gender divisions in society and it portrays these divisions as working to the overall advantage of men. Although feminists are united with their common desire for sexual justice and their concern for women’s welfare, there is a range spectrum of feminist views.</p> <p>Feminism has five major concepts embedded into it:</p> <p>Patriarchy - the dominance of men in society, and the oppression of women for men’s gain. Example: ‘The family is patriarchal because women must do housework without pay.’</p> <p>Discrimination - unfair/unequal treatment of women i.e. by the law. Example: Women paid less than men until Equal Pay Act 1970.</p> <p>Gender stereotypes - negative generalisations/misconceptions about women. These are perpetuated in the media, as well as the education system. Example: ‘Man are better drivers then women.’</p> <p>Economic  dependency - women giving up work to take care of childcare/housework responsibilities, thus becoming dependent on their husbands for money.</p> <p>Emotional work - women are expected to do the majority of emotional care for their family, on top of their job and housework; the so-called ‘triple shift’.</p> <p>Feminism and Education: feminists believe that education as it stands promotes male domination; that there is gendered language within education, education produces stereotypes, education misses women from the curriculum, ‘girls’ and ‘boys’ subjects have been allowed to develop eg: (girls do Food Tech while boys do Woodwork). Feminists believe that the education system is patriarchal; they believe that the ‘Hidden curriculum’ reinforces gender differences. Girls tend to do better now, although boys demand more attention from teachers. Men dominate top positions in school (head teachers ect.) Liberal feminists: want an equal access to education for boys and girls. Marxist feminists: want to consider gender inequalities combined with inequalities of class and ethnicity. Radical feminists: men are a bad influence and we should have female-centred education. Illich 1971: ‘get rid of school completely’. He wanted to de-school society as the functions it performs are not good enough to run schools and schools do not create equality or develop creativity.</p> <p>Feminism and Family: Feminists believe that the family is patriarchal, dominated by men and it exploits and oppresses women. The family supports and reproduces inequalities between men and women. Women are oppressed because their socialised to be dependent on men and remain in second place. They reject the new rights view of the separate roles, and also reject the ‘march of progress 'view in that society has not changed and it is still unequal. Feminists believe that marriage remains patriarchal and that men benefit from wives. Feminists reject the idea of ‘one best’ family type, they welcome freedom and diversity.</p> <p>Feminism and the Media: Feminists believe that the media often presents women as cleaners, housewives, domestic servants providing comfort and support for men, a man’s sex object to service men’s sexual needs, ect. Feminists believe that this gender representation is an aspect of patriarchy. Feminists believe that the media suggests these roles are natural and normal. Feminists see this as an example of patriarchal ideology- a set of beliefs which distorts reality and supports male dominance.</p> <p>Feminism and Crime: Feminists argue that the behaviour of women when criminality is involved can only be understood in the context of male dominance. Pat Carlen argues that women’s crimes are largely ‘crimes of the powerless’. She draws on control theory, arguing that working-class women turn to crime when the advantages appear to outweigh the disadvantages. Feminists believe that women have been socialised to conform; women’s socialisation and domestic responsibilities plus the controls imposed on them by men discourage deviance from social norms. Frances Heidensohn believes that the most striking thing about women’s behaviour is their conformity to social norms. She explains this in terms of their socialisation and control over their behaviour by men. As a result women have less inclination, time and opportunity for crime.</p> <p>Feminism and Religion: Feminists believe that religion is a patriarchal institution. They criticise the sacred texts as in almost all the world’s religions, the gods are male. (Hindus come close to being an exception, with its female goddesses). Feminists have also been written and interpreted by males by incorporating many traditional male stereotypes and biases. Supernatural beings and religious professionals are overwhelmingly male, and in many religions, women play a secondary role in worship. In strongly religious societies, women tend to have fewer options and less favourable treatment.</p> <p>Feminist methodology: There are a number of feminist methodologies. The ‘weak thesis’ states that overgeneralisation is found in all aspects of the research process. Research methods, in and of themselves, are not sexist. Once researchers learn to use them in a non-sexist way, the problem will be solved. Some feminists see women’s struggle and feminist methodology as inseparable. The feminist researcher should be consciously partial and actively participate in women's liberation. Postmodern feminism rejects pre-set, pre-determined categories. It emphasises diversity and variation. It argues that there are multiple interpretations of any observation and that this should be reflected by multiple voices in research reports.</p> <p><strong>Critics of feminism:</strong></p> <p>Critics argue that there is too much focus on negative aspects, and that feminists sometime ignore recent social changes . Critics claim that feminists portray women as ‘passive’ victims, as if they are unable to act against discrimination. The same critics believe that feminists focus on one specific group, ignoring women from other cultures and ethnicities (black feminism).</p> <p><strong>Sociological stance on feminism:</strong></p> <p>Feminism is a structuralist (top-down) theory. Postmodernist sociologists argue that society has ‘fragmented’ since the ‘modern’ era and can no longer be explained with rigid rules and structures. Instead, postmodernists believe in social action (bottom-up) theory.</p> <p>Marxism shares some similarities with feminism: it argues that society is unequal and that it is characterised by oppression. However, Marxists believe that the oppression is of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie.</p> <p>Functionalist sociologists disagree with feminists. Unlike feminists, they emphasise the positive aspects of society. Functionalists believe that society’s institutions (education, media, religion etc.) are vital so that society can function. However, functionalists are often criticised for ignoring negative aspects of society, such as domestic violence</p> <p><br/><br/> Using the Dolls house as a case study </p> <p><strong>Analysis</strong></p> <p>In the tradition of the time, well-made plays used the first act as an exposition, the second to treat an event, and the third to unravel the issue. Ibsen will diverge from the pattern in the third act, but here the beginning is traditional, establishing the tensions that will explode later in the play. Ibsen sets up the act by introducing the central topic, Nora’s character.</p> <p>Specifically, the topic is Nora’s relation to the home or the world outside the home. Nora is a symbol of the women of her time, who were thought to be content with the luxuries of modern society without worrying about the men’s world outside the home. Many women were, but others were not, both as a matter of interest and as a matter of principle. Nora does delight in material wealth; Torvald is not entirely wrong in labeling her a spendthrift from an early age. She projects the attitude that money is the key to happiness. The issue is not quite so simple, though, for Nora’s one great expense was to serve her husband’s need to travel far from home for the sake of his health.</p> <p>In this context, note that a doll’s house is a child’s toy that often allows children to play at being adults. The exterior world, moreover, never makes it onto the stage. Nora is the doll in the house, and the house is the only location we see. Torvald controls the stage on which Nora is an actor who generally believes that this pretend-world is the real one. Just as Nora relates to the exterior world primarily through material objects, Torvald relates to Nora as an object that is possessed, a doll to be controlled within a small sphere.</p> <p>Torvald’s attitude pervades every word he speaks to Nora, and his objectification of her is most evident in his diminutive pet names for her. She is his little “lark” and “squirrel” and, later, his “songbird.” Similarly, Torvald repeatedly calls Nora his “little one” or “little girl,” maintaining the atmosphere of subordination more appropriate to a father than a husband. As for Nora, we see in this first conversation that she seems entirely dependent on Torvald for her money, her food, and her shelter, despite the fact that she is keeping a secret. This secret is the kernel of her individuality and her escape from the doll’s house.</p> <p>Nora’s skewed vision of the world is most evident in her interactions with Mrs. Linde. Whereas her old school friend is wizened and somber, Nora is impetuous. Her choice to tell Mrs. Linde about her secret seems to be more the boast of a child than the actions of a thoughtful adult, and Mrs. Linde also refers to her as a child. Nora’s naïve view of the law—that the law would not prosecute a forgery carried out in the name of a good purpose like love—reinforces the idea that Nora is fundamentally unaware of the ways of the real world.</p> <p>Still, it is apparent that Nora is at least partly aware that her doll-like life is not the only choice. When pressed about whether she will ever tell Torvald about the loan, she replies that she will, in time. For now, she believes that telling him would upset the balance in her home. Torvald’s position as the manly provider and lawgiver is something that she is willing to manipulate, at least from within the home. She knows that other women, like Mrs. Linde, have different levels of freedom and autonomy. It is important to examine the language of the opening scene between Nora and Torvald in this context. Nora’s words could be partly sincere and partly insincere; the text suggests an ambiguity in Nora’s awareness of her situation. This ambiguity is perhaps why Nora’s character is so popular for actors to play; actors can use gesture and voice inflection to signal the true level of Nora’s satisfaction with her sheltered place in the home and in Torvald’s life.</p> <p>Nevertheless, she does not seem want to face the implications of a choice to escape her confinement. She believes that material wealth will render her “free from care,” allowing her not just to repay the debt but also to play with her children, keep the house beautifully, and do everything the way that Torvald likes. The lie about the loan can be preserved. She seems content with her one great secret, her knowledge that she has done something for Torvald entirely without prompting from him. </p> <p>It is a happy first act for the family, but Krogstad’s presence launches the crisis that will consume Nora’s attention. The family seems functional, the room is comfortable, and Nora seems to have the Christmas spirit (for instance, she generously tips the porter who brings in the Christmas tree). The family seems to be, as Aristotle might have had it, at the height of happiness—from which they will tumble downhill. Nora’s secret, which might come out before its time, puts an ominous cloud over the doll’s house. The outside world now invades the home in the form of Mrs. Linde and then Krogstad. These machinations about who should get the banking jobs, complicated by Krogstad’s threat to reveal the secret and by Torvald’s denunciation of Krogstad, are just too much for Nora to manage.</p> <p>Perhaps the coldness of the Norwegian winter in which the play is set represents the coolness, societal conformity, and comfortable routine of Nora’s world. In contrast is a kind of repressed Italy—referenced most obviously in Nora’s outfit and the tarantella—featuring heat, passion, truth, desire, and the flame of individuality. Nora’s secret is bound to come out. Ibsen has set up an ironic inevitability. All who know are waiting for the moment at which the lie falls apart.Torvald almost is cuckolded by the lie.</p> <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p> <p>The doll’s house by herik Ibsen has portray inhumanity to women on how they are been restricted by their husband to be fully dependent like Nora who was not given the chance by her husband to exbits her skills in business instead she has to borrow money to fit the bills of the family without the consent of her husband. So these plays has described the reality in the feministic approach.</p> <p>The theory and criticism looks at dramatic works on the basis of the literary genres in which they can be classified. The play is described based on the genre to which it belongs. The critic therefore looks at certain criteria that makes the play fall under the genre in question. The literary genres include: tragedy, comedy, satire, tragic-comedy, melodrama, farce e.t.c.</p> <p>We shall be discussing tragedy, components of the descriptive approach to dramatic theory and criticism.</p> <p>TRAGEDY: According to Aristotle in “the poetics”, tragedy came from the efforts of poets to present men as nobler or better than they are in real life. Aristotle points out the six elements of tragedy: plot, character, diction, thought, spectacle, and song. Plot is the soul of tragedy, because action is paramount to the significance of a drama while all other elements are subsidiary. A plot must have a beginning, middle and end. It must also be universal in significance, have a determinate structure, and maintain a unity of theme and purpose. Plot must also contain elements of astonishment, reversal, recognition and suffering, which all coalesce to create “catharsis”, which is the engenderment of fear and pity in the audience: pity for the tragic hero’s plight and fear that his fate might befall us. When it comes to character, the hero must good, and thus manifests moral purpose in his speech. Second, the hero must have manly valor and possess extraordinary abilities. Thirdly, the hero must be true to life and finally, the hero must be consistent.</p> <p>Critics who choose to describe literary works using a descriptive approach such as tragedy look out for the following criteria in the work which might as well be referred to as the characteristics of tragedy:</p> <p>1.     The tragic hero’s life is usually turned upside down and he suffers the deepest agony.</p> <p>2.     The tragic hero usually has a flaw or some weakness that is the reason for his downfall.</p> <p>3.     Tragedies usually have heart-breaking ending. It could end in death of the tragic hero, destruction and some chaos.</p> <p>4.     The tragic hero almost always accepts responsibility for his mistakes as well as fight for a larger cause.</p> <p>5.     Catharsis, which is the purging of emotions in the audience, specifically fear and pity must be evident.</p> <p>6.     The tragic hero usually exhibits extraordinary abilities.</p> <p>7.     The tragic hero is usually some one important in the society.</p> <p>The above mentioned characteristics or criteria are part of those that describe literary works as tragic.</p> <p>COMEDY: According to Aristotle, comedy shows a lower type of person and reveals humans to be worse than they are in average. Comedy means a representation of defect or ugliness in character. In comedy, we laugh at the hero’s flaw comforted by the fact that it is not ours, unlike in tragedy where we grieve over the fate of a man who must suffer for his flaws, perhaps touched by the possibility that we too might possess these flaws. </p> <p>Critics who choose to describe literary works using a descriptive approach such as comedy look out for the following criteria which may also be regarded as the characteristics of comedy:</p>\n\nFEMINIST CRITICISMS OF SOME SELECTED FEMINIST WORKS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FEMINIST CRITICISMS OF SOME SELECTED FEMINIST WORKS", "id": 136}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1            </strong><strong>                                                INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.2            </strong><strong> Fiction and Emotion</strong></p> <p>Narration as a concept is the weaving of several strands of events into a story. This means narrative comes out of oral or written account of an event or events such as <em>The Man Died</em> (1972) – the autobiographical narrative on the detention and imprisonment of Wole Soyinka. Narration according Gerard Genette also means “the succession of events, real or fictitious” (25). Narration in this sense may be a novel such as <em>Things Fall Apart</em> by Chinua Achebe. What runs across the two separate definitions of narrative given above is the idea of event without which there can be no narration. Event is the occurrence of action either by man or animal. A student buying a novel at a bookshop is an event and a horse galloping across the field is also an event. The event could be for a very short time and could also be very long such as a civil war. The event or a series of events become a narrative when to use Bridgette Hard et al.’s words they “…are selected and segmented from ongoing information’’ (1221). What Hard et al. mean by “ongoing information’’ are the several existing events from where some have been selected to form the story or narrative.</p> <p>Selecting from the many episodes has implications on how the narrator</p> <p>perceives each event in order of importance. This means, as Hard <em>et al</em> put it, analyzing segmentation patterns of events indicate “…the breakpoints of larger units aligned with those of smaller units. This hierarchical alignment effect suggested that the events were perceived as partonic hierarchies” (1221). Narration, therefore, involves making sense of abstract events and the selection of events in order of their importance to the narrator. The event may be about the other person written by someone else. The narration, in such a case, is told about a personality other than that of the writer. This genre of narration is known as biography. </p> <p>Contrary to what some people believe, storytelling is never a matter of “getting the facts, all the facts, and nothing but the facts” (Jacob, 516). This suggests autobiography or biography no matter the perceived reality is mixed with imagination since some events no matter the vividness cannot be presented the way they occurred. What makes a story interesting is the ability of the story teller to select very important events from among the many, for instance, in autobiographical narrative, the way we consider those facts as they are presented to us by a narrator; this is what makes a story different from a simple retelling of factual happenings, as in the familiar secondary school essay composition that starts each sentence with “And then …”. Stories are part of our lives: they extend into our lives and branch out from there; but also, stories can only be understood if they are localized, fleshed out in terms of our daily reality, and by using the right narrative style. A story that has no relation to our world is probably not going to interest us very much. Some stories written in the past have lost interest among contemporary readers due to their monotonous thematic presentations and narrative styles. On the other hand, we also find stories in older literature such as Jane Austen, Pushkin and Shakespeare, which today seem as fresh as when they first were written down.  </p> <p>While it is difficult to pinpoint what makes a story succeed, it is perhaps easier to spot at least a few of the causes that make a story fail, or let it fall into oblivion after the story producers’ and the consumers’ generation that supported them have passed away. In his <em>Evgenij Onegin</em>, Pushkin satirizes the ennuiof the Russian genteel country nobility by pointing to the fabulous array of ‘has-been’ authors who constituted the daily spiritual bread of the country manor, and whose fame faded as their pages yellowed (the incomparable Grandison, whose bore is matched by our snore, is only one among many). For Jane Austen, her works have survived and continued to survive the test of time due to her thematic preoccupations and style of character presentation.</p> <p>In this and similar cases, the interested readership is confined to students of literature or history; the regular readers will find it difficult to relate to the characters and their voices, as these represent an entirely different social and societal environment. The question thus is what makes for a story, and in particular, for a good story. Literary scholars and the common readership have pondered about this question for centuries, both theoretically, in studies of narrative, and practically, in university courses of the ‘Creative Writing’ type. One thing that is pertinent to making a successful piece of fiction is the technique of narration and character presentation adopted by the author. This makes narration an important part of fiction. </p> <p>Narration is about storytelling. But a story has to be told by someone called the narrator. Already, it may be clear that the narrator is different from the author: in every story, the author creates a world of fiction, the narrative, in which the narrator plays an eminent role, even though not always discernible on the surface. Narrativity thus deals with the techniques and devices that a narrator has at his or her disposal when telling a story; among these, the notion of ‘character’ and the accompanying ‘voice’ are among the most important. To see how character and voice connect and interrelate in narration in, sometimes, rather oblique and inscrutable ways, one may consider the case of the ‘homodiegetic’ novel, or stories told in the first person. Clearly, we cannot assume that the speaking ‘I’ is identical to or is necessarily the author, who likewise cannot be held responsible for the narrator’s claim as being his own. </p> <p>When the 19th century Russian Mikhail Yu. Lermontov starts his classic </p> <p>story, <em>A Hero of Our Times </em>(1841) with the famous line “I traveled by stagecoach from Tbilisi …”, every reader will understand that this does not mean that Lermontov himself did the traveling: the words are spoken by the narrator (referring to his conversation while sitting on top of the coach with a returning NCO, the ranking <em>shtabskapitan </em>serving in Chechenya). So, the author is not the narrator, not even if the story is told in the first person singular, as in the Lermontov case. The author creates the narrator as the embodiment of the story’s authoritative competence; it is really not important whether this authority assumes the ‘I’-role or pretends to be an outside ‘voice’: ‘Trust the tale, not the teller’, as the old adage has it. What characterizes the story is its ‘narrativity’, its quality of being narrated andreceived as a story. The latter part is important, but it is often overlooked; Robert Scholes has pointed out that the very idea of narrativity is dependent on the reader actively entering the story world and participating in the narration: “a process by which a perceiver (author or reader) actively constructs a story from the fictional data provided by any narrative medium” (60). Thus, on the part of the reader, there corresponds to the act of narration an act of active collaboration, an “active narrativity” (Jacob, 517).</p> <p>In demonstrating the role of the readers in progressing the narrative and distinguishing between narrative level or styles, Jacob distinguishes between a primary level, where the action unfolds, and a secondary (and possibly further) level(s), where the actors come in and their voices are heard. On the primary level, we have the narrator’s text; on the secondary (“embedded”) level, we are confronted with the actors’ text. The latter text does not necessarily contain only what the actors say or think in the context of the primary level; they may start a story of their own, and this embedded narrative may then again have several levels of its own, where the secondary story is related to the primary one in various ways. A good example is provided by the classic novella by the German author, Theodor Storm, <em>Der Schimmelreiter </em>(‘The man on the white steed’, 1888; Engl. transl. ‘The Dyke Master’, 1996), where the narrator on the primary level is the authoritative retired school teacher, who ‘frames’ the story by telling it to his friends in the local pub (in German, this kind of narrative is called a <em>Rahmenerzahlung </em>(Jacob, 515), literarily ‘a story within a narrative frame’). But the narrative is not about the teacher and his audience; rather, it concerns the legendary local official in charge of dams and levees (in German: <em>der Deichgraf</em>, ‘the dyke master’), whose expertise and innovative efforts form the secondary narrative, which in fact is the story that we, the readers, co-construct and remember. The teacher’s primary voice, as perceived in his narration and buttressed by his memory, lends credence and local colouring to the embedded story and its secondary voices.</p> <p>Similarly, in one of the most famous collections of stories ever told, the <em>1001Nights</em>, the main character, Sheherazade, invents and ‘orchestrates’ the stories, which she then attributes to secondary narrators on the embedded level. These secondary narrators remain implicit, that is, they are heard, but not seen; in contrast, another famous collection of stories, Boccaccio’s <em>Decameron</em>, has the actors on the primary level narrate their own stories as narrators of secondary level-stories.</p> <p>In what have been said so far, it has been implicitly assumed that actors ‘speak’ in narratives; in other words, they have been attributed with a <em>voice</em>. But how does this happen? More precisely: How do we know whose voices we are hearing in a narrative? How do we decide if what we are ‘hearing’ (and this includes of course ‘reading’) is spoken by the narrator, by an actor (primary or secondary), or by some other (‘third’) party in a story? To better understand, and answer this question, the mode of narration and character presentation adopted by the author is pertinent. The author gets into the consciousness of the readers by the way the story is presented to attract emotions (catharsis) from the readers.</p> <p>Studies in narration show that the concept always has to do with emotion even though it is not expressly stated. Since emotion is a psychological concept, any attempt to relate narration and emotion in a literary analysis would also be approached from a psycho-analytic viewpoint. Collingwood argued that “art is the expression of emotions in languages such as prose, poetry, music, painting, and so on” (5). In a psychological experiment carried out to determine the relationship between narration and emotion, and which also shows that different narrative modes will draw different emotional experiences from the readers, Oatley (2003) in his <em>Communications to Self and Others</em> proposed that “when emotions are important but their experience is unclear, writers of fictional literature explore them by expressing them, and readers can benefit from this exploration and thereby improve their understanding of them” (211). Oatley goes further to argue that fiction is a kind of simulation: one that runs not on computers but on minds. “We could also call it imagination: of characters, their plans as they interact, and the emotions that occur when their plans meet vicissitudes” (211).He notes that there are two aspects of literary simulation. One is the simulation of the minds of other individuals (characters). This is imaginative mind-reading based on empathetic theory of mind. The other is understanding the complexities of social interaction. He exemplifies this by stating that if one learns to fly, one might spend time in a flight simulator, where one can learn more things, and learn them better, than in actual flying when much time is spent aloft with little happening. The skills one learns in the simulator then transfer to flying an actual airplane. Based on this analogy, Oatley et al. argued that people who read a lot of fiction would be better at theory-of-mind and other social abilities than those who read mainly non-fiction. </p> <p>Fiction allows entry to simulated social worlds, and the insertion of characters’ goals and plans into our own planning processors. As in ordinary life, the process is empathetic (identifying with characters). As in ordinary life, it has two parts. In one part, we impute emotions to another (a character). In this part, fiction is designed to enable us to imagine a character’s emotions and their causes. In the other part, having given up our own plans and concerns and, instead, taken on the goals and plans of the character, we experience our own emotions in response to the events that befall the character. Oatley et al.’s (2009) experiment with Anton Chekhov’s “The lady with the little dog,” which is widely regarded as one of the world’s greatest short stories, was used to determine the level of emotions that goes with narrative modes (fiction and non-fiction). It starts with a man who, while staying at a seaside resort, meets a woman he has seen walking with her dog. They begin an affair and at the end of their holiday they part and return to their spouses. But their feelings for each other become stronger and more important than anything else in their lives. The version in non-fictional format was written by Djikic as a report from a divorce court, with the same characters and events as Chekhov’s story. It was the same length and the same level of reading difficulty. Readers rated it just as interesting, though not as artistic, as Chekhov’s story. </p> <p>It was found that the personality traits of people who read Chekhov’s story changed significantly more than those of readers of the courtroom account. Changes were in different directions for different readers, and they were mediated by the emotions people experienced while reading. One may ask why readers find emotion or narrative empathy with the fictional version of the story but find little or no emotion with the same story in a court case divorce situation. An answer to such a question would probably lie in the writers’ method of narrative style of characterization or the diction employed in telling the same story. The researchers’ explanation is that, in their engagement with Chekhov’s story, readers experienced emotions (catharsis) with the protagonists: identified with them, felt emotions on their behalf, or perhaps felt disapproval, so that each in his or her own way was affected by them. Readers thus came to understand their emotions and themselves a bit better.                                                                            </p> <p>When we read fiction, our own emotions become important, far more so than the emotions of the characters. It is our own emotions that we seek to experience and understand: we would not read short stories and novels, or watch films and plays, which did not move us. Fiction offers simulated social worlds more various than could ever be encountered in everyday life, with characters realized in more detail than those of most people we encounter directly. In fiction, the readers can practice empathetic feeling by exploring their emotions in circumstances encountered by the characters, and thereby also understanding these characters. Reading fiction can, therefore, enhance skills of emotional intelligence (Caruso &amp; Salovey, 208).  As we practice experiencing emotions in the simulations of fiction, we improve our understanding of these experiences through the narrative style employed the writer.</p> <p>Narration is the imaginative way of telling the story of past events. Gerald Gennette defines narrative as “oral or written discourse that undertakes to tell an event or a series of events” (25). Discourse could be in the form of fiction or any other narrative forms like the essay, poetry, etc. The essay was once written deliberately as a piece of literature; its subject matter was of comparatively minor importance. Today most essays are written as expository, informative journalism, although there are still essayists in the great tradition who think of themselves as artists. Now, as in the past, some of the greatest essayists are critics of literature, drama, and the arts. Some personal documents (autobiographies, diaries, memoirs, and letters) rank among the world’s greatest literature. Some examples of this biographical literature were written with posterity in mind, others with no thought of their being read by anyone but the writer. Some are in a highly polished literary style; others, couched in a privately evolved language, win their standing as literature because of their cogency, insight, depth, and scope. One can conceive of Literature as a body of written works. The name has traditionally been applied to those imaginative works of poetry and prose distinguished by the intentions of their authors and the perceived aesthetic excellence of their execution. The narrative style employed by an author counts if the aesthetics of a work is to be considered and the value of such work accounted for. Thus, the art of narration can make or mar a particular work of art.</p> <p>Narration, according to Onochie, means “giving account of what happened in the past or what happens as a routine or custom. Simply, it means telling a story” (1). In a narration, the writer is poised to answer the question: “what happened” or “what happens?” In the process of answering the question, the writer describes how it happened or happens; and such a narration could be factual (i.e. autobiographies) or fictional or the combination of both. Narration, also, could be objective or impressionistic.</p> <p>As explained by Onochie (2), “objective narration is also called factual narration. As an expository mode of writing since its aim is to inform or educate, all forms of sentiment and prejudice should be avoided. All that is required is the hard fact.” This means that the writers feeling or impression is not allowed to interfere with the fact. On the other hand, impressionistic narrative tells a story from the point of view of the writer. It could be in the first person perspective where the writer is also a participant in the story, or in the third person where the writer is not directly involved in the event or story being narrated. The author is simply a witness or has heard or read or has imagined the story.                  However, the art of narration could employ both the objective and impressionistic narrations especially in the case of faction (combining fact and fiction). What is salient here is the idea that impressionistic narration is tied to the feelings and sentiments of the writer who creates an event or an already existing story in such a way that the readers are persuaded to think alongside the author. The ability to manipulate language or use appropriate diction to persuade is key to such a narrative. The audience must think and see things from the writer’s point of view; emotional empathy is achieved at the end of reading such a story.</p> <p>Emotions exert an incredibly powerful force on human behaviour. Strong emotions can cause one to take actions one might not normally perform, or avoid situations that one enjoys. A writer who is able to bring out emotions or sentimental feelings in his/her readers mind at the end of a literary work has achieved catharsis. Why exactly do readers have emotions after reading a piece of literature? In psychology, emotion is often defined as a complex state of feeling that results in physical and psychological changes that influence thought and behaviour. Emotionality is associated with a range of psychological phenomena including temperament, mood, and motivation. According to David Meyers (2), human emotion involves \"...physiological arousal, expressive behaviors, and conscious experience.\" Meyers noted that the major theories of emotion can be grouped into three main categories: physiological, neurological, and cognitive. Physiological theories suggest that responses within the body are responsible for emotions. Neurological theories propose that activity within the brain leads to emotional responses; while cognitive theories argue that thoughts and other mental activity play an essential role in forming emotions. The author is influenced by all or any of these theories because as a member of a society, the socio-political events that go on around him influences his mood and being, and this is in turn reflected in his mode of narration as he portrays the events of his time. An author who is negatively affected by societal happenings tends to influence his narration with emotions due to his choice of words or narrative mode. At the end of reading such a work, the author’s aim among other things is for the readers to perceive things from his viewpoint and share in his feelings by using language that endears his audience to his own angle of thought. Thus, the readers feel emotions after reading a piece as they conjure up images and situations portrayed by the author’s language. </p> <p>The author who adopts the right language or point of view in his/her narration ends up achieving empathy or narrative empathy (emotion) because the readers are in tuned to the world created, the perception formed and the message being passed. According to Taylor et al., narrative empathy is “the sharing of feeling and perspective-taking induced by reading, viewing, hearing, or imagining narratives of another’s situation and condition. Narrative empathy plays a role in the aesthetics of production when authors experience it” (376–77), in mental simulation during reading, in the aesthetics of reception when readers experience </p> <p>it, and in the narrative poetics of texts when formal strategies invite it. </p> <p>Susan Keen (169) observes that narrative empathy overarches narratological categories, involving actants, narrative situation, matters of pace and duration, and story world features such as settings. The diversity of the narratological concepts involved suggests that narrative empathy should not simply be equated with character identification nor exclusively verified by readers’ reports of identification. Character identification may invite narrative empathy; alternatively, spontaneous empathy with a fictional character may precede identification.  Empathetic effects of narrative have been theorized by literary critics, philosophers, and psychologists, and they have been evaluated by means of experiments in discourse processing, empirical approaches to narrative impact, and through introspection. Non-fictional narrative genres may involve narrative empathy, but most of the published commentary and theorizing on narrative empathy centers on fictional narratives, especially novels and film fiction, and to a lesser degree, drama. Brecht’s disdain for the evocation of audience empathy in favour of estrangement effects has had a lasting legacy, depressing the theorizing of reception in performance studies. Individual readers testify to greater or lesser intensities of emotional fusion with non-fictional subjects of autobiography, memoir, and history, contrasted with fictional characters. Whether non-fiction arouses greater or lesser empathy in individuals and in larger populations of </p> <p>readers and viewers is a question for future empirical work. </p> <p>Keen (12) notes that scholars have proposed some factors or elements adopted by writers in their narration that induce emotion in the readers. Elements thought to be involved in readers’ emotion include vivid use of settings and traversing of boundaries (Friedman 1998). Most of the existing empirical research on emotional effects in narration concerns film (Tan 1996; Zillman 1991) although a number of researchers are investigating potentially emotion-inducing techniques using short fiction. Novels and stage drama are least studied empirically (though often theorized about), their length and performance conditions being, respectively, at odds with the current modes of empirical verification. This study examines the idea of emotion in the narration of Achebe’s <em>There was a Country</em> and <em>Anthills of the Savannah</em> respectively.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>Every literature aims at informing or educating the readers by passing across certain messages thereby, instructing them to chart a course or change their orientation. The narrative style of a literary work is an important device that the writer explores to drive home his/her point thereby, convincing the readers to hold a particular belief or subscribe to a new idea. Either way, the author has succeeded in creating emotions in the minds of the readers who are persuaded to see things </p> <p>from the writer’s point of view.</p> <p>Emotion in narration tends to be persuasive and a good writer like Achebe who intends to persuade his audience to see things from his own vision must use language to create emotions in his writings. The issue or problem is that emotion affects the story we tell and this constitutes a problem. The problem to be solved in this study is to examine the two texts of study and demonstrate how emotions affect Achebe’s narration. Thus, this study focuses on the examination of emotion in the narration of Achebe’s<em>There was a Country</em> and <em>Anthills of the Savannah</em> respectively. </p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong> Aim/Objectives of Study</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research is to examine emotion in the narration of Achebe’s <em>There was a Country</em> and <em>Anthills of the Savannah</em>. The objective that will strengthen this study is to demonstrate that emotions affect narration. The study will discuss Achebe’s emotion in the narration of the two texts because as a member of society, he is also affected by the issues he tries to portray in his story telling. To get the readers to see things from his point of view, Achebe’s emotive tone that underlies his narration will be critically discussed. </p> <p>The study will also try to determine the effect of emotion in the narration of the texts. When a writer becomes too emotional in his/her narrative, the audience may perceive a lack of objectivism in the narration and this may attract criticism for the author. This study will examine how effective emotion helps in the interpretation of the two texts. </p> <p>Also, another objective of this research is to determine the narrative style of the two texts and discuss the emotive effects of such a style. The effective development of a particular narrative style may enhance the critical perception of the readers in becoming in tuned to the author’s viewpoint. On the other hand, a not well developed narrative style may defeat the aim of the author and negatively influence readers’ perception. </p> <p>The study will also evaluate the thematic concerns of the two texts and how emotion affects the development and portrayal of the themes. When the author becomes too emotional in his character and thematic presentation (narration), the readers may deduce subjective attempts by the author to report societal issues as he/she perceives them rather than how they really appear.</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong> Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The scope of this study is emotional narration which comes under the purview of literary psychoanalysis which interprets literary text from a psychological or mental point of view. This is because the topic of emotion is psychological and narration is relative to imagination. The research will use relevant studies from other domains to situate the view that emotion affects narration. However, in other to limit the scope of this study, this paper’s discussion covers the place of emotion in the narration of Achebe’s <em>There was a Country</em> and <em>Anthills of the Savannah</em>. </p> <p><strong>1.6</strong><strong> Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This research is significant for the following reasons:</p> <p>i.                   It will expose readers to the place of emotion in literary narration.</p> <p>ii.                 The study will discuss the relationship between emotion and narration in literature.</p> <p>iii.              It will also explore the effects of emotion in the narration of Achebe’s<em>There was a Country</em> and <em>Anthills of the Savannah</em>.</p> <p>iv.              The research will relate the two texts to contemporary society.</p> <p>v.                 It will serve as a source material to students, teachers and future researchers in similar topic.</p> <p>vi.              This research is also relevant for its contribution to literature in literary psychoanalysis.  </p> <p><strong>1.7 Methodology</strong></p> <p>The study is content analysis based and the psychoanalytic approach involving the concepts of emotion and narration will be adopted for analysis. These concepts cover two fields i.e. emotion is cognitive and narration is imaginative. This gives an indication that the best approach to the study is psychoanalysis. For obvious reasons, this approach allows for not only the analysis of themes, language and style but other aspects that revolve around emotion and narration. </p> <p><strong>1.8 Theoretical Framework</strong></p> <p>This study adopts the psychoanalytic theory which relates literary work in terms of character and actions to the workings of the mind. This theory relates to the Freudian psychology that interprets character’ actions to underlying complexes of the Id, Ego and Superego. These complexes influence character actions and determine their mood at any given time to create emotions and empathetic feelings towards other characters.</p> <p>          The author who narrates a story is also influenced by the workings of these complexes due to the influence of the socio-political contradictions that affect his society and narratives. The author in his narration reacts to these issues and sometimes, emotions come into play in the process of the story telling. </p> <p>          Achebe’s <em>There was a Country </em>and <em>Ant hills of the Savannah</em> are narratives that portray the happenings in the Nigerian society. In exploring these happenings, it is clear that the author’s emotion may interfere with his narration thereby affecting the objective level of the narration. These emotional features can be interpreted from character presentation and plotting which underlie the author’s perception on the societal happenings of his time. The idea of emotion in narration will be examined from the portrayal of the themes, language use and style of narrative adopted by the author, and how this affects readers’ interpretations. </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>2.0</strong><strong>                                 REVIEW OF LITERATURE </strong></p> <p><strong>2.1 Psycho-Analysis and Literary Appreciation</strong></p> <p>This section begins by giving relevant quotes which relate the idea of emotions to literary narrations as fictional works are a product of the author’s emotional reactions to negative societal issues.</p> <p>But what terrified me most –it was the seed of Marie’s blindness in Black Sunlight –was the sight of blind parents being led around by their five year old little girl –they had nowhere to stay –sometimes they slept in the stadium, sometimes at the railway station –(Dambudzo Marechera, 1983).</p> <p>The above epigram taken from “An Interview with Self’’ (1983) typifies how fictional narration comes out of emotion. In this instance, Marechera portrays the humiliating scene in former Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) whereby parents and their children were made homeless in their home land by the brutal regime of Ian Smith. Marechera speaks on how emotion arising from the scene becomes part of his novel, <em>Black Sunlight</em> in which dejection that is known to be abnormal is a normal condition. It is the so-called “normal condition” that drove Marechera to write about the degrading situation in the Zimbabwean society of his day. He also paints a bizarre picture of Zimbabwe in <em>The House of Hunger</em> (1978): “I got my things and left…I couldn’t have stayed on in that House of Hunger where every morsel of sanity was snatched from you the way some kinds of birds snatch food from the very mouths of babes” (11).The driving force behind the narrative is the intolerable situation in the country that has made the narrator to perceive the homeland as a ‘House of Hunger’. As the narrator paints the picture of dreamlike homeland, “what calls for elucidation are not the artistic and literary works themselves, but rather the psychopathology and biography of the artist, the writer or fictional characters (Freud, npn.) </p> <p>The place of Psychopathology, as noted by Freud above, explains the psychological conditions that underlie character behaviour, and the mental phenomena for the writer’s reactions to societal events which are recreated in the literary corpus. In this regard, the psychological reaction to societal happenings is manifested in the fictional narration which underlies the writer’s emotional response to real life events that are also expressed in a story’s character portrayals.</p> <p>Psychopathology, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica is “the scientific study of mental disorder, including efforts to understand their genetic, biological, psychological, and social causality; effective classification schemes (Nosology); course across all stages of developmental psychology; manifestations; and therapy. The term may also refer to the manifestation of behaviors that indicate the presence of a mental disorder.” (1225)</p> <p>According to the Online Wikipedia, “historically, the word psychopathology has a Greek origin: 'psyche' means \"soul\", 'pathos' is defined as \"suffering\", and 'logos' is \"the study of\". Wholly, psychopathology is defined as the origin of mental disorders, how they develop, and the symptoms they might produce in a person.” (6) Early explanations for mental illnesses were influenced by religious belief and superstitions. Psychological conditions that are now classified as mental disorders were initially attributed to possessions by evil spirits, demons, and the devil. This idea was widely accepted up until the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Individuals who suffered from these so-called \"possessions\" were tortured as treatment. Doctors used this technique in hoping to bring their patients back to sanity. Those who failed to return to sanity after torture were executed.</p> <p>The Greek physician, Nosology was one of the first to reject the idea that mental disorders were caused by possession of demons or the devil. He firmly believed the symptoms of mental disorders were due to diseases originating in the brain. Another Greek philosopher, Hippocrates suspected that these states of insanity were due to imbalances of fluids in the body. He identified these fluids to be four in particular: blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm. Hippocrates’ observations go to prove the idea that social problems may upset emotional bodily fluids leading to the negative mental reactions of a person. Furthermore, not far from Hippocrates, the philosopher Plato came to argue that the mind, body, and spirit worked as a unit. Any imbalance brought to these compositions of the individual could bring distress or lack of harmony within the individual. This philosophical idea would remain in perspectiveuntil the seventeenth century. </p> <p>Plato’s submissions above, suggest that the mind, body and spirit of man that worked in unison could only be at peace or sane when societal situations do not act as turbulence to their serenity. When things are going wrongly in society, they are bound to upset the emotional balance of man and this may affect behavioral patterns. When this happens, the writer may feel the need to react by releasing emotions using his/her literary narrations; while the characters presented in the fictional works may portray behaviours that could be considered as madness, mental phenomena or abnormalities, which are socially unacceptable.  </p> <p> In the nineteenth century, greatly influenced by Rousseau's ideas and philosophy, Austrian psychoanalyst, Sigmund Freud would bring about psychotherapy and become the father of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. Talking therapy originated from his ideas on the individual's experiences and the </p> <p>natural human efforts to make sense of the world and life.</p> <p>The scientific discipline of psychopathology was founded by Karl Jaspers in 1913, whose object of study was mental phenomena. Many different professions or disciplines have become involved in studying mental disorders or mental distress, and literature relates to Psychopathology through psychoanalysis by relating character actions to the workings of the minds or their mental conditions. According to the Online Wikipedia, before diagnosing a psychological disorder, “psychopathologists must study the themes, also known as abnormalities, within psychological disorders. The most prominent themes consist of: <em>deviance, distress, dysfunction and danger</em>.

Through the instrumentality of language, man identifies and make finding about his environment.</p> <p>Thus, language, in the hand of man preserves, conserves, transmits and appropriates functions and does so across space and time, thereby enabling him to overcome those physical limitations to human endeavours and achievements.</p> <p>Armed with his linguistic tool, man appropriates all that others before him have acquired, persuades and convince others to his line of reasoning and action, deceives and dominates others, controls his entire environment and exploits whatever is found therein, and also achieves as much as it is within his capacity.</p> <p>The problems of man's development and growth become increasingly complex and intricate when the individual is not monolingual and mono-cultural. The failure of any development programme becomes greater and more dismal when the individual has got to operate within a multilingual and multi-cultural community. It is these problems which Nigeria encounters as a result of her multilingual and multi-cultural composition that this research intends to highlight. At the end of the exercise solutions will be proffered in order to help solve the challenges we have as country.</p> <p><strong>1.1       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Inspite of all efforts to unite and develop society such as Nigeria politically, economically and socially, the state remains an under developed state. This is due to her multilingual and multicultural nature. Language pluralism has generated a lot of problems in the state. Prominent among them include; </p> <p>The communication gap between the various people, each sees his own language as important, thus creating an impediment to commerce and industry. A warped sense of nationhood whereby genuine unity becomes difficult due to suspicion as various ethnic groups pursue selfish and sectional interests. Picking a national language that is acceptable to the people therefore, becomes difficult.         </p> <p><strong>1.2       HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>The hypotheses of study are</p> <p>(a)     Language is a hindrance to national unity</p> <p>(b)        Language is an instrument for National development</p> <p>(c)        How is language diversity a deciding factor toward national development?</p> <p><strong>1.3        AIMS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of the research is to discover the effect of linguistic plurality in a given multi-ethnic society like Nigeria, particularly in Nasarawa State where I live and the University of Abuja where I school. It  also intends to prove the success or failure of any society. And if language diversity has helped in national growth and development, such as economic, social, political, religious growth, and educational advancement of mankind.

The study is also significant because it will contribute to many of the existing works in this regard especially for both academic and social utilization respectively. It is also significant because it will provide the picture of the issue in question from the perspective of a university community.</p> <p><strong>1.6       METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The methodology of the research is empirical in nature, in which the researcher intends to administer questionnaire as well as an observation within the chosen area of the study being University of Abuja, FCT</p> <p>The respondents to be administered with the questionnaire are selected through single random selection method of one out of every ten respondents in the delimited areas of the research.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW </strong></p> <p><strong>2.1       INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p>The inadequate level of attention that has often been given to the language situation in Nigeria tends to reflect on the level of general development. Nigeria is one of the countries with the largest number of indigenous languages. This situation should be seen as blessings rather than a curse. Contrary to this expectation, countries of this nature has rather turned into ethnic and religious struggles.</p> <p>Considering the multilingual and cultural differences, the issue, of adopting an indigenous national language in Nigeria is described as complex in reality. The relevance of language to development of any society cannot be over emphasized.Developmentcannot be achieved in any society unless the linguistics reality of such a society is put into play.</p> <p>It is evident that different languages in Nigeria coexisted in peace before the advent of the colonial masters which brought together the diverse socio-cultural, backgrounds into one fold through the amalgamation of Nigeria in 1914. This act resulted into the imposition of English language as an official language in Nigeria Adenipekun, (2010).</p> <p>In reality, there are two possible reasons that neglect language issues. The first reason is that development is often conceived of in a rather narrow turn to the calculation of the Gross Domestic Product and Gross National Product and other economics metrics of income.</p> <p>The consequence of this quantitative approach to development are that economic indicators are often erroneously equated with national development and societal well-being. In this narrow sense, the role of language in national development may rather be seen as a bit too marginal to be taken into reality.The second challenge is why the language issue has not featured well in Nigeria’s development discourse. This is as a result of the nature and role of language in the society which is often completely misunderstood. Probably, it may be from the irresponsible declarations of some Nigeria writers and intellectuals. However, Nigerian languages can be used for effective expressions, irrespective of the diverse cultural situation.</p> <p>Contesting all these positions and challenges, this chapter therefore reviews the concept of “Multilingualism” and other concepts relevant to the topic of the research. It covers; Meaning of Language, Characteristics of Language, Strengths and Weakness of Language Diversity, National Development, National Language and Theoretical Framework.</p> <p><strong>2.2       MEANING OF LANGUAGE   </strong></p> <p>Language is considered to be a system of communicating with people using sounds, symbols and words in expressing a meaning, idea or thought. Language can be used in many forms, primarily through oral and written communications as well as using expressions through body language.Manyanimals and even plant species communicate with each other. Humans are not unique in this capability.</p> <p>Language is the means by which man communicates his thoughts and ideas. It is man's most efficient means of communication it is central and most integral to humanity and as AdegbijiAdesoji (1989) puts it, … “lt is the skin in which aspirations are couched, the skin of thought and the flesh of the mind.” (3) That means language as we can see, is a double edged sword capable of keeping a people together as well as tearing them apart.Languageis therefore both a uniting and disuniting force.According to Bloch Bernard and Trager George (1942) “Language is a system of arbitrary vocal symbols by means of which a social group cooperates' this definition stresses the unifying function in the society. (5)</p> <p>To William Labov (1968), language is the institution whereby humans communicate and interact with another by means of habitually oral auditory symbols. (158)Sapir cited in David (2008)</p> <p><strong>Language is purely human and non-instructive method of communicating ideas, emotions and thoughts by the means of the system of voluntarily produced symbols. (4)</strong></p> <p>That is, everyday use of language involves several different senses. At its most specific level, it may refer to the concrete act of speaking emotional and thought in a given situation language, however, is a distinctively human system of communication, based on oral and written symbols. It is a Pan-human development a behavoural aspect of human beings which serves as a point of differentiation from animals.</p> <p>Sweet, cited in Obisakin, (1993) describes language as the expression of ideas by means of speech sounds combined into words. Words are combined into sentences. This combination answering to that of ideas into thought. (17)</p> <p>Aristotle, cited in Obisakin (1993)</p> <p><strong><em>Language is the universal code ofcommunication that fosters exchange</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>and expression of thoughts feelings andideas among humans (17)</em></strong></p> <p>On his part, Obisakin, (1993) defines language as a mode of expression, a manner of expressing thought or feeling which make communication possible (18)</p> <p>Harold (1981) sees language as the medium through which thoughts are conveyed from one person to another.</p> <p>TrudgillPeter (1974) argues that:</p> <p><strong><em>Language is not simply a means of communicating information about the weather or any other subject It is also very important means of establishing and maintaining relationships between other people (Pp16)</em></strong></p> <p>Atchison cited in Yusuf (2006) describes language as </p> <p><strong><em>a patterned system of arbitrary sound symbols, whose characteristic features of displacement,            cultural transmission, productivity and duality are rare or absent in animal communication</em></strong> (106)</p> <p>Although, language is a means of communication yet it is not secondary to It but equally important, Kenneth Kaye, an American paediatrician views language as a vital tool for communication.</p> <p>Language does not exist merely for the sakeof naming things, nor does it exist for the sake of propositions about the world. It consists of interpersonal communication about shared and sharable intentions.Communication, which is a social need, an economic requirement and a political necessity, is partly achieved through language It may be difficult to precisely communicate ideas without a vocal language, as it may be difficult to achieve development without communication. Hence language is the basis instrument for any recordable development</p> <p><strong>2.3</strong>       <strong>CHARACTERISTIC OF LANGAUGE</strong></p> <p>By characteristic of language we mean the peculiar features or properties by which language can be identified, and how language is seen as away or a medium of communication, Harold (1981) clarified the characteristics of language as follows</p> <p><strong>2.3.1    Language is a System of Speech Sound</strong></p> <p>Language is primarily a speech act. One of the basic features of all human language is vocalization that is, production of meaningful organized \"noise\" or sound verbalization or talking is therefore a feature of all human language. In fact, language can even be seen as \"the speech of man\" different from other systems of communications.</p> <p><strong>2.3.2    It is Acquiredfrom Childhood</strong></p> <p>Another important characteristic of every human language is that it is acquired as the child grows from childhood to adulthood. It is an acquired behaviour from generation to generation, in other word, language behaviours has to be acquired, although researches have proved that humans are born with innate ability to learn any language without being taught. The belief is that nobody is born with the ability to speak a particular language. For example, no child has the ability from birth to learn Hausa language.</p> <p><strong>2.3.3    Language is Dynamic </strong></p> <p>Like all other aspects of human culture, language is subject to change. Our material culture like tools, utensils, cloths, does change with time. The non-materials aspects like language will also vary from one generation to another. Change should be seen therefore as a general attributes of all language In other words, all languages are creative and openended New words come into being and some die out Thus language indeed is dynamic, this change is sometimes fast or slow, radical or superficial but it goes on all the time.</p> <p><strong>2.3.4. It is Conventional</strong></p> <p>All human languages are codified. They have a code, a kind of unspoken or unwritten public agreement by the community which uses the language that certain things should be done in certain ways. In other words, every language has grammar. Grammar here is used to mean the description of the ways in which the language uses patterns of structure to convey meaning. The essence of language is communication, that is, communication cannot take place where everybody insists on using his own arbitrary names for things, objects or ideas. Every language therefore, must have a code that is acceptable and meaningful to all users of that language.</p> <p><strong>2.3.5  It is Complex and Systematic</strong></p> <p>Every human language is complex and systematic. Every language has very complicated yet systematic multiple structures to enable it communicate infinite number of messages made up of a small number of vocal signals.</p> <p>Human language is also unique in the sense that it has its own structure, its own system of organizing its component units, into a meaningful pattern. In other words, there are rules governing the organization of sentences such as rule of tense and concord.Language as a social phenomenon.  Thus, it is considered in the social context as the basic ingredient of social interaction, however, the importance of communication to human has however been emphasized by American writer Paul Goodman....... \"Speaking is a commitment not only to a human relationship with the one spoken to, but also to the existence of the thing spoken about.  </p> <p><strong>2.4       Multilingualism (Language Diversity)</strong></p> <p>Multilingualism is taken to mean the same with language diversity. Multilingualism or language diversity is sociolinguisticallyused to describe situation where two or more languages exist within the bounds of one society.Elugbe Ben (1990) says multilingualism        involves balanced, native-like command of all the languages in the repertoire is rather uncommon.         It is a purely sociolinguistic and socio-cultural phenomenon in which more than one language exists in society.</p> <p><strong><em>The term given to the linguistic situation where two or more languages co-exist within the bounds of one society, or are kept in constant contact by politically and economically determined interest (p170-176).</em></strong></p> <p>In line with the above definition, Akindele Femi and Adegbite Wale (1992) see Nigeria as a typical example of a multilingual and a diverse society. According to them, Nigeria is made up of \"more than 250 ethnic groups, with a conservative estimate of languages, each with its culture and behavioural pattern\". Despite a recent history of tribal rivalry among some of the ethnic groups, they all continue to exist within the bounds of the country. Based on this argument they conclude that Nigeria is therefore a multilingual and multi-cultural speech community where, apart from the different indigenous languages, there are foreign languages and cultures such as English, French and even Latin (the CatholicChurch Hymns).</p> <p>Since ethnic lines follow linguistic diversity, the great variety of languages in Nigeria tends to suggest that Nigeria is an assembly of ethnic nationalities.</p> <p>It is in recognition of Nigeria's multilingual and multi-ethnic nature and attendant problems that a veteran Nigeria nationalist, late Chief ObafemiAwolowo, advocated strict federation for Nigeria and highlighted the linguistic factor in shaping the federal structure. (16-17)</p> <p>Dada (2001) quotes Awolowo further:</p> <p><strong><em>\"We are not only diverse in language and in racial affinity, but we are also diverse in manner of our political evolution, there was not that political cohesion in our relationship, and there was no relationship of a political type between all the ethnic groups and linguistic groups in the country until the European came.\" (4)</em></strong></p> <p>Scholars and language researchers working within the field of inter-group relations and speech variations have their own opinions' and views about language and ethnicity. Fishman (1977) and Giles (1980) contend very strongly that language plays a dominant role in inter-group and ethnic relation. They assert that it is expected that members of an ethnic-group seeking social and psycholinguistic distinctiveness will invariable accentuate the ethnic marketers in  their speech by exhibiting remarkable speech \"divergence\" Instead of \"convergence\" in a similar VIEW, lfeinKlevian (1979) further confirms the interrelation between language and ethnic identity, He observes that members of any speech community that share one common language usually have a feeling of belonging to a particular ethnic group and all other speech communities with whom direct linguistic communication is not possible are automatically regarded as aliens.</p> <p>Ogbulogo (1991) views language diversity as a result of multiple languages which Nigeria has and he further says that with the diversity of language, it has brought unity to our country, because a Yoruba man, who is from the western part of the country, can be accepted in the eastern part because of his ability of speaking their language. He further says that Nigeria could be a very great country, in any way some persons have described her as the \"United States of Africa\" This is no exaggeration, but often seems appropriate as a description of her potentials in terms of resources, Nigeria is potentially one of the greatest countries in the world The resources of men, languages, materials and money are sufficient to place her among the top twenty nations of the world.Unfortunately, she is not tapping her potentials. This is because among other problems such as indiscipline, Nigeria has language problems which have dwarfed and drowned her progress. This negative aspect of Nigeria is well brought out by Professor Tamuno, </p> <p>Tekenathe former Vice-Chancellor of the University of lbadan in his valedictory address;Kayode (1987)</p> <p><strong><em>\"From one Institution to another, from one sector of our national activities to another, from one community to another, we observe this pathetic phenomenon all things bright and beautiful, all creatures great and small, all things wise and wonderful, Nigeria kills them all,”(1)</em></strong></p> <p>On Nigeria multilingual problems, Adejo(2002)        in \"Journal of faculty of Arts Seminar Series\" BSU, MakurdiVol 1, reviews Adam (2002).. ……</p> <p><strong><em>\"God in His infinite Wisdom made our dear country a rain-bow collection of tribes and tongues. The rainbow in the sky is a thing of beauty. But we seem blind to the beauty in our rainbow collection of tribes and tongues. Instead, we find mutual suspicion, hate and fear in other tongue and tribes. Consequently several parts of our country are today convulsed in inter and intra-ethnic conflicts leading to loss of lives as well as the destruction of private and public property. The gun is beginning to rule and ruin our country\" (248)</em></strong></p> <p>Indeed, the gun is beginning to rule and ruin our country as past and present ethnic crisis have shown, for example, the Nigerian-Biafra War, Plateau and Nasarawa and the subsequent invasion of Benue State by Nigerian Army in 2001. The Udi problem and other ethnic Militias disturbances, OduaPeoples Congress (OPC), ljaw-Egbesu, and lgbo'sBakass, Boys are all signs of inherent tension in the polity.</p> <p><strong>2.4.1 Plurality (Origin)</strong>There are many myths and theories on the origin of plurality and some are discussed below.</p> <p>One of the earliest accounts of the origin of language plurality is the Biblical story of the \"tower of Babel\" According to this myth as captured in Genesis Chapter II, verse I - 9, the whole world at that time had only one language. The people then decided to build a tower that would reach up to heaven, but this did not please the Lord who reasoned that because the people had a common language, it was easy for them to join together to do anything they wanted to. In terms of modern political thinking maybe they could even have attempted a coup detat so the Lord decided to confound their language and scatter them all over the face of the earth.Bamgbose, Ayo (1994).</p> <p>The second account of the origin of language diversity is captured by Karl Marx and Fasold Engels (1949). In their work entitled \"The origin of the family, private property and the State\", Engels lays down the three stages in the development of man: savagery, barbarism and civilization.(6)</p> <p>Describing the lower stage in the development of human society vagery (the infancy of the human race), Engels points out that the formation of articulate speech was the main achievement of the period. The era of barbarism followed, when more progress was made in production than in all the previous stages put together. The emergent tribes came within this period.</p> <p>Under the tribal system, language was closely connected with the tribe, the highest organizational unit of which the members were aware of their mutual kingship. Engels points out that \"infact, tribe and dialects are substantially coextensive\" and the tribe is identifiable by its peculiar dialect.</p> <p>At this stage there also came a rapid increase of the population and dense population in small areas. In quest of a living, the tribesmen had to go to other grey able and pasture lands. Those sections that have severed relations with their tribe eventually began to speak a bit different from their former kinsmen This split in tribes led to splits in their languages (9-12).</p> <p><strong>2.5       STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF LANGUAGE DIVERSITY</strong></p> <p>Since Nigeria is a diverse state in terms of language and culture, a language in a diverse society like \"Nigeria\" also performs both administrative and official needs. Where people working together even though they are not of the same ethnic background, but because of the speaking of other languages which is not their own, they can communicate without using English language.</p> <p>Language diversity brings unity, increase awareness, it foster understanding and encourages partnership both economically and politically.</p> <p>The first problem of language diversity is that, it kills indigenous language, it causes regional variations in language, it destroys the tendencies of Lingua Franca and there will be no ethnic unity. When a society has many languages and dialects like the tower of Babel, mutual understanding becomes very difficult. This has been one of the causes of bitterness and suspicion in almost every part of Nigeria, as what one says, is often misinterpreted and misunderstood by his neighbours It also breeds faviouritsm, nepotism, tribalism and other social ills which will result to disunity, because many in Nigeria have the propensity to favour their own linguistic group No wonder, it is a common place to see and hear people greeting an occupant of an office in their native language in an attempt to win favour.</p> <p><strong>2.6       NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (DIFFERENT VIEWS</strong>)</p> <p>Recent events across Nigeria's geo-political zones have shown anIncrease in ethnic agitations activism and militancy. The ethnic minorities in the multi-ethnic Nigerian nation have suddenly found fresh zeal to express their long standing grievances. National development is one of the improvement in a country, is an umbrella term which is used to mean a situation where we can adequately utilize our diverse resources.</p> <p>Most times, it could be natural or human resources with the aim of benefiting things. It is a situation where people have the resource at their disposal to have a meaningful development, the people may be from different cultural backgrounds with diverse language and different values sentiments are put aside in a bid to work together towards the national development for the betterment and growth of their economy.</p> <p>Scholars in the field of language have variously defined development, and one of such definitions is that which sees it \"as economic growth and social change\" Opubor (1985) views development in human society as a many sided process. At the individual's level, it implies increased skill and capacity, greater freedom, creativity, self discipline, responsibility and material well being.</p> <p>The achievement of any of those aspects of personal development is very much tied to the state of the society as a whole. That means national development has much to do with how people are united in a country.</p> <p>Economic development is an improvement in material welfare,  especially for persons with the lowest incomes the eradication of mass poverty with its correlates of illiteracy Kindleberger and Herrick, (1977). And in social development, we see how it has improved the social wellbeing of the citizen especially as a nation. Although, national development used to be measured in terms of increase in the Gross Domestic Products (GDP) of a country.Emphasisis now placed on the content of the GDP as well as other indicators of the quality of life to see how and whether our economy has increased or decreased such indicators. Manley, (1991), summarizes development as constitutes about development as it has to do with the development of the productive forces. It has to do with the harnessing of those forces to build viable societies. National development rangesfrom growth in areas of politics, economy, science and technology, education, health and securityand also the aspect of language.</p> <p>Language plays an important role in national development as it fosters understanding, unity and sense of belonging among the various members of the different ethnic and social groups that constitute a nation.</p> <p>Language development is a multi-disciplinary field that has as its central question how is language learnt because language is highly complex yet universally acquired; the answer to this question has profound implications for understanding the essential nature of the human mind.</p> <p><strong>2.7       NATIONAL LANGUAGE</strong></p> <p>Writing on the importance of a national language in the educational development of a nation, Umaru .B. Ahmed in his article entitled: \"the cultural content in Nigeria Education: The Language Curriculum in Ekeh Peter and Ashiwaju, G. (ed), Panel on Nigeria since independence History Project (1989) quotes SekouToure, the late President of Guinea as saying that:</p> <p><strong><em>The use of national language is the most efficient means to make it educationally operative          the use of national language makes it possible to extend education to all people.</em></strong> (32)</p> <p>Similarly, he quotes Babs Fafunwa, a onetime Minister of Education in Nigeria as saying:<strong><em>It is universally accepted except in most African countries that a child learns best in his mother tongue and that mother tongue is natural to him as the mother's milk. (32)</em></strong></p> <p>It is in line with this belief that the education of the child is meaningless without his mother tongue that the federal government of Nigeria came out with some pronouncements as evidenced in the National Policy on Education. According to (NPE 1989), the government appreciates the importance of language in the educational process and as a means of preserving the people's culture. (19)</p> <p>A nation without a language of its own will lose its self-respect in the eye of the world. If this is anything to go by, then Nigeria should be the most respected country in the world, because of her many languages for a nation to function properly she has to choose a national language, this is what Nigeria has failed to do since independence because of her multilingual and multi-ethnic composition. The mechanisms for implementing national policy on education are only sound, their successes are unrealistic in the face of multiple languages to choose, secondly, the use of all the languages simultaneously is not possible, thirdly, if the choice is easy to make in the rural areas, it is</p> <p>not possible to do that in urban centers because of the multilingual nature of the society that reflects in the society that reflects in the urban schools population.In the face of this dilemma, coupled with the reflection of colonial English, many Nigerians have proposed Pidgin English as an alternative, but pidgin has its own problems. For one, it lacks standardization ordinarily, the pidgin spoken in Lagos has a Yoruba flavour, while that of Enugu differs from that of Kaduna according to Akinyele, R. F. (2000), DejiOlaiya's love for \"pidgin English\" once compelled him to compile and publish \"A Dictionary of Broken English in 1995. But while reviewing it, TaiwoAmodu, the reviewer said \"the text, though enduring, generates some linguistic puzzles\".</p> <p>Also in 1982, one Mr. Alex Igbineweka of the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) Lagos, invented an artificial language called GUOSA and hastily recommended it for Nigeria in his belief, that GUOSA could redeem the nation from oppression, tribalism, sectionalism and hatred, Punch 22nd October, 1982. But an expert opinion suggest that the energy expended on \"GUOSA\" was misdirected, Bamgbose (1985). The observation is thatGUOSA is an amalgamation of words of existing language and that the author fails to indicate that each time we want to form new sentence or pronounce words, we have to run helter skelter, looking for Mr. lgbineweka, the language originator.</p> <p>In the language debate of 1977, Wole Soyinka also suggested \"Swahili\" as the lingua franca for Africa during the festival of Arts and Culture for Black Africa (FESTAC). His argument was that since \"Swahili\" is not associated with any ethnic group in Nigeria, the danger of ethnic domination is automatically eliminated Bamgbose, (1985) has observed that the superimposition of the proposal is not compatible with the idea of policy of education in mother tongue (100). It is also in the belief that Nigeria would not make any meaningful strides without adoption of an indigenous language, or national official language that calls .have also been made by more Nigerians to adopt one. In the National House of Assembly, debate of 21 November, 1961 M. Al-batanYerima, called on the federal government to introduce Hausa, Yoruba and lgbo and other languages into institutions of learning with a view to adopting one of them as a national official language. The motion was seconded by Mr. G. D. O. Eneh who stressed the role of a national language in promoting harmony in \"multilingualand multicultural society\". The same consideration encouraged M D. N. Orosanye and Baba Shehu Ibrahim to propose the adoption of Hausa as a language of unity. But these parliamentarians had hardly finished the proposal when opposition reared its ugly head. The minority ethnic members of the House feared that the majority ethnic groups were planning to dominate the country. Chief Anthony Enahoro, a minority champion vehemently condemned the majority of the proposal extolled the value of English language as a unifying factor.</p> <p><strong>2.8       THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK.            </strong>.</p> <p>In linguistics, different approaches are used in the study of language. Those approaches include the functional approach, systemic approach, traditional approach and the socio-linguistic approach.          </p> <p>We believe that no one framework can be ideal to a study such as this. Thus, much as we may want to adopt an ecleptic approach to this research, we are however better placed to accommodate or use the ethnography of communication theory whose main proponent is Dell Hymes (Babatunde and Adeyanju, n.d.)</p> <p>According to Dell Hymes (in Babatunde and Adeyanju, n.d. the ethnography of communication theory is:</p> <p><strong><em>how the conventions of language use relate to other aspects of social behaviour. It refers to a speaker's knowledge of what variety of language to use in what situation, how to vary style with the audience addressed, when to speak or remain silent, when and what kinds of gesture are required with what speech.  P(32)</em></strong></p> <p>Furthermore, looking at the theory, we would see that language and culture are inseparable, they are interwoven. This of course, is the major preoccupation of this field of sociolinguistic, to which this theory is one among others that are used to discuss sociolinguistic findings (see Babatunde Shola and Adeyanju,  Dele(ed)(527 —534).</p> <p>According to Babatunde Shola andAdeyanju Dele(ed): (2002) the ethnography of communication theory revolves around the various factors that affect speaking a language in an ethno-linguistically diverse society like Nigeria. Therefore, the theory is encapsulated into the word <strong>SPEAKING</strong> which is seen as an acronym for the following:</p> <p>S          -           Setting of a speech event, i.e. the time and place of the </p> <p>                        communicative event.</p> <p>P          -           Participants in the communicative content i.e. speakers and </p> <p>                        hearers (interlocutors).</p> <p>E          -           Ends i.e. the conventionally recognized outcome of a linguistic        exchange as well as the goals of interlocutors in a particular     communicative context.</p>\n\nLANGUAGE AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT: CHALLENGES AND IMPEDIMENTS IN A MULTILINGUAL SOCIETY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " LANGUAGE AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT: CHALLENGES AND IMPEDIMENTS IN A MULTILINGUAL SOCIETY", "id": 138}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong><em>ABSTRACT</em></strong></p> <p><em>This research work focuses on the Effect of Language Diversity on National Development. It adopts descriptive and comparative approaches in analyzing the nature of Language and the policy situation in Nigeria, considering in clear terms the complex ethno linguistics setting. Sequel to the look warm attitudes of both governments over the years, the research therefore evaluates the value of an effective language policy and implementation to the development of nations across the globe.On the foregoing, the research identifies the low level of technology and science development in Nigeria as a product of purposelessness approaches in language policy making and implementation. The study observes that, little or no functional language policy exists in Nigeria even at the age of 50 years of independence.Recourse to this, Nigerian languages ought to be central to national development and should occupy an important place in the development discourse. In line with these and many more, the study recommends that urgent attention and responsibilities ought to be given to language experts (linguists) in making language policies and possible implementation strategies for the country. This research further advocates for a national language system, however, calls for the adoption of respective indigenous languages for vocational training at their given speech communities. The Nigerian Pidgin English has the likely majority of speakers and need to be developed to the status of a national language alongside English. These positions can only be achieved if our central policy maker (government) is sincere with the reality on ground and avoid mere political interest and propaganda.</em></p>

ONE </strong></p> <p><strong>1.0       BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Human Beings are social animals and language is an instrument of the society which is acculturated into a given society. Through the instrumentality of language, man identifies and make finding about his environment.</p> <p>Thus, language, in the hand of man preserves, conserves, transmits and appropriates functions and does so across space and time, thereby enabling him to overcome those physical limitations to human endeavours and achievements.</p> <p>Armed with his linguistic tool, man appropriates all that others before him have acquired, persuades and convince others to his line of reasoning and action, deceives and dominates others, controls his entire environment and exploits whatever is found therein, and also achieves as much as it is within his capacity.</p> <p>The problems of man's development and growth become increasingly complex and intricate when the individual is not monolingual and mono-cultural. The failure of any development programme becomes greater and more dismal when the individual has got to operate within a multilingual and multi-cultural community. It is these problems which Nigeria encounters as a result of her multilingual and multi-cultural composition that this research intends to highlight. At the end of the exercise solutions will be proffered in order to help solve the challenges we have as country.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>1.1       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Inspite of all efforts to unite and develop society such as Nigeria politically, economically and socially, the state remains an under developed state. This is due to her multilingual and multicultural nature. Language pluralism has generated a lot of problems in the state. Prominent among them include; </p> <p>The communication gap between the various people, each sees his own language as important, thus creating an impediment to commerce and industry. A warped sense of nationhood whereby genuine unity becomes difficult due to suspicion as various ethnic groups pursue selfish and sectional interests. Picking a national language that is acceptable to the people therefore, becomes difficult.         </p> <p><strong>1.2       HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>The hypotheses of study are</p> <p>(a)     Language is a hindrance to national unity</p> <p>(b)        Language is an instrument for National development</p> <p>(c)        How is language diversity a deciding factor toward national development?</p> <p><strong>1.3        AIMS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of the research is to discover the effect of linguistic plurality in a given multi-ethnic society like Nigeria, particularly in Nasarawa State where I live and the University of Abuja where I school. It  also intends to prove the success or failure of any society. And if language diversity has helped in national growth and development, such as economic, social, political, religious growth, and educational advancement of mankind. The study also hopes to attempt in resolving the issue of “lingua Franca” </p> <p><strong>1.4       SCOPE AND DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of the research is on the use of language to achieve national development especially in a multilingual environment which is delimited to the sociolinguistics of language and society.</p> <p><strong>1.5       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>The importance of this study is that it will showcase how to promote ethnic harmony among all linguistically and ethnically diverse communities in Nigeria. The study is also significant because it will contribute to many of the existing works in this regard especially for both academic and social utilization respectively. It is also significant because it will provide the picture of the issue in question from the perspective of a university community.</p> <p><strong>1.6       METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The methodology of the research is empirical in nature, in which the researcher intends to administer questionnaire as well as an observation within the chosen area of the study being University of Abuja, FCT</p> <p>The respondents to be administered with the questionnaire are selected through single random selection method of one out of every ten respondents in the delimited areas of the research.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW </strong></p> <p><strong>2.1       INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p>The inadequate level of attention that has often been given to the language situation in Nigeria tends to reflect on the level of general development. Nigeria is one of the countries with the largest number of indigenous languages. This situation should be seen as blessings rather than a curse. Contrary to this expectation, countries of this nature has rather turned into ethnic and religious struggles.</p> <p>Considering the multilingual and cultural differences, the issue, of adopting an indigenous national language in Nigeria is described as complex in reality. The relevance of language to development of any society cannot be over emphasized.Development cannot be achieved in any society unless the linguistics reality of such a society is put into play.</p> <p>It is evident that different languages in Nigeria coexisted in peace before the advent of the colonial masters which brought together the diverse socio-cultural, backgrounds into one fold through the amalgamation of Nigeria in 1914. This act resulted into the imposition of English language as an official language in Nigeria Adenipekun, (2010).</p> <p>In reality, there are two possible reasons that neglect language issues. The first reason is that development is often conceived of in a rather narrow turn to the calculation of the Gross Domestic Product and Gross National Product and other economics metrics of income.</p> <p>The consequence of this quantitative approach to development are that economic indicators are often erroneously equated with national development and societal well-being. In this narrow sense, the role of language in national development may rather be seen as a bit too marginal to be taken into reality.</p> <p>The second challenge is why the language issue has not featured well in Nigeria’s development discourse. This is as a result of the nature and role of language in the society which is often completely misunderstood. Probably, it may be from the irresponsible declarations of some Nigeria writers and intellectuals. However, Nigerian languages can be used for effective expressions, irrespective of the diverse cultural situation.</p> <p>Contesting all these positions and challenges, this chapter therefore reviews the concept of “Multilingualism” and other concepts relevant to the topic of the research. It covers; Meaning of Language, Characteristics of Language, Strengths and Weakness of Language Diversity, National Development, National Language and Theoretical Framework.</p> <p><strong>2.2       MEANING OF LANGUAGE   </strong></p> <p>Language is considered to be a system of communicating with people using sounds, symbols and words in expressing a meaning, idea or thought. Language can be used in many forms, primarily through oral and written communications as well as using expressions through body language.Many animals and even plant species communicate with each other. Humans are not unique in this capability.</p> <p>Language is the means by which man communicates his thoughts and ideas. It is man's most efficient means of communication it is central and most integral to humanity and as Adegbiji  Adesoji (1989) puts it, … “lt is the skin in which aspirations are couched, the skin of thought and the flesh of the mind.” (3) That means language as we can see, is a double edged sword capable of keeping a people together as well as tearing them apart.Language is therefore both a uniting and disuniting force.</p> <p>According to Bloch Bernard and Trager George (1942) “Language is a system of arbitrary vocal symbols by means of which a social group cooperates' this definition stresses the unifying function in the society. (5)</p> <p>To William Labov (1968), language is the institution whereby humans communicate and interact with another by means of habitually oral auditory symbols. (158)Sapir cited in David (2008)</p> <p><strong>Language is purely human and non-instructive method of communicating ideas, emotions and thoughts by the means of the system of voluntarily produced symbols. (4)</strong></p> <p>That is, everyday use of language involves several different senses. At its most specific level, it may refer to the concrete act of speaking emotional and thought in a given situation language, however, is a distinctively human system of communication, based on oral and written symbols. It is a Pan-human development a behavoural aspect of human beings which serves as a point of differentiation from animals.</p> <p>Sweet, cited in Obisakin, (1993) describes language as the expression of ideas by means of speech sounds combined into words. Words are combined into sentences. This combination answering to that of ideas into thought. (17)</p> <p>Aristotle, cited in Obisakin (1993)</p> <p><strong><em>Language is the universal code of</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>communication that fosters exchange</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>and expression of thoughts feelings and</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em> ideas among humans (17)</em></strong></p> <p>On his part, Obisakin, (1993) defines language as a mode of expression, a manner of expressing thought or feeling which make communication possible (18)</p> <p>Harold (1981) sees language as the medium through which thoughts are conveyed from one person to another.</p> <p> Trudgill Peter (1974) argues that:</p> <p><strong><em>Language is not simply a means of communicating information about the weather or any other subject It is also very important means of establishing and maintaining relationships between other people (Pp16)</em></strong></p> <p>Atchison cited in Yusuf (2006) describes language as </p> <p><strong><em>a patterned system of arbitrary sound symbols, whose characteristic features of displacement,            cultural transmission, productivity and duality are rare or absent in animal communication</em></strong> (106)</p> <p>Although, language is a means of communication yet it is not secondary to It but equally important, Kenneth Kaye, an American paediatrician views language as a vital tool for communication.</p> <p><strong><em>Language does not exist merely for the sake</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>of naming things. Nor does it exist for the sake of propositions about the world it consists of interpersonal communication about shared and sharable intentions</em></strong></p> <p>Communication, which is a social need, an economic requirement and a political necessity, is partly achieved through language It may be difficult to precisely communicate ideas without a vocal language, as it may be difficult to achieve development without communication. Hence language is the basis instrument for any recordable development</p> <p><strong>2.3</strong>       <strong>CHARACTERISTIC OF LANGAUGE</strong></p> <p>By characteristic of language we mean the peculiar features or properties by which language can be identified, and how language is seen as away or a medium of communication, Harold (1981) clarified the characteristics of language as follows</p> <p><strong>2.3.1    Language is a System of Speech Sound</strong></p> <p>Language is primarily a speech act. One of the basic features of all human language is vocalization that is, production of meaningful organized \"noise\" or sound verbalization or talking is therefore a feature of all human language. In fact, language can even be seen as \"the speech of man\" different from other systems of communications.</p> <p><strong>2.3.2    It is Acquired from Childhood</strong></p> <p>Another important characteristic of every human language is that it is acquired as the child grows from childhood to adulthood. It is an acquired behaviour from generation to generation, in other word, language behaviours has to be acquired, although researches have proved that humans are born with innate ability to learn any language without being taught. The belief is that nobody is born with the ability to speak a particular language. For example, no child has the ability from birth to learn Hausa language.</p> <p><strong>2.3.3    Language is Dynamic </strong></p> <p>Like all other aspects of human culture, language is subject to change. Our material culture like tools, utensils, cloths, does change with time. The non-materials aspects like language will also vary from one generation to another. Change should be seen therefore as a general attributes of all language In other words, all languages are creative and open ended New words come into being and some die out Thus language indeed is dynamic, this change is sometimes fast or slow, radical or superficial but it goes on all the time.</p> <p><strong>2.3.4. It is Conventional</strong></p>\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF LANGUAGE DIVERSITY ON NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECTS OF LANGUAGE DIVERSITY ON NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT", "id": 139}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p>Like its users, one important feature of language is its dynamism. Thus, language</p> <p>adapts to situational constraints as its users vary across regional/geographical, social,</p> <p>educational, occupational, etc. domains. English is such a typical language that, as a</p> <p>result of vast geographical distribution, has often assumed the peculiarities of different</p> <p>societies that use it informing the notion of variety. Varieties of English thus exist among</p> <p>the three Kachruan circles among which Nigerian English (NE) is situated. This paper,</p> <p>building on the works of several scholars who have approached the NE phenomenon</p> <p>from different perspectives, discusses the phonological, morpho-syntactic, lexicosemantic</p> <p>and pragmatic features NE. It is submitted that the issue of variation and/or</p> <p>deviation characterizing the NE be harmonized within the Global English (GE) variety</p> <p>and Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) be fully incorporated and</p> <p>implemented so that the current state of English language teaching and learning in</p> <p>Nigeria would transcend the “state of confusion” (Babatunde, 2002) it is now. This is</p> <p>considered expedient so that the Nigerian users of English would be able to cope</p> <p>meaningfully with the challenges posed by the knowledge-driven twenty-first century, in</p> <p>which English is assuming greater roles and significance.</p> <p>1.0. Introduction</p> <p>One sociolinguistic implication of the diffusion of English language - an amalgam</p> <p>of the three paltry languages of the Jutes, Angles and the Saxon, unknown in the 6th</p> <p>Century AD - in the global scene is the emergence of World Englishes (WE) (Adegbija,</p> <p>1994). English is now spoken all over the world among various categories of speakers.</p> <p>The Kachruan ‘three concentric circles’ of English users are the Inner Circle, the Outer</p> <p>Circle and the Expanding Circle (Kachru,1985).These are normatively characterized as</p> <p>Norm-producing, Norm-developing and Norm-dependent users. This sociolinguistic</p> <p>scenario is also aptly captured by Quirk (1985:1-2) as English as a Native language(ENL)</p> <p>countries (Great Britain, United States, Canada, Australia, South-Africa), English as a</p> <p>Second Language countries (e.g. Nigeria, India, Singapore, Tanzania, Zambia, Ghana,</p> <p>2</p> <p>Uganda, Kenya, etc.) and English as a Foreign Language countries (e.g. Germany,</p> <p>Russia, China, France, Belgium, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Greece, etc.) (Adedimeji, 2006).</p> <p>The international explosion of English has made it cease to be an exclusive</p> <p>preserve of the English people (Adegbija,1994:209).As there are more speakers of</p> <p>English in the outer and expanding circles than the norm-producing inner circle, English</p> <p>is now seen as a global language, susceptible to the subtleties and idiosyncracies of</p> <p>regional and cultural linguistic behaviours. Indeed, Bailey and Gorlach (1982) provide a</p> <p>panoramic overview of world varieties of English as clothed by their various distinctive</p> <p>peculiarities and identifiable local flavour. Some of the issues that have arisen from this</p> <p>phenomenon as rightly identified by Adegbija (1994) are: (a) the growth and</p> <p>development of indigenized, nativized indiosyncratic varieties, (b) the issue of</p> <p>intelligibility or otherwise of the emerging varieties and the implications of this for an</p> <p>international or global variety, (c) the acceptability of the different varieties and (d) the</p> <p>determination of which variety should be the ideal norm to use as a model, especially in</p> <p>education.</p> <p>As “sociolinguistics tries to cope with the messiness of language as a social</p> <p>phenomenon” (Coulmas, 2003:263), such messiness may be said to abound in the sociogeographical</p> <p>spread of English across the world. Some world varieties of English, aspects</p> <p>of Nigerian English inclusive, would still need to be interpreted to other speakers of</p> <p>English before they are intelligible. This is a result of the overbearing local idioms and</p> <p>linguistic patterns that characterize such varieties or uses. Trask (1995:75) provides such</p> <p>structures of English varieties that are quite normal to their users as follows:</p> <p>1. We had us a real nice house</p> <p>2. She’s a dinky-di Pommie Sheila.</p> <p>3. I might could do it.</p> <p>4. The lass didn’t gan to the pictures, pet.</p> <p>5. They’re a lousy team any more.</p> <p>6. I am not knowing where to find a stepney.</p> <p>The expressions above are marked by dialects or regional forms. Almost all of them</p> <p>may have to be interpreted to Nigerian and other English speakers apart from their</p> <p>specific users. As adapted from Trask (1995:74-75), the first expression is peculiar to the</p> <p>3</p> <p>south of the USA, with the extra “us” and the form is sometimes used elsewhere. The</p> <p>second structure is Australian English, a native speaker variety, and it means “she’s a</p> <p>typical Englishwoman.” The third example is a normal expression in parts of the</p> <p>Appalachian Mountain region of the USA as well as many parts of Scotland; it means “I</p> <p>might be able to do it.” The fourth structure is ‘Geordie’, the speech of the Tyneside area</p> <p>of northeastern England and it means “The girl didn’t go to the cinema.” The fifth</p> <p>expression is typical of a large part of northeastern USA and the use is considered</p> <p>mysterious because it means “They used to be a good team but now they are lousy” the</p> <p>opposite of they are not a lousy team anymore .The last (number 6) example is an Indian</p> <p>English expression and it means “I don’t know where to find a spare wheel.”</p> <p>What the above shows that English adapts to the socio-cultural constraints that</p> <p>characterize various contexts of its use. A world language par excellence, its propensity</p> <p>to adapt to the dictates of its users, whoever they are, appears to be inimitable. This paper</p> <p>overviews the linguistic features that typify Nigerian English and highlights the</p> <p>implications of such in an unfolding century that poses greater challenges for mankind,</p> <p>economically, politically, culturally, educationally among others, and in which</p> <p>internationalism and globalization will become more pervasive. The present exercise is</p> <p>relevant because most previous attempts at addressing features of the Nigerian English</p> <p>have been particularistic and unidirectional, focusing on individual or two levels of</p> <p>linguistic description. For instance, all of Banjo (1971), Adetugbo (1977), Bamgbose</p> <p>(1982), Jibril (1979;1982), Eka (1985) among others have focused on phonology.</p> <p>Odumu (1981) focuses mainly on syntax and semantics and Banjo(1969), Adesanoye</p> <p>(1973), Kujore (1985), Awonusi (1990)and Jowitt (1991) treat aspects of morphology</p> <p>and syntax extensively in their treatises. Akere (1982), Adegbija (1989), Bamiro (1991),</p> <p>Alabi (2000) among others have been preoccupied with lexico-semantic features while</p> <p>fragments of pragmatic features of Nigerian English can be gleaned from the works of</p> <p>Akere (1978), Adetugbo (1986), Bamgbose (1995) and Banjo(1996).The representative</p> <p>features in all the above are adopted while others are added as found desirable.</p> <p>4</p> <p>2.0. The Linguistic Features of Nigerian English</p> <p>The English language in Nigeria exhibits certain distinctive features that cannot be</p> <p>ignored. This situation results from the range of social, ethnic and linguistic constraints</p> <p>posed by the second language context in which the language operates. The term,</p> <p>“Nigerian English”, can be broadly defined as “the variety of English spoken and used by</p> <p>Nigerians” (Adeniyi, 2006: 25). Nigerian English has generated as a lot of scholarly</p> <p>interest since as far back as 1958 when L.F. Brosnahan published his article “English in</p> <p>Southern Nigeria.” The question of what Nigerian English is and what it is not has</p> <p>pitched scholars into two camps: the deviation school and the variation school. The</p> <p>deviation school maintains that Nigerian English does not exist and what is referred to by</p> <p>the term is just a concatenation of errors underpinning the superficial mastery of the</p> <p>Standard British English (SBE) by Nigerians. Scholars in this school include Vincent,</p> <p>Salami, Prator, Brann, etc. To the members of this school, Nigerian English is anomalous</p> <p>and the banner of the SBE is upheld as the existing form, “even though their own speech</p> <p>and usage provide ample evidence if its (Nigerian English) existence” (Bamgbose,</p> <p>1982:99). The variation school represents the contemporary viewpoint and a vast army of</p> <p>scholars like Banjo, Bamgbose, Awonusi, Odumu, Adetugbo, Adegbija, among several</p> <p>others, belong here. The school affirms the existence of a distinct variety or dialect in</p> <p>Nigeria, with its own subtypes along basilectal (non-standard), mesolectal (general,</p> <p>almost standard) and acrolectal (standard Nigerian English) lines (Awonusi, 1987, cf.</p> <p>Babatunde, 2001).</p> <p>The question of which school is right or wrong as determined may be outside the</p> <p>scope of the present work though appropriate entailments to that effect are made. What is</p> <p>incontrovertible is that the use of English in Nigeria is characterized by the idiosyncratic</p> <p>norms reminiscent of the Nigerian linguistic ecology. The features reflect the submission</p> <p>of Soyinka (1988:126) regarding the use of English by Nigerian and other non-native</p> <p>speakers:</p> <p>And when we borrow an alien language to sculpt or paint in, we</p> <p>must begin by co-opting the entire properties in our matrix of</p> <p>thought and expression. We must stress such a language, stretch</p> <p>it, impact and compact it, fragment and reassemble it with no</p> <p>apology, as required to bear the burden of experiencing and of</p> <p>5</p> <p>experiences, be such experiences formulated or not in the</p> <p>conceptual idioms of the language.</p> <p>2.1. Phonological Features of Nigerian English</p> <p>1. Each syllable of a given speech is of nearly the same length and given the same stress.</p> <p>The final syllable is often stressed, even if it is not a personal pronoun. There is no</p> <p>differentiation between strong and weak stresses (Alabi, 2003;Ufomata,1996).</p> <p>2 Stress misplacement: The stress pattern of English words in NE is different. This</p> <p>discrepancy is illustrated by Jowitt (1991:90-92) in lexical, phrasal and clausal structures</p> <p>as follows:</p> <p>SBE PNE</p> <p>FIREwood fireWOOD</p> <p>MAdam maDAM</p> <p>PERfume perFUME</p> <p>PLANtain planTAIN</p> <p>SAlad saLAD</p> <p>TRIbune triBUNE</p> <p>conGRAtulate congratuLATE</p> <p>inVEStigate investiGATE</p> <p>SITting-room SITting-room or sitting ROOM</p> <p>DeVElopment fund Development FUND</p> <p>It SHOULD be It should BE</p> <p>3. Interference: This is the negative transfer of what obtains in the source language</p> <p>or Nigerian languages to the target language or English. Phonological interference</p> <p>is of five types: a) Over-differentiation of sounds,b) under-differentiation of</p> <p>sounds, c) re-interpretation of sounds, d.) actual sound substitution and e)</p> <p>hypercorrection (Ofuya,1996:151).</p> <p>a.) Overdifferentiation arises when distinctions made in Nigerian languages that are</p> <p>not realized in English are forced on the English language. Examples are:</p> <p>6</p> <p>/kwɒ’rent/ for current in Hausa.</p> <p>b.) Under-differentiation occurs when more than a sound in mother tongue is used for</p> <p>more than one sound in English. Generally, Nigerians tend to substitute long vowel</p> <p>sounds with the short sounds, the latter of which is only applicable in their mother</p> <p>tongues. Hence,</p> <p>/i:/ is realized as /i/</p> <p>/a:/ :: :: :: /a/</p> <p>/u:/ :: :: :: /u/</p> <p>/ε:/ :: :: / ε /</p> <p>c.) Reinterpretation happens when a sound in English is realized as its close</p> <p>counterpart in English. Hence,</p> <p>/ ʌ/ is interpreted/ realized as / ɔ /</p> <p>/ ə/ :: :: :: / ɑ /</p> <p>/ æ/ :: :: :: / ɑ /</p> <p>/ f / :: :: :: / p / especially in Hausa Nigerian English.</p> <p>d.) Actual sound substitution is occasioned by the substitution or replacement of</p> <p>sounds absent in Nigerian languages. Hence,</p> <p>/  / is substituted with / t /</p> <p>/ ð / :: :: :: / d /</p> <p>/ ʧ / :: :: :: / ∫ / or / s/</p> <p>/ v / :: :: :: / f /</p> <p>/ z/ :: :: :: / s /</p> <p>/ ʒ / :: ::: :: / ∫ /</p> <p>/ </p>\n\nTHE LINGUISTIC FEATURES OF NIGERIAN ENGLISH AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR 21ST CENTURY ENGLISH PEDAGOGY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE LINGUISTIC FEATURES OF NIGERIAN ENGLISH AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR 21ST CENTURY ENGLISH PEDAGOGY", "id": 140}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>This study focuses on describing the sound system of Jaba. The research comes under the purview of phonology which is a branch of language study. Language is a major cultural phenomenon in the human society and therefore, an important regulator of individual consciousness and social interaction. It is vital in human existence that there is hardly any situation or human function where language is not required. Language as a means of communication is essential in all speech communication. There is power in language (speech). It is in recognition of this fact that Omachonu (2011) cited a philosopher, Daniel Webster who once remarked that, “If all my talents and power were to be taken away from me by some inscrutable providence, and I had my choice of keeping but one, I would unhesitatingly ask to be allowed to keep the power of speaking; for through it, I will quickly recover all the rest” </p> <p>The above philosophically sums up the efficacy and indispensability of language. Language is the facilitator of human essence. All inventions and achievements ever recorded in human existence have their roots in language as a veritable instrument of thought and an indispensable channel or a tool for communication. Many scholars have given different definitions as to what language is. Prominent among these, is that which was put forward by Edward Sapir as quoted in Omachonu (2011) which states that “language is a purely human and non-instinctive method of communicating ideas, emotions and desires by means of a system of voluntarily produced symbols”. In other words, language is simply a system of communication. </p> <p>Omachonu (2011) defines linguistics as “the scientific study of language(s)”. This short but precise definition will lead to the question of what does it mean to do a scientific study of language or study language scientifically? In attempting this question, one will have to consider the role(s) of science in the study of language. By the scientific study of language, it is meant that linguistics as a discipline seeks “to study language through investigations by means of controlled and empirically verifiable observations, and with reference to some general theory of language structure” (Lyons, 1998). Science, after all, is that body of knowledge obtained or acquired through observations and testing of facts. To say that linguistics is scientific, “it means that linguistic study, in a nutshell, is characterized by three major phenomena or principles; these are explicitness, systematicity and objectivity” (Omachonu, 2011)</p> <p>Objectivity, in the opinion of Okolo and Ezikeojaku (2010), suggests that “the procedures for linguistic investigations as well as the results obtained from such investigations are verifiable and the techniques used are valid.” Omachonu (2011) is of the view that systematicity as a principle or phenomenon is inherently a characteristic of language. Every language operates three basic systems namely: a system of sounds, of structures, and a system of meaning. For instance, with regards to the system of sounds, one could not but notice that only particular sounds are used by speakers of any language, and these sounds can only be combined in particular ways. Also, there is a network of patterned structural relationship constituting the organization of language. Language as a whole therefore, is characterized as a system and preferably a hierarchically ordered arrangement of systems.</p> <p>          The latter, that is systematicity, is important to the study of this work. Since language is composed of systems of structures which could be studied at different levels, the researcher shall be looking at language study from the level of sound (phonetics and phonology) where there shall be a discussion of the syllable and its structures with examples from Jaba. The systematic study of any language can be carried out under three levels of analysis viz a viz the levels of sound (phonetics and phonology), form (morphology and syntax) and meaning (semantics and pragmatics)</p> <p>     From a layman point of view, phonetics and phonology are concerned with the distinctive sounds of a language(s) and how these sounds combine to form words. This study focuses on phonology as an aspect of language study with a central concern on the sound system of Jaba language. </p> <p>Phonology as a subfield of linguistics is a broad base discipline that focuses on the various aspects of the sound system of a language. It is divided into phonemics, phonotactics and prosody. Phonemics studies the individual sounds of a language; phonotactics examines the permissible and non-permissible rules that govern the combinations of the individual sounds to form words; while prosody studies the supra-segmental aspects of sound such as tone, intonation, stress, syllables, etc. The aim of this study is to examine the soundpatterns of Jaba as a way of studying the sound system of the language. There is lack of sufficient data as regards the study language all because the languages of Southern Kaduna are undoubtedly minority languages and as such, understudied. Minority because they are each estimated to have fewer than one million native speakers. They are also considered to be endangered because of pressure from Hausa which for long has been the lingua franca in the north of the country. However locally, these languages remain in use.</p> <p>According to Blench (1992), “Jaba belongs to the Platoid group found under the Benue-Congo sub family of the Niger-Congo shown in family/phylum.  The language Jaba is seen as a means of communication in the market and also used for worshiping at the church. The Jaba language is spoken in towns like Pari, Kizachi, Makama, Kachia, Kwei, Chawai, Rahama Chawai etc.” (94) The speakers of this language, that is the Jaba people, are known for the preservation of their culture despite much influences and threats from the western world and the Hausa language respectively. </p> <p><strong>1.2 </strong><strong>Statement of the Problem                                                                             </strong></p> <p>In analyzing the linguistic features of a language, one could study the phonological, syntactic and semantic aspects of the language. The phonologicalstudy of a language may prove difficult to comprehend especially the sound system of Jaba because of lack of existing written records of the language. This research is an attempt to study the sound system of Jaba; so as to add to the existing written records of the language. </p> <p><strong>1.3 Scope and Delimitation</strong></p> <p>One cannot exhaust any area of language study in its entirety. This research will focus on the sound system of Jaba with emphasis on the syllable structure, tonology and some elements of prosody. The major focus will be to describe the sound system of the Kwei dialect of Jaba with the aim of adding to the existing written records of the language.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of the study is to describe the sound system of Jaba with a view </p> <p>to describing the phonological features of the language, and adding to the existing written records of the language.</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The significance of this study is based on the fact that Jaba is a little known indigenous minority language on the verge of extinction. This study draws attention to the language by bringing it to the fore of linguistic analysis or description. The Jaba speakers may find this research useful as it describes the structures of its phonology and this is useful for posterity. </p> <p>          Furthermore, studies in the Jaba language are limited. This research may be a stepping stone for those who will wish to delve into the study and the description of the language in terms of its phonological components. Essentially, any effort(s), no matter how little, contributed towards studying and developing any of the minority languages in Nigeria is in itself very significant, hence the need for this study.</p> <p><strong> 1.6 Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>Certain words or technical terms have been used which may not be self-explanatory to the readers who are outside the domains of this field of study. These are as follows:</p> <p>1.     <strong>Syllabification</strong>: it refers to the division of a word into syllables.</p> <p>2.     <strong>Family Tree</strong>: this is used to refer to a diagrammatic representation of language on a tree which shows the source from which they have descended or evolved.</p> <p>3.     <strong>Syllabic Consonants</strong>: this refers to the ability of clusters of consonants to stand alone and form a syllable without the help of a vowel.</p> <p>4.     <strong>Onset</strong>: this refers to the initial consonant of a syllable.</p> <p>5.     <strong>Peak</strong>: this is also called nucleus. It refers to the part of a syllable which carries the vowel sound.</p> <p>6.     <strong>Coda</strong>: this refers to the final segment in a syllable which is equally a consonant. It is also called closure.</p> <p>7.     <strong>Constraints</strong>: these refer to the non-permissible rules that govern the combination of sound in a language.</p> <p>8.     <strong>Prosody</strong>: this refers to that branch of phonology which studies transcend beyond the study of individual sound. It deals with features such as stress, intonation, rhythm, syllable, tone etc.</p> <p>9.     <strong> Diacritics</strong>: these refer to marks or symbols used for detailed information on pronunciation, thus showing that there is variation in the sound.</p> <p><strong>1.7 Methodology</strong></p> <p>This study is a descriptive analysis of the sound system of Jaba. The data </p> <p>was elicited from live utterances of interviewed Kwei Jaba speakers living within the researcher’s environment, coupled with introspective evidences from the researcher as a native speaker. To elicit the data, a questionnaire of Englishwords was given to the Jaba speakers and they were required to translate it to Jaba. This elicited data for the analysis of the tone, consonant and vowel, and other elements of prosody.</p> <p><strong>1.7.1 Area of Study</strong></p> <p>Finding native speakers of Jaba in Abuja is never an arduous task as the FCT shares boundary with the Southern Kaduna people. The study areas are situated within Kwali and Gwagwalada Area Councils respectively. Jaba speakers living within these communities constituted the study population for this study.</p> <p><strong>1.7.2 Research Design and Technique</strong></p> <p>          This study adopts the data elicitation method of data gathering because it provides the researcher with the opportunity to sample a wide audience using a research instrumentation that meets the limited time frame within which the study is conducted. Also, this method enabled the researcher to interact with Jaba speakers and also apply introspection to elicit the required information from data gathered.</p> <p><strong>1.7.3 Instrumentation and Sources of Data</strong></p> <p>This study adopts Primary data from Jaba speakers residing in the FCT within Kwali and Gwagwala Area Councils. The instruments for data collection are the questionnaire, tape recorder, interview and introspective evidence.</p> <p><strong>1.7.4 Methods of Data Collection</strong></p> <p>The method used for gathering data is the giving out of questionnaires to Jaba informants which elicited relevant information for the study. A total of 50 questionnaires was share out and retrieved after the informants filled them up instantly. The informants were also interviewed to elicit relevant information from using introspective evidence. The interviews are tape recorded for further use during the analysis of data.</p> <p><strong>1.7.5 Methods of Data Analysis</strong></p> <p>The questionnaires retrieved and the recorded interviews were transcribed out and the phonological evidences from these sources were analyzed using introspective linguistic knowledge and evidences in their analysis as they relate to the syllabic structure of Jaba.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE</strong></p> <p><strong>2.0. Introduction</strong></p> <p>A work of this nature cannot be complete without first reviewing some published related literatures. The discussion in this chapter covers areas such as:an overview of phonology, historical background of the Jaba language and the syllabic structure in language.</p> <p><strong>2.1. Phonology: An Overview</strong></p> <p>Linguistic analysis involves three broad levels of related studies; the speech sound level, the structure level and the meaning level. The study of speech sounds is undertaken in phonetics and phonology.</p> <p>          Yule (1997:54) defines phonetics as “the general study of the characteristics of speech sounds while phonology is essentially the description of the systems and patterns of speech sounds in a language. It is, in effect, based on the theory of what every speakers of a language unconsciously knows about the sound patterns of that language.”</p> <p>          The study of structures in languages is undertaken in morphology and syntax whereas meaning goes into semantics where an attempt is made to convey and classify experience (s) through language as man gives verbal expressions to his thoughts. This shows that language is a highly well-structured and patterned system which is composed of structures, and its component structures can be studied or analyzed at different levels of language or linguistic analyses. The concern of this research is to study the Jaba language at the phonological level of language study. It is noteworthy that though phonetics and phonology dwell or operate on the same terrain in terms of linguistic analysis and object of study, remarkable differences still exist between the two in spite of the overt similarities or relatedness. They are two sides to the same coin as their object of study is the human speech sound.</p> <p>          Phonetics as defined by Robins (1996: 6) is “the scientific study of speech sound”. In a related development, Lyons (2002) describes the study of phonetics “as giving the phonetic description or instrumental analysis of substances where sounds are to be regarded as physical entities, which can be described or analyzed without reference to any specific language.”Agreeing with the above definitions, they place sounds as the focus of phonetic study; however, phonetics does not study any kind of sound but the human speech sounds.</p> <p>          In the same vein, Wells and Colson (1993) view phonetics as “the study and description of pronunciation. That is, it is concerned with studying the principles and processes that determine pronunciation; what we pronounce and how we </p> <p>pronounce it.”</p> <p>          Similarly, in an attempt to give a concise and precise definition to phonetics and with a view to showing its object(s) of study, Lyons, Todd, Yusuf, and Roach unanimously describe phonetics in terms of production (ariculatory), transmission (acoustic) and perception (auditory) of speech sounds.It is in similar line of thought that Ikekeonwu (1996) clearly defines phonetics “as being concerned with the study of speech sounds from the parameters of its production, physical properties and perception”.</p> <p>          According to Omachonu (2011), the study of phonetics using the three points of views or dimensions; production, transmission and reception or perception consequently and correspondingly, yields to the three branches of phonetics traditionally identified as articulatroy, acoustic and auditory phonetics.</p> <p>          Articulatory phonetics is defined by Yule (1997) as the study of how speech sounds are made, or articulated. On the other hand, he views acoustic phonetics as dealing with the physical properties of speech as sound waves ‘in the air’, while auditory (or perceptual) phonetics, deals with the perception, via the ear, of speech sounds. Yule identifies forensic phonetics, as another branch of phonetics, which deals with the applications in legal cases involving speaker identification and the analysis of recorded utterances.                                                                     Above all, in trying to know the what, how and why of speech sound production, the basic or the fundamental job of a phonetician is to try to find out what people do or are doing when they talk or listen to speech. Omachonu (2011) is of the opinion, therefore, that the most precise and acceptable definition of phonetics is to describe it as the study of pronunciation, that is, a medium used in the speaking of all languages spoken medium) and the phonic medium as used in all styles of speech (37).</p> <p>          Phonology, on the other hand, is the study of the systems and patterns of those units of sound form in a language (Omachonu; 37). Hyman quoted in Omachonu, sees phonology as the study of the sound systems of a language. The goal of phonology according to Hyman, therefore, is to study the properties of the sound systems, which speakers must learn or internalize so as to be able to use the language for the purpose of meaningful communication. Sommerstein (1991) agrees with this when he refers to phonology as “functional phonetics“.</p> <p>          Katamba (2001) describes phonology as “the branch of linguistics which investigates the ways in which sounds are used systematically in different languages to form words and utterances”. It is this systematic functioning and structural pattering of speech sounds in different or specific languages that Ikekeonwu had in mind when he described phonology as a branch of linguistics which concerns itself with the study of speech sounds already identified and studied, to establish their functions and distributional patterns. The importance of function and structure of speech sounds in language, he noted, it emphasized in almost all the definitions of phonology.</p> <p>          Phonology as a branch of linguistics studies the entire sound systems of languages. It is the description of the system and patterns of sounds that occur in a language. It is concerned with the organization of sounds into a system of contrasts, analysed in terms of phonemes, distinctive features or other such phonological units. It aims at demonstrating the patterns of distinctive sounds found in a language, and makes general statements about the nature of sound systems in languages. This is why it is referred to as “functional phonetics”.</p> <p>According to Uzoezie (1996), different phoneticians have defined phonology in different ways but the substance of the different definitions remains essentially the same. It means therefore that every definition points to the fact that the sound patterns that make up the phonemic inventories of a language are the concerns of phonology.</p> <p>As stated before, phonetics and phonology share some forms of relationships. As Omachonu (2011) rightly noted, “the object of the study of both phonetics and phonology is the human speech sound which means that the two belong to the same level of linguistic analysis. They are pre-occupied with the study of speech sounds.” (38) It is also worthy of not that phonetics identifies and describes the pool of sounds in human languages which phonology processes into utterances. This goes to confirm that phonology is related to phonetics since the latter serves as its informant; that is, phonetics provides the needed raw materials for the study of phonology. In other words, the output of phonetics is the input in phonology. It does appear that phonetics serves as the prerequisite for the study of phonology and one wonders aloud if, it is possible to study phonology effectively and adequately without the knowledge of phonetics.</p> <p>Despite the overt and/or obvious relationship between phonetics and phonology, there still exist basic differences between the two. Sommerstein (1991) asserts that phonology begins where phonetics leaves off. This, in essence, points to the notion that the end of phonetics marks the beginning of phonology. In other words, the output of phonetics is the input of phonology. Ikekeonwu (1996), for instance, clearly identifies the basic differences between the two in the following words: “Phonetics studies the speech sound from the parameters of its production, physical properties and perception. In phonology the speech sounds already identified and described are studied, to establish their function and distributional patterns” (33).</p> <p>In addition, it is noted that phonetics identifies the pool of sounds in human </p> <p>language while phonology then systematizes the specific language(s). Sequel to the above, Ikekeonwu (1996) asserts that the expression “sound systems” used in distinguishing between phonetics and phonology is crucial in this consideration. According to this linguist; “Phonetics does the groundwork of identifying the articulatory and acoustic parameters that could be utilized for speech; phonology is concerned with ‘sound systems’ or speech patterns that could arise using these articulatory and acoustic parameters.”</p> <p>Besides, unlike phonology, “phonetics, it is noted, deals with the spoken rather than the written medium. This characteristic of phonetics, according to Omachonu becomes obvious in views of its pre-occupation with phonetic symbols rather than letters of the orthography as it relates to the examination of speech features-tone pitch, stress intonation, duration, syllable and other prosodic features” (Ikekeonwu,39).</p> <p>Fudge (2003) described phonetics, in Omachonu (2011), as that which gives an account of the total resources of sound available to the human being who wishes to communicate by speech, adding that phonetics in its essence is independent of particular languages; phonology on the other hand, gives an account of specific choices made by specific languages within this range of possibilities. Phonology, therefore, is concerned with the sound systems of a single language. Fudge’s contribution largely agrees with Fischer Jorgensen who observed that phonetic study is prone to changes and advances compared to phonology.                  Phonology has two main components: the segmental which analyses speech into discrete segments such as phonemes, and supra-segmental which analyses features which extend over more than one segment such as intonation contours. Another distinction made within phonology is between diachronic and synchronic phonology. The former studies patterns of sound change in the history of a language while the latter studies sound patterns regardless of the process of historical change.</p> <p>Phonology is studied under the sub-branches of phonemics, phonotactics and prosody. According to Omachonu, phonemics is the study of the individual phonemes of a language. For instance: the /p/, /t/, /g/, etc. in English and the /kp/, /gb/, /kw/, etc. in Jaba form the individual phonemes of the two languages, respectively. Phonotactics, on the other hand, studies the permissible and non-permissible rules of combining the individual phonemes of a language. For instance in Jaba language, it is not permissible to have a combination of the /k/ /m/ or /m/ and /d/phonemes in such a sound. This is because of certain constraints in the rules of combination and this is what phonotactics concerns itself about. Prosody studies the supra-segmental or non-segmental features of word(s) or connected speeches such as speeches, tone, intonation, syllable, etc.</p> <p>The focus of this research is on the sound system of Jaba where the study </p> <p>shall concentrate on the syllable as a prosodic feature of Jaba language. From the study so far, it could be deduced that language is made up of a system of structures which could be studied at different levels. The consonants, vowels and tones are a part of the features or aspects of phonology that could be studied under the linguistic level of sound analysis. The Jaba language shall now be discussed so as to discover its sound system but the research will first have to take a look at the ethno-linguistic background of the language under the next section.</p> <p><strong>2.2 Historical Background of Jaba Language</strong></p> <p>The Online Wikipedia gives a historical background on the Jaba people and their language. According to this online medium, there are 57 languages spoken as first languages in Kaduna State. Gbari and Hausa are major languages; most other languages are small and endangered minority languages, due to the influence of Hausa. The language of study, Jaba is a language spoken by the Jaba people of Southern Kaduna specifically in Jaba LGA, Kaduna State.Kaduna State forms a portion of the country’s cultural diversity because representatives of the six major ethnic groups in the country are found in the state. Apart from this fact, there are also present over twenty other ethnic minority groups, each with its language and art or religion different from the other.</p> <p>The works of art and pottery (e.g. the “Nok Terracotta”) found in the </p> <p>southern parts of Kaduna State suggest that it is a major cultural centre. Among the major ethnic groups are Kamuku, Gwari, Kadara in the west, Hausa and Kurama to the north and Northeast; “Nerzit” is now used to describe the Jaba (study language), Kaje, Koro, Kamanton, Kataf, Morwa and Chawai instead of the derogatory term “southern Zaria people”. Also, the term “Hausawa” is used to describe the people of Igabi, ikara, Giwa and Makarti LGAs, which include a large proportion of rural dwellers who are strictly “Maguzawas.”</p> <p>In the north, the Hausa and some immigrants from the southern states practise Islam and majority of the people in the southern LGAs profess Christianity. The major Muslim festivals are the “Salah” celebrations of “ldeIfitri” and “ldeIkabir”, while Christmas, New Year and Easter are observed by the Christians. Two traditional festivals of significance are the “Tukham” and “Afan” in Jaba and Jama’a LGAs respectively. Prominent among the traditional arts, are leather works, pottery and in-dig-pit dyeing with Zaria as the major centre.</p> <p>The 2006 census provisional result puts the population of Kaduna State at 6,066,562. Although majorities live and depend on the rural areas, about a third of the state’s population is located in the two major urban centres of Kaduna and Zaria.The state is divided into 23 Local Government Areas. Jaba is one of the 23 Local Government Areas of Kaduna State with its headquarters in Kafanchan. Jaba Local government has an area of 2,810 km² and a population of 170,008 (2006 census). The Jaba people are known to be hospitable, helpful, industrious and peace loving. When one knocks on the door of a Jaba person at any hour of the day, one is assured of a warm welcome. This is why they are usually regarded as one of the most peace loving people of Kaduna State. Another aspect of their culture is their ability to be able to dance. This has been passed down from generation to generation. They are very good dancers and in fact they are one of the best in the whole of Kaduna State.</p> <p>The Jaba people are predominantly farmers i.e. about 80% of the population though there are few who engage in other income generating ventures. Among the crops of cultural importance is the finger Millet popularly known as ‘tamba’, ‘acha’ or just millet. Just few of them engage in trading, fishing, craft making and bee keeping which also are income generating ventures for the community. Religion is a vital part of life of the people and to this end; there are two major religions in the chiefdom namely Christianity and Islam. However, some Jaba people are adherents of traditional religion popularly called ‘dodo’.</p> <p>Among the people of Jaba, the marriage institution is contracted in stages such as: step I is when the dowry is paid and then followed by the second step which is the marriage ceremony proper. On the wedding day, the groom presents gift items like palm oil, groundnut oil, ram etc. to the bride’s family after which he is permitted to take his bride home. Names are given to children on the very day they are born but celebrations are postponed to the convenience of the parents.</p> <p>The people of Southern Kaduna are also referred to as Nerzit. While they speak many different languages and see themselves as separate peoples, their unity as a group is also quite apparent to them. Hausa, an Afro-Asiatic, Chadic language, is the lingua franca of Northern Nigeria, and this holds true all over Kaduna State where over 57 languages are spoken. Benue-Congo languages, particularly those of the Plateau variety, are the mother tongues spoken by the indigenes. Of these, some of the languages are as mentioned below: Fantsuam (Kafanchan), Gong (Kagoma), Gworok (Kagoro), Jju (Kaje), Koro, Tsam (Chawai), Hyam (Jaba) the study language, and Tyap (Kataf).</p> <p>There is lack of sufficient data as regards the study language all because the languages of Southern Kaduna are undoubtedly minority languages and as such, understudied. Minority because they are each estimated to have fewer than one million native speakers. They are also considered to be endangered because of pressure from Hausa which for long has been the lingua franca in the north of the country. However locally, these languages remain in use.</p> <p>According to Blench (1992), “Jaba belongs to the Platoid group found under the Benue-Congo sub family of the Niger-Congo shown in family/phylum. The language Jaba is seen as a means of communication in the market and also used for worshiping at the church. The Jaba language is spoken in towns like Pari, Kizachi, Makama, Kachia, Kwei, Chawai, Rahama Chawai etc.” (94) The speakers of this language, that is the Jaba people, are known for the preservation of their culture despite much influence and threat from the western world. For instance, among these people, a child is not allowed to greet an elderly person in the western wayor manner.</p> <p><strong>2.3 The Syllable Structure in Language</strong></p> <p>Supra-segmental phonology cannot be broken up into discrete units of utterances. The basis of operation for the supra-segmental features is the syllable, many of which will combine to make up utterances. One fact about the syllable, according to Ladefoged (1989), is that it is a necessary unit in the mental organization and production of utterances. It is for this fact that people believe that, even if they cannot define the syllable, they can count the number of syllables in any given word or sentence. If they are asked to do this, according to Roach (2009), they often tap their fingers as they count, which illustrates the syllable’s importance in the rhythm of speech. They are able to do this simply by identifying the vocalic elements(s) i.e. vowels in such a word or sentence or at times by considering the peaks of prominence of sounds making up the word or sentence. It becomes apparent therefore that two categories of segmental phonemes i.e. consonant and vowel combine to form the syllable.                                                               Although it has been noted that the definition of the syllable presents some problems such that an accurate definition becomes difficult, however, there are several theories in phonetics and phonology which have tried to clarify matters in an attempt at providing a precise definition of the syllable.</p> <p>          The pulse (or motor) theory was suggested by the psychologist, R.H.Steetson (1892-1950). It attempts to define the syllable of a language on the basis of the articulatory effort needed in order to produce them. Steetson argued that each syllable corresponds to an increase in air pressure, air from the lungs being released as a series of chest pulses. In other words, in any utterance there are a number of chest pulses, that is, muscular activity controlling lung movement accompanied by increases in air pressure, which determines the number of syllable uttered. In this therefore, the syllable rather than the sounds is the basic unit of speech.</p> <p>          Consonants form the boundaries of syllable end and beginning; the pulse is then audible, with the vowels in the middle as in the English word cat /kæt/. It is true that while this can readily be measured, particularly in emphatic speech, it is nevertheless difficult to detect such a pulse in adjacent syllables, as when two vowels (v v) co-occur which gives us a syllable structure of cvvc. For instance, in the following Jaba words;</p> <p>          Kwain with syllable structure ccvvc /kwaiŋ/</p> <p>          ɠoin with syllable structure cvvc /gɔiŋ/</p> <p>In the word ‘Kwain’ for example, there are two evident chest pulses but usually said in a single muscular effort. Moreover, there is no consonant to form the boundary between them. Surely certain problems remain.</p> <p>          The syllable has been subjected to various definitions from the point of view of articulatory, acoustic, physiological and psychological. Theorists have argued, however, that the syllable may be defined or described using two broad theories (collapsing the four points into two): the phonetic and the phonological or linguistic approach.</p> <p>In defining the syllable phonetically, an appeal is made to two sub-theories namely: the prominence and the chest pulse theory. The prominence theory holds that there are some sounds which are more prominent than others; these loud sounds form the peaks of the respective syllables. But the chest pulse theory claims that in any utterance, there are a number of chest pulses accompanied by increase in air pressure. These increases determine the number of syllables in a word.</p> <p>The phonological theory, on the other hand, views the syllable as being based on the type of phoneme sequence that is permissible in a particular language. This is sometimes referred to as the linguistic approach to the definition of the syllable.However one may define the concept “syllable”, the fact still remains that the sound segments of any language can be perceived by the ear as being roughly divisible into syllables. It is in line with the second theory-the phonological theory that Gimson (1991) defines the syllable as: a unit of a higher level than that of a phoneme or sound segment, yet distinct from that of a word or morpheme.In the same vein, Crowther (1997) sees the syllable as; “… any of the units into which a word may be divided usually consisting of a vowel sound with a consonant before and/or after it” (67).</p> <p>          Collapsing these definitions, therefore, one may describe the syllable as an intermediate level of phonological organization; that is, intermediate between individual segmental units (consonants and vowels) and their combination into words. Put differently, a syllable refers to a pronounceable unit at a higher level than that of a phoneme, but distinct from that of a word or morpheme. It was noticed by Omachonu (2011) that the notion syllable from many indications, is a psychological real unit. For instance, according to Clement and Keyser, speakers of unwritten languages, if asked to divide a word into its constituent parts, will usually divide it into syllables rather than individual sound segments e.g. education will be /e-ʤu-kei-∫η/ i.e. four syllables.</p> <p>         According to them, it may even prove difficult to convince such speakers that further syllabifications or divisions are possible. This, they assert, was true of English speaking children before the introduction of the alphabetic writing system.The combinatory sequence of syllabic segment(s) which a language permits is referred to as the syllable structure of the language. It could be CV pattern CVV, CCV,VC, and so on.Every language places a constraint(s) as to the pattering of its syllable structure. Structurally, a syllable may be divided into three parts; the peak, the Onset, and the Coda.The onset consists of all segments that precede the peak and are tauto-syllabic with it.Sounds in this position are always consonants. The Coda, on the other hand, consists of all the tauto-syllablic segments that follow the peak. The Coda, therefore, is the consonant sound after the nucleus. Lastly, the peak of a syllable is as well the nucleus of that syllable-the core.</p> <p>Below is the structural representation of the syllable as demonstrated by Hyman (1975)</p> <p>                                                syllable</p> <p>onset                                                               core</p> <p>(consonant)                                                                      </p> <p>                                                           peak                                       coda</p> <p>(vowel)                                    (consonant)                    </p> <p>It should be noted however, according to Omachonu (2011) that the structure may not apply to all English words or syllables, let alone other languages. For instance, syllables like “ǝu” as in open /ǝupn/ or ”ǝ” as</p>\n\nA PHONOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE SOUND SYSTEM OF JABA LANGUAGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A PHONOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE SOUND SYSTEM OF JABA LANGUAGE", "id": 141}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>Abstract</p> <p>Communication as a social tool includes a wide range of functions such as instruction, persuasion,</p> <p>education, entertainment, development and so on.

Thus, it is a mirror of human existence intended to be presented on the stage. But</p> <p>as Victor Hugo says, ‘If the mirror is an ordinary one, it produces a poor, faithful but colourless</p> <p>image; it must therefore be a focusing mirror.’ Thus, drama must provide a physical semblance to</p> <p>human existence on the stage. (Ramamurti, 1964)</p> <p>Drama occupies a significant place in Indian culture. India has always been a paradise for art lovers,</p> <p>be it music, dance or drama. However, perhaps it would be fair to place drama a notch above music</p> <p>and dance because drama essentially incorporates both the forms. The various aspects of drama have</p> <p>been comprehensively discussed in a particular text composed in ancient India known as the</p> <p>Nātyasāstra. The Nātyasāstra ascribed to the Indian sage Bharata is generally considered to be the</p> <p>earliest treatise on dramaturgy. The Sanskrit term for ‘Drama’ is Nātya. Nātya, says, Bharata Muni,</p> <p>is an imitation of the various emotions and situations of the people through abhinaya (acting). The</p> <p>word Abhinaya is a combination of two words, ‘abhi’1 meaning ‘towards’ and ‘ni’ meaning ‘to</p> <p>1 abhi—towards (Srimad Bhagavad Gita 1.14.12)</p> <p>3</p> <p>carry’. Thus, abhinaya literally means carrying the performance of a play to the point of direct</p> <p>ascertainment of its meaning towards the audience. (Pandya, 1990)</p> <p>But then, the question emerges as to how the actor shall carry the meaning towards the audience.</p> <p>Herein comes the role and importance of communication. Communication refers to the act of</p> <p>transmission of ideas between individuals through the use of significant symbols. It is a process by</p> <p>which a person or a group of persons attempts to make another person or a group of person aware of</p> <p>its ideas on a particular subject. It is of paramount importance to social living as social life can exist</p> <p>only when meaningful symbols are transmitted from one individual to another. Thus, communication</p> <p>essentially refers to the process of establishing commonness among the participants involved in the</p> <p>act of communication through the act of information sharing. When any communication process</p> <p>continues for a considerable period of time, particular attitudes and values are inculcated in the</p> <p>minds of the audience which ultimately leads to building of social relationships. Emphasizing the</p> <p>importance of communication in building up of relationships, Raymond Williams asserts that men</p> <p>and societies are tied together to relationships in describing, learning, persuading and exchanging</p> <p>experiences. This exchange of experience is facilitated by communication. (Mukhopadhyay, 1999)</p> <p>Thus, it is only fair that theatre is seen as a medium of establishing a relationship of commonness</p> <p>between the actor (communicator) and the audience (communicated) that hinges on the art of</p> <p>communication.</p> <p>Communication as a human function is multi-dimensional in nature. While communication has</p> <p>primarily been regarded as an information sharing process, the scope of communication is vast</p> <p>indeed. It includes a wide range of functions such as instruction, persuasion, education,</p> <p>entertainment, development and so on. Over the ages, all the communication mediums have evolved</p> <p>themselves to accommodate the various functions of communication and this is true of the theatre as</p> <p>well. We shall now discuss how the theatre as a communication medium can significantly contribute</p> <p>towards performing the various communication functions.</p> <p>Information Function</p> <p>The first and foremost function of any communication endeavour remains information. It is from the</p> <p>information function of communication that all the other functions find application. The primary</p> <p>function of any form of media, thus, is to collect, store, process and disseminate information in order</p> <p>to help the receivers understand and react to their existing environment. (Andal, 2004) This is true of</p> <p>4</p> <p>the theatre as well. Since ancient times, the main function of the theatre has been to disseminate</p> <p>some form of information, either directly or indirectly to the audience which fulfils the basic need of</p> <p>communication process. As a matter of fact, in the ancient times, it was widely regarded that the duty</p> <p>of the dramatist was to equally entertain the masses and to provide men with information which</p> <p>gives ample opportunities to flourish him.</p> <p>The relevance of theatre as an important medium of informing the masses was brought to the fore</p> <p>when this medium was utilized in states like Orissa, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to apprise the rural</p> <p>population of the Kargil conflict. At a time when there has been an exponential growth in broadcast</p> <p>media and means of transport and travel are within the reach of the common man; the theatre</p> <p>emerged as perhaps one of the few successful channels to inform the rural people of the various</p> <p>aspects of the conflict as also the valour and sacrifices made by the Indian soldiers. The plays were</p> <p>equally successful in instilling a feeling of patriotism in the audience. (Vir Bala Aggarwal, 2002)</p> <p>Command or instructive function</p> <p>The second important function of communication is command or instructive function.</p> <p>Communication as a command or instructive function posits that the primary purpose of</p> <p>communication is telling the recipients of the information what to do, how to do when to do etc.</p> <p>Theatre has always been a chosen medium of instruction since the ancient times. In the words of</p> <p>Bertolt Brecht, “Oil, inflation, war, social struggle, the family, religion, the meat market, all became</p> <p>subjects for theatrical representation. Choruses enlightened the spectator about facts unknown to</p> <p>him….Right and Wrong courses of action were shown. People were shown who knew what they</p> <p>were doing, and others who did not. The theatre became an affair for philosophers, but only for such</p> <p>philosophers as wished not just to explain the world but also to change it. So we had philosophy, we</p> <p>had instruction.” (Mukhopadhyay, 1999)</p> <p>Persuasive function</p> <p>The third important function of communication is the persuasive function. According to David Berlo</p> <p>(1960), the sole purpose of communication is to influence people and persuade them into any</p> <p>particular way of thinking or acting. The persuasive function of communication is extremely</p> <p>important for inducing people into changing their behaviour in any particular desirable direction.</p> <p>Theatre, through repeated use of messages over long period of time, can persuade its audience in the</p> <p>5</p> <p>formation of certain attitudes and behaviour patterns. History has shown us how the theatre has often</p> <p>acted as a vehicle for agitation and propaganda.</p> <p>The first significant drama of social protest in India was Nildarpana (The Mirror of Indigo Planters)</p> <p>by Dinabandhu Mitra, published in 1860. The play dramatizes incidents drawn from the revolution of</p> <p>1858 in which Bengali indigo cultivators were mercilessly persecuted by the British planters for</p> <p>refusing to sow their crops. The play aroused considerable public sentiment in Bengal against British</p> <p>rule and paved the way for a host of patriotic works written along similar lines elsewhere in the</p> <p>country. (Richmond, 1973)</p> <p>Education function</p> <p>Education has always been one of the most important functions of communication throughout ages.</p> <p>However, communication for education has been generally limited to formal communication</p> <p>practices and has rarely been experimental in nature. However, theatre can be effectively used as a</p> <p>medium of education. In Chapter I of the Nātyasāstra, the great sage Bharata narrates to us the</p> <p>educational purpose of drama as declared by Lord Brahma. Thus says Bharata, “This (Nātya/</p> <p>Drama) teaches duty to those bent on doing their duty, love to those who are eager for its fulfilment,</p> <p>and it chastises those who are ill-bred or unruly, promotes self-restraint in those who are</p> <p>disciplined, gives courage to cowards, energy to heroic persons, enlightens men of poor intellect and</p> <p>gives wisdom to the learned… It will [also] give relief to unlucky persons who are afflicted with</p> <p>sorrow and grief or [over]-work, and will be conducive to observance of duty (dharma) as well as to</p> <p>fame, long life, intellect and general good and will educate people.” (Ghosh, 1950)</p> <p>One of the primary concerns related to education today is the excessive workload upon the students</p> <p>that threatens to have a de-humanising effect upon them where they increasingly find themselves cutoff</p> <p>from the mainstream society. The theatre can come to our rescue in this regard. Techniques of</p> <p>drama blur many boundaries by transforming the formal space of the classroom through the use of</p> <p>games and conversations, sometimes even actually breaking down its physical order. Some</p> <p>minimising of the social distance between the teacher and the taught infuses trust in the latter and</p> <p>makes conversation possible. More than interaction, the regard and respect of community practices</p> <p>that honour children's out-of school skills in storytelling can go a long way in making children</p> <p>communicative. (Singh, 2004)</p> <p>6</p> <p>Entertainment Function</p> <p>Entertainment has emerged as an important function of communication. The entertainment function</p> <p>of communication was first proposed by Charles Wright. Prior to him, the utility of communication</p> <p>in Harold Laswell’s opinion was limited to three functions – surveillance, correlation and</p> <p>transmission. While entertainment media are much more concerned with likeability and physical</p> <p>attractiveness, it is these characteristics that attract people to entertainment shows and can create</p> <p>attitude change via a peripheral route in entertainment settings. Generally speaking, the broadcast</p> <p>media such as TV and films best reflect this function. (Xiaoli Nan, (2004 However, the entertainment</p> <p>function of communication is by no means limited to the broadcast media. It is worth mentioning</p> <p>here that the theatre started as a medium of entertaining the masses. Entertainment, however, here is</p> <p>to be seen as an expression that addresses the broader canvas of providing relief to the people from</p> <p>the mundane concerns of life that includes multiple aspects of diversion such as delight, recreation,</p> <p>pastime or mere distraction from the problems of real life even if momentarily.</p> <p>Development function</p> <p>The importance of communication in mobilizing people and seeking their willing participation in the</p> <p>development of a country is well recognized. In India, this concern above reaching people,</p> <p>communicating with them and equipping them with new skills has been emphasized over and again</p> <p>in successive five year plans which provide the blue print of the country’s planned development.</p> <p>(Kumar, 2006) While communication for development has generally been ascribed to the usage of</p> <p>the modern mass media forms, the latter half of the last millennium has shown us that the modern</p> <p>mass media forms have not been able to live up to the expectations of development communication</p> <p>planners in the developing nations. This is primarily owing to the fact that people still cannot connect</p> <p>themselves with the modern mass media forms as comfortable as with the traditional media forms of</p> <p>communication.</p> <p>In this regard, the MacBride Commission in its report titled ‘Many Voices One World’ asserted,</p> <p>“Even when modern media have penetrated isolated areas, the older forms maintain their validity,</p> <p>particularly when used to influence attitudes, instigate action and promote change. Extensive</p> <p>experience shown that traditional forms of communication can be effective in dispelling the</p> <p>superstitions, archaic perceptions and unscientific that people have inherited as part of traditions and</p> <p>which are difficult to modify if the benefits of change are hard to demonstrate. Practitioners of the</p> <p>7</p> <p>traditional media use a subtle form of persuasion by presenting the required message in locally</p> <p>popular artistic forms. This cannot be rivalled by any other means of communication.” (Kumar,</p> <p>2006)</p> <p>Theatre can be used as important mode of communication for development primarily owing to its</p> <p>certain qualities. It is one of the cheapest media available, it does not rely on literacy, it can be more</p> <p>flexible and topical than other media, and above all the audience can participate in the play making</p> <p>the theatre a genuine two-way medium for communicating information. (Kasoma, 1974) The theatre</p> <p>holds more relevance in Indian perspective primarily owing to the fact that the Indian folk theatre is</p> <p>a composite form of containing songs, music, dance, and drama that seeks to fulfil all the intellectual,</p> <p>emotional, and aesthetic needs of its spectators. It is more than entertainment, a complete emotional</p> <p>experience and creates a state of receptivity in which messages can be most effectively transmitted.</p> <p>Folk theatre has functioned as an instrument of social awareness, protest, and change. Regional rural</p> <p>drama performance is known to be dependable and persuasive change agents, acting as a bridge</p> <p>between different rural areas, and between rural and urban areas. Unlike in western theatre, folk</p> <p>performance is a composite art in India. It is a total art with fusion elements from music, dance,</p> <p>pantomime, versification, epic ballad recitation, religion and festival peasantry. It imbibes</p> <p>ceremonials, rituals, belief and social system. It has deep religious and ritualistic overtones and then</p> <p>again, it can surely project social life, secular themes and universal values. (Kumar S. , 2012)</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>The theatre by its very nature and particularly because of its communality and its fictionalized</p> <p>situations provides a forum, whereby communication can easily take place without the attending</p> <p>antagonisms which would normally occur in a directly realistic situation. As part of an educational</p> <p>and organizational process, theatre can play a range of roles: bringing people together and creating</p> <p>contexts for collective reflection and action; drawing out participation and expression of popular</p> <p>concerns, and analysis; overcoming people's fears and rationalizations and building confidence and</p> <p>identity; stimulating discussion and a critical understanding of problems, contradictions, and</p> <p>structures underlining everyday reality; clarifying the possibilities and strategies for action; stirring</p> <p>people’s emotions and mobilizing people for action. (Warritay, 1988)</p> <p>It is worth mentioning here that the great Greek philosopher Aristotle who wrote the first Western</p> <p>treatise on drama, the Poetics, is also credited with the earliest model of human communication.</p> <p>8</p> <p>Though Aristotle himself never gave any model per se, the model has been derived by later thinkers</p> <p>from his ideas given in another treatise written by him, the Rhetoric, which essentially deals with the</p> <p>art of conversation. The model includes five essential elements of communication, i.e., the speaker,</p> <p>the speech or message, the audience, the occasion and the effect. In the Rhetoric, Aristotle presents</p> <p>his ideas on the art of speech construction by speakers for different audiences on different occasions</p> <p>for producing different effects. However, it would not be out of place to assume that Aristotle’s idea</p> <p>was based on his personal experience of the Greek theatre and shaped by his observations on the</p> <p>same. As it appears, the speaker that Aristotle talks of, in all likelihood, refers to the actor while the</p> <p>occasion refers to the act of theatrical presentation. The remaining elements are important</p> <p>components of any dramatic act, that is, the speech by the actor, the audience experiencing the act</p> <p>and the effect produced in the minds of the audience.</p> <p>While Aristotle’s model does give us a basic idea on the communication process that apparently</p> <p>takes place in our daily lives, it is found lacking in certain aspects of communication. Perhaps owing</p> <p>to the fact that Aristotle was primarily addressing the subject of speech construction in the Rhetoric,</p> <p>the importance of non-verbal communication in any act of communication seems to have been</p> <p>completely overlooked by him. This aspect of non-verbal communication has been comprehensively</p> <p>discussed and addressed in Bharata’s Nātyasāstra. Having said so, Bharata does not undermine the</p> <p>importance of speech in communication. Thus says Bharata, “One should take care of words… In</p> <p>this world, the Śāstras are made up of words and rest on words; hence there is nothing beyond</p> <p>words, and words are the source of everything. The Verbal representation is related to [a knowledge</p> <p>of] nouns (nāma), verbs (ākhyta), particle (nipāta), preposition (upasarga), nominal suffix</p> <p>(taddhita), compound words (samāsa), euphonic combination (sandhi) and case-endings (vibhakti).”</p> <p>(Ghosh, 1950) Speech, Bharata, terms as vācika. However, Bharata takes note of the other aspects as</p> <p>well that play a vital role in deciding the outcome of any communication endeavour. These include:</p> <p>1. Physical representation (Angikā)</p> <p>2. Costumes and make-up (Āharya)</p> <p>3. Temperament (Sattva)</p> <p>9</p> <p>Thus, Bharata emphasizes on approaching communication in a four-fold manner of expression</p> <p>comprising of vācika, angikā, sattva and āharya. While Bharata postulates the four-fold principle of</p> <p>communication primarily in parlance of drama, it would not be out of place to assume that Bharata</p> <p>also had in his mind the universe while laying down the tenets. As Bharata ascribes the following</p> <p>words to Lord Brahma, “The drama as I have devised, is a mimicry of actions and conducts of</p> <p>people, which is rich in various emotions, and which depicts different situations.” Besides, this fourfold</p> <p>approach is indeed, a more, practical and hands on approach towards analysing and decoding the</p> <p>process of communication.</p> <p>Communication, after all, is not merely about expression of either words or actions. Rather, it</p> <p>incorporates all the aspects of human expression that can play an effective part on conveying the</p> <p>ultimate meaning to the recipient of the information. The absence or disproportionate representation</p> <p>of any one of the given aspects necessarily results in confusion in the minds of the audience and that</p> <p>is what gives rise to the feeling of absurdity. No wonder then, the Indian approach to communication</p> <p>is referred to as sādhāranikarana which essentially means establishing a feeling of uniformity</p> <p>between the participants involved in an act of communication. This, in turn, can be achieved only</p> <p>when commonness is attained at the various intermediary levels of human interaction between the</p> <p>communicator and the communicated through their respective abilities. It is this feeling of</p> <p>commonness and uniformity that is the driving force of communication in this universe. The theatre</p> <p>being a miniature representation of the same is no different.</p> <p>References</p> <p>1. Andal, N. (2004). Communication Theories and Models.

The modern environmentalist movement as it emerged first in the late nineteenth century and, in its more recent incarnation, in the 1960s, gave rise to a rich array of fictional and nonfictional writings concerned with humans’ changing relationship to the natural world. Only since the early 1990s, however, has the long-standing interest of literary studies in these matters generated the initiative most commonly known as “ecocriticism,” an eclectic and loosely coordinated movement whose contributions thus far have been most visible within its home discipline of literature but whose interests and alliances extend across various art forms and media. In such areas as the study of narrative and image, ecocriticism converges with its sister disciplines in the humanities: environmental anthropology, environmental history, and environmental philosophy.</p> <p>Literature and environment studies—commonly called “ecocriticism” or “environmental criticism” in analogy to the more general term literary criticism—comprise an eclectic, pluriform, and cross-disciplinary initiative that aims to explore the environmental dimensions of literature and other creative media in a spirit of environmental concern not limited to any one method or commitment. As Lawrence Buell et al. explain, “Ecocriticism begins from the conviction that the arts of imagination and the study there of—by virtue of their grasp of the power of word, story, and image to reinforce, enliven, and direct environmental concern—can contribute significantly to the understanding of environmental problems: the multiple forms of eco-degradation that afflict planet earth today” (3). In this, ecocriticism concurs with other branches of the environmental humanities—ethics, history, religious studies, anthropology, humanistic geography—in holding that environmental phenomena must be comprehended, and that today’s burgeoning array of environmental concerns must be addressed qualitatively as well as quantitatively.</p> <p>At least as fundamental to their remediation as scientific breakthroughs and strengthened regimes of policy implementation is the impetus of creative imagination, vision, will, and belief. Even though, as the poet W.H. Auden (2) famously wrote, “poetry makes nothing happen” in and of itself, the outside-the-box thought experiments of literature and other media can offer unique resources for activating concern and creative thinking about the planet’s environmental future. By themselves, creative depictions of environmental harm are unlikely to free societies from lifestyles that depend on radically transforming ecosystems. But reflecting on works of imagination may prompt intensified concern about the consequences of such choices and possible alternatives to them. In this regard, the Niger Delta has recently become a topic of discussion for literary artists as the region’s environment has witnessed environmental degradations which constitute health hazards for the people and other natural organisms due to the activities of oil explorations. The need to arrest the deplorable environmental situations of the Niger Delta has being the focus of many literary and environmental activists, and this study falls within the many attempts to effect changes in this regard.</p> <p>The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is rich in crude oil otherwise known as black gold. This singular factor has made this region a cause celebre and a hotbed of trouble in the Sub-Saharan region. The region is bedeviled with ecological problems. The discovery of oil in the region has affected agriculture, fishing as well as the living conditions of the people. Wumi Raji contends that “when Shell D’Arcy, the Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Corporation which later transformed to Shell Petroleum Development Company shipped out the first 5,000 barrels in 1958, the price of the mineral resources was only $4.00 US dollars per barrel. By 1981, when almost 15 oil companies jointly produced over 2 million barrels daily from the innumerable oil wells strewn all over the Niger Delta, the price per barrel had risen to 40 dollar …” (58). This has affected not only the environment but also the life of the people in terms of finding an eco-friendly land for their arable and acquatic livelihood. Good land has, thus, become an important scarce resource for the Niger Delta people.                                                                                                  Land in the Niger Delta, like in other parts of Nigeria and Africa is regarded as a sacred entity as well as symbol of life and status. This is probably why Ngugi posits that “the basic objective of the Mau Mau revolutionaries was to drive out the Europeans … and give back to the Kenyan peasants their stolen land” (28). In South Africa, due to the temperate climate and natural endowment, the Europeans penetrated into the interior, driving out the natives into infertile land and exploring their mineral for their personal development at the detriment of black South Africans. The black South Africans became labourers in the mines. They were moved into shacks and condemned to a slow genocide. </p> <p>Like in East Africa (especially Kenya), this form of oppression and deprivation led to resistance. This recurring decimal perpetuates itself in the Niger Delta environment, resulting in hardship for the people. Land, streams, creeks etc have been polluted, roofs of buildings in the area have been perforated while “the vapour when it settles on the skin turns into a charred surface in the form of an unsightly skin disease” (Raji, III). Raji reasons further that “there is also the effect of consistent explosions which cause many of the buildings to shake and the walls to crack. Because of this many of the villagers have had to abandon their houses, migrating to other villages in search of refuge” (III).</p> <p>Apart from these ecological problems, the Niger Delta region lacks basic social amenities like portable drinking water, electricity, roads, hospitals, schools, and job opportunities to enable the people earn their living and become self reliant, yet the region is the proverbial goose that lays the golden egg that feeds the entire nation. It is against this backdrop of economic, social and political deprivation that Ken Saro Wiwa and eight of his kinsmen have died for. Saro Wiwa views the exploration of oil by multinationals as anti-people exploitation. In an insightful interview, Saro Wiwa affirms that his people live in the middle of death. What Saro Wiwa advocates for is the right of the Ogoni people to use their resources for their own development.</p> <p>Sam Uniamikogbo and Stanley Aibieyi rightly submit that “considering the role of oil in national development, the struggle for indigenous control of activities in the industry has persisted over the years. Among oil exploring countries like Mexico and Libya, this struggle has culminated in apparent revolution, which ultimately forced out foreign oil firms from the industry and made way for national control of oil operations” (247). Saro Wiwa’s fight for social justice and minority rights has made him a man of the people. That he was able to mobilise and draw attention, locally and internationally to the plight of his people marked him out as one of the greatest activist of his time.                                                                Kaine Agary’s <em>Yellow-Yellow </em>and Helon Habila’s <em>Oil on Water</em> situate themselves within the Niger Delta discourse as well as the polemics surrounding the women and environmental issues in this region. For instance, Agary’s inspiration as a writer derives from Saro Wiwa’s commitment for social justice for the Ogoni people, who have been marginalised, deprived and exploited. Pushed to the wall, these people have no choice but to bounce back in order to force the government and indeed humanity to understand their predicament. This has led to untold violence: killing, maiming, gun running, destruction/vandalization of pipelines and recently kidnapping of foreigners and Nigerians for ransom. Young girls/women who cannot find jobs to do or education, find succour in the hands of foreigners who exploit their sexuality. The plight of women in the Niger Delta region is indeed pathetic. Agary’s <em>Yellow-Yellow </em>is a literary enterprise whose main thrust is to expose further the socio-economic predicament of the people as well as explore the debilitating effect of poverty on the feminine psyche. Helon Habila’s concerns generally center on the need to find lasting solutions to the Niger Delta problems confronting the country. This underlies the commitments of both writers to the corrective role of literature in society.</p> <p>The history of oil exploration and production in the Niger Delta is a long, complex and often painful one that to date has become seemingly intractable in terms of its resolution and future direction. It is also a history that has put people and politics and the oil industry at loggerheads rendering a landscape characterized by a lack of trust, paralysis and blame, set against a worsening situation for the communities concerned. The reality is that decades of negotiations, initiatives and protests have ultimately failed to deliver a solution that meets the expectations and responsibilities of all sides. This complex situation has been described by James Tar Tsaaior as “paradoxical.” (71)                                                                      For several seasons now, the Niger Delta has been writhing in throes. It is still writhing in throes. And it will, perhaps, continue to writhe in throes; perhaps, perpetually. Reasons exist for these seasons of throes. The Niger Delta is a blessed, ethereal landscape. It is home to a congregation of ageless swamps, calm creeks, and primeval estuaries. It is also drained by ancient streams and graceful undulating rivers that are populated with shoals of fishes which teem their beds. This is besides other magnificent marine creatures which the area lays claim to, making it a haven of aquatic splendour. With its virile, verdant vegetation of tall, elegant forest trees like the iroko, mahogany, obeche and other swaying flora, the Niger Delta is a natural habitat to a rare breed of wild animals and species of birds which eminently qualify this richly endowed rain forest enclave as a foremost tourist destination of global magnitude. The region is also a neighbour of the majestic, imperial Atlantic to which it pays its watery tributes as a vassal, and in turn has its shoreline bathed with the effervescent and refreshing waters of the ocean. </p> <p>But besides its idyllic essence, there is another more fundamental reason why the Delta writhes in throes. It is the reservoir of priceless mineral resources. In the bowels of this rich, fertile, alluvial earth dwells crude in prodigious deposits. Tayo Olafioye underscores this geographic munificence and the considerable impact it exerts on the Niger Delta peoples when he states that; </p> <p>Geography can influence human behaviour and perception of reality. The Delta as a feature of physical geography creates fishing and farming avocation for its indigene who inhabits its enclave… underneath the Delta are natural resources with which the gods are believed to have enriched the environment. The black gold flows deep and wide between the substrata… the Delta is the gateway to the Atlantic Ocean which encapsulates larger riches and travails for the people. It constitutes topography of gold and travails that borders dynamic resources (2-3). </p> <p>It is this invaluable resource known otherwise as black gold that translates into oil. It is this oil that lubricates the heart and arteries of Nigeria’s mono-cultural economy. It is the same oil that also coagulates and burns these arteries and veins. Thus, what should constitute a veritable source of national blessings has yielded a primal curse whose cause is to gnaw at the soul and visceral of the nation and its chequered existential course in the continuum of history, and “this has made, and continues to make, the Niger Delta Nigeria’s boiling, simmering cauldron, and the recurring decimal of a tissue of paradoxes. It has also enmeshed the land in a ritualized frenzy of debacles and fitful convulsions” (Tsaaior, 72).</p> <p>It is no doubt that oil exploration and exploitation is very lucrative, and a major revenue earner in Nigeria. But, like most industrial activities, it produces environmental hazards that are “slow poisons,” in that they often take months and years to cause disease and death. This is unlike the contamination of water, food, and the environment with micro-organisms, which immediately results in ill health. The covert and slow action of the hazards created by oil exploration and exploitation make it difficult to fully appreciate their contribution to the disease burden in Nigeria, especially in the oil-bearing communities, even with the emergence of non-communicable diseases as major causes of ill health in Nigeria. </p> <p>Each year, 100s of post-impact assessment (PIA) studies are conducted in the Niger Delta to assess the impact of the hazards generated by the oil industry on the physical and social environment and on human health. But, most of these studies are conducted without any significant contributions from health professionals and are reported without highlighting the immediate and long-term implications of the identified hazards on the health of members of the impacted communities. This was sadly commented upon in the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Ogoni environmental assessment report; and is likely to continue because even the technical review of the impact assessment reports, carried out by the Federal Ministry of Environment, often do not include a health professional. Thus, this contributes to the plethora of complicated issues in the region.</p> <p>The need to resolve conflict in the Niger Delta has been worrisome. Granting amnesty after surrendering arms to restive youths in return for training and skill acquisition, some have argued is still not the best option. Recently President Yar’Adua has placed the repentant militants on a salary, but for how long did this last? Miscreants have joined the throng as ex-militants in order to reap where they did not sow. No one is sure who the real militants are and if they have surrendered all their arms. The situation is dicey and need careful attention to forestall continuous uprising in the region. The Ministry of the Niger Delta Affairs has to be more proactive and sensitive to the needs and yearnings of the people. If the crisis in the Niger Delta region is well managed, then the conflicts in the region would have been solved and peace will certainly return to the region.</p> <p>          But the continued security unrests and environmental challenges posed by the activities in oil exploration have shown that the presence of oil in Nigeria has become a curse than a blessing especially for the Niger Deltan communities where it is deposited and the natural habitats that suffer its mismanagement. Since the writer must become the “watchdog” that checkmates societal ills or excesses, according to Achebe, this study is geared towards contributing to the many literatures of the Niger Delta, and in ecocriticism that does not only bring issues of the environment to the fore but also seek to reconstruct and affect positive changes in the Niger Delta environment.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statements of Problem</strong></p> <p>Oil exploration and exploitation has been very lucrative, and a major revenue earner in Nigeria. But, like most industrial activities, it produces environmental hazards that are detrimental to the people and the environment where the oil is deposited. The situation in the Niger Delta is both curious and is an annoying paradox. The people live in difficult coastal areas surrounded by water, and yet, do not have enough water to drink. The creeks are littered with pipelines bearing petroleum products to other parts of the country, but from this researcher’s personal experiences fuel is scarce and expensive, as a matter of fact costlier in Yenegoa than in Kano. The Niger Deltans have also lamented that, before their very eyes, revenue from crude oil sales is taken away to provide infrastructure in other parts of the country (beautiful roads in Abuja, Skyscrapers and flyovers in Lagos etc.) while many communities in the Niger Delta are cut off from civilization because there are no roads or bridges to get to them.</p> <p>In other development, the Niger Delta youths in their thousands, if not millions are largely unemployed. The qualified ones among them have to struggle with other Nigerians to get employments and positions in the oil companies. The oil companies have their headquarters in Lagos and Abuja, not in the Niger Delta. The people feel neglected as illiterates and minorities that can be manipulated. Youths, adults, women, and children grow up and die in the region without much hope and chance of a better life, thus driving many into militancy and other vices; while people from other parts of Nigeria, especially the North, enjoy the benefits that oil wells bring,                                                                        Consequently, the militants among them feel they have reached a point where the only choice they find attractive is violence and kidnapping, illegal bunkering, pipeline vandalism etc. to drive home their demands for equity and justice and due recognition of their rights as citizens. More so, the presence of oil has led to the depreciation in other economic and income earning activities which have driven Nigeria into a monolithic economy that has spelt doom for the country, as local skills and crafts in agriculture have been lost overtime. These unfavourable situations have led some critics to believe that the oil in the Niger Delta is more of a ‘curse’ than a ‘blessing’.</p> <p>This study, thus relates literature to the environment through the Theory of Ecocriticism or Green Literature by examining the presence of oil in Nigerian prose fiction using Helon Habila’s <em>Oil on Water</em> and Kaine Agary’s<em> Yellow Yellow</em> to explain the impact of oil in the Niger Deltan environment as a microcosm of the Nigerian environment.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Aim and Objectives of Study</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to examine oil in Nigerian prose fiction using Helon Habila’s <em>Oil on Water</em> and Kaine Agary’s<em> Yellow Yellow</em>.

Situate the texts to contemporary Nigerian society.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Scope of Study</strong></p> <p>This study comes under the purview of ecocriticism which examines the environmental aspects of literature. The study is limited to the eco-thematic and eco-critical analysis of Helon Habila’s <em>Oil on Water</em> and Kaine Agary’s<em> Yellow Yellow</em>. As such, issues surrounding oil explorations in the Niger Delta and in Nigeria will be discussed in relations to the environmental situations or effects oil has on the community.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Methodology</strong></p> <p>The study adopts eco-criticism theory and Content Analysis approach in exploring the place of oil in Nigerian prose fiction. The data for this research is Helon Habila’s <em>Oil on Water</em> and Kaine Agary’s<em> Yellow Yellow</em>. Every page of both texts that touches on the issues surrounding the impact of oil in Nigeria will be examined. </p> <p>          The study will also use materials from journal articles, periodicals, literary texts, and internet surfing that will be relevant for this research will be consulted for review of literatures. </p> <p><strong>1.6 Significance of Study</strong></p> <p>The research is significant in the following ways:</p> <p>i. It exposes the environmental issues surrounding oil explorations in Nigeria, thus creating further awareness on the subject of environmental degradations.</p> <p>ii. It examines how Nigerian prose fiction writers have been able explore the place of oil in Nigerian Literature, thereby contributing to the literatures of the Niger Delta.</p> <p>iii. By situating the texts to contemporary Nigerian society, the study exposes the relevant contributions of literature (especially prose fiction writers) to society.</p> <p>iv.

As of 1991, the National Census estimated that “about 25% of the entire Nigerian population lives within the Niger Delta region” (Twumasi and Merem, 206). They went further to report that the Niger Delta region has a steady growing population of approximately 30 million people as of 2005, accounting for more than 23% of Nigeria’s total population.</p> <p>The British discovered oil in this region in 1956 and crude oil was discovered in commercial quantity by the Shell British Petroleum, which is now called Royal Dutch Shell at Oloibiri, a village in the Niger Delta and “in 1958 commercial production began with a production of about 6,000 barrels per day” (Uyigue and Ogbeibu, 200). The region has huge oil and gas reserves, and “ranks the sixth world’s largest exporter of crude oil and ranked as the third world’s largest producer of palm oil after Malaysia and Indonesia” (Omofonmwa and Odia, 209). </p> <p>Oil and gas from the region are the main source of revenue for the Nigerian state, accounting for about 97% of the country’s total export. Since the discovery of oil in the region, oil has dominated the country’s economy. The Niger Delta is highly susceptible to adverse environmental changes, occasioned by climate changes because it is located in the coastal region. Conclusive reports have stated that due to oil exploration and exploitation activities, the area has become an ecological wasteland. Ogoniland has witnessed recurrent social unrest during the past several decades over concerns related to oil industry operations, its revenue and petroleum related contamination. Although oil industry operations were suspended in Ogoni land in 1993, widespread environmental contamination remains. The effect of oil exploration in the region is negatively multifarious.</p> <p>Since the discovery of oil in Nigeria in the 1950s, the country has been suffering the negative environmental consequences of oil development. The growth of the country's oil industry, combined with a population explosion and a lack of enforcement of environmental regulations has led to substantial damage to Nigeria's environment, especially in the Niger Delta region.</p> <p>According to UNEP Report of 2005, when there is an oil spill on water, spreading immediately takes place. The gaseous and liquid components evaporate. Some get dissolved in water and even oxidize, and yet some undergo bacterial changes and eventually sink to the bottom by gravitational action. The soil is then contaminated with a gross effect upon the terrestrial life. As the evaporation of the volatile lower molecular weight components affect aerial life, so the dissolution of the less volatile components with the resulting emulsified water, affects aquatic life (Akpofure et al, 26).</p> <p>The harmful effects of oil spill on the environment are many. Oil kills plants and animals in the estuarine zone. Oil settles on beaches and kills organisms that live there; it also settles on ocean floor and kills benthic (bottom-dwelling) organisms such as crabs. Oil poisons algae, disrupts major food chains and decreases the yield of edible crustaceans. It also coats birds, impairing their flight or reducing the insulative property of their feathers, thus making the birds more vulnerable to cold. Oil endangers fish hatcheries in coastal waters and as well contaminates the flesh of commercially valuable fish.</p> <p>In the Nigerian coastal environment a large areas of the mangrove ecosystem have been destroyed. The mangrove was once a source of both fuel wood for the indigenous people and a habitat for the area's biodiversity, but is now unable to survive the oil toxicity of its habitat. Oil spills in the Niger Delta have been a regular occurrence, and the resultant degradation of the surrounding environment has caused significant tension between the people living in the region and the multinational oil companies operating there. It is only in the past decade that environmental groups, the Federal Government, and the foreign oil companies operating in the Niger Delta began to take steps to mitigate the impacts. Large areas of the mangrove ecosystem have also been destroyed. The mangrove forest was in the past a major source of wood for the indigenous people. In some places it is no longer in a healthy state to sustain this use (Nwilo &amp; Badejo, 25)                           The Idoho oil spill traveled all the way from Akwa Ibom state to Lagos state dispersing oil through the coastal states, up to the Lagos coast. This culminated in the presence of sheen of oil on the coastal areas of Cross river state, Akwa Ibom state, Rivers state, Bayelsa state, Delta state, Ondo state and Lagos state. In many villages near oil installations, even when there has been no recent spill, an oily sheen can be seen on the water, which in fresh water areas is usually the same water that the people living there use for drinking and washing. In April 1997, samples taken from water used for drinking and washing by local villagers were analyzed in the U.S. A sample from Luawii, in Ogoni, where there had been no oil production for four years, had 18 ppm of hydrocarbons in the water, 360 times the level allowed in drinking water in the European Union (E.U.). A sample from Ukpeleide, Ikwerre, contained 34 ppm, 680 times the E.U. standard (UNEP, 2005).</p> <p>Following the major Texaco spill of 1980, it was reported that 180 people died in one community as a result of the pollution. On several occasions, people interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that spills in their area had made people sick who drank the water, especially children.</p> <p>Apart from the effects of oil spills, other negative vices came with the discovery of oil which affects the people and their environment, and the nation at large. Subsequently, several protests and clamors for justice have been registered by the local people to no avail. Characteristically, both military and civilian governments have ignored clamors for equitable remedy and forcibly smothered protests through use of overwhelming military might and other documented acts of state sanctioned political violence. </p> <p>The existing concept of Federalism in Nigeria today falls short of prospects in both definition and practice. To the extent that it is being practiced as quasi-federalism, there has been an overly concentrated control of resources by the federal government. Thereby making its component units (state) including the Niger Delta state to be completely dependent on the Federal Government for survival. This abnormality continues to generate continual conflict with indigenous rights, hence, has become a main cause of conflict in the Niger Delta region especially from dishonorable deprivation principles for revenue allocation to the states in the region. The struggles of the Niger Deltans which have assumed violent dimensions in our recent history, are explained to be an expression of the people’s grievances over neglects, marginalization, oppression, subjugation, exploitation and deprivation by the Nigeria government and its collaborators (multi-nationals) of the people’s right to equity and justice of their God-giving resources.</p> <p>          As Biakpara puts it “what the people of the Delta are asking for is equity and justice and due recognition of their rights as citizen. These issues are contained in the Ogoni Bill Rights, the Kaiama declaration, and similar declarations by other groups in the Niger Delta. Sound, the people are insisting on a cessation of destructive oil exploration activities which destroy the Niger Delta ecology and human lives” (3).</p> <p>          Biakpara reports further that, the Niger Deltans want the abrogation of all laws which dispossesses them of their rights as a federating unit within Nigeria. They want the crisis of poverty in the Niger Delta to be addressed. According to him, “although the general poverty index of Nigeria has risen sharply, the worse poverty situations are found in the Niger Delta. The people also want Nigerians to pay attention to their message and treat them with respect as equals in the Nigerian nation” (3).</p> <p>          The precedence was set when in 1966, Isaac Adaka Boro and Notthingham Dick, two Ijaw young men, set up the Niger Delta Volunteer Service (NDVS). They were concerned with rising poverty levels of their people and also perceived that the domineering tendencies of the major tribes in Nigeria were to blame. It was on the platform of the NDVS that they declared an Independent Niger Delta Republic in Febuary 1966. This first secessionist-bid in the history of Nigeria failed (<em>Tell</em>, June 25, 2009:6).</p> <p>          The passage of Isaac Adaka Boro and his lieutenant, Nottingham Dick only marked the beginning of oil-history struggle. Between the late 1980s and early 1990s, Kenule Saro Wiwa led the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) and broug</p>\n\nOIL IN NIGERIAN PROSE FICTION: A STUDY OF HELON HABILA’S OIL ON WATER AND KAINE AGARY’S YELLOW YELLOW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " OIL IN NIGERIAN PROSE FICTION: A STUDY OF HELON HABILA’S OIL ON WATER AND KAINE AGARY’S YELLOW YELLOW", "id": 143}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>What is music? Music a general melody   of sounds that unify the mind and soul,not even language differencescan’t  stop music fromreaching out to her selected audience, even before recorded history, people created music, whether through drumming, singing or chanting. Some of our strongest emotions may be brought on by listening to a piece of music. In this modern age, we hear music around us almost all of our waking hours, in one form or another: radio, television or film music and our personal music (iPods, MP3 players, etc.) is with us throughout the day. Most of us listen to recorded music or go to performances regularly, and some of us play a musical instrument. Prior to modern audio recording technology, music was available only in the presence of a musician, or to those who played an instrument or sang. Music varies in genres, pop, rock, R'n'B etc.</p> <p>A basic definition of music (in the Western World) is the chronological organisation of sounds; that is, making certain sounds at certain times, which make melodic, rhythmic and harmonic sense.The first, most basic concept, is keeping the sounds \"in time\". This leads us to some of the first few musical concepts: beat, rhythm and duration.Beat is the regular pulse which provides a `timeline` for the rhythm to anchor itself to.Rhythm is essentially repeated patterns of long or short, stressed or unstressed sounds or silences which fit into the main beat.Duration is the length of notes or sounds or silences which facilitate the rhythm.</p> <p>Music is also the relationship between sound and silence. Duration and rhythm apply to silence in the same manner as they apply to sound.One way to look at how we perceive music is as horizontal and vertical patterns. We hear melodies as a horizontal pattern. The notes (and silences) are heard one after the other over a period of time.We hear chords (groups of notes played simultaneously) in a vertical pattern. A mixture of one or all of these: melody, rhythm, chords, and silence form musical patterns.Rhythm is the most basic concept of music. In all cultures worldwide, the most simple and basic forms of music are purely rhythms. A rhythm is a pulse; a repetition of sounds in a pattern. Simple rhythms can be recognized straight away. Tapping rhythmically at a drum constitutes tapping it at timed intervals in a pattern. The most common rhythmic pattern in modern-day Western music is  <em>four-four time</em>. This is where four pulses come one after the other, with thefirst of each four being given emphasis (known as an accent). In music, <strong>pitch</strong> is used to describe how high or low a note sounds. Anyone would know the difference between a high-pitched scratching of fingernails across a blackboard, and the low, rumbling growl of thunder. When Maria tells the children in <em>The Sound of Music</em> that \"the first few notes just happen to be...do re mi\", she was referring to pitch. Using pitch, together with rhythm, we can start to construct <strong>melodies</strong>. Without rhythm, notes would just be long, sustained sounds. Without pitch, each sound would be the same (for example, the beating of a single drum).In music, we use the word <strong>dynamics</strong> to describe how loudly or softly a note is played. Dynamics falls under the wider category of <strong>expressive techniques</strong>, which are instructions for the performer to play loudly or softly, smoothly or detached, and many other effects.In music, the \"color\" of a sound being produced is referred to as <strong>timbre</strong>, or <strong>tone colour</strong>. Timbre is the difference between the harsh, scratchy sound of an electric guitar with distortion; the glassy, rounded sound of a piano; and the bird-like whispering sound of a flute. All these instruments could play exactly the same note, yet anyone would be able to recognise instantly an electric guitar from a piano from a flute.Recapitulation - Returns to the tonic key and states the main theme and subordinate theme. The subordinate theme is often reworked to stay in the tonic.Coda - Concludes the pieceTexture in music refers to the layering of sounds on top of each other. It describes the depth, nature, and relationship of those layers of sound, or <strong>voices</strong>. It can describe the vertical and horizontal relationship between the voices. Some common textures are:</p> <p><strong>Monophonic texture:</strong> A melody by itself, without harmony, and without another melody. Forexample, singing in the shower, monks chanting, or a fife and drum corps.<strong>Polyphonic texture:</strong>Two or more melodies, heard at the same time. For example of singing \"Row, row, row your boat\" as a round, or a Bach Fugue.Music we all knowentertains, it gives pleasuretohumanity and it expresses ideas and,emotions in significant form through the Elementof rhythm, harmony and colorMusic isfound inevery known culture all over the world in past and present varying widely between times and places most people in the world includingthe tribal groups who has been existing in the ancestral   population   prior to the dispersal of the human race.  Music have been in existence over 55,000 years ago .Music was first invented in Africa and its fundamental consistent has played a major role in human life. Music can also be seen as an influential part of culture andaccess to technology. The motion ad ideas that music expresses the situation which is been played and listened to. The history of music can be viewed from the prehistoric music andBiblicalperiod, the prehistorical music is commonly called the primitive music. This name is given to all music produced in preliterate cultures. This type of music also is followed by the ancient music mostly in Europe which existed in isolated areas. The origin of music is unknown as it is, occurred prior to the recorded of some scholar’ssuggestions According to Geberth’sGlaindo’s view 2003 clearly state that “Music can change dramatically over a short period”. However music stirs the natural occurrence of sound and rhythmic nature that suit the human mind using,the patterns of repetitionand tonality. Even today some cultures have certain instances that may serve as entertainment to theirsociety.The history of music needs rewriting because the greatest source available has been rejected which is recognizing the creator of the universe (God) as the origin of music.According to the Easton Bible dictionary Jubal was recorded as the inventor of musical instrument also the Bible also indicate that the first man (Adam) knew and practice music. Considering how existed in the spirit realm, the book of revelation records the lyrics of the Angels shouting and dancing around God’s heavenly throne. Also the bible reveals that God sings (zephaniah3: 17) this clearly stated that God is a lover of music just has human beings love music.Throughout the history of music colorful tones pulsating rhythm and meaningful lyrics have been a catalyst or sound track for movement of change. A major usage of music is to portray ideas such as in politics, spirituality or philosophical way, but however, it can be used to show the meaning like people expressing their love for loved once, to show boredom and to show creativity. Music can also be used to liven up, it may not have specific idea or meaning but it can be used to make things look better and more complete.  Many people depend on it as it has become relevant source of lively hood.  Music also can be used to voice the plight of the repressed. In America, the sixties saw the coining of the phrase “protest songs” as Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and a plethora of author artist were protesting the Vietnam War.  “A hard rain is gonna fall “they said and it did. Woodstock wasn’t far away neither was Jim Hendrix warped rendition of the US national anthem reflecting what he thought of his country then. Just about the same time, a dilettante John Lennon was singing “Happiness is a warm gun.‘Little did he know that on a cold December night, the warmth of a gun would take his life In the Caribbean,drenched in sun and music, the Jamaican reggae cum Rasta phenomenon propelled Michael Manley to power he was replaced a while but not before Jimmy Cliff and Bob Marley had time to spread the “stand up for your right “philosophy(Jean Pierre Cloutier 1987). others include Denver john , luigiNono (   1924-1990)  an  Italian composer , Quaker , Bonnie Ratite who championed social  causes and has worked for victims of political persecution In the American countries , U2 , an Irish rock music band which achieved worldwide popularity during the 1980s and 1990s . The subsequently grew famous for commitment to political causes including prominent support for international human rights.Music also can connect the written word to social rights issues, conveying a message of hope to the society also portrayed as freedom and expression often used to evoke politics and some aspect of the society. It is often used as a form of propaganda and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conception or mood. Lastly music connect people around the world.Another key to the order in music is the music being the same and different. The brain works by looking at different pieces of information and deciding if they are different or the same. This is done in music of the baroque and classical periods by playing a theme and then repeating or changing the theme. Furthermore excessive repetition causes people to lose control of their thought and expression. While rhythmic repetition is used by people who are trying to push ethics in their music (O’Donnell, 1999)</p> <p><strong> 1.0    BACK GROUND TO THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>The key to approaching the music of Fela and it change contexts of revolution, circular and consumption reveals the peculiar character of the relationship between art specifically oppositional music and post-colonial African state. Fela‘sAfro beat occupies a pivotal position in Nigeria musical continuum and socio political discourse, throughFela a new medium of social and political criticism was Unearthed for the critical mass of Nigeria in the 1970. Although Nigeria was experiencing what would turn out to been a brief respite of oil boom prosperity after the biter Biafra civil war. Fela used his music to remind the society to be critical and cautions about the military, dictatorship and the impact of neocolonialism on the psyche of the Nigeria people.  In other words fela is seen as an activist all over Africa. A true activist first of all must acknowledge the power of the mind. There is no road to healing;consciousness must be fundamental in the process of doing this he or she realizes that the root cause of the ecological destruction of the world and social injustice are not “out there “but in here”- in our own mind (Andrew 2003) this where the music of fela comes to play, his emotions towards the oppressed and the creation of mental image of societies who were used by their dictators describing them as been constantly responsible for Africa’s woes. His words, Africa was been ruled not by people, but by comprador classes nations as a whole.In conclusion Fela’s music through his famous songs tittleTeacher as his focus letting people see that the white man knows everything we know but one of the important thing they thought us was politics so he used that to compare the situation of issues we are facing in NigeriaFela’s ideology is a matrix of radical Black Nationalism which opened out to a much expansive Pan Africanism and Afro centrism and a sturdy partisanship for the oppressed lower classes that could be described as socialist in orientation and an irrepressible libertarianism that frequently tries to anchor the articulator of the other two. Fela’s solidarity with the oppressed lower classes was a complete. He lived in their midst, trumpeted their sounds to national attention,experienced their brutalitalization at the hands of official lawlessness and even shared their poverty(Olaniyan, 1977). Recalling for AlbertMemmi‘s notion of class suicide. Olaniyan also offers this aspect of Fela who is not born into the oppressed lower classes as consummate an example of class suicide as we can get to in the world of actual struggle.</p> <p><strong>1.3SCOPE   OF   STUDY </strong></p> <p>The study is designed to embrace revolution tune in the music of Fela and his relation topolitical activism especially in Nigeria. it is also designed to embraced the teachings of Fela’smusic and recognizing FelaAnikulapoKuti as the number one musical icon an activist in Nigeria even when his dead his music lives on.The purpose the of a particular study or research is embed in the intension to resolve a problem.</p> <p><strong> 1.4           PURPOSE OF STUDY </strong></p> <p>Consequently the study is aim at;</p> <p>1.                  Establishing the fact that music is a critical and       essential instrument of change making.</p> <p>2.      To demonstrate how Fela’s music has been use as instrument of change making in time past.</p> <p><strong>1.5   METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>The research makes use of both primary and secondary sources in order to obtain primary data,research questionnaires were developed personally administered by the researcher to studentsof university of Abuja.

The Nigerian music industry has produced and its still producing a lot </p> <p>of great celebrities that play a major role in the political development of a country portraying </p> <p>music as a revolution or change makingamongst these musicians includeTu face ldibia with </p> <p>“for instance or ebi like say “, sound sultan with”jagbanjantis and light up Niger area “Black</p> <p>face with “hard life”, Eedris with “jagajaga“, AfricanChina with “Mr. president “, p square with”</p> <p>oga police”. Just to mention a few in the contemporary Nigeria. However it was Olufela</p> <p>Olusegun OludotunRansomeKuti(laterFelaAnikulapokuti which translate to he who carries </p> <p>death or he who holds death in his pocket “ that was the symbolic representation of rthymic</p> <p>opposition as the impact  and importance of felaAnikulapokuti to the global musical village , </p> <p>producer, political radical outlaw , which comes to bear with the creation of Afro beat which is </p> <p>popularize in Africa in the 1970s that came to gain international recognition and its relevance to </p> <p>change making arises with not just creation of his Afro beat but what its stands for in the </p> <p>revolutionary  Tune in his music.  Fela’s musical life spanned through the periods of almost four </p> <p>decades from 1960s through to the 1990s. When he first in the 1960s. His brand of music was </p> <p>the high life which he performed with other artist in many night clubs in Lagos. Political </p> <p>activism through music has over the years been a common factor such as rap music in the early </p> <p>1980’s became highly politicized in the united states. <strong>Jaclyn Nardone</strong> (<em>2009)</em>  drawing largely </p> <p>from the works  and life of John Lennon (1940-1980), world renowned musician (former </p> <p>‘Beatle’ until 1969) and peace activist, asserts that Lennon used his music to fight unjust politics, </p> <p>promote his opposition to the Vietnam war, and express his love for the human race. As such, He </p> <p>understood that people could be changed. By changing the system, (the Irish, Russians and </p> <p>French did it but got them nowhere.) it is the same old game. Thus, Lennon was inspired to adapt </p> <p>new measures and change people and politics through his music. In other words, moving to </p> <p>change the system first without changing the people that comprise the society would be a </p> <p>fruitless endeavor. Music thus come to play the primary role of changing the people from their </p> <p>minds so further changes to the system could be fruitful. <strong>Jaclyn Nardone further asserts that </strong></p> <p><strong>culture is music, thus politicizing music is a means of arousing political culture.</strong></p> <p>Paul Buzenski (2008) in his own view asserts that music plays a critical role in the electioneering </p> <p>process of a country. He supports his points by asserting that musicians such as Bob Dylan, Billy </p> <p>Joel, Bruce Springsteen, Dixie Chicks, Elton John, Grateful Dead, Madonna, Ne-Yo, The </p> <p>Decemberists, The Goo-Goo Dolls among a host of others have held concerts, primarily for </p> <p>Barack Obama, as a way of influencing America. These icons of popular culture can have a </p> <p>profound influence on potential voters.  An example of this influence was the concert held in </p> <p>Philadelphia by Bruce Springsteen. This Bruce Springsteen’s concert in Philadelphia was to act </p> <p>as “…a catalyst for the disengaged to register to vote”. Plenty of people heard the call and </p> <p>according to the Obama campaign, some 21,000 new voters were registered as a result of the </p> <p>event. This also helped Clinton to win his presidency by mobilizing the young people. Likewise, </p> <p>in 2008, Rock Activists such as Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen held concerts to support and </p> <p>gather votes for the candidates and they registered almost 2.3 million young people who by and </p> <p>large support Obama and probably facilitated Obama’s victory over McCain. The outcome of </p> <p>this election was heavily influenced by a process of political Activism through music which have </p> <p>a potent effect on the political processes of The United States of America.</p> <p>This is also evident in the Nigerian political system as evident in songs used as political jingles </p> <p>and musicians playing an important role during political campaigns</p> <p>Austin ‘MaroEmielu  (2008) asserts that political activism through music is most evident in the </p> <p>role music plays in youth empowerment. He supports this assertion on the basis that “a </p> <p>professionalized music industry will midwife institutionalization of  specialized sectors, which </p> <p>will become the engine for growth, development and empowerment for youths with interest in </p> <p>the  music industry”. Drawing examples from Nigeria, he lays emphasis on the importance of the </p> <p>Nigerian music industry which if fully tapped into, can replace crude oil as the mainstay of </p> <p>Nigeria’s economy. He  further asserts that “popular music can be used as a veritable instrument </p> <p>for ideological change and mass re-orientation. Popular music can also be put to a variety of </p> <p>uses, in product advertisement, promoting government programs and policies and also in </p> <p>becoming a social voice for the ‘voiceless’, oppressed and deprived masses as we can find in the </p> <p>case of Fela’s Afro-Beat. Finally, the massive entry of the feminine folk into popular music in </p> <p>contemporary times represent another form of women empowerment which has been a major </p> <p>pre-occupation of women and feminist activist in government, the academia and other women </p> <p>rights organization in recent history”.</p> <p>Barrer, (2009) opines that rap’s improvement in the society are peculiar and notable. He studied </p> <p>how rap improved the social conditions of the people in Slovak. Giving  illustrations on how rap </p> <p>provides a vector of advantaged admission to discourses within Slovak society. Aside from that </p> <p>his essay also demonstrates an approach into how a global music phrase has been accustomed </p> <p>and re-modeled with local meanings. “A key part of rap’s appeal and capacity to provoke </p> <p>audiences lies in its lyrical content, which  aggressively counters official standards in language </p> <p>and the thematic norms of other styles of contemporary popular music.”</p> <p>Alex Ross (1995) places his argument on the role of composers in the society. He believes that </p> <p>the morale is that the composers who begin with writing for the man on the street often end up </p> <p>writing for an elite audience drawing examples from Feldman a German musician and political </p> <p>activist who later started singing solidarity melodies to the elites. That is musicians could first </p> <p>accept to use their music for political activism but after a while, they divert solidarity melodies to </p> <p>the elites for economical, political or social gains. However, tobioshodi (2010) tends to </p> <p>contradict this view in his analysis of Nigeria that “there is a movement from the hitherto largely </p> <p>musical silence or solidarity of musicians in the First era (1960-1979) towards rhythmic </p> <p>opposition in the current era” with his thesis that the military regimes in Nigeria played a role in </p> <p>limiting freedom of speech as such, limiting political activism through music.</p> <p>However, in the late 1960s to 1970s he went to the United States where he came in contact </p> <p>with the black panthers and the ideas of Malcom X and co. by the time he came back his </p> <p>musical orientation had started to have pan Africanist context.</p> <p>In the vein of his political activity, his parent had an effect in shaping his political outlook later </p> <p>in life. His father late Rev RansomeKuti was the acknowledged first Nigerian union of teachers </p> <p>while his mother was a renounced women’s right activist, who once led the protest of Egba</p> <p>women against excessive taxation by the British colonialist.</p> <p>Fela’sMusic and change making also has played an important role in which has raised eyes </p> <p>browse through the music of FelaAnikulapo. The aspect of political activism that comes to the </p> <p>lime light with impact on music.</p> <p>As political issues begin to seep into the lives of people and also need to be changing to </p> <p>altercate to this shift in culture.</p> <p>Revolution through change making has over the years been a common factors drawing from </p> <p>the works and life of  Fela , the legendary musician of Africa .since 1990 there have been </p> <p>revitalization of Fela’s influence on music and popular culture culminating in another release of </p> <p>hiscatalog controlled by universal music , Broadway and off Broadway biographically basically</p> <p>shows and new bands such as Antibalas who carry the Afro beat banner to a new generations </p> <p>of listeners .Felas focus was to change the mindset of the masses through his music by exposing </p> <p>the corrupt leaders who claim to have the interest of the nations at hand rather  for their selfish </p> <p>desires .</p> <p>However music have come to play an important role in the lives of people around the world </p> <p>changing people from their mind to further changes around them. This is where the change </p> <p>making came into existence in Fela’s music.  In the United States Jaclyn Nardone 2009 was a </p> <p>renowned musicians (former Beatle) and peace activist, he used his music to fight unjust</p> <p>politics, promote his opposition to the VietnamWar and also express his love for human race. </p> <p>As such he understood that people could be changed by changing the system. He shared the </p> <p>same view with Fela who suffers brutality for the sake of the masses in other to stand up for </p> <p>the truth through his music. The musical style performed by Fela is called afro beat which is </p> <p>essentially a fusion of jazz,funk, psychedelic rock, and traditional West African chants and </p> <p>rhythms. As lwediOjinmah points out in his article “baba is dead – long live baba “. Afro Beat </p> <p>also borrows heavily from the native “tinker pan “African – style percussion that fela acquired </p> <p>while studying in Ghana with Hugh Masaketa, under the uncanny hedzoleh sounds. Afro beat is </p> <p>also characterized by having vocals and musical structure along with jazzy, funky horn sections. </p> <p>The endless groove is also used in which a base rhythm of drums, shekere, muted gutter and </p> <p>bass guitar are repeated throughout the songs.</p>\n\nMUSIC AND REVOLUTION: A STUDY OF FELA ANIKULAPO KUTI<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MUSIC AND REVOLUTION: A STUDY OF FELA ANIKULAPO KUTI", "id": 144}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 Preamble</strong></p> <p>This study examines the pragmatics of comedy. Adrian Akmajian conceives of pragmatics as a term that “covers the study of language use, and in particular the study of linguistic communication, in relation to language structure and context of utterance.”(361)When Charles Morris proposed his famous trichotomy of syntax, semantics and pragmatics, he defined the last as “the study of the relation of signs to interpreters” (6). But he soon generalized this to “the relation of signs to their users” (29). What this implies is that pragmatics interprets meaning from the angle of the speaker (i.e. speaker-intended meaning). When comedians use language, what acts are they performing? What are the issues of politeness in their language use? These are some of the questions this study will attempt to answer.</p> <p><strong>1.1  </strong><strong> Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The intricacies in language use have brought philosophers (first) and then linguists (later) into the study of language. Although, the first attempt made to study language was prescriptive, less technical, superficial, unprofessional, shortsighted and weak, the Greek philosophers provided the basis for which today’s linguists have made rigorous and more serious researches into the complex nature of language, its behaviour, and its workings from one society to the other or from an individual to another.</p> <p>      Language may be studied from different perspectives. If the substance of language is the focus of language study, then it is referred to as phonetics/phonology and graphology. The former deals with the phonics (sound) of a language and the latter deals with the graphs or the written letters of the language. If the aspect of word formation or word behaviour or word arrangement is the focus of language study, it is referred to as morphology/syntax. However, if the context of language and its function are the focus of study, then the study is placed within semantic/pragmatic fields. This present study is situated in the area of pragmatics.  </p> <p>      Although semantics and pragmatics both study meaning, there has been a number of attempts to fairly separate them. Leech observes that “once meaning has been admitted to a central place in language, it is notoriously difficult to exclude the way meaning varies from context to context, and so semantics spills into pragmatics… Semanticists found they had bitten more than they could chew” (2). However, linguists have succeeded in delineating these two subfields. In doing this, Adegbite dichotomizes them from the perspective of whole-to-part and parts-to-whole. He claims that if semantics is given a wide coverage- cognitive, social and contextual meaning, then pragmatics will be seen as part of semantics (whole-to-part). But if it is given a narrow coverage- cognitive meaning, then they are different parts that constitute the study of meaning as whole (parts-to-whole). It is in line with this that pragmatics is seen as covering those areas uncovered by semantics.</p> <p>Scholars generally conceive of Pragmatics as the study of meaning in context from the angle of the speaker. It centres on how meaning varies from one context to another despite sameness of expressions. It may also be seen as the study of the speaker-intended meaning as against the sentence meaning so that a sentence may mean one thing but the speaker has made it to have another meaning conforming to his or her thought. This is why the listener or the audience continuously searches for the speaker meaning from the speaker’s utterances. This causes him or her to ask questions like: Why did he say so? Does he mean that …? and so on bearing in mind that it is the meaning in the speaker’s mind that prompts the utterance. Pragmatics has a wide coverage of language use ranging from speech acts, cooperative principles, sequencing, to politeness principles and so on. Speech acts and Politeness principles which are parts of the most discussed pragmatic subjects constitute the focus of this study.</p> <p>In speech act, language is used to perform a variegated number of functions. It is used to socialise or to desocialise, to organise or disorganise, to cause affection or disaffection, to start war or to maintain peace, to foster harmony or disharmony, and so on. In the words of Parikh, “When we use language, we typically use it to communicate information. The two dimensions of communication and aboutness correspond to two constraints, communicative and informational. These two constraints interconnect and jointly enable us to use language to communicate information” (3). Perhaps, Parikh’s two language indices, communicative and informational, mean more than they appear. Language is used to communicate our intentions, feelings, thoughts, agreements, disagreements, and so on but the way language is used probably relays communicativeness more than the language content itself. Consider ‘sorry’ made with a soft tone and the one made with a harsh tone. Whereas the content of the expression in the two instances remains the same, the communicativeness in either varies. More so, whereas the basis of language is to use it to share information, among many other things, language may as well lose its informative power if it is not well situated within its appropriate context or if the audience or other interlocutors do share the same background knowledge. The idea that language is used to do a lot of things, and that the meaning of forms used to accomplish such acts is highly dependent on socio-cultural context, was introduced into the discussion of linguistic meaning by Malinowski (1923) and Firth (1968). During this time, sociologists and sociolinguists have been particularly concerned with the use of language to negotiate role-relationship, peer-solidarity, the exchange of turns and the saving of face in conversation (Ayodabo 132). Speech act theory which examines the use of language to perform a variety of functions is an aspect of pragmatic study. With regard to the language of comedy, one wonders what comedians are doing with words especially in their creation of humour. This study will try to examine the place of speech acts in the language of comedy.</p> <p>            Maintaining proper etiquette and speaking properly to a person without offending him or her is what is referred to in linguistics as politeness. Some define politeness as “being nice” to the other party, and argue that when another says “I think I’m a good teacher; what do you think?” Polite people respond “You’re great”, even if they don’t think so. In this view, agreeing with another’s self-praise is considered one of the “most fundamental rules of politeness” (Nass 36). Yet while agreeableness may often accompany politeness, it does not define it if one can be both agreeably impolite and politely disagreeable. One can politely refuse, beg to differ, respectfully object and humbly criticize, that is, disagree but still be polite. Conversely, one can give charity to others yet be impolite, that is, be kind but rude, (Whitworth &amp; Liu 208).</p> <p>To be polite also means, one must not be rude or offensive. One must use proper words to convey something. Foul language can put off a person. Also, one has to be choosy about words while conveying something. Whatever has to be conveyed has to be conveyed in a subtle manner (http://www.paggu.com). However, with regard to the language of comedy, one wonders if politeness can ever find its way to the ways comedians manipulate language to elicit perlocution from their audience. It is not uncommon to find comedians ‘cracking jokes’ that may elicit negative reactions from the audience. This is usually the case when people tag such jokes as “expensive” as they can be rude, impolite, crude, or inconsiderate of the feelings of the audience. This was the situation when the former First Lady of Nigeria, Dame Patience Jonathan, was at logger head with veteran comedian, Ali Baba, for making an “expensive” joke about the First Lady. Still, there are situations where the audience responds positively to such “expensive” jokes especially when one considers the sociology of language from the perspective of male-female talk or sexist language. Here, the researcher means that even when the males make impolite or negative comments about the females, they (females) tend to appreciate it.This is another form of linguistic violence against women. </p> <p>            According to Adetunji, linguistic violence (LV) is a concept used to capture the psychological and social use of any instance of language to abuse, offend, or hurt somebody or people. It emphasizes the linguistic situation of two people or groups symmetrically along the lines of power or status, whereby one person or group occupies a higher, and therefore, oppressive position in relation to the other (20). Gay has classified LV into three broad types-subtle, abusive, and grievous-in a continuum stretching from the minimally intensive to the maximally intensive. Subtle LV concerns an unconscious use of language by persons or groups to subjugate other persons or groups. McGhee submits that men from early childhood have the greater tendency than women to use humour oppressively: boys learn to tell aggressive or face-threatening, especially sexual jokes and girls grow up to just laugh and be amused (Cited in Ugbabe 22). Thus, impoliteness in the language of comedy can be another form of sexist language or gender bias especially if it is used by the males to consciously or unconsciously oppress the females. This work prefers to look at the place of politeness in the language of comedy as an aspect of pragmatic study.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Aim and Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>            The aim of this study is to describe the language of comedy from a pragmatic approach. The objectives of the study are:</p> <p>i. to describe the pragmatic features of the language of comedy</p> <p>ii. to discuss politeness issues in the language of comedy</p> <p>iii. to discuss the acts performed in the language of comedy.                                    </p> <p><strong>1.3 Significance of the Study                                                                                                            </strong>This study focuses on the pragmatics of comedy. The study is significant in the following ways:</p> <p>i. It describes the language of comedy from a pragmatic approach, which to the knowledge of</p> <p>this researcher, has not been done before.</p> <p>ii. It examines issues of politeness in the language of comedy.</p> <p>iii. It examines the acts performed in the language of comedy.</p> <p>iv. It will describe the linguistic features of the language of comedy.  </p> <p>v. It will serve as a resource material for students, teachers and future researchers who may want to carry out similar research in pragmatics.  </p> <p>vi. The study is also significant for its contribution to knowledge in the field of pragmatics.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Problem Statement</strong></p> <p>            This study is an analysis of the pragmatics of comedy. It is not uncommon knowledge about the role of comedy in society. Comedians manipulate language to create humour to make people laugh and this creates medicinal, physical and psychological effects on the audience. However, perhaps, the language of comedy, as known to this researcher, is one that has been barely described by linguists in the past, let alone from a pragmatic perspective; this research sets out to describe the language of comedy from a pragmatic approach using Bovi and Basket Mouth as case studies. The problem to be resolved in this research is covered in the research questions below.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Research Methodology</strong></p> <p>            This study is a descriptive analysis of the language of comedy from a pragmatic approach. The study adopts politeness principles and the speech act theory in its discussion of the language of comedy. The data is limited to selected comedies of Bovi and Basket Mouth streamed on YouTube and the responses (comments) of viewers. This means that the internet will provide a useful source of data for this study as primary data, while linguistic textbooks, journal articles, magazines and periodicals will serve as the secondary sources of information.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Scope and Limitation</strong></p> <p>This study comes under the purview of pragmatics. However, pragmatics is a broad field which covers a lot of subfields or subjects. This study is limited to the areas of politeness principles and speech acts in describing the language of comedy.</p> <p><strong>1.7 Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The study shall be guided by the following research questions:</p> <p>i. What are the pragmatic features of the language of comedy?</p> <p>ii. Are there politeness issues in the language of comedy?</p> <p>iii. What are the types of acts performed in the language of comedy?</p> <p><strong>1.8 Motivation of the Study                                                                                      </strong></p> <p>Comedians have manipulated language to create humour for the interest of their audience. Their role in society cannot be over emphasized. However, to the best of this researcher’s knowledge, linguists have paid little or no attention to the description of the language of comedians especially from a pragmatic standpoint. One wonders what act they perform whenever they use language and what are the issues of politeness that describe their language use? These questions motivated this study.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p><strong>2.0   </strong><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>This chapter reviews past literature in pragmatics. It discusses, among other things, issues of politeness in pragmatics, speech act theory, the place of humour in pragmatics, pragmatics in the media, and the biographies of Bovi and Basket Mouth.</p> <p><strong>2.1 </strong><strong>Pragmatics: An Overview</strong></p> <p>Norrick (4) conceives of pragmatics as the study of the context-dependent aspects of meaning which are systematically abstracted away from in the construction of logical form. In the semiotic trichotomy developed by Morris, Carnap, and Peirce in the 1930’s, syntax addresses the formal relations of signs to one another, semantics the relation of signs to what they denote, and pragmatics the relation of signs to their users and interpreters.</p> <p>According to Wolfram and Norrick (2), even though its roots can be traced back to early classical traditions of rhetoric and stylistics, to Immanuel Kant’s conception of pragmatics as empirical and purposive and to William James, who pointed out its practical nature, modern pragmatics is a fairly recent discipline. Its inauguration as an independent field of study within semiotics took place early in the 20th Century by C. Morris, R. Carnap and ultimately C.S. Peirce. The classic division between syntax, semantics, and pragmatics goes back to Morris, who distinguished three separate “dimensions of semiosis” within his science of signs. According to Morris (21-22), one may study the relations of signs to the objects to which the signs are applicable. This relation will be called the <em>semantical dimension of semiosis</em>, symbolized by the sign ‘DSEM’; the study of this dimension will be called <em>semantics</em>. Or the subject of study may be the relation of signs to interpreters. This relation will be called the <em>pragmatical dimension of semiosis</em>, symbolized by the sign ‘DP’; the study of this dimension will be named <em>pragmatics</em>. One important relation of signs has not yet been introduced: the formal relations of signs to one another. […] This third dimension will be called the <em>syntactical dimension of semiosis</em>, symbolized by the sign ‘DSYN’, and the study of this dimension will be named <em>syntactics</em>. </p> <p>Morris attempts to separate semantics, pragmatics and syntax in the evaluation of linguistic meaning by also noting their point of convergence. According to Norrick (2), syntax studies the relations signs bear to other signs, semantics the relation between signs and objects, and pragmatics the relation between signs and their interpreters. Of course, there were and are differences of opinion on where exactly to draw the line between semantics and pragmatics. Some thirty years elapsed before pragmatics finally made its way into modern linguistics in the late 1960s, when linguists began to explore the performance phenomena. To this end, they adopted ideas developed and advanced by L. Wittgenstein, G. Ryle, P. Strawson, J.L. Austin and other eminent (ordinary or natural) language philosophers. It seems safe to claim that the ensuing ‘pragmatic turn’ was most notably induced by J.L. Austin, J.R. Searle and H.P. Grice, who were interested in utterance meaning rather than sentence or word meaning, i.e. in studying unique historical events created by actual speakers to perform linguistic acts in actual situational contexts in order to accomplish specific goals. Other scientific movements that nourished pragmatics include anthropology (B. Malinowski, P. Wegener, A. Gardiner), contextualism (J.R. Firth), functionalism (K. Buhler, R. Jakobson, D. Hymes), ethnomethodology (H. Garfinkel, E. Goffman, H. Sacks) and European sociology (J. Habermas). Since the pragmatic turn, pragmatics has developed more rapidly and diversely as a linguistic discipline. Since the 1970s, the early Anglo-American framework of pragmatic-linguistic study has been immensely expanded and enhanced by research in Continental Europe and elsewhere. With historiographic hindsight, it can be seen that the broadening, i.e. the interdisciplinary expansion, of the field of pragmatics has been a cumulative process; the broader conception of pragmatics chronologically (and </p> <p>causally) followed the narrower one.</p> <p>Despite its scientific acclaim, the notion of pragmatics remains somewhat enigmatic and is still difficult to define. This holds for its readings in everyday discourse as well as in scholarly contexts. Nonetheless, when people refer to attitudes and modes of behaviour as pragmatic, they mean that they have a factual kind of orientation in common. People who act pragmatically or take a pragmatic perspective generally have a preference for a practical, matter of fact and realistic rather than a theoretical, speculative and idealistic way of approaching imminent problems and handling everyday affairs. To put it differently, they share a concrete, situation-dependent approach geared to action and usage rather than an abstract, situation-indespendent and system-related point of view. To assume a pragmatic stance in everyday social encounters as well as in political, historical and related kinds of discourse, means to handle the related affairs in a goal-directed and object-directed, common-sense and down to earth kind of way. Such an understanding of pragmatics as an attitude in non-scientific discourse has obviously left its traces in scientific definitions of the term. By and large, one can say that in semiotics and philosophy, pragmatic characterizes those theoretical and methodological approaches that are oriented toward use and context rather than toward some system, and that they regard use and context as creating a high degree of analytical surplus.</p> <p>While essentially the same is true for linguistics in general, there is no commonly accepted definition of pragmatics in linguistics which would refer to a single, unified and homogeneous field of study. In contemporary linguistics, scholars can identify a narrow and a broad way of delineating pragmatics (of which the former is sometimes allocated to an “Anglo-American” and the latter to a “Continental [European]” tradition of pragmatics, (Huang, xi). According to the narrow view, Wolfram and Norrick (2) observe that pragmatics is understood as the systematic investigation of what and how people mean when they use language as a vehicle of action in a particular context and with a particular goal in mind. Thus, the context-dependency of utterance meaning is the central component of more narrowly defined accounts of pragmatics, which focus on a few key issues that can be juxtaposed with related issues in other modules of language theory such as grammar and semantics. Those issues include indexicality/deixis (versus anaphora), presuppositions, implicatures (versus entailments) and speech acts (versus types of sentences), to name only the most conspicuous topics.</p> <p>According to Wolfram and Norrick (4), in a much broader point of view, pragmatics is the scientific study of all aspects of linguistic behaviour. In particular, pragmatics includes patterns of linguistic actions, language functions, types of inferences, principles of communication, frames of knowledge, attitude and belief, as well as organizational principles of text and discourse. Wolfram (3) summarizes the thrust of pragmatics as a discipline which deals with meaning-in-context, which for analytical purposes can be viewed from different perspectives (that of the speaker, the recipient, the analyst, etc.). It bridges the gap between the system side of language and the use side, and relates both of them at the same time. </p> <p><strong>2.2 Speech Act Pragmatics </strong></p> <p>Pragmatic theory has drawn inspiration from logic. It draws mainly upon philosophy of language and ‘the theory of speech act’ in particular, as well as the analysis of conversations and of cultural differences in verbal interaction. Just as the rules governing semantic interpretation respect the classes of syntactic structure, the operation that turns discourse into acts might also be called a pragmatic interpretation of utterances (van Dijk cited in Ayodabo 133).</p> <p>            Blakemore (18) is cited as saying that pragmatic theory is concerned with the mental structure underlying the ability to interpret utterances in context. The suggestion that pragmatic theory involves abstracting away from the particular properties of the situation in which it is put to use is not meant to conflict with the generally accepted view that pragmatics is the study of utterances or sentences in use. The whole point of pragmatic theory is to explain how the context is used in the interpretation of an utterance (Ayodabo 133).</p> <p>            According to Kempson (561), pragmatics is the study of the general cognitive principles involved in the retrieval of information from an uttered sequence of words. Lawal sees pragmatics as evolving as a result of the limitations of structural semantics to capture satisfactorily the sociological and other non-linguistic dimensions of verbal communication. What is usually meant by saying that we do something when we make an utterance is that we accomplish some specific social acts (for example, making a promise, request, giving advice, etc.) usually called speech acts (Dijk 195), or more specifically, illocutionary acts. He adds that a global differentiation between the various kinds of acts involved is made by the distinction between a locutionary act, a propositional act, and an illocutionary act, and in some cases, a perlocutionary act (Ayodabo 196).</p> <p>            Speech act theorists have classified speech acts in different ways. Austin (1962), the forerunner of this field, classified them into five categories of ‘verdictives,’ ‘exercitives’, ‘commissives’, ‘behabitives’ and ‘expositives’. Searle’s (1969) categories is based on the argument that Austin’s classification is deficient, in that there was too much overlap in Austin’s (1962) classification; based on that observation and some others, Searle (1969) came up with the classes of assertives, directives, commissives, expressives and declaratives, with various sub-categories and definitions (Ayodabo 134).</p> <p>            In Sadock’s view, the most straight-forward way in which our intended locution can be communicated is to mention directly what we are doing in making a particular utterance. He adds that the factors that determine whether a particular illocutionary act succeeds are termed felicity conditions, maintaining that in the majority of cases, the illocutionary force of an utterance is not signaled by a perfomative formula.</p> <p>            Bach and Harnish (197) criticized certain aspects of earlier theories, claiming that intention and inference are basic elements to understanding. They also came up with the notion of presumption. In their opinion, both linguistic and communication circumstances are presumed. They recognized two main categories of illocutionary acts: communicative, with four main categories of constatives, directives, commissives and acknowledgements, and non-communicative class with two subcategories of effectiveness and verdictives.</p> <p>            Trauggot and Pratt classified illocutionary acts into Representatives, Expressives, Verdictives, Directives, Commissives, and Declaratives, the sub-categories of which they also defined and explained. The centre-point of their theory as noted by Ayodabo is that a speaker’s communicative competence includes not just knowledge of what illocutionary acts can be performed in the language, but also, how, when, where and by whom they can be performed (134).</p> <p>            Adegbija’s major grouse with previous speech act theories is that they relegated the pragmatics of a situation of social interaction to the background. He states that at every stage of discourse, both speaker(s) and hearer(s) have to mobilize appropriate areas of the pragmatic, social, syntactic, semantic, and lexical competencies in order to be able to participate effectively in the interaction at hand (Cited in Ayodabo 134). Leech (183), writing under ‘varieties of illocutionary function’, classifies illocutionary functions into four types of competitive, convivial, collaborative and conflictive. To leech, a perlocutionary act is performed by saying something.</p> <p>            Allan, relying heavily on the works of Austin (1962), Searle (1969), and Bach and Harnish (1979), observes that language comes into existence only because someone performs an act of speaking or writing. He presents a scheme for analyzing the meaning of a speech act, in which there is a hierarchy among the acts, that is, the perlocutionary act presupposes a denotational act which presupposes a locutionary act which presupposes an utterance act. Allan’s (1986) classification follows Bach and Harnish’s (1979) work in terms of identifying ‘interpersonal acts’ and ‘declaratory acts’. Allan, however, justifies the major category distinction between interpersonal and declaratory acts by sub-classifying interpersonal acts into constatives, predictive, commissives, acknowledgements, directives, authoritative; and declaratory acts into effective and verdictives, totaling eight categories of speech act, as against five found in Austin (1962), six in Searle (1975), and four of Bach and Harnish (1979).</p> <p>Lawal (192) identifies the pragmatic mappings of general factual knowledge of the world, local factual knowledge, socio-cultural knowledge, and knowledge of context as useful for constructing meaning out of an utterance. He adds that an understanding of the mapping helps to illustrate that a pragmatic interpretation of utterances goes beyond the meaning of lexical components and the structural semantic relations among them. Lawal’s (1995) ‘Aspects of Pragmatic Theory’ focuses on both the surface structure of an utterance as well as the background structure.</p> <p>            Ayodabo’s work was able to espouse the aspects of pragmatic theory captured by Lawal and how these can be applied to texts. Ayodabo noted that illocutionary acts, typically, do not come alone. They are part of a sequence of actions in general, or of a sequence of speech acts in particular. This sequence must satisfy the usual conditions for action sequence. Thus, it may be required that the final state of some speech act is a necessary condition for the success of a following act. In this sense, an illocutionary act may be an auxiliary act (135).</p> <p>            Just like another in general, Dijk (238) opines that speech act sequencing requires planning and interpretation. In other words, certain sequence of various speech acts may be intended and understood, and hence function socially, as one speech act. Such a speech act performed by a sequence of speech acts is called a “global speech act” or “macro speech act”</p> <p>(Ayodabo 136).</p> <p>            Sequences in monologue or dialogue conversations may be assigned a global speech act through some conditions. Firstly, as Dijk says, by “deleting irrelevant or predictable information” (239). For such speech acts as well as for actions in general, this would mean that preparatory and auxiliary speech acts may be deleted, as well as those component speech acts which, taken together, desire the essential component of the resulting global speech acts. Similarly, Dijk adds that expressions of mental states and context descriptions may be deleted, although they may determine the acceptability of the speech act. Finally, the speech acts establishing, maintaining and concluding the sequence, that is, the communicative interaction in general, may also be dropped in macro-interpretation.</p> <p><strong>2.3 Humour in Pragmatics</strong></p> <p>            The tendency of some particular cognitive experiences to provoke laughter and provide amusement can be termed humour. The term derived from the humoral medicine of the ancient Greeks, which taught that the balance of fluids in the human body, known as humours (from Latin - body fluid) controlled human health and emotion. Most people are able to experience humour  ̶  be amused, smile or laugh at something funny  ̶  and thus are considered to have a sense of humour. The hypothetical person lacking a sense of humour would likely find the behaviour induced by humour to be inexplicable, strange or even irrational. Though intimately decided by personal taste, the extent to which a person finds something humorous depends on a host of variables, including geographical location, culture, maturity, level of education, intelligence and context. For instance, young children may favour puppet shows or cartoons such as Tom and Jerry, whose physical nature makes it accessible to them. By contrast, sophisticated forms of humour such as satire require an understanding of its social meaning and context and thus tend to appeal to the mature audience.</p> <p>            Many theories exist about what humour is and what social function it serves. The prevailing types of theories attempting to account for the existence of humour include psychological theories, the vast majority of which consider humour-induced behaviour to be very healthy; spiritual theories, which may for instance, consider humour to be a “gift from God”; and theories which consider humour to be an unexplainable mystery, very much like a mystical experience (Raymond Smullyan, 1).</p> <p>The benign-violation theory, endorsed by Peter McGraw, attempts to explain humour’s existence. The theory says that humour only occurs when something seems wrong, unsettling, or threatening, but simultaneously seems okay, acceptable or safe (2). Humour can be used as a method to easily engage in social interaction by taking away that awkward, uncomfortable or uneasy feeling of social interactions. Others believe that the appropriate use of humour can facilitate social interactions. Humour is a ubiquitous, highly ingrained and largely meaningful aspect of human experience and is therefore decidedly relevant in organizational contexts, such as the work place. The significant role that laughter and fun play in organizational life has been seen as a sociological phenomenon and has increasingly been recognized as also creating a sense of involvement among workers (Wikipedia 2014). Sharing humour at work not only offers a relief from boredom, but can also build relationships, improve camaraderie between colleagues and create positive effect. It may also relieve tension and can be used as a coping strategy. Sharing a laugh with a few colleagues may improve moods and bring out quality of work.</p> <p>            Humour has a medicinal effect of decreasing stress, reducing tensions, killing boredoms and prolonging people’s life span. The financial benefit of humour is an understatement. Rich comedians are making a living off cracking jokes in Nigeria today among which Bovi and Basket Mouth have made names for themselves. Humour can be made out of the most serious events or situations. For instance, Nigerian standup comedians today make jokes out of national situations or ridicules public figures to create jokes. A case in point is the former first lady, Dame Patience Jonathan, whose idiosyncratic language use has provided much reference points for Nigerian comedians at all levels. However, some of the jokes created out of this language situation have not been taken likely when they are used out of context. This explains the strained relationship between the former first lady and veteran standup comedian, Ali Baba. Context in humour is vital and this is where pragmatics may come in.</p> <p>            In literature, humour is mostly satiric as writers try to lampoon, satirize or use sarcasm to change certain societal excesses. The driving force of every humour is language or one of the basic aspects of humour is language. Language can be manipulated for stylistic and humorous effect. However, a joke made or words spoken as humorous must be context based. Jokes and humorous statements can stir up trouble if not applied to the right context. Therefore, the place of humour in pragmatics will be the application of humorous languages in their appropriate social context.</p> <p><strong>2.4 Politeness Issues in Pragmatics and the Media</strong></p> <p>For a lay person, to be polite means, one must not be rude or offensive. One must use proper words to convey something as foul language can put off a person. Also one has to be choosy about words while conveying something. Whatever has to be conveyed has to be conveyed in a subtle manner (http://www.paggu.com). Although politeness as a research area of pragmatics and sociolinguistics was initiated by Brown and Levinson more than 30 years ago, it seems to be a topic which still offers enough space for new definitions and theoretical frameworks within which researchers concentrate on various politeness strategies and also language devices used for their manifestations, often in different languages, cultures, (Válková 208), and perhaps, media. Such studies on politeness have adopted one of three views – “traditional” (Lakoff 1973, Brown and Levinson 1987[1978], Leech, 1983); “post-modern” (Eelen 2001, Mills 2003, Watts 2003); and ‘frame-based view’ (Terkourafi 2001). For instance, after the emergence of the traditional view of politeness came the postmodern and frame-based views which were all borne out of dissatisfactions with the earlier theories. Initially, emphasis was on the place of politeness in physical human interactions, gradually however, and with the advent of the internet and social media in recent time, researchers’ attentions are shifting to studying politeness in machine mediated human interactions and how perceived distance affect use of politeness among others, (Hoffmann, Krämer, Lam-chi, and Kopp, 2009).</p> <p>            Among such salient evolving dimension to politeness studies is the delving into its relationships with social network (media)–a computer based communications. Social network according to Redbridge Marketing (208) is an “online communities of people who typically share a common interest in activity”. Those web sites that provide opportunity for the users with such platform is called social networking sites. The sites enable users ‘to interact, allow visitors to send e – mails, post content, build web content and or take part in live chat (YALSA, 2007). Explaining the social network frontiers, Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS), The Teenage Research Unlimited (TRU) and Marketing Evolution (2007) remarked that Social Networking represents: a fad, especially among the young and technologically obsessed; an unprecedented tool for keeping in touch with friends and family; a disruptive, unscripted environment; an un paralleled opportunity for brands and consumer to make real connections; and some combination of all of the above and then some. Sometimes, social networking sites allow users to set up online profile or personal home pages and develop an online Social Network, (Gbadeyan 208). Examples of social networking sites include but not limited to Facebook, Myspace, Stream, Twitter, and Google+, YouTube, etc.</p> <p>            The data for this study is drawn from YouTube streaming and the reactions from the viewers to elicit the perlocution. To assess politeness issues in YouTube’s social network, however, it must be defined in information terms. If politeness is “considering others”, then since different societies “consider” differently, what is polite in one culture can be rude in another, (Whitworth and Liu, 208). Given no universal “polite behaviour”, there seems to be no basis to query the politeness in social media like on YouTube. Yet while different countries have different laws, the goal of fairness that underlies the law can be attributed to every society (Rawls 201). Likewise, different cultures could have different “etiquettes”, but a common goal of politeness. Nevertheless, while each society may “implement” a different etiquette, politeness remains the common “design goal”, just as legitimacy is the “spirit” behind laws that vary in detail between societies, (Whitworth and Liu 208).</p> <p>If politeness can take different forms in different societies, to ask which implementation applies online is to ask the wrong question. The right question is how to “reinvent” politeness in each specific online case, whether for chat, wiki, email or other groupware, (Whitworth and Liu 208). Just as each different physical society develop local etiquettes and laws, so different communication medium may need a different politeness implementation especially online, based on a general design “pattern”, specifying politeness in information terms (Alexander 164).   </p> <p>            Since this study relies on data from YouTube, it is not out of place to discuss in brief, this online communication medium. Another way to interact and share personal content with others is on YouTube, the world’s largest video-sharing site (Huang et al. 210). YouTube was founded in 2005 and their vision is to “give everyone a voice, to evolve video, and to make partners and advertisers successful” (Pressroom - YouTube). More than 65,000 videos are uploaded every day and most videos uploaded are available to the public (Huang et al. 210). On YouTube users can share their own videos, comment on uploaded videos, rate them, and create video collections. The videos are characterized. By that, they are mostly short and much information can be collected by the description and the comments on the videos (Huang et al. 210).</p> <p>YouTube can be a trigger for a crisis, since hundreds or thousands of people can reach it. The videos that are uploaded can also be viewed repeatedly. United Airlines is a company, which have had problem with negative videos on YouTube (González-Herrero &amp; Smith 2008).</p> <p><strong>2.5 Politeness Theory</strong></p> <p>Attempts to give an in-depth description of how human beings understand others and how they make themselves understood have led researchers across diverse disciplines- philosophy, rhetoric, communication arts, linguistics and so on- into theorizations. For the linguist, there must be a scientific procedure leading to an empirical result in giving such a description. It is against this that Austin propounded his Speech Act Theory; Grice presented his Cooperative Principle, Leech, Brown and Levinson, Lakoff and so on dwelt on Politeness Theory, at least from a pragmatic perspective.                                                                                                     It is, however, important to mention that, more often than not, one theory of locutionary description serves as bedrock for another. While Austin approached his theory from a speech-action perspective, and Grice from speaker-listener cooperation perspective, Leech, Brown and Levinson, Lakoff and others approach their theory from direct-indirect meaning perspective. They are often concerned about why speakers sometimes consider expressing their thoughts in an indirect manner. This is what underlies politeness theory.</p> <p>Just as it is applicable to almost all linguistic concepts, it has always been a trouble finding a unified definition of politeness shared by all despite the innumeracy of scholarship on the concept. This could be partly because of the labyrinth of usages the term has been put to over time. No wonder Papacharissi (204) described it as attributes that are difficult to define but somehow, ‘we know them when we see them’. The non-generality of definition of politeness notwithstanding, we can still rely on scholars’ definitions in explaining the term.</p> <p>From a layman’s perspective, politeness can be seen as behaviour that is respectful or </p> <p>considerate to others. This layman’s view of politeness, however, underlies many sociolinguistic definitions of the term. For instance, Lakoff maintains that “to be polite is saying the socially correct thing” (53), while in the words of Adegbija, politeness is associated with situations in which one “speaks or behaves in a way that is socially and culturally acceptable and pleasant to the hearer” (58). Both Lakoff’s and Adegbija’s definitions reveal that there must be certain cultural norms and values which people’s behaviour including their speeches must conform to. One is only seen as polite if he or she behaves or speaks the way it is stipulated within that culture. Similarly, Ide views politeness as a cover term for behaviour “without friction” (7), while Brown sees it as “saying and doing things in such a way as to take into account the other person’s feeling” (114). By ‘without friction’, Ide probably means conformity (to norms). Brown is, however, particular in his definition because he does not see politeness as general. He, therefore, maintains that politeness is observed in relation to ‘the other person’s feeling.’</p> <p>Fraser and Nolen took a more general approach to defining the term ‘politeness.’ According to them, “to be polite is to abide by the rules of the relationship. The speaker becomes impolite just in cases where he (or she) violates one or more of the contractual terms” (96). Nwoye shares similar view when he observed that “being polite is ... conforming to socially agreed codes of good conduct” (310) and for Watts, Ide, and Ehlich, politeness “help(s) us to achieve ‘effective social living’” (2). It is important to mention here that these scholars maintain that there may be a communication breakdown when codes of conduct of the society are not respected in speech or behaviour.</p> <p><strong>2.6 Approaches to Politeness Theory                                                                                  </strong>Although politeness is a research area of pragmatics and sociolinguistics initiated by Brown and Levinson more than 30 years ago, it has emerged to be a topic which still offers enough space for new definitions and theoretical frameworks within which researchers concentrate on various politeness strategies and also language devices used for their manifestations, often in different languages and cultures, (Válková 208). While summarizing the theoretical approaches to politeness over the past years, Fraser (223) identified four current perspectives: the social-norm view, the conversational-maxim view, the face-saving view, and the conversational contract view. These are discussed below:</p><p> 2.6.1    The Social-Norm View  </p> <p>The ‘social-norm view’ refers to the normative view of politeness seen as the social standards of behaviour in any society. It reflects the historical understanding of politeness as embraced by Western cultures. According to these standards, polite behaviour adheres to rules of etiquette and rude behaviour contradicts these norms. This view associates politeness with speech style, and connects a higher degree of formality to greater politeness. There is controversy in the literature regarding the status of this approach within approaches to politeness. On the one hand is the extreme view which asserts that the interpretation of politeness as the desire to be pleasant to others “has no place within pragmatics” (Thomas 150). Fraser seems to hold a similar opinion and states that this approach has few adherents in the current research on politeness. It seems, however, that this conceptualization of politeness can be seen as corresponding to another view, that of “discernment politeness”, which has been proposed as the underlying basis of politeness systems in non-Western cultures (Hill et al. 196; Ide 189)</p>\n\nPRAGMATIC STUDY OF BOVI AND BASKETMOUTH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PRAGMATIC STUDY OF BOVI AND BASKETMOUTH", "id": 145}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1  </strong><strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The social vices called sexual harassment is not a new topic to the generality of people today especially in the tertiary institutions such as universities, polytechnics, monotechnics and colleges of education.As observed by Taiwo and Omole (2014:1) ,the fact is that, “in every human society where there is interaction between opposite sex, some levels of sexual attraction is expected. When this occurs, mutual interest and reciprocal response defines a civilized and socially acceptable sexual behaviour”. However, the increasing manifestation of social vices in higher institutions in Nigeria can be attributed to the poor quality of graduates being produced. One of such is sexual harassment that has continued to attract the attention of researchers and the media as a common phenomenon in the Higher education Institutions. This abnormal, antisocial behaviour has been accepted as a norm within the higher education institutions Nigeria and overseas. </p> <p>Sexual harassment is a global issue that has permeated the fabrics of higher education institutions and many workplaces as long as humans (males and females) have reasons to interact. This vices in universities and other higher education institutions is not limited to Africa. Universities in Ghana and Tanzania have already integrated sexual harassment into course modules on Gender, Power and Sex to address the challenge ofmale lecturers demanding sex from female students in exchange for grades as a right.</p> <p>In the USA, study among psychology studentsrevealed a higher prevalence of sexual harassment and unethical intimacy between postgraduate students and their supervisors than undergraduate students due to frequent face-to-face interaction when seeking advice on theirresearch studies. Higher education institutions in Nigeria are not left out of this saga, for instance, it has been affirmed that, in Nigeria sex for grades in the tertiary institutions is a reality and the male lecturers in particular, perceived themselves as thin gods and such unprofessional behaviour can be perpetuated unchecked. A similar study according to Taiwo and Omole, reported a high prevalence of sexual harassment both in the education institution and in the workplace. Sexual harassment takes on various trends and nature, but most importantly, it emanates from unequal power relation that is also associated with gender based violence and violation of human rights. In most cases, the harasser is usually older, powerful and poses something of value that is beneficial to the harassed. The trend of occurrence was reported totake several forms: from male lecturer to female student, from male students to female students, from male lecturers to female lecturers and non-academic staff and so on. In most cases, female students are most at risk as victims while the male lecturers are more likely to be the perpetuators. This trend presents an amazing and disturbing scene in an environment that is often believed to be a center of excellence for molding and developing virile leadership skills, high moral qualities and intellectual capacityfor human capital for future leadership. </p> <p>Also,a number of factors have been enumerated as motivation for perpetuation of sexual harassment to include: lust, pursuit of happiness, lack of norm of morality, lack of conscience, pursuit of pleasure, lack of temperance, passion, habit, value, personality disorder, inferiority complex, immaturity, cheapness, abuse of power, and suffering from demonology. In addition, indecent dressing pattern among female students who almost go naked in their appearance can also be driving factors for continued incidence of sexual harassment. Many female students are so morally bankrupt that they rely absolutely on their womanhood for high grades without due preparation. Because this anomaly is has eaten deep into the fabric of our higher institutions in Nigeria, this study is set to check the prevalence in the tertiary institutions in Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The institutions of focus include: University of Abuja and FCT College of Education.</p> <p>1.2  <strong>Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>The occurrence and prevalence of sexual harassment menace in the tertiary institutions in Nigeria has become a cankerworm that needs serious attention. Various researches in with similar interest have been carried out across the globe, but to the best of the researchers knowledge, no such in recent time has been done taking schools in FCT (that is University of Abuja and FCT College of Education) into consideration. That is the motivation for this study. The study is carried out to examine the prevalence of this menace among the male lecturers and female students in the University of Abuja and FCT College of Education respectively.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>Aim and Objectives</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to check the prevalence and correlates of sexual harassment in the University of Abuja and FCT College of Education. The objectives to drive this aim are below:</p> <p>i.                   This study establishes that sexual Harassment has become a phenomenon in our tertiary institutions.</p> <p>ii.                 It also establishes that the female students some times are the solicitors of the sex by their provoking and immoral dressing.</p> <p><strong>iii.              </strong>The study establishes the consequences of sexual harassment on the academic and social life of the victims who are mostly women.</p> <p>1.4<strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>At the end of the study,the following questions would have been answered:</p> <p><strong>i.                   </strong>To what extent has sexual harassment become a phenomenon in our tertiary institutions?</p> <p><strong>ii.                 </strong>Are the female students the solicitors of  sex?</p> <p><strong>iii.              </strong>What are the consequences on the academic and social life of the victims?</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong> Scope of the Study and the Limitation</strong></p> <p>This study is a check on the prevalence and correlates of sexual harassment by male lecturers on the female students in the tertiary institutions. The students of interest here are undergraduates. It therefore covers only University of Abuja FCT College of Education. The major challenge of this study is the inability of the researcher to reach out tothe actual victims of this menace for their fear of what may happen after admitting they were once sexually harassed. In other words, they fear that the research report may not be as confidential as the researcher claims and this may not favour them because it could lead to further intimidation by the supposed lecturer (s).</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong><strong>Significance of Study</strong></p> <p>This study is designed to determine how academic field impacted the perceived sexualharassment experienced by female undergraduates in the FCT College of Education and University of Abuja. It will check and curtail the manace of sexual harassment which has psychological effects on the victims and consequently affects their academic and social life on campus.It is also the hope of this study to enable policy makers to create or improve policyinitiatives that protect the rights of  female students in the target institutions and Nigeria at large<strong>.</strong></p> <p>1.7<strong>A Brief Profile of University of Abuja</strong></p> <p>The University of Abuja was established in January 1988 and academic work began 1990 with the matriculation of the pioneer students. Its establishement was informed by the imperative to provide an institution of higher leaning with in Abuja,the new Federal Capital Territory whose objectives will be in line with the ideals that informed the conception of the city by the federal government. The university’s national outlook means it will also makes its services accessible to other states of the federation. It was established with the dual mode to providing the regular or professional academic programme and distance learning. The university at the moment has eight faculties which include: faculty of agriculture, Arts, Management Science, Social Science, Vetinary Medicine, Law, Engineering and Science.</p> <p><strong>1.8</strong><strong>. A Brief Profile of FCT College of Education</strong></p> <p>The college was established in 1996 with temporary site at the defunct teachers college. The purpose for theestablishment was to provide qualitative teachers education geared towards meeting the present challenges facing the Nigerian educational system especially in the area of training teachers in the science and Nigerian languages to teach at the primary schools.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p><strong>2.0 Introduction</strong></p> <p>This chapter presents some conceptual frame work for the study which include: some definitions of the term sexual harassment, the growth and measurement, experience of female students in the tertiary institutions in Nigeria etcetera. It also provides the theoretical framework for the study.</p> <p><strong>2.1</strong><strong>What is Sexual Harassment?</strong></p> <p>Gutek and Done (2001) say sexualharassment can be a legal and a psychological phenomenon.</p> <p>Legal definition: legally, two types of sexualharassment were identified (a) quid pro quo (this for that) harassment that requires the employeeto submit to sexual demands as a condition for promotion to avoid trouble, or being dismissed orin the case of faculty-student relationship, sex for better grades and (b) hostile environmentharassment where sexuality or discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult are beingpracticed in the environment in which the employee works or students learn.</p> <p>Psychological definition:Psychologists defined sexual harassment onthe reasonableness of the offender (Browne, 1997). From this point of view, sexual harassment isperceived as an act of unsuitable mind or lack of understanding as prevents one from having themental capacity required by law to enter into a particular relationship. Therefore, sexualharassment was seen as an act done as a result of mental imbalance.</p> <p>According to Hornby (2005) sexual harassment as putting pressure on someone, or doingunpleasant things to him or her. New Zealand Hockey Federation-NZHF (2001)conceptualized harassment as any unwelcome comment, conduct or gesture directed towardsan individual or group of individuals, which is insulting, intimidating, humiliating, malicious,degrading or offensive, and is either repeated or of such significant nature that adverselyaffect someone’s performance, contribution or sport and education environment. Harassment as used in this current study refers to any unwanted or unwelcome behaviour directed to afemale student which is insulting, intimidating, malicious, degrading or offensive and is</p> <p>either repeated or of such significant nature that adversely impairs the student</p> <p>capacity to learn at school.New Zealand Hockey Federation (2001) further observed that harassment can takemany forms namely; physical, verbal, sexual, or emotional and most often involves acombination of these elements. When harassment relates to sex or sexuality, is referred to assexual harassment (Wikipedia Foundation, 2010).</p> <p>Robinson (2005)opines  sexual harassment as any physical, visual, or sexual</p> <p>act experienced by a person from another person at the time or later, which asserts a person’ssexual identity as a person and makes him or her feel embarrassed, frightened, hurt,uncomfortable, degraded, humiliated, compromised and as well diminishes a person’s powerand confidence. American Association of University Women–AAUW (2006) submits thatsexual harassment in education is an unwelcome behaviour of a sexual nature that interfereswith a student’s ability to learn, study, work or participate in school activities.Wikipedia Foundation (2010) described sexual harassment as persistent and unwantedsexual advances, typically in the workplace, where the consequences of refusing arepotentially very disadvantageous to the victim. </p> <p>To Larkin (1994), sexual harassment can be in three categories: verbal harassment,</p> <p>physical harassment and other types of harassments. Also, Fitzgerald, Gelfand and Drasgow’s(1995) categorization of sexual harassment is composed of three related but conceptuallydistinct dimensions, which are gender harassments, unwanted sexual attention; and sexualcoercion. To Timmerman and Bajema (1997) sexual harassment can be classified into verbalharassment, non-verbal harassment, and physical harassment. According to Witkowska (2005), it can be verbal behaviour, non-verbal displays and sexual assault behaviours. This study has adopted Gelfand, Fitzgerald and Drasgow (1995) position where they catigories sexual harassment into gender harassment, unwanted sexualattention and sexual coercion.Gender harassment involves unwelcome verbal or visual comments and remarks that</p> <p>insult individuals because of their gender and can include such things as postingpornographic pictures in public places, telling jokes and making gender-related degradingremarks while unwanted sexual attention refers to uninvited behaviours that explicitlycommunicate sexual desires or intentions toward another person such as staring at someone’sbreasts or making comments that insinuate sexual activities (Ajuwon, Akin-Jimoh &amp; Olley,2001; Jejeebhoy &amp; Bott, 2003).Sexual coercion among youth encompasses a range of experiences, ranging from noncontactforms such as verbal sexual abuse and forced viewing of pornography, as well asunwanted contact in the form of touching, fondling, to attempted rape, forced penetrative sex(vaginal, oral, or anal), trafficking in person, and forced prostitution. It also includes sexobtained as a result of physical force, intimidation, pressure, blackmail, deception, forcedalcohol and drug use, and threats of abandonment or of withholding economic support.Transactional sex through money, gifts, or other economic incentives (especially in thecontext of extreme poverty) often has a coercive aspect as well. (Ajuwon, Akin-Jimoh &amp;Olley, 2001; Jejeebhoy &amp; Bott, 2003). Moreover,all of these misdemeanor are observed to be trending in university of Abuja and College of Education ,Zuba,thus, the study tends to research into it and find solution in order to curtail the embarrassing situation for the sake of better academic performance for the victims.</p> <p>In addition, the concept correlate according to Collins (2002) , it is a phenomenon which entails placement ofsomething or somebody in a mutual, complementary, or reciprocal relationship. Houghton(2009) defined correlate as a process of putting something or somebody into casual,complementary, parallel, or reciprocal relation. In this study, it refers toprocess of putting the female student into casual, complementary, parallel orreciprocal experiences of sexual harassment. This therefore can be found in the target institutions as a result of some of the incidences that are refered below in this work.</p> <p>According to Mama (1996) male lecturers exploit vulnerability of female students (cost-benefit analysis)who performed poorly in their examinations and tests, and are unable to cope with thedemands of courses registered for as factors that put them in vulnerable positions;predisposing them to the risk of sexual harassment.</p> <p>To Oppong (1995) failures in the Nigerian educational system promote sexual harassment in our institutions.Elendu (2010) revealed in his study that female students’ dressing and attitudesincrease their vulnerability to sexual harassment. He also stated that lack of respectfor thefemale gender was reported as a fundamental reason for sexual harassment.In line with Elendu’s position,the provoking immoral dressing of the so called campus big girls has been observed to be one of the factors exposing them to sexual assult and this is going to be one of the major focus of this study.</p> <p><strong>2.2 Sexual Harassment: Growth and Measurement </strong></p> <p>Sexual harassment as it is perceived today came into existence in 1964 when the UnitedStates Congress passed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and created the Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission. Constance Jones, the author of the book <em>Sexual Harassment </em>traced thehistory of sexual harassment back to the 1830s when many women worked in New Englandtextile mills. Jones indicated that in 1835, printers in Boston conducted a campaign ofintimidation to force women out of their jobs in their industries. By then there was no term todescribe their action. In the 1960s, feminists coined the term \"sexual harassment\".</p> <p>Before the emergence of the concept, people had no way to express their encounter sincethere was no term by which to name it. Since this time, sexual harassment has drawn a greatdeal of interest from academic and legal scholars. Both parties focused primarily on thetraditions, methodologies, and assumptions, but drew different conclusions. Feminist scholars,for instance, contended that the legal system, being male-dominated, has no understanding orregard for the perspectives of women who have been sexually harassed. Initially, sexualharassment was perceived by the public as a normal biological attraction of males to females or</p> <p>an instigation of males' sexual pursuit of women in the workplace or institution. CatherineMacKinnon, as cited in Wyatt (2007) a professor at the University of Michigan Law School andSusan Brownmiller, an activist, initiated the study of sexual harassment and redefined theconcept as an issue of power instead of sex (Nancy Wyatt, 2007). These noble womenacknowledged that sexual behaviors in the workplace or in the academic institutions were notnormal, but were a problem of discrimination against women.It is a cliché that any construct studied by the methods of empirical science like the current one must bereliably and validly measured; sexual harassment is no exception. However, despite growinginterest in this topic, a number of basic questions remain (Fitzgerald, Gelfand, &amp; Drasgow,1995). Of these, perhaps the most perplexing has to do with the level of specificity at whichsuch experiences should be measured. Early studies (Fitzgerald et al., 1988; Martindale,1990; U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, 1981) were primarily designed to collectfrequency data and typically examined harassment at item level; that is, they calculated thenumber of individuals who experienced one or more of a number of specific acts. The generalprocedure was to present individuals with lists of behaviours and count as harassed allrespondents who reported experiencing any of these during the time frame of the study.</p> <p>Although, empirical investigations into the phenomenon of sexual harassment have</p> <p>increased exponentially over the past decades, many basic questions about the measurement ofthis construct remain unanswered. Most research has utilized an aggregate-level approach,which assesses the frequency of all offensive sex-related behaviours experienced by anindividual within a given time . However, this approach has several limitations,including obscuring the etiology and impact of separate harassment incidents on a particularindividual (Suzanne, Mindy, NiCole, Fritz, &amp; Louise, 2001). Consequently, Suzanne, Mindy,NiCole, Fritz, &amp; Louise, (2001) adopted a situation-specific approach to the measurement ofsexual harassment experiences, the Sexual Experiences Questionnaire-Specific Experienceversion (SEQ-SE) was employed and evaluated. Results of confirmatory factor analysissuggested that the measure has adequate construct validity. In addition, the substantiveinformation yielded by this measure indicated that it is an important tool in the investigationof the prevalence and correlates of sexual harassment experiences.</p> <p>Studies (Fitzgerald 1995) have begun to conceptualize harassment as a higher</p> <p>order construct that is more appropriately assessed by a scale score than by individual items.Such an approach has the advantage of being amenable to traditional reliability and validityinvestigations as well as to examination by item response theory-IRT methodologies(Donovan &amp; Drasgow, 1999). Research at the aggregate level assesses the frequency of alloffensive sex-related behaviours experienced by an individual within a given period.This methodology, thus, has revealed substantial data on sexual harassment measurement.</p> <p>Despite these insights, aggregate methodology suffers from its own limitations.</p> <p>Specifically, aggregate measurement ignores the fact that behaviours can combine to produceboth more and less than the sum of their parts. This is because the meaning of complexexperiences is not well captured by simply summing their components; less because suchaggregations obscure the experience of multiple incidents, possibly perpetrated by differentpeople across time, departments, and so forth. When separate experiences are aggregated,their etiology cannot be determined. Thus, it is impossible to explore potential associationsbetween antecedents (e.g., organizational climate) and specific types of experiences.</p> <p>Moreover, the impact of a given experience is difficult to evaluate when data are “collapsed”over multiple incidents and perpetrators. Another problem of aggregation is that it equatesincidents of varying types and can thus underestimate the importance of situations that,though rare, are particularly severe. For instance, a woman who reports hearing offensivejokes at work “many times” over the past 2 years receives 5 points (on a 5-point scale)toward her score on the Sexual Experiences Questionnaire-SEQ (Fitzgerald et al., 1988,1995), a widely used aggregate measure of harassment. In contrast, a woman whosesupervisor tried to rape her in a single violent incident theoretically receives only 2 points.Because items on the SEQ are unit-weighted, the measure’s major source of variance is the</p> <p>frequency ratings assigned by the participants; thus, repeated exposure to “minor” eventscarries much more weight than a single violent incident.</p> <p>In practice, this problem arises infrequently, as virtually all respondents who report</p> <p>sexual coercion or sexual assault describe it as embedded in a network of other offensivebehaviours; still, the situation is conceptually unsatisfying as well as occasionally empiricallyproblematic. A final limitation of aggregate-level measurement is that it complicatesexamination of targets’ coping strategies, including whether they report their experiences.Also, research has demonstrated that fewer than 15 per cent of harassment targets formallycomplain about their experiences (Dansky &amp; Kilpatrick, 1997) and the question of why this isso, and under what circumstances, is not completely understood. These predictors areobscured, however, when an aggregate measure is employed and multiple incidents arecollapsed.</p> <p>Suzanne et al. (2001) explored an alternative approach to the measurement of sexualharassment experiences using the Sexual Experiences Questionnaire—Specific Experience(SEQ-SE), which assesses such situations at the level of a by unitary experience (i.e., itinquires about the behaviours that comprise a single harassment incident). This approach,which was labelled situation-specific measurement, is not new to sexual harassment research;situation-specific data have been collected for as long as researchers have been exploring thistopic.</p> <p>The Sexual Experiences Questionnaire-Department of Defense version (SEQ-DoD)(Fitzgerald et al., 1999) is a behaviourally based measure of offensive sex-related experiencesderived from Fitzgerald et al.’s (1988) measure; it was revised and expanded for use inmilitary settings. All questions share a common stem: “In the past 12 months, have you beenin situations involving military personnel and/or civilian employers and contractors employedin your workplace where one or more of these individuals.” The body of each item describesbehaviours that the respondent may have experienced, such as “Repeatedly told sexual stories</p> <p>or jokes that were offensive to you?” and “Continued to ask you out after you had repeatedlysaid you weren’t interested?” Responses are made on a Likert-type scale, ranging from 1(never) to 5 (very often).</p> <p>Factor analyses of the original SEQ (Fitzgerald et al., 1988, 1995) have consistentlyyielded a three-factor solution (gender harassment, unwanted sexual attention, and sexualcoercion); the first two factors are conceptually similar to the legal concept of hostile workenvironment, whereas the last more closely corresponds to the concept of quid pro quoharassment. New items were incorporated in the SEQ-DoD that formed an additional fourthdimension, sexist hostility (Fitzgerald et al., 1999); these items assess behaviour that,although not explicitly sexual in content (e.g., comments that women are not suited to be</p> <p>leaders or do not belong in the military), convey sex-based antipathy and discriminatoryattitudes. As with previous forms of the measure, the words “sexual harassment” do notappear until the final item, at which point respondents are asked if they have been sexuallyharassed during the time frame of the study; this item is not included in SEQ scores.</p> <p>Fitzgerald et al. (1999) report internal consistency reliabilities of .83, .91, .85, and .95 for thesexist hostility, sexual hostility, unwanted sexual attention, and sexual coercion scales,respectively.Sexual Experiences Questionnaire-Significant Experience (SEQ-SE) was baseddirectly on the SEQ-DoD; this measure asks respondents who marked any items on the SEQDoDto provide information about the one such experience that had the greatest impact onthem. Respondents are then directed to review the items they have marked (on the SEQ-DoD)and indicate all behaviours involved in this single, significant incident. Operationally, theSEQ-SE is a re-administration of SEQ-DoD with a different instructional set. In contrast to</p> <p>the parent measure, responses to the SEQ-SE are dichotomous (i.e., “yes/no”). As a check onreliability, data from the SEQ-DoD and the SEQ-SE were first examined for responseconsistency. Because the SEQ-SE assesses the one situation that had the greatest effect on therespondent in the past 12 months (whereas the SEQ-DoD asks about all experiences duringthe same time frame) the items checked on the former should logically be a subset of thelatter. Therefore, women who marked an item on the SEQ-SE not marked in their overallSEQ-DoD were excluded from subsequent analysis; less than 2 per cent of respondents(1.6%) failed to satisfy this consistency requirement.</p> <p>Wadsworth et al. (1993), maintain that the two popular tools for data collection in</p> <p>sexual behaviour studies have remained the self-administered questionnaire and interview. They further explain that the greatest advantage of the self-administered questionnaire is itsefficacy in eliciting information on socially-censored behaviours. The efficacy, means that, it is a product of the anonymity, which the questionnaire guarantees the respondent tosuch issues. According to Helitzer-Allen, Makhambera and Wangel (1994), there are twotypes of interview suitable for obtaining sensitive information like information on sexualharassment, namely in-depth interview and focus group discussion (FGD). They furtherstressed that in-depth interview is a one-on-one type of interview conducted on a few subjects</p> <p>typical of the study population. Such interviews, according to them, are good for derivinginformation on all the interviewees who know or have experience about the sexual behavior in question. This type of interview helps the interviewer to find out whichsocial norms might limit the content of the FGD; hence, it will better precede the FGD.</p> <p>The FGD, according to World Health Organisation WHO (1995), is an organised</p> <p>discussion among 6 to 12 individuals on a single topic for a limited amount of time. WHOfurther asserted that one person, called the facilitator, guides the conversation by asking aseries of very general, open-ended questions about the chosen topic. The aim is to encourageordinary dialogue among members of the group, including differences of opinion. Thediscussion, according to WHO (1995), is recorded in detail by a documenter and is analyzedafterwards for information about the topic. In the current study, the phenomenon of sexual harassment against female students by their male lecturers shall be  measured by adapting and integrating Fitzgerald et al.’s (1995) SexualExperiences Questionnaire-SEQ . SEQ adopts an approach where item responses are made on a Likert-type scale,ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (very often). </p> <p><strong>2.3 </strong><strong>Sexual Assault in Tertiary Institutions and the Experience of Female Students in Nigeria.</strong></p> <p>The impact and scope of sexual harassment in colleges and universities surfaced in theearly 1980s leading to the creation of policies, procedures, extensive training programs andmaterials designed to identify and prevent sexual harassment. In spite of the efforts to minimizeor eradicate sexual harassment on college campuses the frequency of complaints are increasing(Riggs et al., 1993). Sexual harassment is a real life experience for women across countries,culture, and ethnicity. According to the AAUW (2006) report about two-third of college students</p> <p>(62%) have been sexually harassed and about one-third of first-year students (41%) have beensexually harassed by peers. Katz (2005) indicated that a survey conducted by the AmericanPsychological Association (APA) on female graduate students revealed that over 12.7% haveexperienced sexual harassment, 21% have avoided classes for fear of being sexually harassed,11% tried to report an incident of sexual harassment and 3% have dropped a course because ofsexual harassment. A 1997 survey of nearly 200 female college and university students inMumbai, India found that 39% of the respondent complained of sexual harassment (Puja, 2003).</p> <p>At Jimma University in Ethiopia sexual violence, harassment, and lack of security were indicatedas the most common problems facing female students (Panos, 2003).AAUW (2006) identified sexual harassment as number one pervasive problem to equityin educations at all levels. AAUW argued that sexual harassment posed a damaging effect on theeducational experience of many college students and disrupts students' ability to learn andsucceed. According to AAUW sexual harassment interferes with the students'ability to perform in an educational setting. Students have become aware of the existence ofpolicies on harassment (AAWU, 1999); however, increased awareness does not mean lessincidents of sexual harassment or increased report of incidents. The AAUW's research report,\"Drawing the Line: Sexual Harassment on Campus\" indicated that more than one-third ofcollege students tell no one after being harassed; almost half (49%) confide in a friend; and onlyseven percent (7%) of students report the incident to a college employee.</p> <p>In addition, sexual assault is any sexual act performed by one person on another without the persons consent and it includes genital, oral or anal penetration by a part of the accused body or by an object. It may result from force, the threat of force either on the victim or another person, or the victim‟s inability to give ap-propriate consent. Sexual assault have been des-cribed or categorised based on personal relation-ship as marital, acquaintance, incest and date rape, or legally in terms of age as statutory rape and child sexual abuse. It is a serious violent crime that has no place in any ideal society and no one can justify its prevalence in any community that thrive on mu-tual trust particularly our tertiaryuniversities and other tertiary institution are by con-ception knowledge dissemination centres where knowledge is both brought in and taken out by students as well as teachers and it further inculcate moral values that will influence positive behaviour change to the students in the course of the training. These are the attributes that qualifies student for award of certificates which at graduation ceremonies summarised as found worthy both in “character and learning”. Equally, not only positive knowledge but negative knowledge and experiences are consciously or subconsciously distributed in both directions which manifest with immoral behaviours as sexual assault. Sexual assault is becoming a com mon occurrence among students; the vulnerable group were the weak female students which boththe lecturers and fellow male students take undue advantage to abuse. This was facilitated by the degree of freedom of social interaction among young men and women encouraged by the learning environment and lack of parental supervision because they are away from home.Female students in Nigeria colleges and universities have unique experiences of this menace from male faculty, staff, and peers. Though sexual harassment is a global conceptthat affects virtually women of all races, ages, and colors Nigerian women experience moreelusive types of harassment. In other countries or cultures, sexual harassment is a behavior that isgenerally unacceptable in any public setting. Nigerian society does not accept the concept of</p> <p>harassment and so does not perceive harassment as evil or a violation of women's right. In fact, in some states in Nigeria for instance, this ugly practice was indirectly legitimized by teaching and nonteachingstaff. According to Nwaogwugwu (2007) “a practice in Anambra State colleges anduniversities popularly called \"sorting\" where students (males and females) pay their way throughexaminations either with cash, gifts, or sexual gratifications. In this practice, male students wereasked to pay money but sexual gratification was the top expectation for women students. Thesefaculty and staff proudly call this practice \"inconveniency allowance\". As a result, studentsfondly divide faculty into \"sortable\" (those who make demands for gratification) and\"unsortable\" (those who do not). Consequently, women students in Nigeria colleges anduniversities are raising concerns over the alarming incidents of sexual harassment on campus by</p> <p>male faculty, staff, and students”. Houreld (2006) found that 80% of women in Nigerian highereducation institutions reported sexual harassment as their greatest challenge in the successfulcompletion of their academic goals. Adedokun (2004) and Ejiogu and Onyene (2006) found thatabout 86% of male faculty and staff in the sampled universities in Nigeria have sexually harassedfemale students at one point in their teaching career. In line with all of these findings,this</p>\n\nPREVALENCE AND CORRELATES OF SEXUAL HARRASSMENT OF FEMALE STUDENTS BY LECTURERS IN THE TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PREVALENCE AND CORRELATES OF SEXUAL HARRASSMENT OF FEMALE STUDENTS BY LECTURERS IN THE TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS", "id": 146}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p>The gradual shift from the offline to online communication such as text messaging has given way to innovative</p> <p>language-short forms whose morph-syntactic aspects have permeated the linguistic characters of the texters. For</p> <p>about a decade now, there exist a growing body of research on mobile phone text messaging by linguists but</p> <p>only very few have been done in the area of morpho-syntax. The work therefore, examines the aspects of</p> <p>morphology and syntax found in SMS text messages.

Through the move-a rule and the pragmatic</p> <p>method of analysis, the study discovers that there are morpho-syntactic variations among texters which are</p> <p>problematic to formal English. It also reveals that movement of constituents from one slot to the other is a</p> <p>common feature in text messages though some of such movements violates move-a rules.

The texters obviously down-play the orthographic and</p> <p>syntactic rules of the formal English language for their convenience.</p> <p>Keywords: SMS texts, Nigeria, mobile phone, morpho-syntactic analysis.</p> <p>1.0 Introduction</p> <p>Language has been an integral part of communication and human beings being compulsive communicators</p> <p>continue to find new ways of communication in an attempt to bridge the distance between individuals. Internet</p> <p>technology has greatly influenced human life especially in the area of communication. Following the wave of the</p> <p>technology, Wiki (2008) notes that there is an overwhelming access to different forms of media with an increase</p> <p>in interconnectedness of peoples and races around the entire world. According to Adejub (2010:2), “the entire</p> <p>world comprising six continents and many countries of about 6,881,800,000 (as the estimated population United</p> <p>States Census Bureau) has been reduced to a global village through the dynamism of communication with the aid</p> <p>of information technology (ICT).” ICT is a term used to refer to a range of technologies for gathering, storing,</p> <p>retrieving, processing, analyzing and transmitting information. The SMS (short message service) which serves as</p> <p>the latest way of quick communication since the invention of SMS texts came alongside with the global</p> <p>technology Lexemes are used to facilitate the effectiveness of this device. The effectiveness of this medium of</p> <p>communication depends on the appropriate combination of the words it carries, and in the combination of these</p> <p>words lie what is known as the message. This communication technique is currently in use in all areas of lifeoffices,</p> <p>schools, markets, homes, advertisements, churches, etc. The component service (the phone) is unique for</p> <p>its smallness and mobility. Due to the smallness, there is a limited space which leaves subscribers no choice</p> <p>other than pursue simple sentence structures and other language short-forms to enable them exhaust their</p> <p>message. Crystal (2008) contributing to the small character space of the mobile phone contends that subscribers</p> <p>have created new linguistic forms to enable them maximize the available space and at the same time, make sure</p> <p>they say all that is to be said to the understanding of the receiver. Supporting this view, Rafi (2010) observes that</p> <p>through the new written conventions, texters have developed a written form of sounds that replaces the ability to</p> <p>hear spoken utterances. The study therefore, seeks to examine the morpho-syntactic analysis of the innovative</p> <p>language-form (Text messaging).</p> <p>1.1 Methodology</p> <p>The sources of data for our analysis comprise the text messages sent and received by the students of the</p> <p>University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Our choice of area of study is guided by the fact that University of Nigeria,</p> <p>Nsukka is a federal university where the students comprise peoples from different tribes of the nation. Data was</p> <p>collected from fifty University students comprising both male and female. A total of seventy-five messages</p> <p>(consisting of educational, seasonal, love, religious and other messages that express well wishes) were collected</p> <p>from the participants whose messages were taken in confidence. This guarantees the researcher’s permission to</p> <p>analyze the messages. The samples of the data are found in the Appendix.</p> <p>Research on Humanities and Social Sciences www.iiste.org</p> <p>ISSN 2222-1719 (Paper) ISSN 2222-2863 (Online)</p> <p>Vol.3, No.15, 2013</p> <p>85</p> <p>2. SMS Text Messaging: An Overview</p> <p>The Short Message Service (SMS) is the part of a phone, web or mobile communication system used globally for</p> <p>the exchange of short text messages between discussants. SMS according to Oladoye (2011:16) was first used in</p> <p>December 1992 by a 22-year old named Neil Papworth. He says that the concept of SMS was developed by</p> <p>Friedhelm Hillebrand, Bernard Ghillebaert and Oculy Silaban in 1984, in the Franco-German GSM cooperation.</p> <p>Since the invention, the mobile telephone has been the latest way to communicate quickly. Text messaging is a</p> <p>general term that is used to refer to the short written messages usually sent through phone and other portable</p> <p>devices over a network. Ong’onda (2011:1) observes that the terms ‘text messaging’ or just ‘texting’ refers to the</p> <p>brief typed messages sent using the Short Message Service (SMS) of mobile/cell phones, personal digital</p> <p>assistants (PDAs), smart phones or web browsers. Uhunmwangho (2009:27) defined a text message as “any</p> <p>linguistic event, usually a written form of speech that is imbued with meaning”. Doring (2002:7) notes that</p> <p>“SMS communication allows for a reasonable use of syntactic and lexical short forms, which save character</p> <p>space, or touches of the handset keys, as compared with using the full forms of words”. In the words of Rafi</p> <p>(2010:3) it pursues simple sentence structures for communication. They also make use of written sound of words</p> <p>and in other cases bring code mixing into it. Rafi further observes that SMS syntactic and lexical choices by the</p> <p>texters are not so different from a child language; for instance a child expresses his feelings through simple</p> <p>present progressive tense e.g. mom eating for ‘Mom is eating’ and Eating for ‘I am eating’</p> <p>The equipment in its uniqueness affords most texters a much economized means of communication (Habluetzel</p> <p>2007), (Thurlow 2003) and (Thurlow and Poff 2011). The Short message Service gives the subscriber the</p> <p>advantage of choosing a specific number of words that would communicate comprehensively, but briefly, with</p> <p>minimum cost- Chiluwa (2007:96). Due to the inconveniences caused by the limitation in the time and space that</p> <p>comes along with the Short Message Service, texters are forced to find new ways for sending text messages.</p> <p>Letters and numbers are also often combined (or used alone) for compression and convenience. Discussing on</p> <p>the brevity of the electronic discourse, (Crystal 2001), (Hard af Sagerstad 2002) and (Thurlow 2003) note that</p> <p>the technical restrictions of text messaging have led to the development of language short forms in SMS</p> <p>communication.</p> <p>The sender of a text message is known as a texter. SMS text service itself has different colloquialisms depending</p> <p>on the region in that it may simply be referred to as a text in North America, India, Australia, Nigeria etc. Our</p> <p>area of study geographically is therefore, morpho-syntactic analysis of SMS text messaging in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.1 Nigeria and the SMS Texts</p> <p>The global technology for Mobile communication notes Alabi (2010a) was introduced in Nigeria in the year</p> <p>2001 and following the inception, he observes that SMS text messaging has become a major medium of passing</p> <p>across information from one person to another irrespective of the distance between the ‘sender’ and ‘receiver’.</p> <p>MTN, which happened to be the first GSM Company in Nigeria, commenced its commercial services in August</p> <p>2001. In the words of Bodomo (2010:110) mobile phone in Nigeria was introduced in 2001 with the evolution of</p> <p>Global System for Mobile Communication which two people or more exchange messages by coding and</p> <p>decoding texts received and sent from their cell phones”. Oladoye writes that the commencement brought the</p> <p>Short Message Service (SMS) to limelight in the Nigerian communication system; ever since then, text</p> <p>messaging has taken different turns. SMS text messaging as used by modern handsets is a part of the Global</p> <p>System for Mobile communication (GSM), as a means of sending messages of more than 160 characters to and</p> <p>from GSM mobile handsets. In Nigeria, most SMS messages are mobile - to - mobile text messages, although the</p> <p>standard supports other types of broadcast messaging as well. Linguists and scholars of related fields have</p> <p>conducted researches on the general use of SMS text messaging since it became a part of the Global System of</p> <p>communication in Nigeria. Such scholars include: Chiluwa (2007), Egbe (2009), Uhunmwangho (2009), Alabi</p> <p>(2010ab), Adejub (2010) Oladoye (2011), etc. Chiluwa focused on the effects of the limited interface allowed by</p> <p>the SMS to the users and the Nigerianess of SMS messages in English. Egbe spoke elaborately on the varying</p> <p>possibilities offered by text messages and acknowledges that many users sending greetings at Christmas, Easter,</p> <p>Sallah, anniversaries, wedding ceremonies or events are no longer by the use of cards but through text messages</p> <p>by the mobile handset. Even invitations to events, meetings and high powered gatherings are sent through the</p> <p>mobile discourse. Oladoye (2011:46) discussing on the importance of the SMS as a means of communication in</p> <p>Nigeria comments as follows:</p> <p>SMS text messaging has become a vital part of our communication system in Nigeria. It serves as a cheaper</p> <p>alternative for many Nigerians today, in which they pay less, as against the higher costs on oral phone calls. It</p> <p>has found a place for itself and it has come to stay. Various new devices are now developed to promote its usage</p> <p>e.g. Blackberries and I-phones. In Nigeria today, people receive invitations to employment interviews, warnings,</p> <p>announcements, etc via text messages. SMS text messaging is moving fast on a wide range in the Nigerian</p> <p>communication system and even in the whole of Africa</p> <p>From the foregoing, there seem to exist a growing body of research on mobile phone texts messaging by</p> <p>Research on Humanities and Social Sciences www.iiste.org</p> <p>ISSN 2222-1719 (Paper) ISSN 2222-2863 (Online)</p> <p>Vol.3, No.15, 2013</p> <p>86</p> <p>linguists but only very few have been done on the area of morpho-syntax. Nevertheless, we shall review them as</p> <p>they constitute our base.</p> <p>2.2 Empirical studies</p> <p>Nwankwo (2011) examines the syntactic errors among GSM users and discovers such dominant features as</p> <p>omissions of punctuation marks, incorrect phrasal combinations, spellings and the use of abbreviations. She</p> <p>warns that the users of this innovative language should be conscious of these deviations not to transfer the habit</p> <p>in writing to the formal English. Iloelunachi (2011) studies the relationship between the syntax of the SMS</p> <p>language style and the language of media. Comparing their syntactic structures, his result reveals that SMS</p> <p>language format are structured differently from that of formal writing. He therefore, strongly suggests that</p> <p>learners should be taught on how best to apply the forms with due recognition for formal and informal contexts</p> <p>while writing. Oladoye (2011) investigates the syntactic and lexico-semantic analyses of selected SMS text</p> <p>messages among the university of Ilorin students. The result shows that among the word classes, the most</p> <p>frequently occurring element is the noun with 39.22%. It discovers that all the text messages had noun elements</p> <p>in them. The most prominent word sequence was the clause which had 20.5%. Ogbonna (2012) made a</p> <p>sociolinguistic study of the local colouration in mobile phone text messaging in Nigeria. Adopting Hymes’ (1962)</p> <p>Ethnography of Speaking, she discovers that young Nigerian text composers blend their knowledge of Nigeria</p> <p>social, linguistic, cultural, political and economic settings with their knowledge of conventions of organization of</p> <p>SMS messaging within Nigerian context to create different types of messages that are meaningful. The study</p> <p>reveals that for most Nigerian youths, the major purpose of texts is social bonding and in expressions that are</p> <p>Nigeria specific. However, the present study examines the morpho-syntactic aspects of text messages as</p> <p>contained in the messages sent or received by the students of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.</p> <p>2.3 Morpho-Syntax</p> <p>2.3.1 Morphology and morphological processes</p> <p>Morphology studies the internal structure of words. It is the way the speech sounds are stringed together to form</p> <p>words. Morphological processes are those processes employed in linguistics to form new words in a language.</p> <p>Sanmi (2010) identified eight ways by which words are formed. They include: affixation, compounding</p> <p>reduplication, acronym, blends, conversion, back-formation, clipping etc. We shall only discuss the</p> <p>morphological processes of Compounding, Blending and Acronyms</p> <p>2.3.2 Compounding is neither inflection nor derivation; it is a combination of two or more independent words.</p> <p>The product of the words formed stands as a free morpheme. According to Lyons (1868), Zwicky (1985) and</p> <p>Sanmi (2010:59), the compound formed is a morphological complex unit in linguistics; it is unquestionable</p> <p>among linguists. It can be formed by adding a noun to another noun as in star lights, noun to a verb as in</p> <p>kickback etc.</p> <p>2.3.3 Blending</p> <p>It is a process in morphology where new words are formed by combining the initial and the final segments of</p> <p>two or more already existing words in a language. Adams (1973) says that blends words made of parts of</p> <p>morphemes usually formed by joining the parts of two diff’ words together. Sanmi (2010:65) observes there are</p> <p>two types of blends; the first cannot be analysed into constituents but contains elements which may remind us of</p> <p>other words similar to them. For instance smog tells us of smoke and fog. Quirk (1986) contends that the second</p> <p>type of blend consists of words seen as contracted forms of compounds, that is, words in which one element is</p> <p>fragmentary when compared to its corresponding uncompounded form. Example, Breakfast + Launch → brunch,</p> <p>carpet + cafetaria → capetaria</p> <p>2.3.4 Acronyms</p> <p>They are new words formed from joining the first letters of two sets of words. Oladoye (2011:36) writes that</p> <p>“when the initial letters are pronounced with the name of the letters of the alphabet, they are called</p> <p>‘alphabetisms’ but when they are pronounced like individual words, they are called acronyms”. Examples</p> <p>include: WHO, NEPA, YES (Youth Empowerment Scheme), AIDS etc. The morphological style is languagespecific,</p> <p>that is, the word formation rule differs across languages. However, in this study we are specifically</p> <p>concerned with the formation rule in English language</p> <p>2.4. Syntax</p> <p>It is the related area of linguistics which studies the patterns that governs the way in which words are combined</p> <p>to form phrases, sentences or clauses (word-order topologies). It can be seen as constructive rules according to</p> <p>which words are combined into sentences using the rules of the grammar of that language. The study anchors on</p> <p>Chomsky’s (1965) syntactic component of grammar. He argues for the innate ability of every normal child in</p> <p>acquiring a grammar of a language that can generate infinite number of grammatical structures using syntactic</p> <p>rules and at the same time detects the ungrammaticality in constructions. We shall also apply Chomsky’s (1957)</p> <p>rules of transformation which was advanced by Baker (19780), Radford (1981) etc. Ndimele (2003:160) holds</p> <p>that a transformation is a grammatical operation which enables two levels of structural representation (Deep and</p> <p>Research on Humanities and Social Sciences www.iiste.org</p> <p>ISSN 2222-1719 (Paper) ISSN 2222-2863 (Online)</p> <p>Vol.3, No.15, 2013</p> <p>87</p> <p>surface structure) to be placed in correspondence. The rule responsible for such operations in syntax is known as</p> <p>move-alpha. The transformational operations we shall discuss here are movement and deletion.</p> <p>2.5. Meta Pragmatic Theory: An overview</p> <p>Metapragmatic theory was propounded by silvestein (1976) and his associates. Leech (1983) says that the theory</p> <p>involves metapragmatic reasoning and reasonability. He observes that the reasonability of the metapragmatic</p> <p>denotes ‘user reasonability’. By ‘user reasonability’, he means that it is the users that deem the rules of text</p> <p>composition reasonable. This contention implies that it is the sender and the receiver of text messages that deem</p> <p>the content of the text reasonable for the understanding of the intended messages. The key principles of Meta</p> <p>pragmatic theory include the principles of economy and efficiency. Though this theory seems to belong to the</p> <p>area of sociolinguistics, but the reason for using it in the analysis of the selected text messages is its ability in</p> <p>capturing the reasonability and the economy of the texters.</p> <p>Having made a review of both theoretical and empirical data, we shall examine the morpho-syntactic aspects</p> <p>of the data on the text messages collected just as the way the words, phrases, sentences and clauses are formed</p> <p>by the texters in this work. The analysis is based on the standard norms of the structure of a sentence (English</p> <p>language). It will be discussed under the following headings: movement transformation, Deletion, Word-order</p> <p>violation, omissions, contractions, abbreviations, acronyms, etc.</p> <p>3. Morpho-syntactic Analysis</p> <p>3.1 Movement</p> <p>From the data, we observe that some messages received or sent by texters in SMS messages (M) show evidence</p> <p>of moved constituents from their syntactic positions to a landing site. See Mgs 12, 23, 64 and 65. In M64 ‘Your</p> <p>account’ which is the NP of the sentence moved from its original slot as the pr-verbal NP to a landing site of</p> <p>post-verbal NP of the verb ‘debited’. This type of transformation is barred because a constituent is not allowed to</p> <p>move across more than one bounding node. In M.12, the embedded clause was moved to the subject slot and the</p> <p>complementiser ‘for’ functions as the subject. The structure should be ‘John is tough for one to beat’. In M23,</p> <p>the subject ‘we’ has been inverted leading to syntactic variation. The variation created by move-a may be a</p> <p>device by the writer to achieve focus or even a stylistic device.</p> <p>3.2. Deletion/Omission</p> <p>Deletion is a syntactic operation that removes constituent in a construction and therefore cause it not to appear in</p> <p>the surface structure. Many sentences in SMS texts involve discourse ellipsis, that is, contextually determined</p> <p>omission where the subjects/agents and objects are intentionally deleted or omitted because they are either</p> <p>implicit in the verb or are known by the interlocutors in the discourse. The elements seen as omissions are</p> <p>deleted at the surface structure for purposes of economy and user’s reasonability in understanding the rules of</p> <p>text composition. The data reflected the following types of deletion: subjects/agents, objects, etc. In ‘Ms.1, 3, 5,</p> <p>9, 20, 2I, 22, 24-30’ there are deletions of the subjects in the text messages of the discussants. From the data, the</p> <p>subjects deleted are mostly pronouns such as we, he, she especially the personal pronoun ‘I’. M2 shows evidence</p> <p>of deletion of the agent to the action of the verb ‘transfer’. Texters sometimes omit the object of a sentence</p> <p>which constitutes an obligatory part of a sentence. For instance, in ‘M36 the object of ‘forge’ is omitted. The</p> <p>verb ‘forge’ needs an object to complete the sense of the verb yet its object has been deleted. It is natural in</p> <p>many discourse situations that the discussants under a particular context limit some information to underlying</p> <p>structure yet they understand themselves. The omission shows that there is a shared context or background</p> <p>between the interlocutors about the object in question. This also bears out Ong’onda’s (2011:4) postulation that</p> <p>the stylistic feature of syntactic omissions in SMS discourse relies on the fact that communications with close</p> <p>friends, partners and family members allows one to organize messages pragmatically as a common background</p> <p>exists. Articles and determiners are also omitted in texts of SMS users. In Ms2, 32 and 33’ the determiner ‘the’</p> <p>are omitted while the article ‘a’ is omitted in ‘M34’.</p> <p>3.3 Contractions</p> <p>Contraction is a term used for words or group of words whose orthographic letters are not fully represented; they</p> <p>are shortened for want of time or space. SMS communication makes use of contractions. The words are</p> <p>contracted by cutting the middle of a word or by attaching the first letter of the first word to the second word and</p> <p>removing the rest of the letters of the first word. In ‘M.31, 37, 40, 42, 50’ respectively ‘the phrase what is up’ is</p> <p>contracted as follows: ‘wassup’, birthday as ‘bday’, somebody as ‘sbody’, breakfast as ‘bfast’ fdom as freedom,</p> <p>gmourning for good mourning. The contracted forms which are derived from two or three sets of self standing</p> <p>words do not lose their property of a fully independent word. However, if the practice continues overtime, the</p> <p>fear is that the novice language created by texters may cause some words to lose their property of a fully</p> <p>independent word and acquire the properties of a morphological affix.</p> <p>3.4 Violations in Word-ordering</p> <p>Some sentences found in SMS texts when placed in line with the English word-order, rebel against the standard</p> <p>Research on Humanities and Social Sciences www.iiste.org</p> <p>ISSN 2222-1719 (Paper) ISSN 2222-2863 (Online)</p> <p>Vol.3, No.15, 2013</p> <p>88</p> <p>format of subject-verb-object (SVO). Consider Mgs ‘5 and 9’, in ‘5’ the syntactic ordering of the constituents is</p> <p>‘VOV’ (verb object verb). In ‘9’ the ordering is ‘VSVO’ However, Ong’onda (2011) notes that in an attempt to</p> <p>say all that is needed to be said to achieve effective communication, users tend to rebel against word-ordering; in</p> <p>such cases, ‘to infinitive’ the auxiliary, verbs, prepositions or adverbs may therefore come first. Rafi (2010),</p> <p>comments that inversion of normal English word order seems to be motivated by lack of paralinguistic cues. It is</p> <p>important to note that the structural representation of syntactic variant is based on the assumption that variants</p> <p>have an identical underlying structure. Messages (M) ‘4, 12 and 23’ show that subjects of the sentences are</p> <p>implied. In M4, ‘to infinitive is topicalised for the sake of emphasis; it then occupies the subject slot though it is</p> <p>a pseudo-subject. The surface structure reads ‘it is human to err’.</p> <p>3.5. Compounding, Acronyms and Blends</p> <p>The words merigoround carryova and emotionpach in Ms 24, 36 and 38 are compound words used in the data.</p> <p>The texters overlooked the use of hyphen that connects the word sets as in meri-go-round etc. Acronyms are</p> <p>commonly used as found in the data. Example, C.W.O, UK, UNN, NFCS, NEPA, AIDS, FUNAI in Ms</p> <p>26,28,37,43, 57 and 72 respectively. Blends are also used in the messages, motel in M56 and telecast in ‘74’ are</p> <p>instances used by texters.</p> <p>3.6. Abreviations</p> <p>The use of abbreviations in words and phrases is one of the most features that characterizes the messages of the</p> <p>texters. In M.35, 39, 41, 43-49 respectively, the following words: ‘sumtin stands for something’, ‘wnt for want’,</p> <p>‘cos for because’, ‘fyn for fine’, ‘hw for how’, ‘liten for lighten’,‘d for the’, ‘wz for was’, ‘apy for happy’, broda</p> <p>for brother’, plz for please’. From the data, there is no hard and fast rule morphologically with regards to the</p> <p>users’ choice of letters in abbreviation. This gave rise to morphological variation in lexical forms such that while</p> <p>some texters use phonectic forms as in M.53- ‘gud’ which ignores the orthographic form of the vowel ‘o’ and</p> <p>adopts the graphemic usage ‘u’ in its place. Thurtlow (2007) discussing abbreviations in text discourse notes that</p> <p>texters also take the advantage of different phonetic spellings in order to create different types of verbal effects in</p> <p>their messages such that SMS language reflects abbreviations, capitalization and punctuation. Others who</p> <p>adopt the written framework while abbreviating still vary in their choices of orthographic combination. For</p> <p>instance, ‘cos’ in M.41’ is written ‘cuz’ in M51’, ‘plz in ‘50’ is written ‘plse’ in ‘57’ etc. Some writers use a</p> <p>combination of letters and numbers in their text messages. Example: ‘2morow and b4’as used in M.56. Some</p> <p>others use only numbers for compression. For instance, the numeral ‘8’ is used for ‘eight and ate’ in M. 52 and</p> <p>54, 2 for ‘to, two and too’ in Ms. ‘58, 59 and 60’ respectively. We observe that most often the letters ‘ion’ in the</p> <p>end of words or phrases is abbreviated to be ‘n’. There are also two or three words shortened and merged to</p> <p>become one as in ‘wassup’ and ‘gmourning’ above; they can be termed abbreviated phrases. An abbreviated</p> <p>construction is the one that has two or three words compressed by omission of letters and merging of the words</p> <p>involved. Few text messages use abbreviated phrases. Abbreviated phrases seem to be prompted by the challenge</p> <p>of small screen and the limited character space-Doring (2002). Moreover abbreviations are easily understood by</p> <p>SMS users as Leech’s (1983) metagragmatic user’s reasonability deems such combinations reasonable to both</p> <p>the sender and the receiver.</p> <p>4. Summary and conclusion</p> <p>The paper examined the text messages of the students of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka taking focus on</p> <p>the morpho-syntactic aspects that underlie the linguistic characters of the writers. From the data, our findings are</p> <p>as follows:</p> <p>Syntactically, SMS texts employ transformation rules such as the move-a and deletion rules in some</p> <p>constructions. It is noted too, that some of such movements violates move-a rules. There are many deviations by</p> <p>the online interactive media on the formal English format in such areas as word-ordering, lexical and phrasal</p> <p>contractions and omissions.</p> <p>Morphologically, there is no hard and fast rule with regards to the users’ choice of letters in abbreviation.</p> <p>Texters use a combination of letters and numbers in their text messages and in some cases they use only</p> <p>numerals. The data shows that morphological processes of word formation such as compounding, acronyms and</p> <p>blends are common features that are found in messages of the interlocutors. The analysis also reveals that the</p> <p>SMS text is seriously controlled by socio-linguistic variables as shared background knowledge, the</p> <p>metapragmatic principles of economy, user’s reasonability and efficiency.</p> <p>In conclusion, the stylistic device in SMS texts captured in word modifications, phrasal and clausal</p> <p>manipulations and excessive liberty afforded to the subscribers have given rise to novice language which affects</p> <p>the morpho-syntactic aspects of the Standard English format.</p> <p>References</p> <p>Adejub,EE, S.

Community developments are deliberately ignoring the problems of community development in Nigeria. Even the nongovernmental organizations (Ngos) that are community focused have somehow fallen into the same trap of government act of insensitivity; misplace priority and outright ignorance about the plight of the community poor and community development. Both the government and some of these voluntary agencies often underestimate the quantum of the problems, which comfort the community people in Nigeria. They are attracted to and trapped in urban “cores” which generate and communicate their own sort of knowledge which community “peripheries” are isolated and neglected (chambers 1983). They try to visualize community development according to their own experience, which is urban-based, and therefore lacking in content and form, what constitutes the real kernel of community development.</p> <p>           consequently, the apparent  failure of successive community development policies in Nigeria is to be expected in the light of the foregoing analysis more worrisome, however, is that while this act of government neglect an often selfishness to tackle headline, the problem of community development poor is being multiple, with no end in sight and this is the midst of plenty makes his case miserable as succinctly put by the English proverb which says what the eye does not see, the heart does not grieve about (chamber-1983).</p> <p>indeed the case of the community poor in Nigeria is the case of poverty in Nigeria is the case of poverty in the midst of plenty and that is why it is more painful and call for serious concern especially the government and the non-governmental organization involved in community development effort.</p> <p>there are plethora definitions as to what constitute community development.</p> <p> professor v. Diejomoh (Udo 1984) sees community development as a process of not only increasing the level of per capital income in community areas, but also the standard of living on such factors as food and nutrition, health, education, housing, recreation and security knowing this is important step towards addressing the problems of community development genuinely. </p> <p>                 Robert n. Mcnamarah (1976) in his forward to 1978 world development report, is “trapped” in what he terms as absolute poverty, a condition of life so characterized by malnutrition, illiteracy, disease, squalid surrounding, high infant mortality and low life expectancy is to be beneath any reasonable definition of human decency inspite of the remarkable changes recorded in the countries of the south in recent years.</p> <p>          community development policies in Nigeria over the years have not succeeded in achieving the desired goals by way of uplifting and improving the material living conditions of the community poor inspite of the resources that have been put into the sector and attempt to point the way out. This research study does focus on Nasarawa state.</p> <p>       1.2    <strong>statement of the problem:</strong></p> <p>             the worrisome living condition which people live in communities in Nigeria have found themselves today inspite of a government they can call their own has naturally compelled the need to looking into why this is so, especially that the world, particularly in thecountries of the south, in the test century has witnessed monumental progress in all spheres of  life. Questions likes: is the community man actually lazy and therefore brought upon himself (human being) the present predicament or that deprivation is normal and therefore not two bad as believed by some people agitate the mind and continue to beg for answers. It is the plight of the community dwellers are not only suspect, but they constitute a smokescreen, perhaps from imperialist to confuse the people and subject them to further misery and perpetual state under-development in Nigeria. That is the question we shall attempt to answer in this work.</p> <p>it is instructive to note that beginning with the colonial times many development plans have been evolved in the country. With varying interest and attention on community development yet without significant changes.</p> <p>                details of these shall come in the later part of this work, but suffice it to say that the excruciating community problems which an average Nigeria is going through today leading to a multicity of other problems such as available deprivation, suffering and death make this research a compelling starting point to find out why we are, were we are today and perhaps where we may go from here.</p> <p>1.<strong>3</strong>           <strong> Research Questions:</strong></p> <p>The following are the research statement.</p> <p>(i)                To what extent has government effort toward the development of the community areas in Nigeria over the years succeeded in improving the living condition of the community people?</p> <p>(ii)             What is the level of involvement of the community people in project initiation and implementation?</p> <p>(iii)           Are there any impediments on the way of government on its determined effort to develop the community areas?what are the impediments.</p> <p>(iv)           What positive roles has Nasarawa local government played as an agent of community transformation to develop its community since its creation?</p> <p>(v)             Are there any development targets the local government? What are they and how does the local government intend to achieve them?</p> <p>(vi)           Are there problem militating against  </p> <p>1.4     <strong>Objectives of the Study.</strong></p> <p>The study is an attempt to identify the various impediments on the way of government to development and transform the community areas in Nigeria and to try to re-engineer the process by way of offering/ suggestion/possible solutions</p> <p>The research study will focus on the development plan in the problem of community development in the country which have attempted to tackle the problem of community development in the country and to what degree of success, on the basis of which we shall point the way forward.</p> <p>1.6     <strong>Significance of the Study.</strong></p> <p>The significance of the research work is on community development and administration right from the colonial time till date in their various attempted to develop community areas. Have failed to achieve the desired goals. Thus it is imperative for researchers and scholars interested in the study of Nigeria politics and administration to venture into this area to find out what has gone wrong with government effort in this direction and how to possibly correct it. The studies will after a good starting point of discussion as to why there is into liable level of community problem in Nigeria and interestingly how this co-exist with affluence. What this means is either that the government is not doing enough to improve the living condition of the community areas and render them more vulnerable to deprivation and available deaths.</p> <p>1.7     <strong>                Scope and Limitation of the Study.</strong></p> <p>               the research study centered on community development and the problem envisaged or encounter in the course of this research work include difficulty involved in reaching some of the sample village due to poor road, network.</p> <p>                      consequently in a attempted to solve this problem the researcher had to make do with what was really available in travelling to such areas namely boardly of open vans knows in some places as “Akworekura” while in extreme situation motorcycles population called “Achaba, Okada or going” depending on which part of the country (Nigeria) are come from.</p> <p>Similarly, due to the hypocritical attitude of government to the plight (community). It was not easy to get their attraction and the readiness to talk to the researcher.</p> <p>              there was the general problem of time frame or constraint faced in the cause of the research work, the lecture (whenever it become necessary) because like earlier stated the research work was carried out side by side with may class work needless to say that the approach, the problem of time was conveniently put to rest</p> <p><strong>1.8Definationof Terms:</strong></p> <p>in order to enhance a better group of the subject issue the discourse study it is important for us to after some explanation and interpretation of some of the basis terminology used in the study. </p> <p><strong>Local Government</strong></p> <p>(UnitedNation in 1959). Sew local government as “a political sub-division of a nation which is constituted by law and has sub-stantial control of its local affairs, including the power to imposed tax</p> <p>Orewaand Adewumi(1992) also sew “local government as a system of local communities and towns. Which are organized to maintain law and order provided some limited range of social services and co-operation of the inhabitants in joint endeavors towards the improvement of their conditions living “going further they asserted that the local government provides the community with a formal organization framework which enable them to conduct their members for the general public?</p> <p><strong>Development</strong></p> <p>Rodney (1972:9-10) development is a process whereby the people of a society increase their capacity of satisfy their needs through the explanation of the resource within their environment by organizing the abilities and energies of the people to exploit such resources. What this means in essence is to portray development as a process dual and multifaceted phenomenon that involves changes in the material life of a people.</p> <p><strong>Community</strong></p> <p>G.O.H. Cole (1920) community means “ a complex social life, a complex including a number of  human being living together under conditions of social relationship bound together by a common, however constantly changing stock of convention, customs and tradition and conscious to some extend of common social objects and interests”.</p> <p>Sutherland and Maxwell (1961:316) defined community as “a local area over people are using the same language, conforming to the same norms feeling more or less the same sentiments and acting upon the same professor.V.Diejomah (udo 1984) defined community development as the process of not only increasing the level of per capital income in community seas, but also the standard of living of the community population either the standard of living measured on such factors as food, nutrition, health, education, housing, recreation and security.</p> <p><strong>Tanzania model</strong></p> <p>(Doctor Nyeyere). Before Nyeyerebecome president of Tanzania he frequent Tanzanians that when independence comes they would need to exert themselves more than ever before. The common salutation was “Uhum” which means freedom and response was “ Nakazimeaning ( and work). Every person old or young embraced the idea upon independence the people responded enthusiastically (actively) to the plea of the president and urgency of community development workers, the politicians and the officials to take up self-help or nation building activities. Project sprang up so rapidly that the government could not cope to meet the effort of the people with material and technological assistance many projects of little use were completed and many useful ones were not completed. Most of the efforts do not contain the essential of self-help; the idea of project execution comes from outside promotions, they were motivated patriotism and political enthusiast.</p> <p>at the outside of independence (1961) Tanzania leaders recognized the critical element that had to be considered for nation building and thus.</p> <p>-        Expansion of Agriculture</p> <p>-        PublicWorks (Effective Communication Network)</p> <p>-        HigherEducation.</p> <p>-        Education for Self-Reliance</p> <p>-        Freedom and Development </p> <p>The president stressed that development, means developing themselves so that there may be change in their own interest. He pointed out that if development is for greater freedom and well being of the people then it cannot result from force. He contended that decision making and willing action can take place only if people understand their needs know how to meet these needs and have the freedom to decided and act upon them.</p> <p>-                     A structure for local and national development approach was formed.</p> <p>-                     An operational and administration scheme was made for useful association and joint effort between people and government.</p> <p>-                     Village development committee was organized to promote local planning and action by people.</p> <p>-                     District rural development and planning committee were formed to amalgamate the plans of people and government into useful local action.</p> <p>-                     Regional development committee ware given the task of representing the interest of government at the level.</p> <p>-                     National committee of ministers and officials was formed to given overall credence and guidance to the entire effort.</p> <p>The government officials and technical’s of each district council whose task was to prepare development plans based on the needs and desires of the people expressed through the village development committee.</p> <p>The typical functions of district councils had been to collect taxes enforce law and carry out the general duties of government at local level. It was recognized that not all council or council members were well versed in development planning and implementation, but with the adviser delegated to work with them, they were expected to develop experience. The major improvement in principle was that planning was made to be the responsibility of those who had to carry it out.</p> <p><strong>The Ujaman Programme</strong></p> <p>Ujamanis a Swaliliword for the political ideology development in Tanzania by dr.

A strategy, which is gaining ground in many countries, as the   </p> <p><strong>Chapter Two:Literature Review</strong></p> <p>2.0     <strong>Introduction:</strong></p> <p>Community development has been recognized as a development par diagram in Nigeria from time immemorial to date, however, it remains rudimentary and operates more meaningfully, in the rural then urban areas. Struggling to avoid being completely left behind, many community dwellers develop the spirit of self-help for the provision of some of the basic needs within their communities.</p> <p>Self-help activities have been internet in several communities the rural communities especially, have unique social cohesiveness and are homogeneous culturally and linguistically. The tradition and societal norms encourage communal approaches to the solution of a variety of problems.</p> <p>Community development in Nigeria has witnessed consideration transformation in terms of the nature of projects embarked upon, political recognition and the extent of integration into development planning. Various groups in the rural communities have been involved in the provision of a aided range of facilities includes social, physical and institutional infrastructure.</p> <p>In various parts of the country, the self-help approach has been adopted in the construction and rehabilitation of rural roads, primary and secondary schools, health centers postal agencies and market stalls as well as provision of potable water and electricity part of the transformation was the increased involvement of the government since the 1970s.</p> <p>Many scholars and international organizations defined community development.</p> <p>              according to united organization defined community development as the process by which the efforts of the people themselves are united, with those of government authorities to improve the economic, social and cultural conditions of the rural communities to integrate those communities into life of the nation and to enable them to contribute fully to the solution of national problems (Uno 1960).</p> <p>bolas and Bello, i.o. (1978) says community development implies a massive effort to increase production, create and spread employment and root out fundamental causes of poverty, diseases and illiteracy among the community people in the other words, community development involves the far reaching transformation of the social and economic structures, institution, relationships and process in any community area.</p> <p>Aziz, s. (1978) defined community development as a multidimensional process by which the productivity, income and welfare, in terms of health, nutrition, education, and other features of satisfactory life of community people can be improve or transformed.</p> <p>According to United Nations (1955) defined community development as an education process to create condition of economic and social progress for the whole community with its’ active participation and fullest possible reliance up on the community initiative”.</p> <p>National policy on integrated rural development document (1991). Defined community development as the strategy and process where significant improvements are brought about and sustained in the economic, socio-cultural and political life of the community population.</p> <p>Professor v. Diejomoh, (Udo, 1984) defined community development as a process, of not only increasing the level of per capital income in the community sector, but also the standard of living of the community population. The standard of living in this regard includes such factors as food, nutrition, health education housing, recreation and security.</p> <p>V. Lele (1999) defined community development as a way of improving the living standard of the low income and in so doing acquire the attitudes, experiences, and co-operative skills for repeating this process again and again on their own initiatives.</p> <p>2.1     <strong>Theoretical Framework:</strong></p> <p>A major disturbing phenomenon in the developing world particularly in the African continent is the issue of community development. The question of community development problems in the midst of affluence has continued to defer solutions inspire of all efforts to find a recipe to the problems. That the continent is blessed with a enormous and abundant human and natural resources is not in doubt, but that the mass of the people. Living in this continent is poor and grappling daily with basic issues of survivals namely food, housing and clothing is what scholars must cannot understand.</p> <p>in most of the developing countries, the bulk of the populations reside in the community areas. Consequently to understand and squarely address the situation posed by these crises of living we have to understand the concept of community participation and most particularly, as it affects the community development policies over the land years and see to what extent they have been genuine or otherwise.</p> <p><strong>Community Participation</strong></p> <p>This is the involvement of people in community development activities in terms of ideas, planning, directing, execution, supervision and evaluation of program and projects. It is an opportunity provided by the local government for the people to have a say in the issued which affect them  it is a planned process by the local government to involve members of the communities in political, economic, social and cultural issues in decision-making –participation is a kind of minimum freedom which is accorded to communities at the grassroots level to sit together, discuss and make recommendations on the issues affecting their livelihood before forwarding them to the local government. In the past the local government usually formulated policies and only involved the communities during the implementation when labor was needed. Today participation has become fashionable because it is a central theme in community development which is also a component of social development.</p> <p>          when a community come together, decides on its’ priorities and invoices its’ development program, it is participating and feeding on input into the system in a way lives would be affected as and how they want, if the local government encourages participation, at is automatically embarking on a process of bringing people together and closer to itself. This is a sure way that the local government can contribute to the improvement of the quality of life of its people. Conversely, the attitudes of the community to development program depend largely on the type of the community. For example at the local level it is relatively easy to whip up collective enthusiasm for development where as in a town where the ties of tradition are weak or non-existent, it is not easy to imbibe communal spirit.</p> <p>Arising from the foregoing, what then is community development?</p> <p>United nations (1955) define community development as an educational process “designed to cre</p>\n\nSOCIAL AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES", "id": 148}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong>     <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong>     <strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Over half the world’s population is bilingual and many people are multilingual. They acquire a number of languages because they need them for different purposes in their everyday interactions. The research had it that most of African nations are multilingual. Nigeria is as well a multilingual nation, with 452 different ethnic languages operating daily amongst the lives of the people.Onewill need one or two of these languages in his daily interactions. Apart from these ethnic languages, there are other varieties of languages that are in operation in the society e.g. lingua franca, which is predominantly English Language, Pidgin, and creoles. All of these are what made up the linguistic varieties in Nigeria. The environment one lives (geographical location) is what determineswhichcode to be chosen per time. Also, the classes of people that are involved in the daily activities plays a vital role to some extent, in the choice of the variety of the language to be used. The linguistic code to be used in the formal school environment will be different from the one to be used at home, and the one at home is to some extent, different from the one to be used in the market. </p> <p>The main reason why I have interest in carrying out research work on this project topic titled “linguistic varieties and a multilingual nation” and have Nigeria as my case study is not just to identify these various languages that are in existence in the nation.</p> <p>The aim of this research is to examine how languages behave in a multilingual speech community and how people react to these linguistic behavioural patterns. In a situation where there are more than two or three languages that function simultaneously in society there are bound to be language crisis. Some languages will likely to be subjugated or dominated, thereby making them look inferior or unattractive. Therefore this research work will help in identifying such problems and to also proffer possible solution to them. It is obvious that language is an Integra part of culture, and culture is referred to as people’s way of life, therefore if there is any language that is suffering from inferiority complex, the people that own such language will suffer the some. Therefore, via this research work and any other research work that shall further this study, will be able to draw government’s attention tp these degenerating languages, and a mean of bringing them to the lime light will be carried out.</p> <p>There are several other issues which are problematic to the Nigerian society orchestrated by multilingualism. This research work also takes a look at them and in the same way suggest possible solution to them. Such issues as communication barriers, language domination and so on are addressed in this work.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Problem of communication had been a common feature in all multilingual nations. People across the globe need to communicate with one another in order for society and business to keep going. Human society cannot survive without communication, and so the use of languages cannot be overlooked. There are various languages that are engaged in these enormous activities of communication in Nigeria. The problem that arises as the result of existence of these multi-languages is what necessitates this research work. It is a common feature among Nigerians that, an individual must need more than one language to survive the socioeconomic and political situation in the country.</p> <p>Nigeria as one of the most multilingual nations in Africa has developed so many languages that serve as medium of communication in her day to day activities. The existence of these various Languages is what i call linguistic varieties in Nigeria. They range from: Mother Tongue (MT), to lingua franca, to pidgin and creoles,  to standard, and national language. The understanding of one or two of these languages is necessary to the survival of an individual in the nation. As earlier stated, language is vital to the survival of a society. </p> <p>There are various languages Nigeria and majority of them are on their way to extinction already, except with government’s timely intervention to their restoration. The question is what will happen to their owner? Definitely they will imbibe other languages, but something very important is gone out of their lives. Some people are even ashamed of speaking their mother tongue because of inferiority complex. Government should stage programs that will cure such damaged mind. High level of favouritism that has pervaded the society today is rooted on language differences. Something should be done about it our mother tongue has almost given way to alien code in mega cities this also should be considered. All these problems are what this project research work seeks to proffer solution, or recommend solution to.</p> <p><strong>1.3RESEARCH QUESTIONS </strong></p> <p>On the basis of the foregoing stated problems, the following questions are raised:</p> <p> i.            How many languages do we have in Nigeria?</p> <p>ii.            Which language serves as national language in Nigeria?</p> <p>iii.            Which language (s) serve as lingua franca in Nigeria?</p> <p>iv.            What role do pidgins and croles play in Nigeria?</p> <p>v.            Which languages are standard language in Nigeria?</p> <p>  vi.            What is the consequences of not understanding these languages?</p> <p>vii.            How do people acquired these various languages? And what do one stands to  gain  over another by understanding these language?</p> <p><strong>1.4  OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p><strong>1.4.1     </strong>BROAD OBJECTIVE </p> <p>To examine the sociolinguistic situation of Nigeria, and how individuals acquire different languages for different purposes, and how each of these linguistic groups harmonize and form a habitable society.</p> <p><strong>1.4.2  </strong>SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES</p> <p>This research also aims at achieving the following goals:-</p> <p>       i.            To examine how these various languages aid the economic and political development in Nigeria.</p> <p>     ii.            To examine how the understanding of these codes had contributed to the social well-being of an individual.</p> <p>  iii.            To widen our scope on the multilingual  and multicultural nature of Nigerian society.</p> <p><strong>1.5 </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>In the study area, the project will be relevant because it will widen our knowledge and understanding about the subject matter – linguistic varieties and a multilingual nation: A case study of Nigeria – and setup our mind on how to positively embrace other ethnic linguistic groups that are different from ours. Also, it is very crucil because it helps identifies the language and cultural diversity in Nigeria, and also sensitizes our mind on the need to harmoniously co-habit with other ethnic groups, knowing fully well that Nigeria is a multi-lingual and multicultural nation, and so everyone should see a fellow as a relative and not a stranger, because of language differences. This knowledge will help to curtail these excesses of tribal wars in the nation Nigeria. We are one.</p> <p>This study will equally give suggestions that are relevant and useful, while the reports shall serve as repertoire of knowledge for other researches to consult in the nearest future.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong>  <strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of this study is on linguistic varieties of a multilingual nation. A case study of Nigeria.  Due to the vast scope of the research area (Nigeria),  it is limited to Abuja city. Emphasis is on the nature of the linguistic varieties in Nigeria and why people acquire various languages for different purposes in their daily interactions. And how this had helped them to peacefully co-habit and manage well in a multilingual setting like Nigeria. The findings of this research might apply to other towns in Nigeria apart from FCT.</p> <p>This is because thiscityis a mega city and there could be a useful information from other minor and nearby satellite towns.</p> <p><strong>1.7DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>-    <strong>Linguistic Varieties</strong>: refers to various or different languages that are in existence.</p> <p>-    <strong>Multilingual: </strong>Speaking or using different languages </p> <p>-    <strong>Multilingual Nation:</strong> This refers to society or nation that has more than two languages.</p> <p>-    <strong>Nation:</strong> This is considered as a country with a group of people of the same history who live in a particular area under one government.</p> <p>-     <strong>Language:</strong> A.C.

Language is a unique and very important phenomenon, the important of which many take for granted. Human beings naturally find themselves speaking the language, unfortunately life and society of human being very boring without it. This is what Edward Sapir understood and came up with the definition of language as an entity through which all human express their thought. Edward Sapir in (1921) defines language as purely human and non-instinctive method of communicating ideas, desires and emotion through the method of voluntarily produced symbol. </p> <p>The arbitrary and haphazard territorial boundaries imposed by the colonial masters in the last two centuries or so did not take cognizance of the people’s diversities before differentiating Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African states. As a result, the geo-political enclave now known as a country encompasses people with varying linguo-cultural identities. This has continued to have far reaching effects on the socio-economic potentials of the nation. This paper argues that the post independence Nigeria’s slow pace on the road of development is due to the non-participation of the Nigerian mono-lingual majority in the socio-economic and political affairs of the nation. This phenomenon is either as a result of the non-availability, non-utilization or defective language policy geared towards the use of mother-tongues.</p> <p>Multiligualism has formed many Nations of the world, including Ghana and Rwanda, to mention but a few. Nigeria is also an example of a multilingual, pluralistic and heterogeneous African state with a history of British colonization. The natural implication of these diversities is that language becomes a principal source of individual identity and also a socio-political capital for interaction across different cultural and political borders. To further complicate this milieu is the colonial language bequeathed to the nation by the imperialist (Adetugbo, 1979). The debate therefore has been what language(s) should function in the lives of the people given the various political, cultural, cognitive and economical role language plays in the socio-political architecture of a nation. </p> <p>Different scholars have taken different contentious and contestable positions on this polemics. Earlier debates on the language policy in Nigeria had centred on the conflicting importance of indigenous and exogenous languages in Nigeria (Bamgbose2005 and Aito 2005). This research work argues from a different perspective of contentious language policy such that gives functional roles to both exogenous and indigenous languages. To achieve the stated goal, the research work delves into the historical and sociolinguistic factors that forged Nigeria’s linguistic situation. The research work also demonstrates that ethnic diversity has always been a part of the people living around the Niger; that being the case, ethnicity and ethnic diversity is not the problem of the nation but the politicizing of ethnicity along linguistic parameters.</p> <p><strong>2.2. The Historical Background</strong></p> <p>To best understand Nigeria’s complex linguistic situation, a historical overview of the traditional societies from the past to the present becomes crucial. In a succinct and abridged fashion, the fragmentation that divides the history of the nation into its various chapters is examined. In what follows, Nigeria’s ethno linguistic history is discussed in order to locate the internal forces that drive policy change and to fully appreciate and appraise the language policy strategy discussed in this paper.</p> <p><strong>2.2.1.          Language Situation in the Pre-Colonial Era</strong></p> <p>Perhaps, one of the highest legacies bequeathed to Africa by colonialism is the political organism now known as the state. The Colonial masters organized different ethnic groups into a political unit for ease of governance and economic exploitations, paying less attention to their cultural and linguistic diversities (Rodney 1973).</p> <p>Before Nigeria came in contact with Europe and colonization, it existed as a sprawling territory of diverse ethnic groups, with each group having a distinct (and to some extent overlapping) historical, linguistic, cultural patterns expressed in traditional socio-political, educational and religious systems (Ajayi and Smith 1964, Dike 1956, Enoch 1996). Therefore in the northern hemisphere, there existed the Hausa, Fulani, Kanuri, Eggon, Mada, Tiv and the Nupes, to mention a few. In the Southern protectorate are the Yoruba, Igbo, Edo, Efik, and Ibibio etc.</p> <p>These ethnic groups were in constant contact with one another through various economic activities and military expansionism. From the standpoint of history, it is understood that there were really no completely isolated tribe; rather, there were different socio-political interaction among the different ethnic groups that constitute what is today known as Nigeria (Ajayi 1967). These contacts and transactions brought about linguistic and cultural exchange. Cultural and linguistic contact, no doubt, led to linguistic borrowing and adaptation of new vocabularies and patterns but not necessarily linguistic domination or annexation. If this claim of history is correct, it is safe to say that linguistic diversities have always been part of the people living around the Niger. For example there are lot of cognate words in Hausa and Yoruba that suggests that the two languages came in contactat some point in history.Another type of linguistic contact that Nigeria experienced happened in the late sixteen century when British missionaries and traders came into the coastal regions of Lagos and Calabar (Omamor, 1991; Elugbe, 1995; Egbokhare, 2001; Esizimetor, 2002b; Adegbija, 2003 and Esizimetor 2010). While the missionaries were concerned with Christian evangelization the merchants were interested in slave trade. After slave trade was abolished in 1807, some of Nigerian slaves who had acquired Western Education came back home with English as a foreign asset and would later serve as interpreters and copyists to the missionaries. One of them was the popular Ajayi Crowder who translated the English Bible into Yoruba language (Huber 1999). This was the beginning of the implantation of English in Nigeria. Going by this historical position, it is safe to conclude that English predates colonization in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>2.2.2.          Language Situation at the Colonia Era</strong></p> <p>When Britain took over as the colonial power in Nigeria, English became the tool with which the new territory would be administered. Hence English became the language of administration (Bamgbose 1991, Lawal 2004). It was the language to be used in official domains of the lives of the colonized. Also, as the missionaries established more schools and propagated the gospel message and western education, the language became the prestigious language of the educated. Finally in 1882, the colonial government intervened in the system of education by promulgating a law that made English the language of instruction at schools and as a subject that must be taught in at all stages of educational growth (Adetugbo 1979). This was necessarily so as the major goal of the colonial powers was to make the colonized assimilate into their culture and way of life. However, the indigenous languages were allowed to be taught in schools alongside English (but not as the primary medium of communication). However, the attitude of people to English particularly in the southern part of the country was more positive than in the North.</p> <p>People readily sent their children to schools to be educated in English. The religious proselytes had their baptismal names in English. Thus English assumed another economic function in that it became a ladder to attaining social mobility under the imperial government. Hence, English became not only the language of administration and religion; it was immediately dignified as the language of the upper class and the elites.</p> <p>The religious proselytes had their baptismal names in English. Thus English assumed another economic function in that it became a ladder to attaining social mobility under the imperial government. Hence, English became not only the language of administration and religion; it was immediately dignified as the language of the upper class and the elites. In the northern region, the response and attitude to English was quite different from the southerners. For one, the Christian mission was not as successful in the north as it did with the south. For this reason, the western education that was projected along with the gospel message could not diffuse easily through the north.</p> <p>The use of English was restricted only to the traditional Hausa/Fulani feudal class. The Hausas took to their Arabo-Asiatic language and their Islamic religion while a very small percentage of them embraced Christianity.</p> <p>This dichotomy between the north and the south along linguistic, cultural and religious lines still exist today. Without paying cognizance to these differences, the colonial authority of those days amalgamated the Southern and the Northern protectorate for ease of governance and made English the official national language to administer the linguistically heterogeneous state.</p> <p><strong>2.2.3.          Language Situation at the Post-Colonial Era</strong></p> <p>The linguistic situation in the post-colonial Nigeria is so complex that it has been described as the biblical tower of Babel. The first tier of language found in Nigeria is the exogenous (English) language bequeathed to the nation by the Colonial rulers.</p> <p>Today, English has grown to become the official national language of Nigeria and continues to play important roles in the nation as the language of education, media, religion (especially the Pentecostal Christian faith), and the language of politics, governance and law. It is the language of the elites and also the first language for some Nigerians. Also, the basilectal variety of the English language in Nigeria called the Nigerian Pidgin is a neutral language spoken across every ethnic and social boundary in the nation. Other exogenous languages with less influence are Arabic and French. The Arabic language has a major political and religious weight in the northern part of the country. It became the language of Islamic education for the northern part of the country after the Usman Dan Fodio Jihad war between 1804-1808.</p> <p>The present language ethnography records over five hundred and twenty-one languages and ethnic groups in the nation.

It observes</p> <p>that the fact that some features of Nigerian English syntax are shared by other new Englishes is a</p> <p>healthy development for the identity of non-native varieties around the world. It finally recommends</p> <p>the codification of the new norms into variety-specific grammars and a common grammar</p> <p>of new Englishes.</p> <p>1. Introduction</p> <p>The documentation of the various features of world Englishes has continued to</p> <p>attract the attention of the linguistic scholar. Like other varieties of non-native</p> <p>Englishes, West African English (WAE) has received considerable attention</p> <p>(see, for example, Spencer 1971; Sey 1973; Bamgbose – Banjo – Thomas 1995;</p> <p>Wolf 2001; Igboanusi 2002a). However, not much has been published on the</p> <p>syntax of WAE in general and that of Nigerian English (NE) in particular. The</p> <p>general belief is that grammatical features of national varieties of WAE are not</p> <p>exclusive, and can also be found in other varieties of New Englishes (cf. Peter –</p> <p>Wolf – Simo Bobda 2003: 44). For example, some scholars (notably Todd</p> <p>1982; Bamgbose 1992; Bamiro 1995) observe that most of the syntactic patterns</p> <p>in educated WAE are similar to those of other new Englishes. However, Todd</p> <p>identifies the following syntactic variations of WAE: the indiscriminate use of</p> <p>the tag questions isn’t it/not so? as in it doesn’t matter, not so/isn’t it?; differences</p> <p>in the use of some phrasal verbs, e.g. cope up with for ‘cope with’; failure</p> <p>to sometimes distinguish between countable and non-countable nouns (e.g. an</p> <p>394 H. Igboanusi</p> <p>advice, firewoods, behaviors). Bamiro’s (1995) study on the syntactic variation</p> <p>of WAE was a more comprehensive investigation than earlier studies on the</p> <p>subject matter. Using data from creative literature, Bamiro identifies the following</p> <p>variations: subjectless sentences, e.g. Is because she’s a street walker for ‘It</p> <p>is because…?’; deletion of -ly morpheme in manner adjuncts, e.g. Send patrol</p> <p>van to pick her up quick (quickly); omission of function words, e.g. You say</p> <p>truth (‘… the truth’); reduplication, e.g. Slowly, slowly the canoe moved like the</p> <p>walk of an old man (gradually); formation of interrogatives without changing</p> <p>the position of subject and auxiliary items, e.g. You’ve decided finally then?</p> <p>(‘Have you finally decided then?’); tag questions, e.g. You are writing a paper</p> <p>about our organization, not so? (‘Isn’t it?’); the use of the progressive aspect</p> <p>with mental processes, e.g. Do you know what I am hearing? (‘Do you know</p> <p>what I hear these days?’); non-distinctive use of reciprocal pronouns, e.g. The</p> <p>captains (seven of them) looked at each other somewhat perplexed (‘one another’);</p> <p>substitution of preposition in idiomatic usage, e.g. That is why they have</p> <p>dragged the good name of my father, Joshua, son of Fagbola in the mud</p> <p>(‘through’); focus constructions, e.g. You are a funny man, you this man.</p> <p>With regard to NE, Banjo (1995: 217) observes that “empirical contrastive</p> <p>study of the syntax of Nigerian and British English goes back to the era of error</p> <p>analysis and contrastive linguistics” (e.g. the works of Tomori 1967; Banjo</p> <p>1969; Odumuh 1981; Kujore 1985). Further works on the syntax of NE are</p> <p>found in Odumuh (1987); Jowitt (1991); Bamgbose (1992); Kujore (1995) and</p> <p>Banjo (1995). For example, Odumuh (1987: 60-65) identifies some “typical</p> <p>variations between British English and Nigerian English as spoken by tertiary</p> <p>educated informants”. Some of his examples include:</p> <p>1) They enjoyed for BE ‘They enjoyed themselves’ (enjoyed occurs intransitively</p> <p>in NE structure while it is usually transitive in BE);</p> <p>2) He pregnanted her for BE ‘He made her pregnant’ (while NE structure uses</p> <p>pregnanted as a verb, the word pregnant occurs in BE as an adjective);</p> <p>3) You like that, isn’t it? for BE ‘You like that, don’t you?’ (in BE, while the</p> <p>negative question tag is always determined by the verb, it is often represented</p> <p>in NE by isn’t it?);</p> <p>4) Give me meat for BE ‘Give me some meat’ (omission of article in NE</p> <p>structure but not in BE structure);</p> <p>5) I am having your book for BE ‘I have your book’ (NE structure uses the</p> <p>ing as a stative marker);</p> <p>6) He has been there since for BE ‘He has been there for some time’ (NE</p> <p>structure uses an adverbial adjunct while BE structure has a preposition</p> <p>followed by an adjunct).</p> <p>Syntactic innovation processes ... 395</p> <p>Jowitt (1991) provides the following examples:</p> <p>7) He offed the light for BE ‘He put off the light’ (1991: 112 – functional</p> <p>derivation);</p> <p>8) After the referee might have arrived the match will begin for BE ‘After the</p> <p>referee has arrived the match will begin’ (1991: 120 – illustrates the use of</p> <p>modals in NE);</p> <p>9) My father he works under NEPA for ‘My father works in NEPA’ (1991:</p> <p>121 – subject copying).</p> <p>A further example is:</p> <p>10) I have filled the application form for BE ‘I have filled in the application</p> <p>form’ (Kujore 1995: 371 – illustrates the use of the verb fill in NE where</p> <p>the preposition in is deleted);</p> <p>It has to be pointed out here that some of the syntactic features illustrated as characterizing</p> <p>WAE or NE by existing studies are in fact shared by other varieties of English.</p> <p>For instance, Kachru (1982, 1983, etc.) has noted the following syntactic features</p> <p>in South Asian English – reduplication, formation of interrogatives without</p> <p>changing the position of subject and auxiliary items, tag questions, differences associated</p> <p>with the use of articles, etc. Similarly, Skandera (2002: 98-99) identifies</p> <p>some of the grammatical features of all ESL varieties which do not occur in Standard</p> <p>English to include missing verb inflections, missing noun inflections, pluralisation</p> <p>of uncountable nouns, use of adjectives as adverbs, avoidance of complex</p> <p>tenses, different use of articles, flexible position of adverbs, lack of inversion in</p> <p>indirect questions, lack of inversion and do-support in wh-questions, and invariant</p> <p>question tags. The fact that many of the features of NE or WAE syntax identified in</p> <p>earlier studies are also shared by other new Englishes is an indication that new Englishes</p> <p>around the world now have identifiable linguistic characteristics. What needs</p> <p>to be done is to intensify research on comparisons of these features across national</p> <p>and regional varieties of non-native Englishes with a view to separating exclusive</p> <p>features of these varieties from general or universal markers.</p> <p>2. Syntactic innovation processes</p> <p>The present study is an attempt to account for innovations in the syntax of NE</p> <p>resulting from the sociolinguistic context of Nigeria, namely Nigerian Pidgin</p> <p>English and the indigenous languages. How is “innovation” to be perceived? To</p> <p>this question, Bamgbose (1998: 2) states that an innovation is to be seen as “an</p> <p>acceptable variant”. The problem here is to determine whether a usage or struc396</p> <p>H. Igboanusi</p> <p>ture is an innovation or an error. What is seen as an innovation in a non-native</p> <p>variety of English may be perceived as an error by most native speakers of English.</p> <p>This problem is resolved the very moment we recognize the roles of social</p> <p>convention as well as the relationship between social structure and linguistic form</p> <p>in the use of new Englishes (cf. Banda 1996: 68). As Skandera (2002: 99) has</p> <p>rightly observed, “if the characteristic features of an ESL variety come to be used</p> <p>with a certain degree of consistency by educated speakers, and are no longer perceived</p> <p>as ‘mistakes’ by the speech community, then that ESL variety becomes</p> <p>endonormative (or endocentric), i.e. it sets its own norms”. Most of the examples</p> <p>provided in the present investigation are so frequently heard in the speech of</p> <p>many educated users of NE that they have ceased to be regarded as errors.</p> <p>3. The data</p> <p>The data for this study is based on my observations through recordings and field</p> <p>investigations over the past five years. The recordings involve mainly the formal</p> <p>and informal conversations of educated speakers of NE at different social</p> <p>events, conferences and seminars, and students’ conversation as well as the</p> <p>conversations of less educated NE speakers. The informal recordings reflect</p> <p>different settings, sexes, ages, and ethnic and educational backgrounds. Some of</p> <p>the data used in this work are also drawn from radio and television discussions.</p> <p>I have adopted some of the categories of syntactic variation in WAE identified</p> <p>by Bamiro, which are commonly found in NE. They include: reduplication,</p> <p>subjectless sentences, substitution of preposition in idiomatic usage, and use of</p> <p>double subjects. I have supplemented these categories with such new ones as</p> <p>the use of verbless sentences, Pidgin-influenced structures, and structures influenced</p> <p>by the use of discourse particles. Although many of the processes of syntactic</p> <p>innovation discussed in this paper may occur in other varieties of WAE or</p> <p>new Englishes, the sources of their influence and patterns of their use may be</p> <p>different. It is also important to note that some of these syntactic categories are</p> <p>very important features of creation in the style of many Nigerian and West African</p> <p>writers (as Bamiro has shown) and are regularly founded in Nigerian newspapers</p> <p>and magazines. In other words, they are not only restricted to colloquial</p> <p>contexts. Their uses also cut across different levels of education.</p> <p>I have carefully presented features which are found in both the basilectal and</p> <p>acrolectal varieties of NE. I have identified the variety of NE in which a particular</p> <p>feature is dominant. British English (BE) equivalents to the examples are</p> <p>provided in parenthesis after each example.</p> <p>English in Nigeria presents interesting problems because even the acrolectal</p> <p>variety is caught between the Standard BE norms and basilectal pidgin. This</p> <p>complex situation inevitably tolerates influences from Nigerian languages (as</p> <p>Syntactic innovation processes ... 397</p> <p>with the case of discourse particles and reduplication) and Nigerian Pidgin (as</p> <p>with the case of Pidgin-influenced structures).</p> <p>3.1. Subjectless sentences</p> <p>There is a preponderant use of subjectless sentences in the speech of NE users.</p> <p>This practice involves the omission of the subject it in NE structures. Where</p> <p>this omission occurs in the speech of educated users of NE, it is largely influenced</p> <p>by the process of shortening in which the form It’s is reduced to Is, especially</p> <p>in spoken English. Where it occurs in the speech of less educated users of</p> <p>NE, it may be as a result of the influence of Nigerian Pidgin (NP) in which na is</p> <p>transferred as is into NE structures. Consider the following examples:</p> <p>a) Is very far (‘It’s very far’).</p> <p>b) Is about three hours or more (‘It’s about three hours or more’).</p> <p>c) Is about ten dollars (‘It’s about ten dollars’).</p> <p>d) Is the woman (‘It’s the woman’).</p> <p>Although subjectless sentences may not be found in the written form of the</p> <p>acrolectal variety, it does exist in the written form of the basilectal variety.</p> <p>3.2. Reduplication</p> <p>Although reduplication has been treated by Bobda (1994) and Igboanusi (1998)</p> <p>as lexical process of innovation, Kachru (1982) has noted that the reduplication</p> <p>of items belongs to various word classes. For instance, some English words are</p> <p>often reduplicated or repeated consecutively, either for emphasis, pluralisation,</p> <p>or to create new meanings. Bobda (1994: 258) has rightly identified three categories</p> <p>of words, which generally undergo the process of reduplication: numerals,</p> <p>intensifiers and quantifiers. And as Igboanusi (2002b) has observed, while</p> <p>the occurrence of a second numeral denotes ‘each’ (as in one-one, half-half), the</p> <p>reduplication of an intensifier or a quantifier may be for emphasis (as in manymany,</p> <p>now-now, before-before, fast-fast, fine-fine, slowly-slowly) or for pluralisation</p> <p>(as in big-big, small-small). Examples are:</p> <p>a) Please drive slowly-slowly because the road is bad (‘Please drive very</p> <p>slowly because the road is bad’).</p> <p>b) Before-before, food was very cheap in this country (‘In the past, food was</p> <p>very cheap in this country’).</p> <p>c) Please get me two more bottles of beer fast-fast (‘Please get two bottles of</p> <p>beer for me very quickly’).</p> <p>398 H. Igboanusi</p> <p>d) I visited my friend’s campus and I saw many fine-fine girls (‘I visited my</p> <p>friend’s campus and I saw several fine girls’).</p> <p>e) Give me half-half bag of rice and beans (‘Give me half bag each of rice</p> <p>and beans’).</p> <p>f) We were asked to pay one-one hundred Naira as fine for contravening the</p> <p>environmental sanitation law (‘We were asked to pay one hundred Naira</p> <p>each as fine for contravening the environmental sanitation law’).</p> <p>g) Do you have small-small beans? (‘Do you have small brand of beans?’).</p> <p>h) You put it small small (‘It is put little by little’).</p> <p>i) I have small small children in the house (‘I have young children in the</p> <p>house’).</p> <p>j) He claims not to have money and yet he’s busy building big-big houses all</p> <p>over the city (‘He claims not to have money and yet he’s busy building</p> <p>several big houses all over the city’).</p> <p>k) Many many speak English (‘The majority of the people speak English’).</p> <p>l) He visits me at three three weeks interval (‘He visits me at three week</p> <p>intervals’).</p> <p>m) Me I was running running (‘I was busy running’).</p> <p>n) They went inside inside (‘They went to the interior part’).</p> <p>o) Those are simple simple jobs to do (‘Those are very simple jobs to do’).</p> <p>p) They live one one or two two (‘They live one or two to a room’).</p> <p>Reduplication is mostly used in NE in colloquial contexts. And in the contexts</p> <p>exemplified above, the reduplicatives small-small, fine-fine, one-one, fast-fast,</p> <p>simple-simple, three-three and big-big are often heard in the speeches of educated</p> <p>NE users. In general, reduplicatives are more commonly used by the less</p> <p>educated speakers of NE than by educated speakers. The occurrence of reduplicatives</p> <p>in NE stems from the influence of Nigerian languages and Pidgin.</p> <p>3.3. Double subjects</p> <p>The use of double subjects is another syntactic feature of NE. This process,</p> <p>which is adopted to emphasize the subject, may involve the use of double pronouns</p> <p>(e.g. this your/my, Me I) or the pronoun + a modifier/qualifier (e.g. we</p> <p>children, we the poor).</p> <p>a) Me I don’t have money (‘I don’t have money’).</p> <p>b) Me I don’t know anything about the journey (‘I don’t know anything about</p> <p>the journey’).</p> <p>c) This your friend is not reliable (‘Your friend is not reliable’ OR ‘This</p> <p>friend of yours is not reliable’).</p> <p>Syntactic innovation processes ... 399</p> <p>d) This your regime is the worst we have witnessed in recent time (‘Your</p> <p>regime is the worst we have witnessed in recent time’ OR ‘This regime of</p> <p>yours is the worst we have witnessed in recent time’).</p> <p>e) We children were sent to go and play (‘We were sent to go and play’ OR</p> <p>‘Those of us who were young were sent out to go and play’).</p> <p>f) We the poor are always cheated in this country (‘We are always cheated in</p> <p>this country’ OR ‘Those of us who are poor are always cheated in this</p> <p>country’).</p> <p>The use of double subjects in constructions reflects the colloquial contexts of</p> <p>some of Nigeria’s indigenous languages (e.g. Igbo and Yoruba) and Nigerian</p> <p>Pidgin. Its colloquialism lies with the use of redundancy to achieve emphasis.</p> <p>Note the use of double pronouns as subjects in examples (a) to (d) and the use</p> <p>of pronoun + a modifier/qualifier in examples (e) and (f). The structures exemplified</p> <p>in (3.3.) are found in the speech of both educated and less educated users.</p> <p>Although the use of double subjects resembles the use of topicalisation,</p> <p>which is commonly used in British English (e.g. John Coker, he’s to blame), the</p> <p>two processes are different since the pronoun in topicalisation is in apposition to</p> <p>the noun.</p> <p>3.4. Pidgin-influenced structures</p> <p>The strong influence of Pidgin English brings forth several NE structures. Let’s</p> <p>examine the following samples:</p> <p>a) We work farm (‘We are farmers’ or ‘We work on a farm’).</p> <p>b) I have maize, yam, finish (‘I have maize and yam; that is it’).</p> <p>c) I continue working at farm, finish (‘I continue to work at the farm; that is it’).</p> <p>d) We sat down, finish (‘We sat down; that was it’).</p> <p>e) We stayed together, ate, finish (‘We stayed together and ate; that was it’).</p> <p>f) The Muslims are plenty than the Christians (‘The Muslims are more than</p> <p>the Christians’).</p> <p>g) I don’t know book (‘I’m not brilliant’).</p> <p>h) If rice is done you keep it (‘Bring down the rice from fire when it is well</p> <p>cooked’).</p> <p>Note the deletion of preposition and determiner in (a), the emphatic use of finish</p> <p>as a discourse marker in (b), (c), (d) and (e), the use of plenty as a comparative</p> <p>item in (f), translation equivalent in (g), and (h).</p> <p>400 H. Igboanusi</p> <p>3.5. Structures with discourse particles</p> <p>Several English structures exist in NE with discourse particles, which derive</p> <p>either from the influence of NP or the indigenous language. Discourse particles</p> <p>are frequently used in conversation. Consider the following examples:</p> <p>a) You know Kemi now! (‘You should know Kemi’).</p> <p>b) I live in Port Harcourt now! (‘You should know that I live in Port Harcourt’).</p> <p>c) Wait now! (‘Please wait’).</p> <p>d) Tomorrow is your birthday, abi? (‘Tomorrow is your birthday. Isn’t it?’).</p> <p>e) Shebi it was you I gave some money yesterday (‘I think it was you I gave</p> <p>some money yesterday’)</p> <p>f) I won’t be there o (‘I will not be there’).</p> <p>g) I’m tired of this life self (‘I’m even tired of this life’).</p> <p>h) You’ll be here tomorrow, ko? (‘You’ll be here tomorrow, won’t you?’).</p> <p>i) You disobeyed me and still went ahead to fight those people, ba? (‘You</p> <p>disobeyed me and still went ahead to fight those people, didn’t you?’).</p> <p>j) So, it is now confirmed that you were the one who initiated that move</p> <p>against me; kai, I’m disappointed (‘So, it is now confirmed that you were</p> <p>the one who initiated that move against me; I’m really disappointed’).</p> <p>k) Haba! You should have told me before taking my money (‘What! You</p> <p>should have told me before taking my money’).</p> <p>l) Sha me, I have said what I wanted to say (‘As for me, I have said all I have</p> <p>to say’).</p> <p>m) I don’t know him sha (‘Anyway, I don’t know him’).</p> <p>n) I have heard you, to! (‘OK, I have heard you’).</p> <p>o) You’re the one that stole my money, to! (‘You’re the one that stole my</p> <p>money, right!’).</p> <p>p) I will deal with that man, wallahi (‘By God, I will deal with that man’).</p> <p>q) Yauwa! I have seen what I’m looking for (‘I’m satisfied that I have seen</p> <p>what I’m looking for’).</p> <p>While 3.5 (a), (b), (c), (f) and (g) have pidgin as their source language, (d), (e),</p> <p>(l) and (m) have Yoruba as their source language. The examples in (h), (i), (j),</p> <p>(k), (n), (o), (p) and (q) are derived from Hausa and/or Fula. All the examples</p> <p>are regularly found in NE-based conversations. In (a), (b) and (c), the discourse</p> <p>particle now is used to emphasize the point that what is referred to is not unfamiliar</p> <p>to the listener. In (d), the interjection abi is used as a discourse strategy to</p> <p>confirm a piece of information. It may be equivalent to ‘Isn’t it?’ Like now, the</p> <p>particle o in (f) is usually found in sentence-final position and gives emphasis to</p> <p>Syntactic innovation processes ... 401</p> <p>the entire sentence. In addition, o signals the emotional involvement of the</p> <p>speaker. Both ko in (h) and ba in (i) are interrogative markers. Kai and haba</p> <p>express surprise. Shebi is a rhetorical question marker while yauwa expresses</p> <p>feeling of satisfaction. Both sha and to are used to affirm a statement whereas</p> <p>wallahi is equivalent to ‘honestly’ or ‘By God’. All the discourse particles discussed</p> <p>above are only used colloquially. Discourse particles are veritable</p> <p>sources of syntactic innovation processes in NE. The structures in (3.5.) can</p> <p>occur in the conversations of both educated and less educated speakers of NE.</p> <p>Although discourse particles are not originally English items, they are innovative</p> <p>in creating NE structures.</p> <p>3.6. Verbless sentences</p> <p>Some verbless sentences exist in the discourse of NE speakers. In conversations</p> <p>or exchange of pleasantries, one notices the frequent occurrence of the following</p> <p>verbless sentences:</p> <p>a) How? (‘How are you?’)</p> <p>b) How now? (‘How are you?’)</p> <p>c) How things? (‘How are things?’)</p> <p>d) How work? (‘How is work?’)</p> <p>e) How family? (‘How is your family?’)</p> <p>f) How life? (‘How is life with you?’)</p> <p>g) How body? (‘How is your body?’)</p> <p>h) How market (‘How is business?’)</p> <p>It may be argued that the deep structure of the verbless sentences in 3.6. may</p> <p>not be really verbless but the result of a phonological rule in which single consonants</p> <p>(in this case, [z]) are deleted between word boundaries. But at the surface</p> <p>structure, they remain verbless. Although such verbless sentences are more</p> <p>frequently found in the conversation of the less educated speakers of NE, they</p> <p>also occur in the conversations of educated users of NE as a means of expressing</p> <p>intimacy.</p> <p>3.7. Substitution</p> <p>Some instances of substitution, which involve the use of English idioms, have</p> <p>been identified as processes of syntactic creation in NE. In all the examples</p> <p>listed below, NE structures are used to replace BE idioms:</p> <p>a) They are two sides of the coin (‘They are two sides of one coin’).</p> <p>402 H. Igboanusi</p> <p>b) He did the work on his own accord (‘He did the work of his own accord’).</p> <p>c) I am not surprised that Chike and Andrew are such close friends; they are</p> <p>birds of the same feather (‘I am not surprised that Chike and Andrew are</p> <p>such close friends; they are birds of a feather’).</p> <p>d) Dipo, I can’t believe that you’re now biting the finger that fed you (‘Dipo, I</p> <p>can’t believe that you’re now biting the hand that fed you’).</p> <p>e) The football match is going to be a child’s play (‘The football match is</p> <p>going to be child’s play’).</p> <p>f) I have been busy since morning cracking my brain over that question (‘I</p> <p>have been busy since morning racking my brain over that question’).</p> <p>g) You should not take the law into your hands (‘You should not take the law</p> <p>into your own hands’).</p> <p>h) By no stretch of imagination could anyone trust him (‘By no stretch of the</p> <p>imagination could anyone trust him’).</p> <p>i) And last but not the least is the perennial water problem in this state (‘And</p> <p>last but not least is the perennial water problem in this state’).</p> <p>j) He often shouts on top of his voice (‘He often shouts at the top of his</p> <p>voice’).</p> <p>As a syntactic process, the substitution of idiomatic usage involves three strategies</p> <p>– omission, replacement and insertion. While examples (a), (g) and (h)</p> <p>involve omission of some functional words, examples (e) and (i) concern the</p> <p>insertion of articles. In the same vein, examples (b), (c), (d), (f) and (j) adopt the</p> <p>process of replacement of some words.</p> <p>4. Conclusion</p> <p>What the data on syntactic innovation processes in NE shows is the evidence of</p> <p>some aspects of the nativisation of English as a result of the contact of English</p> <p>and indigenous languages and Pidgin. There is also evidence of some influence</p> <p>of the pragmatic use of English in the Nigerian environment. It is true that some</p> <p>features of NE syntax discussed in this paper are shared by other varieties of</p> <p>WAE in particular and other varieties of English elsewhere. This trend suggests</p> <p>a healthy development for the character of new Englishes worldwide. The</p> <p>pedagogical implication of these processes relates to acceptability. Once the</p> <p>“acceptability factor” (Bamgbose 1998: 4) is guaranteed, that is, when innovations</p> <p>become accepted by speakers, the next process will be to codify the new</p> <p>norms in the form of variety-specific grammars and the common grammar of</p> <p>new Englishes. To further aid the codification of these various grammars, there</p> <p>is a great need for comparative studies of the syntax of New Englishes.</p> <p>Syntactic innovation processes ... 403</p> <p>REFERENCES</p> <p>Allerton, D.J. – Paul Skandera – Cornelia Tschichold (eds.)</p> <p>2002 Perspectives on English as a world language.

Although there exist relationships between grammatical theories and linguistic theories in their attitudes towards language, their goals, and their methods, they are both independent of and interacting with each other.</em></p> <p><strong>1.0 Introduction</strong></p> <p>At its most fundamental level, a theory is a set of statements about natural phenomena that explains why theses phenomenons occur the way they do. In sciences, theories are used in what Kuhn calls the job of “puzzle solving”. By this Kuhn means that the scientists look at observable phenomena as puzzles or questions to be solved. In short, the first duty of a theory is to account for or expalin observed phenomena. This paper will examine linguistic and grammatical theories in order to indicate the differences between them.</p> <p><strong>2.0 linguistic Theory</strong></p> <p>Linguistic theory is the scientific study of language, and involves an analysis of language form, language meaning, and language context. Linguists traditionally analyze human language by observing an interplay between sound and meaning. Over the last fifty years, several theories have been put forward to explain the process by which children learn to understand and speak a language. They can be summarized as follows:</p> <p><strong>2.1 The Theory of Innateness</strong></p> <p>The Innate theory (also known as Innatist theory, Nativist Theory, Mentalist Theory) of language acquisition was developed in the mid-20th century (1959) by the renowned American linguist Noam Chomsky. It emerged as a reaction against the Behaviourist theory, and contradicted its model at almost every point of basic structure. Chomsky focused particularly on the impoverished language input children receive. Chomsky concluded that children must have inborn faculty for language acquisition. According to this theory, the process is biologically determined- the human species has evolved a brain whose neural circuits contain linguistic information at birth. The child’s natural predisposition to learn language is triggered by hearing speech and the child’s brain is able to interpret what he or she hears according to the underlying principles or structure it already contains. This natural faculty has become known as the Language Acquisition Device (LAD). Chomsky did not suggest that an English child is born knowing anything specific about English, of course. He stated that all human languages share common principles, for example, they all have words for things and actions - nouns and verbs. It is the child’s task to establish how the specific language she or he expresses have these underlying principles.</p> <p>For example, the LAD already contains the concept of verb. By listening to such forms as “worked”, “played” and “patted”, the child will form the hypothesis that the past tense of verbs is formed by adding the sound /d/, /t/ or /id/ to the base form. It hardly needs saying that the process is unconscious. Chomsky does not envisage the small child lying in its cot working out grammatical rules consciously.</p> <p>The theoretical assumptions underlying the innate theory are as follows:</p> <p>l  Language acquisition is innately determined; that is, children are biologically programmed for language learning. They develop language in the same way as other biological functions. They start to speak at roughly the same age and proceed through roughly the same stages.</p> <p>l  Children are born with a special ability to systematically discover for themselves the underlying rules of a language system. This special ability enables them to learn the complexities of language in a relatively short period of time.</p> <p>l  Environmental differences may be associated with some variation in the rate of language acquisition.</p> <p>Limitations of Theory of Innateness</p> <p>Although this theory provides what some claim is a reasonable explanation about acquiring language, this theory lacks sufficient evidence. Some of the cases against this theory include:</p> <p>l  Firstly, the Language Acquisition Device is an abstract concept and lacks adequate scientific support.</p> <p>l  Secondly, the theory is heavily based on the learner’s linguistic competence which is again abstract phenomenon.</p> <p>l  Thirdly, the theory placed more emphasis on the linguistic competence of adult native speakers, but not enough on the developmental aspects of language acquisition.</p> <p><strong>2.2 The Behaviorist Theory</strong></p> <p>Behaviorist theory, which is basically a psychological theory in its essence, founded by J.B. Watson, is actually a theory of native language learning, advanced in part as a reaction to traditional grammar. the supporters of this theory are Leonard Bloomfield, O.N. Mower, B.F. Skinner, and A.W. Staats. The major principle of the behaviorist theory rests on the analyses of human behavior in observable stimulus-response interaction and the association between them. According to Wilga, “the behaviorist theory of stimulus-response learning, particularly as developed in the operant conditioning model of Skinner,considers all learning to be the establishment of habits as a result of reinforcement and reward”(73). According to this category, babies obtain native language habits via varied babblings which resemble the appropriate words repeated by a person or object near him. Since for his babblings and mutterings he is rewarded, this very reward reinforces further articulations of the same sort into grouping of syllables and words in a similar situation. </p> <p>Basic Tenets of Behaviorist Theory</p> <p>The following principles illustrate the operating principles of behaviorism:</p> <p>l  Behaviorist theory dwells on spoken language. That is, primary medium of language is oral: speech is language because there are many languages without written forms, because we learn to speak before we learn to read and write. Then, language is primarily what is spoken and secondarily what is written.</p> <p>l  Behaviorist theory is the habit formation theory of language teaching and learning, reminding us the learning of structural grammar. Language learning concerns us by “not problem-solving but the information and performance of habits” (Nelson 46). In other words language learning is a mechanical process leading the learners to habit formation whose underlying scheme is the conditioned reflex.     </p> <p>l  The stimulus-response chain is a pure case of conditioning. Behaviorist learning theory “emphasizes conditioning and building form the simplest conditioned responses to more and more complex behaviors” (David 19-20). This comes to mean that clauses and sentences are learned linearly as longer and longer stimulus-response chains, produced in a left-to right series of sequence like S1 to S2 to S3..., as probabilistic incidents, which are basically Markov’s processes. Each stimulus is thus the caser of a response, and each response becomes the initiator of a stimulus, and this process goes on and on in this way.</p> <p>l  All learning is the establishment of habits as the result of reinforcement and reward. Positive reinforcements is reward while negative reinforcement is punishment. In a stimulus situation, a response is exerted, and if the response is positively augmented by a reward, then the association between the stimulus and response is itself reinforced and thus the response will very likely be manipulated by every appearance of stimulus. The result will yield conditioning. When responses are coherently reinforced, then habit formation is established. It is because of this fact that this termed habit-formation-by-reinforcement theory.</p> <p>l  The learning, due to its socially-conditioned nature, can be the same for each individual. In other words, each person can learn equally if the conditions in which the learning takes place are teh same for each person.</p> <p>Limitations of Behaviorist Theory</p> <p>l  Language is based on a set of structures or rules, which could not be worked out simply by imitating individual utterances. The mistakes made by children reveal that they are not simply imitating but actively working out and applying rules. For example, a child who says “drinked” instead of “drank” is not copying an adult but rather over applying a rule. The child has discovered that past tense verbs are formed by adding a /d/ or /t/ sound to the base form. The “mistakes” occur because there are irregular verbs which do not behave in this way. Such forms are often referred to as intelligent mistakes or virtuous errors. </p> <p>l  It is highly unlikely for learning to be the same for each individual; that is, each person cannot learn equally well in the same conditions in which learning takes place, for the background and the experience of the learners make everybody learn differently. In addition, according to Chomsky, there must be some innate capacities which human beings possess that predipose them to look for basic patterns in language.</p> <p>l  Children are often unable to repeat what an adult says, especially if the adult utterance contain a structure the child has not yet started to use.</p> <p>l  Many of the learning processes are mostly too complex, and for this reason there are intervening variables, which cannot be observed between stimulus and response. Language acquisition cannot take place through habit formation, since language learners are thrown between stimulus and response chain, for language is too far complicated to be learned in such a matter, especially given the brief time available.   </p> <p><strong>2.3</strong> <strong>Cognitive Theory</strong></p> <p>This theory was proposed by Jean Piaget in 1936. Theory of cognitive development explains how a child constructs a mental model of the world. He disagreed with the idea that intelligence was a fixed trait, and regarded cognitive development as a process which occurs due to biological maturation and interaction with the environment. To Piaget, cognitive development was a progressive reorganization of mental processes as a result of biological maturation and environmental experience. Children construct an understanding of the world around them, then experience discrepancies between what they already know and what they discover in their environment.</p> <p>Basic Components</p> <p>1. Schemas</p> <p>Piaget defined a schema as ‘a cohesive, repeatable action sequence possessing component actions that are tightly interconnected and governed by a core meaning’. A schema can be defined as set of linked mental representations of the world, which we use both to understand and to respond to situations. The assumption is that we store these mental representations and apply them when needed. Piaget’s development of a person’s mental processes refer to increases in the number and complexity of the schemata that a person had learned. When a child’s existing schemas are capable of explaining what it can perceive around it, it is said to be a state of equilibrium, i.e a state of mental balance.</p> <p>2. Adaption Processes</p> <p>Jean Piaget views intellectual growth as a process of adaptation to the world. This happens through:</p> <p>l  Assimilation: this is using an existing schema to deal with a new object or situation.</p> <p>l  Accommodation: this happens when the existing schema (knowledge) does not work, and needs to be changed to deal with a new object or situation.</p> <p>l  Equilibration: this is the force, which moves development along. Piaget believed that cognitive deveolopment did not progress at a steady rate, but rather in leaps and bounds. Eqilibrium occurs when a child’s schemas can deal with most new information through assimilation. However, an unpleasant state of disquilibrium occurs when new information cannot be fitted into existing schemas (assimilation). Equilibrium is the force which drives the learning process as we do not like to be frustrated and will seek to restore balance by mastering the new challenge (accommodation).</p> <p>3. Stages of Development</p> <p>Piaget proposed four stages of cognitive development which reflect the increasing sophistication of children’s thought:</p> <p>l  Sensorimotor stage (birth to age 2). The main achievement during this stage is object permanence- knowing that an object still exists, even if it is hidden.</p> <p>l  Pre-operational stage (from age 2 to age 7). During this stage, young children are able to think about things symbolically. This is the ability to make one thing- a word or an object- stand for something other than itself.</p> <p>l  Concrete operational stage (from age 7 to age 11). This marks the beginning of logical or operational thought as the child can work things out internally in their head(rather than physically try things out in the real world).</p> <p>l  Formal operational stage (age 11+ to adolescence and adulthood). During this time, people develop the ability to think about abstract concepts, and logically test hypothesis.</p> <p>Each child goes through the stages in the same order and the child development is determined by biological maturation and interaction with the environment. Although no stage can be missed out, there are individual differences in the rate at which children progress through stages, and some individuals may never attain the later stages. Piaget did not claim that a particular stage was reached at a certain age- although descriptions of the stages often include an indication of the age at which the average child would reach each stage.</p> <p>Criticism of Cognitive Theory</p> <p>l  Piaget concentrated on the universal stages of cognitive development and biological maturation but failed to consider the effect that the social setting and culture may have on cognitive and development.</p> <p>l  Piaget’s methods (observation and clinical interviews) are more open to biased interpretation than other methods. Piaget made careful, detailed naturalistic observations of children, and from these he wrote diary descriptions charting their development. He also used clinical interviews and observations of older children who were able to understand questions and hold conversations. Because Piaget conducted  the observations alone, the data collected are based on his own subjective interpretation of events.</p> <p>l  As several studies have shown Piaget underestimated the abilities of children because his tests were sometimes confusing or difficult to understand. Piaget failed to distinguish between competence( what a child is capable of doing) and performance (what a child can show when given a particular task).</p> <p><strong>2.4 Input or Interactionist Theory</strong></p> <p>In contrast to the work of Chomsky, more recent theorists have stressed the importance of the language input children receive from their care-givers. Language existing for the purpose of communication and can only be learned in the context of interaction with people who want to communicate with you. Interactionists such as Jerome Bruner suggest that the language behaviour of adults when talking to children (known by several names by most easily referred to as child-directed speech or CDS) is specially adapted to support the acquisition process. This support is often described to as scaffolding for the child’s language learning. Bruner also coined the term Language Acquisition Support System or LASS in response to Chomsky’s LAD. Colwyn Trevarthen studied the interaction between parents and babies who developed through games and non-verbal communication long before actual words are uttered.</p> <p>Limitations of Input Theory</p> <p>This theory serve as a useful corrective to Chomsky’s early position and it seems likely that a child will learn more quickly with frequent interaction. However, it has already been noted that children in all cultures pass through the same stages in acquiring language. We have also seen that there are cultures in which adults do not adopt special ways of talking to children, so CDS may be useful but seems not to be essential.</p> <p><strong>3.0 The Concept of Grammatical Theories</strong></p> <p>Grammatical theory is a system of rules which governs the production and use of utterances in a given language. These rules apply to sound as well as meaning, and include componential sub-sets, such as those pertaining to phonology, morphology and syntax. The following are the earliest theories of grammar: Traditional Grammar, Structural Grammar, Transformational Grammar /Transformational Generative Grammar and Systemic Functional Grammar. Over the years, new trends have come to be in the development of grammatical theories such as The Theory of Markedness, Principles and Parameters, Government and Binding, Chomsky’s Minimalist Program, Tagmemics, Stratification Grammar, etc. Inspite of the new modifications to grammar, the new trends are closely related to the four orthodox theories and they will be discussed one after the other.</p> <p><strong>3.1</strong> <strong>Traditional Grammar</strong> </p> <p>Traditional grammar refers to the type of grammar study, done prior to the beginning of modern linguistics. Grammar in this traditional sense is the study of structure and formation of words and sentences, usually without reference to sound and meaning. In modern linguistics sense, grammar is the study of the entire interrelated system of structures- sounds, words, meanings, and sentences within a language. It reflects the prescriptive view that one dialect or variety of a language is to be valued more highly than others and should be the norm of all speakers of the language. It include prescriptive rules that are to be followed and prescriptive rules of usage to be avoided. “When describing an emotion, use of an English word descended from Latin is preferred over an Anglo-saxon word” is an example of a prescriptive rule, and “Never split an infinitive” is an example of prescriptive rule of usage to be avoided. </p> <p>2. <strong>Structural Grammar</strong></p> <p>This grammar is concerned with how elements of a sentence such as morphemes, phonology, clauses, phrases and parts of speech are put together. Structural Grammar deals with how these elements work together to have greater meaning than any of the single elements. S.G. Assumes that what is seen on the surface is also straight forward meaning behind the words of a sentence. It is accepted literally on the surface level and no attempt to identify the implied meanings made.</p> <p>       Structural Grammar grows from Sausurre’s work in ‘<em>langue versus parole’ and </em>diachronic language versus synchronic expressions of ‘<em>parole’ </em>in order to find the abstract diachronic universalities of ‘langue’. It is also characterized by the procedures known as substitution; by which word class membership is established and through which smaller structures are expanded to larger ones.</p> <p>E.g. The boy is crying →  NP/ VP</p> <p>3. <strong>Transformational Grammar</strong></p> <p>This grammar is also known as Transformational Generative Grammar. This is a system of language analysis that recognizes the relationship among various elements of sentences and among the possible sentences of a language and uses processes or rules (some of which are transfromations) to express these relationship. The most widely discussed theory of Transformational Grammar was proposed by U.S. Linguist Noam Chomsky in 1957. His work contradicted earlier tenets of structuralism by rejecting the notion that every language is unique.</p> <p>       For example, Transformational Grammar relates the active sentence “Kate read the book” with its corresponding passive, “The book was read by Kate”. The statement “Steven saw Mary” is related to the corresponding questions, “whom [or who] did Steven see? And who saw Mary?. These active and passive sentences appear to be very different on the surface (i.e in such things as word order). Transformational Grammar tries to show that in the ‘underlying structure’ (i.e in their deeper relations to one another), the sentences are very similar.</p> <p>   T.G is achieved through the following:</p> <p>u  Movement: can be described as the major syntactic process in transformation. Items are moved from its original site or extraction site to landing site. For example,</p> <p>a)        The student entered the class <em>quickly.</em>  (Sentence)</p> <p>b)        The student <em>quickly </em>entered the class   (Movement)</p> <p>u  Insertion : it is a linguistic operation by which an element is attached to its original from in a sentence. For example,</p> <p>a)        The girl ate the apple. (Active)</p> <p>b)        The apple was eaten by the girl. (Passive)</p> <p>u  Deletion: in the passive deletion transformation, Chomsky argued that all we need do is delete the semantic object that is found in the sentence. For example,</p> <p>a)        The apple was eaten by the girl. (Passive)</p> <p>b)        The apple was eaten.</p> <p>u  Substitution: an element is replaced by another one which performs the same function as the former. For example,</p> <p>a)        The girl ate [ the apple]</p> <p>b)        The girl ate [it]</p> <p>4. <strong>Systemic Functional Grammar</strong></p> <p>This is a grammar that is based on the view that language is a system of making meaning. <em>Systemic</em> refers to the fact that when we use language language, we make choices from sets of available options. <em>Functional</em> assumes that every time we make a choice for the available options, we are doing so in order to fulfill a communicative purpose. <em>Grammar</em> refers to the fact that there is an overall organization to all of these options. </p> <p>     Structural Functional Grammar  originated from the work of Micheal Halliday. It has helped teachers and learners work with whole stretches of language in order to develop their potential to communicate in the target language. This is made possible by the linguist theory underpinning S.F.G, known as Systemic Functional Grammar. (Halliday and Mathiessen) also pays great attention to how the speaker generate utterances to convey their intended meaning.</p> <p>The </p> <p><strong>4.0 Differences Between Linguistic Theories and Grammatical Theories</strong></p> <p>Grammatical theories are set of rules that describe how one specific language delivers a message via text, and also prescribe how a message must be delivered if you want it to be understood correctly while linguistic theories study language (not just one langauge) in a broader aspect: how language develop, where they come from, how they are interconnected, where they are used (everyday speech, literature, art, translation, specific fields) how they are produced in human mind, how they can be deconstructed and their principles understood to create artificial languages, what role they play and what effect they have on people, their lives and behaviour, etc.</p> <p>Linguistic theory is descriptive (to describe the way people speak), whilst grammatical theory like traditional grammar is prescriptive (to prescribe the way people speak, or simply, to tell people how to speak and let people know the correct way of their speaking).</p> <p>Grammatical theory has majorly been restricted to mainly syntax, that is, the way of words making patterns to form sentences, while linguistic theory has a broader scope for researching, e.g. Pragmatics, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, etc. Which, accordingly, are out of the scope of grammatical theories.</p> <p>Grammatical theories teaches a language while linguistic theories explains the nature of a language.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p> <p>This paper looked at the difference between linguistic and grammatical theories. In summary, linguistic theories and grammatical theories are two independent fields which are also interacting with each other in many respects.</p> <p>Works Cited</p> <p>Brooks, N. <em>Language and language learning</em>.

The term is often used for civil strife, sedition rebellion properly so called, or even for the undertaking of a state to put down by force an organized bodies of outlaws.</p> <p>        The continent of Africa has been highly susceptible to intra and inter-state wars and conflicts. This has prompted the insinuations that Africa is the home of wars and instability, most pathetic about this conflagrations is that they have defied any meaningful solution and their negative impacts have retarded growth and development in Africa while an end to them seems obscure. What then are the causes of this unending wars in Africa? How far have they impacted our younger generation and how far have they weakened cohesion, unity and potential development of the African continent?</p> <p>         The history of Africa as a continent “is replete with conflict” (Alabi, 2006: 41) one may even assert that the major current that runs through Africa from North to South, East to West and central is conflict and wars. Since the 196o’s, series of civil wars had taken place in Africa. Examples include; Sudan (1990-1995), Chad (1965-85), Angola since( 1974), Liberia (1980-2003), Nigeria (1967-1970), Somalia (1993-1999) and Burundi, Rwanda and Sierra Leone (1991-2001).</p> <p>        But apart from civil wars Africa has also witnessed a number of intermittent border and inter-state conflicts notable among which are the following:</p> <p>              I.            Nigeria-Cameroon dispute over Bakassi Peninsula since the 1970s</p> <p>           II.            Algeria-Morocco conflict over the Atlas, Mountain area in October 1963</p> <p>        III.            Eritrea-Ethiopian crisis between 1962 and 1979</p> <p>        IV.            Somalia-Ethiopia dispute of  1964 to 1978 over the Ugandan desert regions</p> <p>           V.            Chad-Libya crisis of 1980- 1982</p> <p>        VI.            Kenya-Somalia Border war 0f 1963-1967 in which Somalia aimed at recovering its lost territories including the northern frontier district of Kenya.</p> <p>     VII.            Tanzania-Uganda crisis in 1978-79. (Barkindo et al, 1994: 279-321) </p> <p><strong>Current wars in the African continent Include;</strong></p> <p>Ø  The Boko Haram Insurgency in Nigeria (2009- present) The Islamic fundamentalist group Boko Haram is waging a war against the Nigerian government and against the Christian Community in Nigeria.</p> <p>Ø  The Central African Republic War- (2012- present) Rebels seized several major cities and towns as they advanced on the capital city of Banjul in December, 2012</p> <p>Ø  Burundi coup attempt(May, 2015) An attempt to overthrown the Incumbent president of Burundi, Pierre Nkwrunziza, ended in failed coup and confusion as to whether or not the Military Mutineers had foreign backing.</p> <p>Ø  Congo wars (1998- present) Beginning in 1998, Congo (Kinshasha) has been wracked with civil war rebellions, presidential assassinations and foreign intervention and invasions to mention but a few.</p> <p><strong>Causes of wars and conflict</strong>.</p> <p>     Conflicts in Africa may be said to have been caused by a multiplicity of factors such as: arbitrary borders created by the colonial powers, heterogeneous ethnic composition of African states, Inept political leadership, corruption, negative effect of external debt burden and poverty.</p> <p><strong>Types ofwar</strong></p> <p><strong>1.      </strong><strong>Hegemonic War.</strong></p> <p>  As defined by Ezine articles, is a war over control of the entire world order. The rules of the international system as a whole, including the roles of world hegemony. This class of war is also known as global war, World war, General war or systematic war.</p> <p><strong>2.      </strong><strong>Total war.</strong></p> <p>    A warfare by one state waged to conquer and occupy another. The goal is to reach the capital city and force the surrender of the government, which can then be replaced with one of the victors choosing. In total war, the entire society of the enemy is considered a legitimate target.</p> <p><strong>3.      </strong><strong>Limited war.</strong></p> <p>Includes military actions carried out to gain some objective short of the surrender and occupation of the enemy. E.g. the US led war against Iraq in 1991 retook the territory of Kuwait but did not go on to Baghdad to topple Saddam Hussain’s Government.</p> <p><strong>4.      </strong><strong>Civil war.</strong></p> <p>    This refers to war between factions within a state trying to create, or prevent, a new government for the entire state or some territorial part of it. The Nigerian Civil war 1967.</p> <p><strong>5.      </strong><strong>Guerrilla war.</strong></p> <p>Includes certain kinds of civil wars. It’s a warfare without front lines. Irregular forces operates in the midst of and often hidden or protected by civilian populations. The purpose is not to directly confront an enemy army but rather to arrest ant punish it so as to gradually limitits operation and effectively liberate territory from its control.</p> <p><strong>Teenager/ Adolescents and Children: Their Nature.</strong></p> <p>      A teenager, or teen, is a young person whose age falls within the range of thirteen to nineteen years. They are called teenagers because their age number ends with “teen”. Usage by ordinary people varies, and also varies in different societies. Most societies traditionally had a formal ceremony to mark the change from childhood to adulthood. A child (plural form is children) is a person who is not an adult yet, or who has not reached puberty.</p> <p><strong>Theoretical Framework.</strong></p> <p><strong>The Nigerian Civil war: A synopsis.</strong></p> <p> To place the present assignment in proper perspectives, a brief historical account of the events that produced the Nigerian Civil War is Germaine here. According to Emeyonu,“At the dawn of independence, achieved on a platter of gold in 1960, few years after this, it became apparent that things were not moving as they should, some well- meaning Nigerians started getting concerned as to where the country was drifting to. By 1966, there were prolonged political disturbances which eventually culminated in the military coup that claimed so many lives.”(155)</p> <p>The Northerners reacted violently and a counter coup followed in July 1966, in which many eastern political and military leaders were killed. It was this retaliatory coup that brought Yakubu Gowon (a Northerner) into power. For the Easterners, there was no security or assurance of protection of their lives and property outside their region, hence the desire to secede which gave rise to the birth of Biafra on 30th May, 1967. The federal government quickly decided to force them back to the federation and so war broke out on 6thJuly, 1967. It is against this background that the Nigerian Civil war broke out. To the ‘Biafrans’ it was a war of survival and to the federal government, a war to keep Nigeria one.</p> <p>          As often the case, creative writers make contemporary issues the subject of their writing Eddie Iroh is a postwar writer who in his two already published novels, <em>Forty eight Guns for the General</em> and<em>Toads of War</em>. Prose works as chukwuemeka Ike’s<em> Sunsetat Dawn</em>, Achebe’s <em>Girls at war</em>, IsidoreOkpe who’s <em>The Last Duty</em>, Festus Iyayi’s<em>Heroes</em> among others owe their thematic root to the Nigeria Civil War.</p> <p>           Eddie Iroh’s novel is preoccupied with presenting horrifying aspects of the War. The book is divided in three phases which are preceded with a prologue and end with an epilogue. His <em>Forty-eight Guns for The General</em> brings out the harrowing and horrifying incidents of the Nigerian Civil war as Nigeria and Biafra fought in four major cities of the former Eastern Region: Enugu, Port Harcourt, Calabar and Onitsha. In effect, he has shown that not only was life in each of these towns disrupted, but the destruction in human life and property was wanton. Both soldiers and civilians suffered untold hardships, deprivation, hunger and starvation. </p> <p>         In a war situation, many die of hunger neglect, heartbreak, constant air raids, bullet wounds and families are torn apart Cyprian Ekwensiin<em>Survive the Peace</em> comments on this horror. ElechiAmadi in <em>Sunset in Biafra</em> says as much, so also does Frederick Forsyth in <em>The Making of An African Legend.</em></p> <p>       Writers who either write to support the Biafra nation or the Nigeria nation project consciously or unconsciously one ironic conclusion and that is the real victims of the civil war were innocent and ordinary citizens most of whom did not know what the war was all about According to Emenyonu, ElechiAmadi’s<em>Sunset in Biafra</em> is</p> <p>                               “A personal account (autobiography) of Amadi’s experiences</p> <p>during the civil war. He was opposed to the Biafran session</p> <p>and therefore maintained a loyal stand to the Nigerian cause.</p> <p>                                He was tortured and harassed repeatedly by the Biafran Civilian</p> <p>and military leaderships and this hardened his stand against the</p> <p>Biafran position in the conflict (pg.172).”</p> <p>      Thus <em>Sunset in Biafra</em> is written with understandable bitterness. The book has seventeen chapters and the title of each chapter is a summary of the authors experience in a particular situation of event.</p> <p>        In the text,Amadi was moved from one detention camp to another until his area was ‘liberated’ by the federal troops and he rejoined the Nigeria Army actively for a while but even when he was not actively deployed in the army, he still remained loyal to the Nigerian cause until the end of the war.</p> <p>IsidoreOkpewho’s second novel <em>The Last Duty</em>(1976), his first being <em>The Victims</em> (1970). The novel was about the Biafra-Nigeria war which was characterized by violence, greed, fear and lust.</p> <p>Alabere in her review of <em>The Last Duty</em> says that:</p> <p>                                   The novel focuses on the casualties of war, how these</p> <p>                                   Circumstances, deprivations, the hardship, the zeal</p> <p>to survive, changed people is a summary of this book. (n.p web)</p> <p>The central characters are Aku, Wife of a man unjustly jailed for suspected pro rebel activities, Major Ali Idris a federal Commander assigned to protect the village and its citizens and Toja a selfish Local chief and rubber farmer who seeks to use the circumstances of war to his own advantage. Under the very intense pressure of war their behavior debases every moral virtue. The novelist uses dramatic monologue to capture their inner conflict that is a feature of the pressure that engulfs them.</p> <p>Emeyonu further comments on <em>The Last Duty</em>,Okpewho</p> <p>                           “Tries to show his readers other aspects of the war rather than</p> <p>the shooting aspect. In the face of fear, violence and corruption, </p> <p>there were individuals who still maintained their self-respect and</p> <p>conducted themselves according to the dictates of their conscience</p> <p>by doing what honor and fair play demanded”(157).</p> <p>     We can see this in Oshevire’sdefense at his trial on the allegation that he collaborated with the enemy.</p> <p>                            “MrOshivire, is it not safe for us to assume that the reason you</p> <p>                              Saved that boy had to do with your wife being herself a samba? . .</p> <p>                              I saw that boy as a minimum human being and that was my only</p> <p>Concern. I felt deeply moved to see human life in danger (pg. 20)</p> <p>            Most books on war are expected to deal with the physical casualties of war like devastation of farms and residence, mass killing of soldiers and civilian, missing children and rape. But this book deals with casualty that is insidious, invisible psychological wounds that is the effect of man’s inhumanity to man.\\</p> <p><strong>           The Impact of War on Teenagers and Children in NgoziOnyioha Orji’s <em>Teenager atWar</em>.</strong></p> <p>NgoziOnyioha-Orji who is gradually establishing a reputation for dealing with issues of child abuse through her novels hails from Nkoporo in Ohafia local government in Abia state. The Umuahia based author has three novels to her credit. Her debut novel, <em>Teenagerat War</em> was co-published with the Nigeria Education Research and Development Council (NERDC). Her second novel was <em>The Accused, The Condemned, The reprieved</em> and<em> TheKnots of Karma</em>.</p> <p><em>Teenager at War</em> was described by The Guardian Newspaper on the preface page of the text as a ‘heart rending tale which portrays the sordidness of War and how it seizes people’s sanity.</p> <p>AkachiEzeigbo describes the text as ‘Fresh and Lucid in language suffused with local colour. The image of war are evocative and arresting.” </p> <p><em>Teenager at War</em> is all about the horrors of war which was mostly experienced by innocent children and teenagers.</p> <p>Nkem and Chioma are Mr and MrsAgahs’s daughters who are in their teenage years. They attend a secondary school where they have friends of the same age grade. Nkem who is the narrator in this text, is the younger sister to Chioma, both of them equally have siblings Egbuna, Aki and the twins.</p> <p>      Their lives were normal until May 1967 when she celebrated her sixteen years birthday with her peers; Chibuzo and Celia who in turn ushered her into teenage hood, their parents were very protective and do not want them out of their sight until the unfortunate incidence of the Nigerian Civil war broke out. They were surrounded by trustworthy house helps, cook, steward, washer man, gardeners, drivers and house girls.</p> <p>Chioma started dating Louis who was eighteen years when the war started. During one of her numerous visits to Louis in the company of her sister Nkem, chidi was also introduced to Nkem. Chidi was also eighteen years old at that time he joined the war.</p> <p>      Both sisters gradually know the meaning of war when the invaders entered into Enugu where they live and go to school in 1967. The family was forced to leave Enugu to seek refuge at their Uncle’s house in Okigwe. At Okigwe they were not able to see friends and they became bored. Their mother does not like it with their uncle’s wife  because she always prove to be the senior wife over their mother. Enugu fell, and soon it was time to leave Okigwe the family moved to Umuahia.</p> <p>       Initially, Umuahia was boring until refugees from other towns where the invaders had conquered started populating the town. Mrs Agha, Nkem’s mother started operating a restaurant to keep her busy and provide food for the family to eat. The girls, Chioma and Nkem found jobs with the medical directorate and propaganda respectively. These jobs kept them busy and allowed them to pay visits to their friends, Louis and Chidi.</p> <p>        Amidst the bombs, shellings and bullets their parents allowed them to enjoy their social life by going to dances particularly called ‘jumps’. With a chaperon assigned to them by their father. Apart from reading a lot of novels to ward off the strange happenings around them, they have Louis and Chidi, who unfortunately are fighting in the war. Their jobs kept them company until they can see them when they are less busy.</p> <p>      During Chioma and Nkems stay at Emekuku, a village near Owerri, a tragic incident occurred that shook the family especially Chioma in chapter 4 of part two of the text. By now Louis and Chidi were lieutenants commanding artilleries with batmen to serve them until Louis was called upon by his friend Ezenwa to help him collect his battery from a mechanic who exchanged his new battery with his old one.</p> <p>Ezenwa was determined to get his battery so he went to the military police for help, the commander referred the case to his subordinate Louis. Louis went to investigate the allegation but the mechanic was no-where to be found. When the mechanic refused to show up he and his boys went to his shop, on getting there the mechanic and some unknown persons opened fire on Louis and his boys. They took cover and without waiting for instruction one of his boys reacted in self-defense and shot one of the ambushers dead.</p> <p>      Louis was told that his commanding officer wanted to see him at the Military Police Headquarters at Enyogugu. One incidence led to another, Louis was kept in detention, sent to the tribunals and later sent into the worst detention camp in Nnueke. All efforts made by Chioma to see him proved abortive, the officers In charge of the case told her that it was because the case involved a native that was supposed to be protected, that was why Louis case would be taken to the court even after the officer who committed the crime has exonerated Louis from the problem.</p> <p>     Pius, Louis brother and their father were the only ones granted permit to see him. His case was taken to court and he was pronounced guilty and sentenced to death. He made attempts at breaking out with six other inmates when Ezenwa was killed, but proved abortive, he was caught and was killed in the public with no traces of where he was buried.</p> <p>      Gradually, the enemy encroached into Umuahia after destroying the villages around them and Owerri is equally shaking. The frequent running to the bush and caves as hideouts from the air liners continued until the Federal troopes gain ground after shelling and destruction of Okigwe and the final push would be Orlu. Agha’s family decided to send Chioma and Nkem with their family friends, Frank and Paul to a farm when the news came to them that the soldiers were raping and humiliating women.</p> <p>       The family became separated when Umuahia became the enemies target and thousands of refugees packed out of Umuahia to God knows where. Chioma and Nkem parted ways when Chioma forgot her purse in their hideout, she went back to pick it and Nkem waited, during her waiting, special airliners of the Federal troops came and bombarded the town, Nkem had to run for her life.</p> <p>    After walking miles upon miles she came across the father’s friend who helped her a little in his car and told her to face Orlu. She overheard from the refugees that the warlords and generals are fleeing the country. This made the Biafran soldiers who had no weapons not to fight any longer, of which Chidi was one of them. She had to trace him, in doing this she walked six miles before seeing Uncle Victor, her mother’s distant cousin who joined the army in 1968 and had become a Captain.</p> <p> She was directed to Umuaka where she was told Chidi’s artillery unit moved to. After dropping her off at the junction which leads to her destination, she came across chidi’s batsman who assured her of seeing his boss there but unfortunately they have moved and she had to walk miles until she became tired and sat by the road side where Chidi saw her and took her to Orlu.</p> <p>       With Chidi by her and IkechiChidi’s sister, they prepared to flee Orlu where the enemy is bombarding seriously they moved straight by foot to Umunze where Chidi’s batsman was staying before leaving to Akokwa the next day.</p> <p>Chidi paid their transport fare with a lot of struggle to Enugu so that Nkem can rejoin her parents.

We use Tenses to show clear time specification. In this sense, it is seen that without verbs, there will not be Tenses as tense in grammar does not only refer to time but also the action of the verb or state of being at a given moment. Tense is a way of making us know that a thing has happened at ‘present’ (present tense), a thing happened some moments in the ‘past’ (past tense) and a thing will happen in ‘future’ (future tense).</p> <p>Communication is the process or act of expressing ideas and feelings to one another or a process of giving out information to people.</p> <p>Language as a medium of human communication, socialization, civilization and development has been given a full-length treatment by linguists. Language is quite complex and for this reason, linguists had to devise ways of making it easier to analyze and describe so as to present a true and full structure of any definition given. However, the attempt to describe and study language gave rise to a number of schools of linguists. All of them developed from the same root of traditional grammar. </p> <p>Sidney Greenbaum defines grammar as “a general theory of language description” In this sense, grammar refers to the properties and processes that underlies the use of language. By implication, the speakers are expected to be equipped with the knowledge of the rules of the language they intend to speak and apply them properly when using them.</p> <p>            Traditional grammar precedes what is now regarded as a scientific approach to the study of language. Its approach is one that is normative, definition-oriented and prescriptive in nature. It represents an attempt to prescribe rules for language use. It prescribes rather than merely describe language. Emphasis is on correctly usage that is what speakers should say rather than what speakers actually say. Indeed, it is the attitude to correctness of the traditional grammar that has made it to always prescribe what sort of language ought to be used. Such terms as noun, verb, adverb, preposition, object, subject, etc. and of course, tenses are derived from the traditional grammar and are used to analyze sentences today.</p> <p>            It is interesting to note that traces of these grammatical terms or features are still found in use in schools today. However, the traditional grammar which is normative, prescriptive and definition-oriented has provided us with clear explanations on the uses of tenses in English and going by this, one is able to detect errors made by students in using tenses.</p> <p>In this research work, the researcher intend to draw attention to the problem with tenses in communication using the students of university of Abuja as a case study.</p> <p><strong>1.2           </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>When Nigerians speak English, especially the students whom the scope of this research is limited to, they tend to make mistakes in their usage of English Language tenses. It is the level this problem has reached that prompted the researcher to investigate into the problem with the aim of highlighting the causes as well as the features and also the gateway of solving this problem.</p> <p><strong>1.3           </strong><strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>This study aims at discussing in some details the English tenses in order to examine the possible mother tongue interference on the speakers or learners of English as a second language and also to point out other factors responsible for the misuse of English tenses. This study seeks to explain at length the problems students encounter in the usage of tenses and tries to offer some ways with which to overcome these problems.</p> <p><strong>1.4    </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        The study is important first, because it will help students to be aware of their grammatical problems and have them conscious of their usages when they speak the target language (English) in order to improve on their problems.</p> <p>        It also helps enlighten individuals as regards to the grammatical system of English so as to master and speak a form of English which is devoid of over bearing influence of their mother tongues, regional features, etc. similarly, this work also shows the path way to researchers who would want to take up the challenge for further studies in the field.</p> <p><strong>1.5    </strong><strong>SCOPE AND DELIMITATION</strong></p> <p>Our main focus here is the students; undergraduates of university of Abuja to be precise and it is within this scope that the researcher carried out this research.</p> <p><strong>1.6    </strong><strong>RESEARCH PROCEDURE</strong></p> <p>        The research procedure entails the research methodology. That is the method the researcher used to gather data for the study and the method intended to be used for the analysis of data collected for this research work.</p> <p><strong>1.6.1      </strong><strong>METHOD OF DATA COLLECTION</strong></p> <p>        The primary method of data collection as used by the researcher constitutes a nucleus of the research because it is through this method that the researcher actually got the materials to be used for the analysis this study. The method used in observations and written essays in the sense that some students were asked to write about their experiences on campus. Their essays were used to extract the data for analysis in this study.</p> <p>        Most of the students who wrote the essay had the Igala language of Kogi State as their mother tongue while few had pidgin as their mother tongue. This choice of students made it easier for the researcher to analyze their errors since the researcher has spent a reasonable number of years with the Igala people and can confidently identify the causes of the errors made if attributed to mother tongue interference or not.</p> <p><strong>1.6.2      </strong><strong>DATA ANALYSIS PROCEDURES</strong></p> <p>        The researcher embarked on an extensive analysis of her available data which is picking at least five essays from the ten scripts collected, selecting and analyzing the errors made as regards tenses and found the causes of these errors.</p> <p><strong>1.7    </strong><strong>THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</strong></p> <p>        The theory that is adopted for this study is the theory of error analysis alongside the inter language approach. This theory entails the study of the language of the learners with a view to identifying the mistakes learners make and to figure out the causes and significance of such errors in the learning process.     </p>\n\nTHE PROBLEM OF TENSES AMONG NIGERIAN SPEAKERS OF ENGLISH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROBLEM OF TENSES AMONG NIGERIAN SPEAKERS OF ENGLISH", "id": 153}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p>One of the features of a living language is that it constantly changes with new words finding their way into the vocabulary of the language. Languages’ vocabularies grow from time to time as a result of new innovations that continuously spring up in different sectors of life and human endeavour; one of which is the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), in the recent century. This study, therefore, explores the various processes employed by Nigerian Short-Message Service (SMS) writers in generating new words, by critically sampling and analysing some of these new words to see the processes employed by these GSM users. It is discovered in this paper that these GSM users have the capability of reducing any form of expression to the starkest abbreviation. Generally, the new words analysed are in one way or the other in their reduced forms and this may not be far from the characteristic SMS requirement of limited number of characters.</p> <p>Index Terms—word formation, GSM, SMS, clipping, alphanumeric and coinages</p> <p><strong>I. INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The current computer literacy level in the society has made text-based communication, which comes in various forms; assume a vital position among many people. These text-based communication techniques include chat on-line, text messaging, e-mail, among others. This form of communication (text-based communication) comes with its peculiar style of writing, creating and re-creating new ways of writing. This paper is an attempt in analysing the various word formation processes employed by Nigerians using the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) in text messaging.</p> <p>GSM, which is an abbreviation for Global System for Mobile Communication, is a communication system that does not use wires and cables. It rather uses radio waves according to Homby (2001), and as such, it can be carried about and be used anywhere. Though GSM can be used for many purposes, it is majorly used for call making and text-messaging. However, this paper focuses on text massages.</p> <p>Temple (2013) observes that technical ideas (with respect to GSM) from various numbers of sources are gathered over the period from 1982-1985. According to him, Europe produced the very first GSM Technical Specification in 1987, which marks the birth or the pivotal year of GSM. However, GSM was introduced in Nigeria in 2001following the January 2001 auction for GSM which attracted mobile phone operators like MTN Nigeria, Econet Wireless Nigeria (now Airtel), MTEL, Globacom and Etisalat to operate digital mobile service in the country. Econet Wireless Nigeria and MTN Nigeria launched their GSM on 7th and 8th of August 2001 respectively. Obviously, GSM subscription rate and phone calls were extremely expensive at inception. However, with the advent of days, they have become relatively affordable that an average household in the country can afford to own as many GSM phones as the number of persons in the household. This makes it possible for young people (even children) to have access to GSM. Consequently, from observation there are innovative ways/styles of writing that accompany the use of GSM to compose text messages, especially by the younger generation in order to reflect local colouration and to, save time, space and cost. In this paper, we look at these innovative styles to find out the word-formation processes employed by Nigerian users of this information technology gadget in their text messages.</p> <p>Short Message Service (SMS) is a text messaging service component of web, phone or mobile communication systems that makes use of standardised communication protocol which makes it possible for fixed lines or mobile phone devices to exchange short text messages. SMS sends and receives messages of up to 160 characters per page to and from GSM handsets. In other words, there is a limited number of characters that can be sent or received through SMS. This may explain the need to create and re-create new words. This study is inspired by this new form of writing and the styles with which it comes.</p> <p>Language is in constant change with new words coming into it almost on a daily basis. Though not every new word survives, some eventually find their ways into the vocabulary of the language. Word formation is simply the creation of new words in a language. Fromkin, Rodman and Hyams (2011) observe that new words have quite a number of ways by which they can enter the language. Scholars like Fromkin, Rodman and Hyams (2011); Aronoff an Fudeman (2008); Gries (2006); Peña (2010), among others, have identified these various processes of word formation to include: ISSN 1799-2591</p> <p>Theory and Practice in Language Studies, Vol. 4, No. 11, pp. 2215-2222, November 2014</p> <p>© 2014 ACADEMY PUBLISHER Manufactured in Finland.</p> <p>doi:10.4304/tpls.4.11.2215-2222</p> <p>© 2014 ACADEMY PUBLISHER</p> <p>compounding, derivation, coinage, acronym, blending, clipping, back-formation, etc. However, the focus of this paper is on how Nigerian mobile phone users employ these and other processes in forming new words as are evident in their test messages.</p> <p>For clarity of purpose, this paper is divided into five sections, with the first and the second sections bordering on introduction and views of various authors on the topic respectively. In the third section, the methodology adopted in the paper is discussed, while the various word-formation processes, alongside the resulting new words as identified in SMS, are provided and discussed in the fourth section. Finally, the fifth and sixth sections respectively summarise and conclude the paper.</p> <p>II. WORD FORMATION PROCESSES: AN OVERVIEW</p> <p>A word-formation process may be either or all about the following: a way in which an entirely new word comes into a language and/or a way in which a speaker creates complex words from already existing simpler word(s). In line with this view, Lieb (2013) defines word formation as forming new lexical words from already existing words using a word-formation process.</p> <p>Bryson (1990) cited in Peña (2010) identifies six ways of creating new words which include: by adding to them, by subtracting from them, by making them up, by doing nothing to them, by borrowing from other languages and by mistake. This paper is not interested in the mechanism of doing nothing to them because it is an aspect of historical semantics. Moreover, in addition to the six mechanisms identified by Bryson (1990), Peña (2010) adds another which is: by combining them. Peña (2010) further explains that when we talk of adding to existing words, we mean the use of processes like derivation and compounding. Scholars like Peña (2010); Fromkin, Rodman, and Hyams (2011); Aronoff and Fudeman (2008); etc posit that derivation and compounding are the more productive ways of adding new words into English. Subtracting from them refers to word formation process as clipping; then borrowing and mistake refer to backformation or misspelling while combining them has to do with acronyms and blending or portmanteaus.</p> <p>Peña (2010) asserts that blending is a word formation process that involves the removing and joining of residues of two or more words in order to create a new word that has form and meaning, which have resemblance with the source words. The meanings and sounds of the two words combined; and the combination may or may not be in their full forms. Little wonder, Gries (2006) and Aronoff and Fudeman (2008) while observing that blending is a highly creative word-formation process explain that this is so, because it is a process that does not adhere to any specific productive rule. In the same vein, Bauer (1983) opines that the blender is actually free to take either as little or as much as he deems necessary to form a blend. Consequently, one can rightly say that blending is the most unpredictable process of word formation.</p> <p>Peña (2010) also defines borrowing as a process that involves the copying of a word from one language (to which it originally belongs) to another. For there to be a case of borrowing, the two languages involved must have come in contact with each other. Borrowed words often do not remain the way they are in the original/source language. However, they are modified to adhere to the phonological, morphological and syntactic patterns of the borrowing language. Languages that are in contact with one another tend to take-on terms they lack from each other.</p> <p>In the case of compounding, Olsen (2007) calls the process of forming compounds, composition and posits that two stems from the vocabulary are combined to form a new word. On the other hand, Katić (2013) notes that initialisms and acronyms are shortenings which are derived from the initial letters in a phrase or name, explaining that</p> <p>… while acronyms are pronounced as “single words” (NASA, AIDS), initialisms are pronounced “as a sequence of letters” (DNA, USA). The difference between these two types lies in how the resulting word is pronounced in spoken language, namely letter by letter or without intermission, (p. 3).</p> <p>In essence, Katić (2013) is saying that initialisms (also called alphabetisms by Zapata 2007), and acronyms are words that are formed from the initial letters of words, (usually names of organisation or a scientific term, etc), which are pronounced as sequences of letters and as words respectively.</p> <p>Clipping as another word-formation process, according to Peña (2010), is a process that involves the deletion of a part (usually, one or more syllables) of a word and leaving a certain part of the said word. In clipping, the deletion may take place at any position, initial, final or medial. In other words, any part of the word can be clipped off. Shahla and Amir (2013) posit that it involves abbreviating an already existing word.</p> <p>In back formation, which is another word-formation process, Shahala and Amir (2013) say that it is a word-formation process where a shorter word (base) is being formed by deleting a supposed/imagined affix from an already existing word in a language. This type of word-formation process is, for instance, used to create verbs from nouns ending in ‘-tion/-sion’ or ‘-or/-er’. Kwary (nd.) says it is a creative reduction of a word due to wrong morphological analysis. This is a process of forming a new word by deleting what looks like a typical affix in the language. Shahla and Amir (2013) later summarise their view by saying that back formation is a process that is motivated by analogy.</p> <p>Furthermore, Gries (2006) studies the underlying mechanisms for the coining of intentional morphological blends and complex clipping where he asserts that the two word-formation processes are clearly different in relation to the extent to which the source words they involve relate to the output. While the absolute magnitude of this effect is specifically strong in speech, complex clipping behaves nearly like a random word pair when it comes to writing. He states that:</p> <p>2216 THEORY AND PRACTICE IN LANGUAGE STUDIES</p> <p>© 2014 ACADEMY PUBLISHER</p> <p>(i) the formation of blends is in fact substantially correlated with corpus-derived SPs (Selection Points) and that</p> <p>(ii) a superficially very similar word-formation process, complex clipping, does not exhibit such a tendency, (p. 549).</p> <p>Furthermore, Gries (1989) opines that this is an indication that “the intentional creation of blends at least suggests that their coiners make use of a general mechanism involved in the comprehension of words when they form a neologism, as if trying to anticipate comprehenders’ strategies” (p. 549).</p> <p>As it concerns the empirical findings of other scholars, Peña (2010) carries out a contrastive study of word-formation processes in the English and Spanish languages with a view to contrasting the mechanisms used by the two languages in coining new words. She does this by describing each of the processes with examples in order to determine the frequency and productivity of the mechanisms in each of the languages. The work shows that both languages have corresponding coinage mechanisms which vary in frequency and productivity. Peña (2010:408) goes on to state,</p> <p>These processes are derivation, compounding, clipping, borrowing, backformation, acronyms and blending. Derivation and borrowing are highly prolific mechanisms in both languages; compounding is very much used in English but not so common in Spanish; the rest are less prolific and more or less equally frequent in both languages.</p> <p>Shahla and Amir (2013) have carried out a comparative study of the different word-formation processes used in Ilami, a dialect of Kurdish and that of the English language to see if there are similarities or differences in the ways these two languages form new words. By looking at different strategies of word formation like derivation, compounding, blending, abbreviation, etc, they discover that Kurdish makes use of compounding more than English. They also observe that Ilami makes less use of derivation to form new words. In addition, other processes of word formation were discovered to be rarely or never used in Ilami. Shahla and Amir (2013:83) believe that “Kurdish (as a whole and Ilami as a dialect of it), unlike English does not have a written form and is not an official language; these factors remarkably decrease the level of word-formation productivity in this language (and dialect).” Therefore, they are of the view that since word- formation processes have some kind or relation with written language, it should not be surprising that these processes are rare in Ilami.</p> <p>Plag (2002) writes on word formation processes in English computer mediated communication (CMC and SMS). The summary of his findings show the following:</p> <p>a. that native languages/dialects influence patterns of writing in CMC and SMS</p> <p>b. that pronunciation spelling (which usually manifests in SMS/CMC) is not considered as a method of creating new words, but non-standard orthographic representation of words motivated by mother tongue interference</p> <p>In conclusion, there are various ways by which new words find their ways into the vocabulary of a language – by adding to them (through the use of a processes like derivation and compounding); by subtracting from them (through the use of process like clipping); borrowing; mistakes (which involves a process like back-formation) and combining them (through processes like blending and acronyms). We can also have outright coinage, where an entirely new word is coined. In this case, it does not involve an already existing word. On this basis, as we can see above, linguists have carried out researches on word-formation processes in different languages of the world and also in various aspects of language.</p> <p>III. METHODOLOGY</p> <p>This study is a descriptive survey. The researchers engaged the assistance of six field assistants. Two persons each were appointed for the three locations that serve as the areas of the study. Moreover, the youths (within the age bracket of 15-35) make up the population of the study. The youths are purposely chosen because they are more involved in the use of ICT. The researchers observe that these ‘new words’ in Nigerian SMS are common among the youths and do not necessarily cut across the entire GSM users. With the use of purposive cluster random sampling method, the researchers sampled two urban and one rural area within the southern, northern and western parts of the country. Data were collected from these locations viz: Enugu (for the South) and Kano and Lagos (for North and West respectively), with SMS from mobile phones serving as the primary source of data. The respondents were approached and they granted the researchers and field assistants access to the text messages they sent out within a period of two weeks. Additionally, library and the internet serve as secondary sources from where books, articles and papers relating to the topic were reviewed.</p> <p>Within the selected locations, five respondents were randomly selected; making a total of fifteen respondents in each area. Eight hundred and ten messages (messages in the English language) were extracted from their phones. This number gives an average of about ten messages per respondent. However, only one hundred and forty (140) items were seen to contain the kind of words the paper is interested in, (i.e. words that are not in normal Standard English forms). Consequently, 140 words were used for this study. The data so collected were descriptively analysed, viz.: clipping, sound reduction involving deletion, alpha-numeric, and initialisms involving abbreviations. In the analysis, emphasis is on what actually happens to the source word (the words from which the new ones emanate). In other words, the analysis focuses on the patterns adopted by the respondents in creating the ‘new words’ from the already existing ones.</p> <p>IV. WORD FORMATION PROCESSES IDENTIFIED IN NIGERIAN SMS</p> <p>A.

It is important to note here that example 10 does not adhere strictly to this rule. Apart from reducing the double ‘p’ to a single one, the letter ‘y’ is also substituted for ‘i’, depicting its sound. In examples 11 - 16, clipping takes the form of the first letter of the first syllable (or a letter that sounds like it as in example 11 above) and the whole of the subsequent syllable or a representation (what sounds like it as in 12-13 above) of the syllable. However, in examples 17-19 above, clips are formed by taking letters partly from the beginning as well as the ending of the words. On the contrary, there is no exact pattern involved in forming clips in examples 20-21 above except that the first, second as well as the first, second and third letters in the respective words are retained. It is also noteworthy to point out that ‘pix’ and ‘bros’ in the context of SMS in Nigeria can be used for both singular and plural. Summarily, in all the instances, words are reduced to some of their parts.</p> <p>B (i) Sound reduction involving deletion of letters</p> <p>22. wit with 43. dis this</p> <p>23. wat what 44. dat that</p> <p>24. wen when 45. dem them</p> <p>25. wud would 46. fada/moda father/mother</p> <p>26. wot what 47. dey they</p> <p>27. fon phone 48. dose those</p> <p>28. tym time 49. tanx thanks</p> <p>29. gal girl 50. eva ever</p> <p>30. tot taught 51. ova over</p> <p>31. kip keep 52. tite/tyt tight</p> <p>32. kia care 53. nite/nyt night</p> <p>33. kot caught 54. shud should</p> <p>34. skul school 55. buk book</p> <p>35. bak back 56. luv love</p> <p>36. unik unique 57. xpanñ expansion</p> <p>37. gud good 58. evry every</p> <p>38. hapi happy 59. b be</p> <p>39. beta better 60. n and</p> <p>40. laf laugh 61. u you</p> <p>41. suxes success 62. y why</p> <p>42. pis/pisful peace/peaceful 63. c see</p> <p>In the group of words above (examples 22 – 63), ‘new words’ are formed based on the sounds that make up the individual words. Though they are not exact transcription of the ‘original words’ (the words from which they are formed), the pronunciations of the ‘newly formed words’ represent typical Nigerian phonemic realisations of the said words (applied linguists may call this pronunciation – spelling error. For instance, Plag (2002) classifies words in example (Bi) as a product of pronunciation spelling based on the respondents’ native language/dialect). Here, ‘wh’ is represented by ‘w’ (see examples 32 – 36 above); ‘c’, ‘ch’, ‘ck’ and ‘que’ are simply represented by ‘k’ since they are pronounced /k/ in the words where they occur. Interestingly, ‘th’ which is pronounced as /ð/ in 43 – 48 and /θ/ in (49), is represented by ‘d’ and ‘t’ letters respectively. This may likely be as a result of the absence of the two interdental fricatives in Nigerian languages; hence, the sounds are always mispronounced as /d/ and /t/ respectively, using the nearest equivalent in their native languages. Therefore, it is not a surprise that GSM users in Nigeria would do such substitution as we see in examples (43 – 49) above. The reduction of somewhat complex spellings with the nearest letter that also depicts pronunciation is also evident in group B(i) above. Words in examples 59 – 63 are seen as depicting sound because they are intended to be realised when pronouncing the letters used in representing them and, as such, the letters then stand for the words. We should also note that examples B(i) (59 - 63) do not fall into a neat category. They 2218 THEORY AND PRACTICE IN LANGUAGE STUDIES</p> <p>© 2014 ACADEMY PUBLISHER</p> <p>also belong to another category (observe example C below). However, we will not also be wrong to present and analyse them as abbreviations of the original words.

It involves the special use of numerals to represent sounds in words, such that when the numeral is pronounced (sometimes, alongside other letters), the intended word (or something close to it), is realised. The figures ‘1, 2, 4, 8, and 9’ have been observed as being used to represent the words, ‘to’ - /tə/, ‘one/won’ - /wʌn/, ‘night’ - /naɪt/, ‘four/for/fore’ - /fɔ:/ or /fə/ and ‘ate/eight’ - /eɪt/ respectively. These figures are consequently added to form part of spellings of the words where such sounds they represent are found.

When we consider ‘nd’ in (88) and (89 – 105), we discover that the abbreviations are formed by simply retaining the consonant letters or sounds in the original words while deleting the vowels by that effect. Examples (111 – 114) are formed from the first letters of the two words that respectively make up the compound words. Others (like 106 – 110) are ordinary abbreviations that do not actually have a specific pattern. Moreover, we can also see examples (83 – 87) and ‘n’ in (88) as abbreviations that can be pronounced to realise the words they represent, by ordinarily pronouncing the letters as if in isolation (also observe examples 59-63 above). Moreover, phrases, clauses and even whole sentences are also reduced to abbreviations (see 115 -140 above for illustrations).</p> <p>V. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS</p> <p>THEORY AND PRACTICE IN LANGUAGE STUDIES 2219</p> <p>© 2014 ACADEMY PUBLISHER</p> <p>This paper looks at how GSM users manipulate words and spelling symbols to re-create new words while writing their text messages. The previous section shows that GSM users make use of clipping, sound-reduction and initialisms involving abbreviation in forming these words. Example ‘A’ above shows that clipping in text messages comes in various forms. While some can be said to have a pattern, others are without any identifiable pattern. However, they are understood by the communicators. This can be proved by the communication flow observed in the data extracted from the respondents.</p> <p>Again, there is a notable difference as well as irregularities that exist between the English sounds and their corresponding spellings. This, from the result of the findings, may be the reason behind the new form of writing exemplified in B above. Here, new words are formed on the basis of one-to-one correspondence between the pronunciation of words and their spelling. It is worthy of note to state that what is done is not outright transcription but a rendition of words is a typical Nigerian pronounceable way that still portrays the original word. Typically, the nearest letters that depict the speech sounds of the words are chosen in the representation and this is usually clear where the actual sound segment is not present in any of the native languages. As observed earlier, Plag (2002) sees it as pronunciation spelling which is not considered as a word creating process, rather to represent non-standard orthographic variants. But our findings see it as a word creating process. This conclusion was reached by observing other text messages (still within the 810 messages collected) sent by the same group of respondents to their elder ones and official colleagues. In these official text messages, the above instances of clips, abbreviations, alphanumeric, etc were written in Standard English forms. This is a clear indication that the respondents are not motivated by non-standard spelling. Furthermore, B (ii) shows a pattern of sound-reduction, which can be called alphanumeric, where numerals like 1, 2, 4, 8 and 9, are used to represent sounds. These can either be used in isolation or alongside other letters in the original word to form words in the language of Nigerian SMS users.</p> <p>This study also discovers that there is a wide range of abbreviations in use among the SMS writers in Nigeria. As against the general notion that initials are being formed from names of organisations and technical names, we see these GSM users’ ability to reduce almost anything they desire to initials. These abbreviations range from single words to phrases, clauses, as well as sentences. Therefore, we can say that Nigerian GSM users reduce both simple and complex expressions to the starkest abbreviation.</p> <p>It is also evident from the data presentation and analysis that what we have are all forms of reducing words and expressions because of lack of space, (which may not be far from the characteristic limited number of characters that are required in SMS), impatience on the part of GSM users to type full words (obviously to save time), and cost. As it concerns cost, it was only last year (2013) that the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) reached an agreement with network providers that inter network SMS charge be a flat rate of N4.00 per SMS. Before 2013, it costs N15.00 and above.</p> <p>Furthermore, this paper discovers that these ‘new words’ are generally interpreted in context. For instance, what is obtainable in the Nigerian context may be different from the Ghana or American context and vice versa. Also, the manner in which words are shortened in the sampled SMS shows that, except within context (i.e., context of use now), these expressions may not be understood. Even though interpretation of SMS is outside the scope of this paper but the analysis reveals that context is the major factor that provides lucid interpretation of these new created forms of writing, which people usually refer to as ‘the language of the GSM.’ Again, (though it is not within the scope of this paper), it is equally important to note that the users of these short forms are mostly youths. Adult GSM users, most times, do not understand this “new language”, and are not usually involved in it. Therefore, the usage is more among the youth, who apparently understand the language. Again, new words are not actually created in that sense of word formation. What we have is a unique writing system in Nigerian SMS that involves the recreation of existing words through clipping, alphanumeric, and sound reduction and deletion.</p> <p>VI. CONCLUSION</p> <p>Every human society depending on its needs require new words from time to time to satisfy such needs. Therefore, new innovations make it needful for new words to come into a language in order to name new things and take care of their present communication needs. Every language needs new words almost every day. However, these words are got by borrowing, derivation, conversion, etc. The most important thing is that new concepts are taken care of in the vocabulary of a language. This is why language cannot remain static – since innovations will not cease. Hence, language keeps growing and developing to meet up with the changes in the society. In recent times, many words have entered the vocabularies of many languages as a result of many innovations; for example, the turn-around in the information communication technology (ICT) requires a great deal of new words to meet the demands of the industry since the words we have presently are not adequate to take care of the new things that come with it. ICT makes it necessary for new words like ‘internet, website, ping, cookies, blog, bookmark, download, etc to enter the vocabulary of the English language as well as for old words like web, surf, and bug, etc., to acquire new meanings. Also, there is need to reduce the number of characters in a text since the number of characters in a mobile phone is restricted. This encourages the use of clipped words, abbreviations and the reduction of series of letters to a single letter or figure that will take care of the sound(s) represented by the series of letters as we saw in the paper.

It is to explain the styles adopted by the speakers of both languages in expressing numeral situations.</p> <p>In the early days of some comparison between languages, some scholars had argued that there was such a strong linguistic affinity between Hausa and English numerals so much that the two languages could have common meaning and non- instinctive way of communicating ideas, emotion and desires by means of voluntarily produced symbols. This is because any language is fundamentally a series of sounds which become meaningful only when those sounds are grouped together in certain definite arrangements (Olaye, 1982). Besides, just as languages must name things and talk about them, virtually all human languages (English and Hausa inclusive) count things. By this token, numeration is somewhat a universal phenomenon.</p> <p>Both English and Hausa languages may need little or no introduction because they are both languages of wider communication.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>                 <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Given the nature of their numeral comparison, it is good to look at their linguistic affiliation. Hausa is a Chadic language of the Afro-Asiatic language family. The Bole-Tongale Angas and Ron groups of the west Chadic languages represent the closest relative of Hausa. While English language really started with arrival of three German languages. In that numbers and counting have become an integral part of English and Hausa everyday life especially when we take into account, in the modern computer. These words you are reading have been recorded on a computer using a code of ones and zeros.</p> <p>It is an interesting story how those digits have come to dominate our word. Presently, the earliest known archeological evidence of any form of writing or counting are scratch marks on a bone from 150,000 years ago. But the first really evidence of counting in the first form of the numbers from twenty thousand years ago. An Ishango bone was found in the Congo with two identical marking of sixty scratches each an equally numbered group on the back. These Markings are certain education of counting and they mark defining moment in a western civilization. In present day, counting we learn about cardinal and ordinal numbers followed by grammar rules and animal names and that of conversation in Hausa.</p>                                                          \n\nA COMPARATIVE STUDY OF NUMERIC SYSTEMS OF ENGLISH AND HAUSA LANGUAGES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF NUMERIC SYSTEMS OF ENGLISH AND HAUSA LANGUAGES", "id": 155}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study aims to present a particular view of second language pedagogy. Teaching English as a second language is a quite complex task for a teacher. Language learning should be more fun and enjoyable for students to learn. Teachers need to have effective teaching strategies in order for students to grasp better in learning English. The objective of this study is to investigate the methods of teaching used by Dr. Farooq Kperogi on how to attract interest in learning English as a second language.<br/><br/><br/></p> <p> <strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 Introduction</strong></p> <p>Pedagogy can be defined as the intervention into thought and behaviour which is concerned with the promotion of learning processes for intended outcomes. By definition it therefore simultaneously involves decisions by teachers, action by learners and perceptible outcomes, both immediate and over time.</p> <p>Pedagogy has been studied for centuries. However, much of that study has been based on principle, prescription and analogy. In contrast, a researched pedagogy (Leung, 1993) scrutinizes pedagogic activity to assess it’s modes of implementation, it’s operation and it’s outcomes. This research builds upon a growing number of previous publications to bring together a series of studies which investigate tasks in this way. This is a long term project, a research as this can only sample a small range of tasks in a limited number of contexts under a restricted range of conditions. There is a substantial range of pedagogic activities that remain to be researched in a vast range of circumstances. In contrast, this collection makes a small contribution to the field. In fact, research into pedagogic task is one of a growing number of areas of empirical research which have emerged since the early 1980s. One of the basic functions of empirical research into language pedagogy is arguably feedback to the teaching profession, so that, as Brumfit argued 'we are able to attempt to assess the effectiveness of our educational system; and in order to receive information about alternatives to traditional methods, so that the alternatives can be introduced, in some systematic way, into the system' (Brumfit, 1980: 132).</p>                                                          \n\nA PEDAGOGICAL ANALYSIS OF TEACHING ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A PEDAGOGICAL ANALYSIS OF TEACHING ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE", "id": 156}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This project analyses semantic ambiguous headlines stating their communicative effectiveness with regards to print media. Using data from <em>Vanguard</em> and <em>Daily Trust</em> newspapers, the study discovered that ambiguities are prevalent in the newspaper headlines as a result of various manipulations on sentences and lexical choice. This leads to the possibility of multiple meanings and interpretation of the headlines.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The crux of this research is semantic ambiguity as it affects communication effectiveness of media headlines of print media. Semantic ambiguity is concerned with meaning relations at sentence level which is a sub-field in the study of semantics that deals with the influence of one word upon another in sentences. Other related terms are tautology, redundancy, paraphrase, anomaly. Ambiguity is defined as a grammatical phenomenon in which an expression can be given more than one interpretation and could be caused by syntactic and semantic factors. Semantic ambiguity is a situation in which an expression can be given more than one interpretation based on the meaning of a word or words which in themselves can be misinterpreted. Syntactic ambiguity on the other hand is caused by the grammatical construction of the phrase or sentence which bring about misinterpretation.</p> <p>A headline like, “Fashola meets ex-girlfriend in Paris” from Vanguard newspaper of June 4, 2013 could be ambiguous and as such could be misinterpreted. The word ‘meets’ has several meanings and denotes a lot of things. It means among others (1) to come face to face with someone coincidentally or unexpectedly (2) to converge or come in contact and finally touch or have sexual intercourse with someone (3) to come together in conflict (4) to gather for a formal discussion. The construction has therefore distorted a direct translation of the sentence to mean Fashola, saw his former girlfriend in Paris coincidentally.</p>                                                          \n\nAMBIGUITIES IN NEWSPAPER HEADLINES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AMBIGUITIES IN NEWSPAPER HEADLINES", "id": 157}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study examined the Correlation between English – language and literature – English: A case study of MELL, UDUS, Sokoto.

It discusses the background to the study and statement of the research problem. It also goes further in explaining the objectives of the Study, significance of the Study, as well as its Scope and Delimitations.</p> <p><strong>1.1</strong>     <strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>There is no gain saying the fact that English has become an African Language. The language has become an invaluable legacy of the British which has provided African with yet another means of expressing their culture. Thus, English became the language of administration, law and legislative functions especially in Nigeria (Ker, 2002). In English language studies, literature is also featured as an important aspect for example; figures of speech in literature are also taught in English language. This goes to show that the English language is not devoid of literature.</p> <p>Today in Nigeria, the English language has become so central in every sphere of life, that most people equate literacy and indeed education with the ability to read and write in English language (Otagburuagu, 2002). Faloye and</p> <p>Babatunde, (1991) similarly contained that:</p> <p><em>….Since the advent of formal education, instructions in</em></p> <p><em>all subject areas have been in English students are taught and tested in English.

It is a purely human and non-instinctive method of communicating ideas, emotions, and desires by means of voluntary produced symbol (Sapir, 1921). Language is a resource used for any social purposes, it is to be found wherever human live in social relationships and helps in maintaining political control, as it can be used to communicate attitudes and feelings of government towards people as well.</p> <p>However, there are many interpretations to the concept of language. Many scholars, and political analysts consider language of politics as a means to play or deceive the citizens so that, the citizens would believe them.</p> <p>So, many features have been attributed to the nature of language of politics, which depict politicians in most negative lights, this is because the nature and characteristics of the processes, procedures and activities in governance require constant communication between the leaders and the led.</p> <p>It is however believed that every set-up and discipline use certain patterns of language to process information and ensure proper understanding within their profession. For instance, in the legal profession and engineering etc, have specific choice of words and terms that are peculiar to them, so also are politicians and public officials in leadership positions.</p> <p>But the use of certain terms in language construction by politicians is deliberate just to achieve some set of goals. Most of the times, politicians lie, deceive, exaggerate etc, to convince the populace of their good intention so as to generate continued support. Thus, citizens are made to believe at times, what is either not true or over blown beyond proportion.</p> <p>O' Bar (1976) states that people use language (verbal or written) in relation to the study of political process. Thus, politicians use language either to impress, persuade, captivate or woo the interest of their people, and the kind of language used by the politician to captivate attention of their people differs greatly from the language they use to persuade.</p>                                                          \n\nLANGUAGE OF PERSUASION: AN EXAMINATION OF GOVERNOR ALIYU WAMAKKO’S SELECTED SPEECHES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " LANGUAGE OF PERSUASION: AN EXAMINATION OF GOVERNOR ALIYU WAMAKKO’S SELECTED SPEECHES", "id": 160}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 BACKGROUND TO STUDY</strong></p> <p>The English language in Nigeria is older than the Nigerian nation. It was formally introduced in 1842 by the first batch of missionaries who arrived in Badagry to evangelize as well as educate Nigerians (Tomori, 1981). When a language comes in contact with new environment, for it to survive, it has to adopt and change to reflect the needs of its new environment. The English language is no exception: the language is about 170 years old in Nigeria (as it was formally introduced in 1842). The English language has become so much adopted that it has been demosticated, nativesed and acculturated (Adegbija 2004). The English language has been Nigerianized. This adaptation of English emanating from the distinctive use of the language by Nigerians gave birth to what is known as Nigerian English (NE). What Bamgbose (1995), Adegbija (2004), Akere(2005) refer to as “nativazation”, “domestication” and “indigenization” of English in Nigeria.</p> <p>The change of meaning that occurs in the Nigerian context of English usage may be due to factors such as adaptation of English to Nigerians’ needs influence of indigenous languages, influence of Nigerian culture, which is different from the British culture. Although there are changes of meaning of certain words that differ from the native speakers’ usage, nonetheless, there are common grounds in which particular lexical items are use alike.</p>                                                          \n\nLEXICO-SEMANTIC NIGERIANISM IN NIGERIAN NEWSPAPERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " LEXICO-SEMANTIC NIGERIANISM IN NIGERIAN NEWSPAPERS", "id": 161}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0  INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Language is generally used for the purpose of interaction among people in the society. It is also used to differentiate people by sex, age and social status within a particular society. Language serves as a tool for development in every society. It develops nations or societies socially and particularly for the purpose of interaction within and outside a particular society. Through choice of words and forms of speeches, language can be used to differentiate gender or age.</p> <p>The languages that a person uses can be differentiate into L1 and L2, that is first and second languages. First language is also known as mother tongue meaning our language or the language a child first comes in contact with depending on the environment he/she is born and raised</p> <p>while second language is a language that is later learnt at adult stage.</p> <p><strong>1.2  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>Every individual has a first language or a mother tongue. Hausa language is a largely spoken language in the Northern part of Nigeria. It is observed that most Hausa native speakers posses this problem of their second language (English) facing syntactic problem as a result of the interference or the influence of the mother tongue (Hausa) over the second language (English). This is why a native speaker of Hausa language is easily identified if he/she speaks English language because the interference will be observed once the speakers makes an utterance.</p>

<div> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong>    <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>This project is on the power relation in courtroom language. Chapter one covers the general overview of the subject matter. It comprises the background to study, statement of research problems, aim and objective of the study, purpose of the study, significance of the study and scope and limitations.</p> <p><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Language has been identified as the “primary medium of social control and power” Fairclough (1989) most notable in legal settings where language is used in away to facilitate control through the exercise of power. A person that wields power or influence anyone does it by the potency of language.</p> <p>Language is central to human existence because human language is distinct and remarkable .The uniqueness of language which is ability to communicate is what Hickerson(1980)says makes possible most of the other behavior which we think of as uniquely human.</p> <p>There have been many speculations as to the origin of language. There are three (3) sources that point to the origin of language. According to Yule (2003) they are; the divine sources, the natural source and the oral source.</p> <p>9</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>The divine source is of the view that language came when Adam in the Bible was given the authority to name all living things. The theory also posits that there is a divine source that provides human beings with language. Few experiments have been carried out in an attempt to prove this with conflicting results. A quite different view on the beginning of human speech is based on the concept of the natural source. Scholars who hold this view are of the opinion that language came as a result of the imitation of the sounds around human. Sounds referred to the object associated with them. The oral gesture theory is yet another. It involves a link between physical gesture and orally produced sounds. It claims that originally, a set of physical gestures was developed as a means of communication.</p> <p>All these are speculations that have not been proven. Language serves as the vehicle with which man dominates his environment. Man has the ability to use system of sounds in which symbols are related to each other i.e. Language and it is this language that man uses to carry out various activities. According to Edward Sapir (1921) language is a ‘’purely human and non-instinctive method of communicating ideas, emotions and desires by means of a system of a system of voluntarily produced symbol’’. By this definition, only humans possess language.</p> <p>10</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>They make use of symbol; these symbols are auditory and are produced by some Speech organs.</p> <p>Hall (1969) defines language as the institution whereby humans communicate and interact with each other by means of habitually used oral-auditory symbols.</p> <p>This is similar to Gimson(1980) who defines language as ‘’a system of conventional signals for communicating by a whole community’. Language therefore is a means by which humans communicate in the society.</p> <p>Human society cannot exist without language since language is purely a human activity and communication in itself is the essence of humanity.</p> <p>Every language exists in a number of varieties. According to Hudson (1980; 24)</p> <p>A variety is ‘’a set of linguistics items with similar distributions’’. Going by this definition, we can say that languages have varieties. We have language of politics, language of science, language of law, language of sports, language of technology, etc. For the purpose of this study, we will focus on the language of legalese and how it wields power. The law society has established norms and values that govern and pattern the behavior of its members and machinery</p> <p>11</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>for enforcing these is language. Language therefore plays an important role in law making, preservation and enforcement. Language of law connotes power and influence. Power as related to language is the measurement or the ability of an entity to control his environment, including the behavior of other entities. The exercise of power is accepted as endemic to human as social beings. It is a form of social control.</p> <p>According to Wikipedia, the free Encyclopedia, word ‘court’ comes from the rench word ‘cour’ an enclosed yard, which derives from the Latin form ‘cortem’ which also means an enclosed yard.</p> <p>The meaning of a judiciary assembly is first attested to in the </p></div>                                                         \n\nPOWER RELATIONS IN COURTROOM LANGUAGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " POWER RELATIONS IN COURTROOM LANGUAGE", "id": 163}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>This research work aims at the investigating aspects of language that causes problems in learning second language.

Humans and animals communicate in different ways and for different purposes. Communication could be either oral or written.

Humans and animals communicate in different ways and for different reasons. Language is the primary but complex form of communication by which human beings are distinguished from other living things. Humans use language to achieve premediated goals to defend themselves to initiate and sustain interaction with one another. Language is not only used to communicate but also to do things and this is supported by Chomsky’s standard theory 1965 where he says “There’s little reason to believe that the primary use of language is to modify behavior or thought.”</p> <p>Literature is the most effective tool for social criticism as well as a pool of strategies for moral uprightness that promotes literacy and cultures necessary for human and national development.

Though a large percentage of students in Nigeria learn English as a second language and are instructed in it, the Nigerian pidgin seems to interfere with their acquisition of the language and their performance in it much more than their mother tongues. The impact of pidgin contributes in no small measure to the dismal performance of students in their academic career</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Nigeria    is   a   multilingual    country   with   four   hundred               indigenous</p> <p>languages,  out  of  which  three  are  regarded  as  major  ones,  namely:</p> <p>Hausa,  Igbo  and  Yoruba,     representing  the  three  major  geo-political</p> <p>zones - North, East and South respectively. Despite this fact, Nigerian</p> <p>Pidgin is used in diverse degrees in different parts of the country and it</p> <p>has  become  a  lingua  franca  for  many,  while  it  is  a  Creole  in  some</p> <p>Southern and Eastern States like Rivers, Lagos, Delta, Edo, and Cross</p> <p>Rivers.   Marchese    and   Schnkal   (1980)   confirm   this   after   a              major</p> <p>evolution in the Delta area of Nigeria, they say; \"... in a particular part</p> <p>of Nigeria, the areas around Warri and Sapele, Nigerian pidgin is more</p> <p>9</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>of a Creole. Creole is a mixture of an European language with a local language and is spoken as a first language.</p> <p>Some view it as a variety of English, while others see it as a distinct language. A look at the structure of Nigerian pidgin (NP) portrays that it has structures and patterns of behaviour of its own. Though at its initial stage, NP was considered the language of those who could not speak good English, but many know better now. It is therefore, no wonder that it is not only used by undergraduates in Nigerian universities during conversation with the uneducated public, but it has become a fascinating medium of casual exchange among students themselves. Fisherman (1997) asserts that; \"no language considered inferior is aptly logical\". This is because where two or more speech communities come in contact, a lingua franca or common language of communication emerges. He further points out that it is the social situation use popularly known as context that affects the morpho-syntactic pattern of a language. Since pidginisation, according to Hymes (1971:84), is a \"complex process of Sociolinguistics\", we shall now consider the use of Nigerian Pidgin English among students of Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto.</p> <p>10</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p><strong>1.1    BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The term pidgin is used to refer to a language which develops in a situation where speakers of different languages have a need to communicate but do not share a common language. Once a pidgin has emerged, it is generally learned as a second language and used for communication among people who speak different languages.</p> <p>Language is the most creative and unlimited instrument for social communication and it helps us to understand the deep seated social relevance, culture involvement and the human relatedness of language. Having said this, we can therefore agree that pidgin is a language of its own and not just a supplementary tongue as some people see it, since it serves as an unlimited instrument of social communication especially in a multilingual society like Nigeria.</p> <p>Linton (1982) states that \"the culture of a society is the way of life of its members, the collection of ideas and habits which they learn, share and transmit from generation to generation\". These cultures, ideas and habits can only be transmitted from generation to generation through language. In Linguistics, every language is considered adequate to represent the communicative needs of its people as such should not be made to suffer any biases.</p> <p>11</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p>This cannot be said of Nigerian Pidgin - even though it is a language because various attempts have been made by different factions to eradicate the use of Nigerian Pidgin English. These attempts have however been unsuccessful because of the significant value the language has to its users. It is a language that has brought people together in spite of their differences in ancestral culture and language by creating a local culture for itself which blends ideas from different cultures.</p> <p>Moreover, this use of Pidgin as a lingua Franca affects many Nigerians in academic careers, especially, those students that come from the environments where it is spoken.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>It is very pertinent to note that what actually started as an \"emergency language\" between the white merchants, to ease communication with the natives has now become \"an elitist campus language\" spoken among the teeming population of the Nigerian students in higher institutions of learning, thereby overlapping the standard English to such an extent that the students’ competence is impaired.</p> <p>12</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <div> <p><strong>1.3</strong>       <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This Study is important because its results can go a long way in finding out the causes of students' competence. This work will in no doubt contribute to one's knowledge, especially in the Department of English, Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto as it will highlight some issues in relation to written English. It will be a guide for the effective educational system.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong>       <strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research is carried out to examine the effect of Pidgin English on students’ competence. It is a fact that students deviate from the norms of codified English in most of their essays and communications.</p> <p>The following are the set of objectives to be achieved</p> <p>a. To show the impact of Nigerian Pidgin in a University Community; using 300 level students of MELL</p> <p>b. To assess the extent of its popularity and the communicative situation within which it is used.</p> <p>13</p> </div> <p><br/></p> <p>c. To show who uses Pidgin and for what purpose?</p> <p><strong>1.5    JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Prior to this time, a lot of works and research have been done on NP as a language of wider communication in Nigeria. However, its impact on the students is worth investigating. This work will attempt to reveal the fact that the Nigerian pidgin which was initially used as a medium of communication by particular group of people and for specific purpose has gradually come to be used in institutions of higher learning</p> <p><strong>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work will attempt to investigate the impact of Pidgin English on the University community, though it focuses on the Students of UDU, Sokoto (300level MELL) with a view to providing detailed information on the impact of NP on the performance of the students</p>                                                               \n\nTHE IMPACT OF PIDGIN ENGLISH ON STUDENTS COMPETENCE IN NIGERIA UNIVERSITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF PIDGIN ENGLISH ON STUDENTS COMPETENCE IN NIGERIA UNIVERSITY", "id": 167}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 Introduction</strong></p> <p>Language is characterized by set of vocal sounds which can be decoded. These are produced by human organs of speech- lips, tongue, and larynx etc. The vocal sounds produced by the vocal organs are used in various systematic and rule governed combinations. Language is thus a human phenomenon that has form which can be described in terms of the units of sound (phonemes), words, morphemes, phrases, and paragraph or discourse. Human language is unique in the sense that it has its own structure, its own system of organizing its component units into meaningful patterns.</p> <p>English, Nigeria’s official language, occupies a unique place in Nigerian education today; not only has English been adopted as the principal medium of instruction in Nigeria’s educational institutions but it has also been institutionalized as the language of educational evaluation in Nigeria school system. However, Kujore notes that it is alarming how in spite of the tremendous functions that English performs as the language of instruction and evaluation in Nigeria and the bold effort made over the years to encourage its effective usage, the vast majority of speakers record in recent years is an appalling low level performance in the language (Kujore, 1995).</p> <p>This research is going to investigate the instances of the non standard use of English. Whenever a language functions as a borrowed second language, problems of usage are bound to arise. This is because when a language moves out of its original speech community, it is inevitable to have some super imposed linguistics features and frictions resulting from the meeting of two systems and cultural pattern. Moreover, when the English language (being outside its native environment) there is bound to be deviation from the norms in usage (Olagoke 1981). An adult will have learnt one language, which is his mother tongue, which feature she naturally transfers some features to the second language. The study will identify and describe some sub varieties of English usage in Nigeria, which are instances of the use of non Standard English because of the multiplicity of ethnic groups in the country.</p>                                                          \n\nTHE MANIFESTATION OF NON STANDARD USAGE OF ENGLISH AMONG UNIVERSITY STUDENTS: THE SYNTACTIC PERSPECTIVE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE MANIFESTATION OF NON STANDARD USAGE OF ENGLISH AMONG UNIVERSITY STUDENTS: THE SYNTACTIC PERSPECTIVE", "id": 168}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The Nigerian Pidgin English is a type of English used and understood by so many people in Nigeria regardless of ethnic, cultural, and socio-economic background. Even though some people now use it in social communication, pidgin English is not only used in places like market local community and so on, but also Nigerian secondary and tertiary institutions’ students now use pidgin English to communicate with each other. The continued use of Pidgin English in Nigeria made the number of interest of its speakers to continue to expand and this encouraged the growth of Nigerian pidgin. Therefore, this project attempts to study the role of Nigerian Pidgin English especially in Army Day Secondary School, Sokoto.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong>        <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Nigeria is a country with a background of about four hundred indigenous languages, but there are three major languages – Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba existing in three major zones of North, East and South respectively. Despite this fact, Nigerian pidgin is used in different parts of the country and it has become a common language for many. It is spoken mainly in the Southern and Eastern states like Rivers, Lagos, Delta, Edo and Cross Rivers. Merchese and Schknal (1990) stated after a major evaluation in the Delta area of Nigeria that: “… in areas around Warri and Sapele, Nigeria pidgin is more of creole.” Creole is a mixture of European language with a local language and is spoken as a first language.</p>                                                          \n\nTHE ROLE OF NIGERIAN PIDGIN ENGLISH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF NIGERIAN PIDGIN ENGLISH", "id": 169}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0   INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Figurative expressions are forms of styles in which words are used to express more than they mean ordinarily so as to make the idea very emphatic and effective.</p> <p>On the other hand, hyperbole is one of the figurative expression and it means the use of deliberate expression for emphasis to achieve heightened effect or to produce some effect.

The primary concern of Chinua Achebe, the recipient of the <em>Man Booker International Prize, 2007</em>, was his society, more precisely, the destiny of hispeople. Achebe, perhaps the most authentic literary voice from Africa, wrote not only to record the African, especially Nigerian, life but to analyse the reality experienced by the native people in different times and situations. In his view, the writer must be accountable to his society. To him it was absurd to think of art as a pure and autonomous entity coming into existence by itself in an aesthetic void. Accordingly, his aim was to make his fiction an instrument of awareness seeking to elevate the social reality to a higher level. In this regard, the paper is an attempt to show Achebe’s endeavour to expose the rampant corruption and evil in Nigeria to exert a decisive and positive influence on his people. For Gimba, the intrigues and contestation over power, especially within the civil service, assume a metaphoric significance in unraveling social contradictions in society. Gimba thus, evaluates the various dimensions of power and how it is used to subjugate or oppress people. In most of his works, Gimba pillories the repressive nature of power and the conflicts it engenders are graphically illustrated. In his articulation of this disabling environment, Gimba evokes a consciousness, concerned with Manichaenism and alienation. Gimba is sensitive to his characters as they adjust to the uncertainties of a postcolonial society with all the indices of underdevelopment, greed, corruption, bureaucratic tardiness, indiscipline, political instability etc. These characteristics of modern Nigeria form the background from which Gimba’s characters are drawn. However, drawing from their Islamic background, the characters in Gimba’s works express their morality, conviction and thought through the ideals of the religion. This leads to a remarkable blending of social and moral concerns with the supervening influence of Islam without sermonization. The outcome of this fusion is a balance between aesthetics and spiritual interests in a way that captures the essence of Northern Nigeria with vividness and freshness. Gimba, like Tahir, therefore relates the traditional and cultural values of the people to their response to the dilemma of new experiences and their interpretations of them.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong>         <strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Chinua Achebe has proven his worth among English-speaking African novelists by representing the African social and political environment in a thoroughly realistic way. His novels depict life within a particular historical background, and convey a sense of growing disgust and unrest within Nigerian society, a society that has started to emerge from the ‘colonial complex’ caused by years of denigration and self-abasement. <em>A</em> <em>Man of the People</em></p> <p>(1967) is Achebe’s fourth novel. It describes Nigeria in its post-independence phase, during which time the country became a ‘cesspool of corruption and misrule’ in the context of colonial-style social and economic development, a situation that resulted in conflict between the emergent elitist middle class and the general populace. Achebe’s reputation as a novelist rests on his impartial understanding of, and ability to represent the Nigerian environment.</p>                                                          \n\nTHEME OF CORRUPTION IN THE POST-COLONIAL AFRICAN NOVEL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THEME OF CORRUPTION IN THE POST-COLONIAL AFRICAN NOVEL", "id": 171}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE INFLUENCE OF GENDER IN THE USE OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE OF 400 LEVEL STUDENT OF SOKOTO STATE UNIVERSITY </strong></p> <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p>The work used the ex-post-facto design to deepen our understanding of the relationship between gender and students’ academic achievements in English Language.

Two instruments were used: questionnaire administered to the lecturers and sample of semester result in English Language. These items were obtained from English Language lecturers. The data were correlated and analyzed using chi-square statistics to derive the research measure. The result showed a no significant relationship between gender and students’ achievements in English Language.

It refers to all the characteristics of men and women which a particular society has determined and assigned each sex. Gender, according to Mershall (1994), refers to socially-constructed aspects of differences between men and women. Since its introduction as a social concept, it has been extended to refer not only to individual identity and personality but also at the symbolic level, to cultural ideas and stereotypes of masculinity and femininity. The differences in the behaviour of males and females are learned rather than being the inevitable result of biology.Scholars have tried to determine the contribution of students’ gender to their academic achievements. Inyang and Archibong (1998) studied effects of gender and order of treatment of related mathematical principles on students’ performance in Chemistry Quantitative Problems. The study investigated the effects of exposing senior secondary school students of different gender to selected mathematical principles on their performances in quantitative problems in Chemistry. Subjects were exposed to three different instructional models. Those in the control group were exposed to treatment of chemistry quantitative problems with related mathematical principles; those in experimental Group 1 were exposed to quantitative problems in Chemistry before treatment of related mathematical principles while those in experimentalGroup 2 were subjected to related principles before treatment of quantitative problems in Chemistry. Post-test data in Chemistry Quantitative Ability Test (CQAT) collected and analysed using independent t-test revealed that an instructional model in which related mathematical principles were taught first before chemistry quantitative problems was most effective in understanding quantitative problems in Chemistry irrespective of gender. Akpama (2007) studied the gender influence on perception and attitude to HIV/AIDS prevention among secondary school students in Cross River State, Nigeria. The author formulated the null hypothesis: there is no significant difference between male and female adolescents in terms of their perception and attitude to HIV/AIDS prevention. 900 adolescents (450 males and 450 females) constituted the sample. A 20-item questionnaire was used for data collection. Data collected were analysed using independent t-test. The result showed that males and females did not differ significantly in their perception and attitude to HIV/AIDS prevention. It showed that the knowledge of the means of transmission and prevention was high among both male and female adolescents. According to Donahue, Veolki, Campbell and Mazzco (1999), some correlations appear to exist between gender and some academic achievement e.g. reading. They noted that disaggregation of the 1998 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) reading results based on gender rather than other variables revealed that females outperformed males in 4th, 8th and 12th grades, as they also did in 1992 and 1994; that at the 4th grade level, the males made a significant gain over their 1994 score while the females remained the same. They reported a similar trend in the North Carolina end-of-grade test administered in grades three to eight of the North Carolina State Department of Public Instruction (2000). Baharudin and Luster (1998) asserted that in US some of these gender differences could be explained by a national survey of reading attitudes conducted with 18,185 children across country among the first to third grades. They advanced that girls as a group possessed more positive attitude than boys at all grade levels, both towards recreational and academic reading. Similarly, Eccles, Wigfield, Harald and Blumenfield (1993) affirmed in a four-year longitudinal study of elementary school children in Michigan that girls valued reading significantly more than boys. But Baharudin and Luster’s study of 1998 using gender as a predictor of Mathematics achievement of six to eight-year-olds emerged again as significant in favour of females sub-group. Females, in general, as reported in a study supported by Campbell and Beaudry’s (1998) longitudinal study of American youth data, revealed less confidence in their mathematical ability and greater exertion of effort in mathematical classes than males. According to Fennema, Carpenter, Jacobs, Franke and Levi (1998), mathematical ways of thinking may differ by gender. This team of researchers studied  children as they progressed from first through third grades. They identified gender differences in strategy use that was evident from the beginning of the study and persisted through the end. Girls, they said, tended to use more modelling or counting strategies, while boys tended to use more abstract strategies such as derived facts or invented algorithms. By the third grade, girls used significantly more standard algorithms than did the boys.The natural traits that distinguish individual user of a language can never be denied .It has never occurred in the world history that two persons speak the same way even though they use the same language. The language behaviour of different users of a language spells out the unique language identity. Eloquence, power of oration and ability to acquire the necessary tools of communication in a language may vary from person to person. Heredity may play a vital role in the learning and acquisition of a language. But this notwithstanding, the theory of nurture through which the necessary cultivation of language behaviour is observed can make a difference in language performance. Language as one of the natural phenomenon has its complex peculiar characteristics but the ability to cope with all its features is given to man. This is controlled through proper nurture in a particular linguistic situation within a language region. Human being is given the power to acquire any language with different individual distinctions: language competence and language performance could be blind to gender variation. The uses of a language are based on individual language acumen rather than the sex. In the process of language acquisition and language learning, every creation (human) has equal opportunity to perform. Apart from illness, accident and some abnormalities, all human beings have equal opportunity of using the tools of communication effectively. The theory of navitivism according to Chomky (1968) suggests that nature had provided every linguistic paraphernalia needed by any man to acquire the necessary tools of communication in human language. The number of human languages in the world is infinite yet there are common cores. The natural features are similar and every normal person has the potentials to use the features for social interactions. Though the mentalist theorists do not believe in the concept of learning language through stimulus- response, their claim in language learning processes does not deny exposure to language culture as being practised in the environment of the learner/ child. The crux of the matter in acquiring the needed tools of language of communication is exposure. The correct language habit is formed through exposure to the right language model .Good language habit is developed as the child/learner imitates the linguistics tit-bits which the mature speakers often demonstrate before him. The drama is carried out through repetition, recapitulation and replication. In language pedagogy, the best methodology is explored in order to develop the standard and globally acceptable linguistic norms in the child/learner as regards the Language of Wider Communication (LWC).</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Despite the importance attached to the English Language, and efforts made by stake holders in the educational sector to optimize the learning of English Language as a school subject, students’ achievement in English Language has not commensurate to the investment made in it. There has been a fall in students’ academic achievement in English Language over the years as compared to other subjects in the school system. Evidence abounds that students have not been doing well in English Language.</p> <p>Nigeria as a country, has been suffering from a disgustingly high rate of students‘failure in key subjects (Eze, 2011) among which is English Language, the language of administration in government and medium of instruction in Nigerian schools. This failure rate has attracted the attention of educators, educationists and educational researchers in investigating its causes Unfortunately, not much consideration has been given to the gender factor in streaming students as a possible vital variable that can impact on students‘ academic performance in Nigeria‘s educational system. This factor is often conspicuously absent in such enumerations. Consequently, of recent, a deliberate and drastic shift from coeducation, much more to singlegender education is fast gaining ground and has prompted several studies, especially outside the shores of Nigeria. This shift to single gender system today in other parts of the world is attributable to a number of research findings that that male and female genders are different in several respects such as the rate of brain development (Lenroot et. al. 2007), brain lateralization (Harriet, Robert &amp; Marvin, 1999, Burman, Tali&amp; James, 2008), brain tasks execution strategies (Gomez, 2011), seeing and hearing endowed capabilities Corso in Algoe 2012), and activeness in the brain. Other differences reported include learning strategies or styles (Vernon-Gestenfeld, 1989 &amp;Hodgins, 2008); and classroom learning climatic conditions (Hodgins, 2008). Each of these poses some pedagogical challenges and consequently, constraining students‘ academic performance if not addressed. This research, therefore, investigated the influence of gender in the use of English language of 400 level students of Sokoto state university. </p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is to ascertain the influence of gender in the use of English language among 400 level students of Sokoto state university; in order to aid the completion of the study, the researcher intends to achieve the following specific objective;</p> <p>i)            To ascertain the influence of gender disparity on the use of English language among student of Sokoto state university</p> <p>ii)           To investigate the relationship between gender disparity and student eloquence in English language</p> <p>iii)         To examine the effect of gender on student academic performance in English language</p> <p>iv)         To ascertain the effect of gender differences on the failure rate in English language</p> <p><strong>1.4      </strong><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>To aid the completion of the study, the following research hypotheses were formulated by the researcher;</p> <p><strong>H0:  </strong>there is no significant relationship between gender disparity and student eloquence in English language in Sokoto state university</p> <p><strong>H1:  </strong>there is a significant relationship between gender disparity and student eloquence in English language in Sokoto state university</p> <p><strong>H0:  </strong>gender disparity does not have any effect on the use of English language among student of Sokoto state university</p> <p><strong>H2:  </strong>gender disparity does have aneffect on the use of English language among student of Sokoto state university</p> <p><strong>1.5      </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>At the completion of the study, it is believed that the findings will be of great importance to English lecturers in higher institutions as the study seek to explore the influence of gender disparity on student eloquence level among 400 level student of Sokoto state university In Nigeria, it is clear that the government does not give much attention to the issue of gendertype when it comes to the matter of streaming or placing students into senior secondary school level or when allocating classes to them in schools. In most cases, government‘s concentration is on career/professional predictions such as arts, science, technical or vocation aptitudes, and day or boarding variables. The exploitation of gender streaming strategy for academic performance implications is never viewed with much seriousness. Therefore, since this study is designed to investigate whether or not streaming students according to gender composition can significantly impact on senior secondary students‘ academic performance particularly, in English Language, its findings may help teachers, school administrators and managers, school counselors, curriculum specialists, teacher trainers and teacher re-trainers.</p> <p><strong>1.6      </strong><strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of the study covers the influence of gender in the use of English language of 400 level students of Sokoto state university.

To sociolinguists, language can never be divorced from the society. Therefore society is of more importance to their study. To scientists, facts can never be ignored in the process of observation; this of course forms the basis of their theorizing. To historians, sourcing information by which ever means to establish historical facts must be strictly adhered to. So also a phonetician believes in the proper study of the properties of individual sounds that make up a language. An aspect of this forms the basis of this research work.</p> <p>This research work aims at analyzing the English fricatives as used among the Yoruba speakers of English language.</p> <p>·        This research work is limited to only the Yoruba people, who dwell in the southern part of the country, Nigeria particularly within the terrain of Oyo state.</p> <p><strong>1.1    BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The research work is analytical in nature, and this is due to the fact that data shall be closely examined, in order to arrive at the major determinants of the wrong or the right realization of the fricative sounds as used among our respondents. That is, each respondent data shall fully be analyzed and if there is need for comparing of data, it shall be exhaustively done.</p> <p><strong>1.2    AIM OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of research work is to carry out a task in order to establish which of the factor(s) is or are responsible for the wrong or right realization of the English fricative sounds;</p> <p>This research work aims at enlightening the readers that some of the already existing factors might be proved wrong based on the practical analysis that will be carried out from the responses of the respondents.</p> <p>For the purpose of this research, the Received Pronunciation (R.P) will be used as the standard pronunciation model for the explanation of the deviation noticed in the variants of the sound segments under the study. This is chosen due to its prestigious position as a dialect that is taught in the public schools and its relevance to our field. Eventually, the study will serve as a check on the performance of English sound segments.</p> <p>Whatever discovery is made in this connection will aid a further study on the teaching of the phonological segments to students at all level of learning in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3     SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Every academic research work is carried out within a specific scope to make researchers have focus in their work. This research would look at English fricative used among the Yoruba speaker of English language; thus, the research would be focusing on the speaker who are literate and how the English fricative are being used. Literacy is the ability to read and write, thus, this research tends to look at that in secondary school and in the higher institution as the literate Yoruba speakers of English.</p> <p><strong>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The significance of this research work is to appreciate the Yoruba speakers of English Language bearing in mind the fact that some English fricative sounds are not present in the Yoruba consonant chart.</p> <p>Consequently, a good understanding of this research work requires a mental dissociation from the knowledge letters and a concentration on sounds as they are produced rather than how they are spelt. It has been observed over time that second language learners often allow their knowledge of letters to interfere with the learning of English sounds/fricatives. Example, at the phonemic level of interference, English Language for instance, has the voiceless fricatives<em>/θ/ </em>which is absent in the Yoruba language. For this sound the Yoruba speakers of English substitute the voiceless alveolar fricative <em>/t/.</em></p> <p>Thus, the English word think /<em>θ</em>iηk/ is realized as <em>/tink/. </em>At the end of this research work, Yoruba learners should therefore concentrate on how sounds are pronounced rather than how they are spelt.</p> <p><strong>1.5    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Quite a number of scholars had made contributions regarding the factor responsible for the difficulties in the realization of some fricative sounds such as <em>lv, </em>z, <em>θ</em>, d, <em>3,/. </em>This out rightly is the centre core of this research work.</p> <p>The difficult sounds as listed above are sometime correctly articulated in words by some Yoruba users of the English fricatives, while others or a few use them wrongly. These therefore, form the tasks which this research work seeks to provide answer(s) to. In lieu of this, the research work shall seek various and the possible reason for these noticeable problems among second language speakers of English.</p> <p><strong>1.6    THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</strong></p> <p>The theoretical framework for this research is phonology. Phonology is said to be the study of some sounds system of a particular language. It can equally be said to be the study of human sounds with due regard to their patterning and function in a particular language.</p> <p>Phonology is a level or pattern of linguistic arrangement of significant sounds into a meaningful production of significant sound for their phonetics.</p> <p> The basic unit of phonology is called phoneme which is defined as the sound system of a language that can keep utterance apart. There are some principal rules used to establish the phonemes of any Yoruba language.</p> <p>They are:</p> <p>·        Contrast through minimal pairs</p> <p>·        Complementary Distribution</p> <p>·        Phonetic similarity.</p> <p>Finally, phonemes are realized and achieved differently. As a phonetician there is an account for different realizations.</p> <p><strong>1.7    STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>The following hypothetical statements shall be tested at the end of this research.</p> <p><strong>H1</strong>:    Yoruba learners of English pronounce some sounds according to their understanding.</p> <p><strong>H2</strong>:    Some Yoruba users of the English fricative do not recognize minimal pair</p> <p>/f, v/.</p> <p><strong>H3</strong>:    Most voiced fricative sounds are usually difficult to articulate by Yoruba speakers of English.</p> <p><strong>H4:   </strong>Voiceless fricatives are easily articulated by the Yoruba speaker of the English Language.</p> <p><strong>H5:    </strong>Consonant cluster usually serves as barriers to most Yoruba speakers of the Fricatives.</p> <p><br/></p>                                                           \n\nA PHONELOGICAL ANALYSIS OF ENGLISH FRICATIVES AS USED AMONG THE YORUBA SPEAKERS OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A PHONELOGICAL ANALYSIS OF ENGLISH FRICATIVES AS USED AMONG THE YORUBA SPEAKERS OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE", "id": 173}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Language learning practice often assumes that most of the difficulties that learners encounter in the study of language are consequences of the degree to which the native languages differ from the English of the native speakers.</p> <p>This research work is basically analyzed problems of pronunciation among the non-native speakers of English, especially the Yoruba People. The Yoruba Speakers of English encounter problems in pronouncing some English sounds because they are not aware that some English Phonemes exist. Some are aware but do not know where and how to use them.</p> <p>Examples of these sounds are: <em>/θ, ð, Ʒ,</em> z, J, ٨, Ʒ: ǝ/. Therefore, they replaced the listed sounds with the familiar ones in the Yoruba phoneme system for example: <em>/d/ </em>for /<em> ð</em> /.  Thus, a Yoruba speaker substitute the sound <em>/d/ </em>for <em>/ ð / in </em>the word 'father'.  Hence, the word 'father'<em>/fa: ð</em>әr// is then realized as <em>‘/fa:d</em>ӕ<em>/.</em></p> <p>This project analyzed some factors responsible for the mispronunciation of the English sound system and suggest ways those problems can be reduced if not curbed.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In learning to speak a second language, one's goal is usually to be as competent as the native speakers of that language; and if not, one will strive to be intelligible to any speaker of that language. Depending on when one's attempt at bilingualism starts, it is often possible before the age of puberty to acquire near-native competence in a second language.</p> <p>Most speakers of English around the world today are second or foreign language users. Estimates of the number of speakers of English globally range between seven hundred million and eight hundred million, about three hundred million of whom speak the language as native users. These are people who use the language as their first language are made up of speakers in the United States of America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Most of the speakers in the formal British territories of Africa, India, the Caribbeans and Asia speak English as a second language. That is, these speakers acquire a native language first before they come to learn English. A considerable numbers users merely use the language as a window on the world as foreign speakers.</p> <p>Native speakers are those who have acquired the language naturally as their first language during childhood and who are said to be norm generating; second language users are those who have acquired the language after acquiring another language but who make almost daily use of the second language for intercommunal functions because of the multilingual nature of their societies. For most of the users of English as second language in Africa and Asia, the English language is also their official language, that is, the language of government, of the judiciary, of business and inter-ethnic communication. For all these users to keep to the norms of the native English speakers, influences or inferences phenomena from their native languages environment make them develop new norms that may not be consistent with native norms. The third category of speakers are foreign speakers; those who learn and use the language for no real need for it except for travel and access to English culture, but can do without using the language in their daily lives. For these users, the goal of learning is that foreign users come close to this goal.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>Received pronunciation (RP) in second language situations especially in former British territories, the dialect of the English language is usually taught is so­-called RP as described by A.J Ellis (1896: 23)</p> <p>Received Pronunciation all over the country, not widely differing in any locality, and admitting a certain degree of variety, may be considered as the educated pronunciation of the metropolis, of the court, the pulpit and the bar.</p> <p>Second language user of English has a number of difficulties in the pronunciation of utterances of English, difficulties arising mainly from interference of the sound patterns of their native languages on the sound systems of English orthography and difficulties arising from their mode of learning the English language. As an example of the first type of difficulty, most Nigerian speakers of English substitute <em>/t/ </em>for <em>/θ/ </em>in thin <em>/tin/ </em>and <em>/d/ </em>for <em>/ð/ </em>as in this <em>/ðis/ </em>because most Nigerian languages do not have dental fricative; the closest to these English sounds in their native languages are thus substituted for these sounds. Others substitute <em>/s/ </em>for <em>/θ/ </em>and sound <em>/z/ </em>for sound <em>/z/  </em>because there is no one on one correspondent of English letters to English sounds. Most Yoruba's pronounce the words: says, victual, bomb, cupboard, sing, wanted danced, Greenwich, honour, come, boys, as /seis, vik ʃ uæl, bomb, kopᴅd, sing, wanted, danzd, grinwis, hᴅna, kᴅm, bᴅis/ instead of /sez, vitl, bᴅm, k˄bᴐd, siᵑ,wᴅntid, danst, grinwit ʃ , ᴅn∂, k˄m, bᴐ :z/respectively.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>Examples of the type of learners' difficulty arise largely because most of those who teach English language as a second language are themselves not very competent in the language. The same source of difficulty is responsible for most Nigerian speakers of English not distinguishing between high tense and lax vowels in seat and sit, pool and pull when these contrasts are operative in some of their first language.</p> <p>Some of learners' difficulties are more important than others as capable of interfering with intelligibility. Cues for intelligibility are hierarchical in English. Intonation comes first, followed by consonant sounds while vowel sounds come lowest. We shall therefore look at learners' difficulties with these in mind. Therefore, pronunciation among- the Yoruba speakers of English has been identified as a problem which we are set to investigate and proffer possible solutions which would help the audience to pronounce English wopdis better.</p> <p><strong>1.2    AIM OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Our aims of undertaking this project include but not limited to the following:</p> <p>·        To practically carry out a careful test in order to establish which of the factor(s) is/are responsible for the wrong pronunciation of sounds.</p> <p>·        To conscientizing our readers that some of the already existing factors might be proved wrong based on the practical analysis that will be carried out from the respondents' response.</p> <p>·        To aid a further study on the teaching of the phonological segment and suprasegmentals to student at all levels of learning in Nigeria</p> <p>In this research, the Received Pronunciation (RP) will be used as the norm or the standard pronunciation model for the explanation of the deviation noticed in the variants of the sound segments. This is chosen due to its prestigious position as a dialect that is taught in the public school and its relevance to our field. Therefore, the study will serve as a check on the performance of the English sounds.</p> <p><strong>1.3    SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of the study is the spoken/pronunciation of selected words ill English language by the Yoruba speakers of English.</p> <p><strong>1.4    SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The significant of this research work is to emphasis on the wrong pronunciation of sounds especially those that are as a result of background factors, which cannot yet be determined until the final stage of this research is reached. The research therefore assures us that all factors that are likely to be responsible for the wrong or right pronunciation of the sounds will be drawn and looked into. It was noticed that the Yoruba speakers of English often transfer their mother tongue knowledge of alphabets or letters to English words. Example are: 'fever' pronounced as 'fifa' by a Yoruba speaker instead of <em>/fi:v</em><em>∂</em><em>/  </em>'church' is pronounced as 'shurch'. The speaker substitutes <em>/ʃ/ </em>for <em>/tʃ/ </em>sound, 'check' is also pronounced as 'sheck' e.t.c</p> <p><strong>1.5    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The problem to be analyzed in this research is the problem of pronunciation by the Yoruba speakers of English. The research work is meant to test and see if truly the transfer of Ll to L2 (that is, the Yoruba phonetic system and the English phonemic system) are the major causes of the problem of pronunciation by the Yoruba users of English sounds in attaining the Received Pronunciation standard. Other factors that would be examined as part of the problems include, educational background, level of exposure, status e.t,c. The mispronunciations of the English words have been identified as a problem which would help our respondents to pronounce English words better.</p> <p><strong>1.6    THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK (PHONOLOGY)</strong></p> <p>Phonology is a level of linguistic organization of significant sounds for which it provides rules not only of their phonetic realization but also of their distribution. According to Fromkim and Rodman (1974), it is also the term used to refer to the kind of knowledge that speakers have about the sound patterns of their particular language. It can therefore be summarized that phonology of a language is the system and pattern of the speech sounds and the tacit knowledge that the speakers have of the sounds. Phonology will answer the following questions:</p> <p>·        What are the peculiar sounds of this language?</p> <p>·        How are they joined together to form meaningful units</p> <p>·        What are the rules that affect sound protection and structuring in the language?</p> <p>The basic unit of phonology is the phoneme, usually defined as the minimal unit in the sound system of a language that can keep utterances apart. To establish the phonemes of any language, a number of principles are used namely:</p> <p>·                                 Contrast</p> <p>·                                 Complementary distribution</p> <p>·                                 Phonetic similarity</p> <p>Adetugbo (1997) defines phonology \"as the study of speech sound which constitutes a system in any language\".</p> <p>Yule (1996:56) defines phonology \"as the description of the systems and patterns of speech sounds in a language. The perception of phonology from this stand point places it as a branch of linguistics that deals with the mental recognition of the speech sound of language.</p> <p><strong>1.7    METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>Our methodology shall be segmented into two main parts. We shall be having the mode of our respondents and the mode of our date collection as well as sources of our information.</p> <p>In our mode of respondents, we shall be having respondents being represented from a selected secondary school and the Lagos State University. In other words our respondents shall constitute the class of undergraduates including 'professionals'. The reason for ibis cannot be far fetched, though the non-students or students belong to undergraduate level will also be used for this analysis but for the purpose of clear analyses, we have decided to make use of majority of the undergraduate the Lagos State University. In our mode of data collection, we shall be adopting the interview method of analyses as to alternate the questionnaire method. This method has been strongly chosen because much of what we shall be doing in our research work shall involve practical. We have decided interview method be used in our data collection. The method of our interview shall be a one – one discussion with our respondents. Some words will be written out for our respondents to be pronounced. This will be the last lap of our interview with our respondents.</p> <p>Our research work is going to be mainly of field work; however, we are going to review some relevant materials on the research work. In other to do this, we shall be relying on library as our source of information.</p> <p><strong>1.8    CONCLUSION</strong></p> <p>This chapter has introduced this research; we embark on with the background to the study, problem of research, objective, scope and theoretical framework of the research. This has established our research and paved way for smooth progression and we hope to arrive at concrete findings at the end of this research work.</p>                                                           \n\nANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEMS OF ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION AMONG YORUBA SPEAKERS, OF ENGLISH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEMS OF ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION AMONG YORUBA SPEAKERS, OF ENGLISH", "id": 174}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Literature has some unique features that make it admirable. It is these features that possess the power that spark off the change in people. An understanding of these features helps us to understand literature better. Such features as Theme, Style, Plot, Character and Characterization, Setting etc. All these deal with peoples' emotions and their environments. Literary appreciation, as well as criticism has helped to expose and entrench these features. In sum, literature through its aesthetic and artistry have shaped and affected the society positively. When you read any literary work, you find yourself in the work which expresses some of the features mentioned earlier.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research entitled \"Literature\" a vehicle for social change\" sets out to study how literature can bring about change in the society.</p> <p>In this research I might use the word \"vehicle\" and \"tool\" interchangeably, in addition to the words \"change” and \"development\" in order to achieve the objective set for this work.</p> <p>The issue of whether literature has the capacity to trigger off a revolution has been an enduring controversy. Some people believe it does not, while others argue that literature is of no use if writers write and no one reads what they write. A work of art becomes effective only when it is read. A writer and critic, Kole Omotoso has more to say on this;</p> <p><em>The society has to use what it produces for literature to be relevant. For instance, had not responded to some of the 18th and 19th century novels depicting the suffering in Russia, the Russian revolution would not have happened. It was when a member of the British parliament read Charles Dickens' representation of poetry in London in Oliver Twist that they decided in </em>1832 to <em>come up with an education act.</em></p> <p>... <em>I still insist that literature has no function, except that which </em>is <em>given it by those who read it. On its own, it cannot change anything unless someone responds to the work and </em>does <em>something with it. If there </em>is <em>no response to literature, there </em>is <em>little literature can do (Ezeigbo 2000-13).</em></p> <p>What we deduce from Omotoso's assertion is the fact that literature can be a catalyst to revolutionary change. What is required is for an individual (a reader) or individuals (readers) to apply the knowledge, the information gathered from literature to bring social change.</p> <p>The unrelenting persecution faced by writers all over the world is a clear indication that literature can indeed be a weapon to achieve change, which bad leaders dread; hence the persecution of courageous writers. In apartheid South Africa, in Kenya during the time of Arap Moi, in Nigeria under Abacha, and in Eastern European countries during the cold war, many writers faced death sentence, imprisonment and detention as a result of their work and their· activism. Literature is a threat to dictators. Bad leaders fear and hate writers and their works.</p> <p>In traditional African society, art was functional, and the artist, performer or story teller was fully aware of this. The traditional oral artist knows the didactic role his/her art had to play and geared the performance towards achieving that end (Ezeigbo 2000: 57-58). Thus in such a society, art was placed at the service of the society. Modern African writers are a product of their species of the traditional society. At the African-scandinavian writer's conference in Stockholm in 1967, Soyinka, among other things, declared \"the artist has always functioned in African societies as the record of mores and experiences of his society and as the voice of vision in his time\" (21).</p> <p>Perhaps writers elsewhere have not always thought it their responsibility to direct their societies. For instance the followers of \"The Aesthetic Movement\" believed in the dictum\" art for arts sake\" and defended this position in the late 19th century Europe.</p> <p>This type of attitude has been rejected by most African writers. Chinue Achebe believes that the writer \"should match right in front\" in \"the task of re-education and re-generation that must be done and that the artist is \"the sensitive point in his community\" (45). Agreeing, with Soyinka and Achebe, Romanus Egude adds that the literary artist\" dissects the society not only at its political level but also at its moral levels\" (64).</p> <p>This is what other writers have done over the years Since Nigerian literature came of age with the publication of Achebe's Things Fall Apart in 1958. Our writers are among the best in the world; they are contributing through the power of their imagination and artistic creativity to the growth of literary productions that are changing the face of world literature, Writers, with award wining titles, like Chinue Achebe, Wole Soyinka, Buchi Emecheta, Ben Okri, NiyiOsundare, Femi, Osofisan, Zainab Alkali, Helon Habila, Chimamanda Adichie, Promise Ogochukwu and others have put Nigerian literature in the world's literary hall of fame and contributed to Nigeria's cultural and intellectual development. They have used art as a means of effecting revolutionary changes in society.</p> <p>It seems proper to mention the contribution women writers have made in engendering equity and parity in gender relations and in creating awareness of the plight of women in the world's largely patriarchal societies. From Europe to the Americas, Asia and Africa, women writers have consistently portrayed the injustice the female gender faces from birth to old age. There is no doubt that some of the finest prose writers-novelist especially-in the world, past and present, have been women. This is even more evident in the African literary tradition.</p> <p>Modern writers like Virginia Woolf, Margret Drabble, Emma Tennant, Tone Morrison, Alue Walker, Buchi Emecheta, Flora Nwapa, Yvonne Vera, Zaynab Alkali, Tess Onwueme, Grace Ogot etc, raised women's consciousness, addressed the politics, thus drawing attention to the fact that women are subjugated and marginalized. It is obvious that culture is pivotal in the consideration of gender difference (Ezeigbo 1996). Culture plays a prominent role in the subordination of women· to a subaltern position in discourse and in real life (Ezeegbo 2005).</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>As earlier remarked, this research sets out to study how literature can change the society. There are many ways literature can change the society I Shall be mentioning few of them.</p> <p>·       Literature teaches. It is teach us everything about humanity. It is important to know that no writer writes in a vacuum. What they depict In their writings is the experience of people in their environments and societies of which are either good or bad. If good, it is encouraged but if bad, it is corrected.  A good teaching generally is designed to bring about a change in behaviour. If literature goes on to achieve this, then literature is good and should be encouraged.</p> <p>·       I also want to point out here that literature helps to develop and promote language. Apart from English which has over the years become the official and second language to most countries of the world, including Africa, most African local language have entered into English lexicon what we have as Nigerian language today is part of the development and promotion of language. There is no other field of discipline that develops and promotes language like literature. It is only in a literary piece you can find such Nigerian English as \"Oga\", \"botton power\" \"go-slow\", \"garri\", \"agbada\".</p> <p>·       Literature promotes and preserves culture. You, get to know about people's culture through their literature. African culture and tradition have commanded attention of many people of the world through their literature, just like people from other continents of the world. For instance, the culture of the Igbo people in the eastern part of Nigeria is captured in Acbebe's Things Fall Apart before the corning of the Whiteman. The younger generations are brought to the knowledge.</p> <p>·       Literature preserves history. For instance, the Nigerian civil war story would have been forgotten if writers like Adichie in her Half of the Yellow Sun and the playwright Onyebuchi's Bleeding scare (2005) to mention a few.</p> <p>·       Literature also entertains. It is meant to entertain. It brings happiness. Literature elicits the beating of nature. It is for relaxation. It mirrors the society.</p> <p><strong>1.3     AIMS AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research work is to sensitize the society on the need to develop a reading culture on literary works. It is also aimed at exposing the hidden powers that literature possesses. Literature is not just for pleasure. There is more to it in our quest for societal changed</p> <p><strong>1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The significance of the study will be drawn as we progress in the course of this research work.</p> <p><strong>1.5     RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In the course of this project work, the following questions will be addressed;</p> <p>·       Has literature the ability to change the society?</p> <p>·       What are those features in literature that helps it achieve</p> <p>this change?</p> <p>·       Are the societies willing to change?</p> <p>·       What is the relationship between literature and history?</p> <p>·       What is the relationship between literature and culture?</p> <p>·       How is the government encouraging up-coming artist?</p> <p><strong>1.6     SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of this study captures little part of English, American, East African and finally narrowed down to Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.7     LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study can only be limited by time and non-availability of data etc.</p> <p><strong>1.8     DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>Different terms will be used in the course of this research work and they will be well defined</p> <p>·       <strong>HISTORY: </strong>This is the events of the past records of people, nations and their culture.</p> <p>·       <strong>CULTURE: </strong>This is the way of life and value of people.</p> <p>·       <strong>RELIGION: </strong>This is the relationship between God and man through indirect and direct contact.</p> <p>·       <strong>SOCIETY: </strong>It is a cluster of people with the same speech and cultural belief.</p> <p>·       <strong>SETTING: </strong>Itis the location and time of an event.</p> <p>·       <strong>THEME:</strong> Itis the central idea of a story.</p> <p>·       <strong>DICTION: </strong>Itis the choice of language.</p> <p>·       <strong>PLOT: </strong>It is the story-line of the event.</p>                                                           \n\nLITERATURE: THE VEHICLE FOR SOCIAL CHANGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " LITERATURE: THE VEHICLE FOR SOCIAL CHANGE", "id": 175}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The link between literary studies and linguistics is language. It is the process through Which the thought and intension of a writer or a speaker is conveyed to the reader or Listener. The beauty of any writing is the ability of the writer to effectively employ Language to construct meaning. Linguistics is the study of language in general and of a particular structure. It is also a scientific study of language meanings.</p> <p>Language functions to express moods and emotions of the individual. Language is inseparable from human beings; that is human beings cannot survive without language. The reason is that in all our activities, we employ language overtly or covertly. The transmission of shared knowledge; customs and beliefs, feelings, ideals and attitude would be practically impossible without language. It is one of the closest things to man and very fundamental to his self-fulfillment; that is, it is the most important part of a total system of human behavior in society.</p> <p>On other hand, language has been defined: fractionally as a means of communicating ideas; emotions, and desire by means of a system of voluntarily produced symbols. It is a variety of speech or body of words and a mode of expressing thought and feelings of the society or an individual. Language is the most effective means of dissemination of information .</p> <p>Writers do not just disseminate information any how but in an appropriate way based on the genre of the discourse. A writer must use a language to communicate his view to the society before his meaning can be deducted.  And since there is no meaning without communication, communication is a central and fundamental aspect of all human interaction. Though communication is an individual dissemination of both written and spoken information, every human being communicates with another in a speech community. Literature mirrors life. It employs the imagination and the resources of language to present important facts of life. It is the use of words to create an illusion of life.</p> <p>In sum, the use of language provides the rules while literature expands the rules to produce the best expressions in the language. It is the creative and stylistics way of using language that makes it different from other discourses. Poetry as one of the genres of literature explores language in unique way that differentiates it from other genres such as prose and drama. It is a spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings recollected in tranquility. Poetry uses elevated and pleasurable language in a unique way. Webster's dictionary defines a poem as</p> <p>\"An arrangement of words in verse, especially rhythmical composition of ideas, emotions in a style more concentrated, imaginative' and powerful than ordinary speech.\"</p> </div> <div> <p>It springs from deep human impulses and fulfill human needs (Warren, 1986: 2-3). Poetry is deeply involved in the expression of emotion such as love, hate, pain, joy, grief etc All these feelings and more can be communicated to the reader/audience by proper choice of words - language which includes style and stylistics.</p> <p>The choice of language use in poetry to convey the idea of the poet is of great importance. The diction carries metaphorical meaning through the creative use of language. The poet carefully selects his words that contain concrete meanings that needed to be broken down to readers to understand. These words are syntactically arranged to achieve stylistic effects. The stylistic effects of the poetic language indicate the peculiarity of how they are used by poets. Poets enjoy language immunity to do harm to normal grammatical structure so as to project certain ideas, beautify language or generate new expressions that will jolt us out of our mental stupor. This immunity is called \"poetic license\". It enables them to use language in their own way - customized or specialized manner.</p> <p>Stylistic analysis aims at giving objective account of how language is used in a literacy piece. It provides a close analysis for the purpose of understanding the possible meanings in a work of art. Stylistics is the bridge between language and literature (Leech. 1969). It is s systematic way of exploring literary texts. It looks at the language of texts and tries to explain how that language gives meaning, style and effects to the texts. It is the study of the variation in language style that is dependent on the situation in which the language is used, and also on the effect the writer or speaker wishes to create on the readers or hearers. On the other hand, stylistic sometimes include investigations of spoken language in a literary work and choice that are available to a writer. Stylistics is the study of style. Style is a manner of language used by poet. Style in a work of art therefore is the choice of dictions or words. The style is simply identified as the peculiar way an individual uses language to covey meaning.</p> <p>Poets, can use language in different ways which include praises, poetry (that show attributes and appellation), epic (which narrates historical events)\" ode (which appreciates nature and natural objects), dirge (which laments the death of beloved one in mourning), elegy (which expresses complaints about love) and satire (which is a sarcastic poem that ridicules people or institutions and vices going on in the society).  Each of these forms of poetry uses language in their peculiar ways that enables it pass the message across effectively.</p> <p>This study is the stylistic variation of the language use by Wole Soyinka and Oswald Mbuyiseni Mtshali carry out this study on the stylistic variation of the language use in expressing their feelings to the society. Wole Soyinka's variation of language to express how disappointed he was by the racial prejudice of the whites in Britain where he has gone in search of the Golden Fleece. Also, Oswald Mtshali expresses the opposition of the African to the white man's expressions.</p> <p>Language may refer either specifically to human capacity for acquiring and using complex system of communication or to a specific instance of such a complex system of signs for encoding and decoding information. The human language faculty is thought to be fundamentally different and of much higher complexity from those of other creatures. Human language is highly complex in that it is based on a set of rules relating to symbols for their meanings.</p> <p>Graghological effect of language which is the physical features that shows strangeness in the use of language and the features such as capitalization, spelling, punctuation and arrangement of verses and stanzas, italicization, indentation and other relevant features are studied in this research. The aim of this study therefore is to find out how language use in literature with particular reference to poetry helps in conveying meaning/creating effect.</p> <p><strong>AIM OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to investigate how poets to communicate ideas, emotions and feelings to the reader or listener use language.</p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>(1)     The primary objective of the study is to find out the relationship between \"language and how it is used as it relates to poetry.</p> </div> <p>(2)     The study also seeks to know how the graghological and lexical analysis of language used by poets has significant role to play in the communication of meaning.</p> <p>(3)     It is also set to establish that language is extremely important in all human endeavors based on how it is used.</p> <p>(4)     The study will take a close look at how poetry uses language in a specialized way to convey meaning.</p> <p>(5)     It will determine the link between language and poetry.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>Literature is divided into three major genres namely drama, poetry and prose. Each of the three genres bas its peculiar features. While drama and prose can be said to be written in simple language that can be easily understood, poetry is not. It is rather written in an elevated/embellished language. This makes it more difficult for ordinary minded person to fully grasp or comprehend the message of the poet at first reading.</p> <p>This study therefore aims at analyzing the styles of the language used by poets under study as guide in making poetic works more comprehensible to reader especially the ordinary minded one.</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH  HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>Research hypothetical statements made in this study stand as our assumptions. These assumptions are in agreement with our objectives .</p> <p>Is there any specific ways in which poets use language?</p> <p>To what extent do poets communicate their message and meanings in a unique way?</p> <p>To what extent is poetry unique from other literary genres?</p> <p>To what extent does a poet explore his own style?</p> <p>To what extent do poets use language to differentiate their writings from other forms of literature?</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of the study is to expose readers particularly the young ones to the nitty gritty of reading, understanding and actually enjoying poetry.</p> <p>This study also aims at disabusing the minds of literature students of the age long belief that poetry is \"acidic\" and thus a no go area.</p> <p>It is also aimed at equipping students with the knowledge of style and stylistics which will show them the hidden joys that poetry can give.</p> <p><strong>SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The research will cover the study of stylistic use of language, which is carried out on the selected poems from Wole Soyinka's Telephone Conversation and Oswald Mbuyiseni Mtshali's Nightfall in Soweto. The study will cover the graphological and lexical analysis alone on the selected poems to show the physical features of the lexical items in the poems.</p> <p><strong>LIMITATIONS OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study would have taken a broader dimension if not for time limit. I would have loved to travel to places of domain of the poets to meet them one on one and get exactly their feelings as they write the poems. But this is impossible because of financial constraints.

Literature by implication springs from our in-born live of narrating a story or experiences. It is the totality of man's action in his social environment</p> <p><strong>GENRES OF LITERATURE</strong></p> <p>All literary works are grouped under three basic classes. These classes are technically termed genres. The three branches of literature constitute the component parts of imaginative or artistic creative work. Have the following.</p> <p>·        DRAMA</p> <p>·        PROSE/NOVEL</p> <p>·        POETRY</p> <p>The basic difference in this various divisions depends on the narrative language used in each of them.</p> <p><strong>NATURE OF PROSE</strong></p> <p>Prose basically refers to all types of writing that use the normal linguistic apparatus, marked by plain sentences, paragraphs and chapters, as distinct from drama and poetry. It is unique as a form of story telling art characterized by a subject matter.</p> <p>Prose means an ordinary form of spoken or written language. It is arranged in verses and rhymes. It comes, in sentences form through dialogue and conversation, the sentences are added together to make paragraphs. Prose is a genre(s) of literature which is one of the subjects in the school curriculum. It explains, describes and narrates events.</p> <p>Adejumo (2003) claims that ''prose simply means story telling\" It requires that usual comprehensive skill that has the ability to identify the imagery or figurative expression used in the chapters.</p> <p>Prose demands the individual interest, dedication, commitment and, time. It should be noted that even English language which is considered very important cannot stand without literature and there is no way a teacher will teach Iiterature without English prose being integrated in it.</p> <p><strong>TYPES OF PROSE</strong></p> <p>There are sub-genres of prose like short story, the novel, novella and the novelette.</p> <p><strong>The Short Story</strong>: This is the shortest form of prose that shares all that features of an averages novel. The short story simply distances itself from the novel by its length or coverage.  It is absolutely complete on its own, in terms of presentation of characters, setting and theme.</p> <p><strong>The Novel</strong>:  The novel is the most ambitious of the sub-genres of prose. It relates its story in manners resembling the others sub-genres, nonetheless, it does this through a rational coverage.  It is total and wide ranging in its coverage of those actions presented. Moreover, characters are wholly developed, with well marked-out complexities, presented in a relaxed manner. </p> <p><strong>The Novella:</strong> The word novella is an Italian word applied by the Italian writer Giovanni Boccaccio. It is an known as the intermediary prose form; this is varied between the short story and novel, equally sharing all the qualities of the novel.  It reveals a natural tendency of being longer than the short story but shorter than the novel.</p> <p><strong>The Novelette:</strong>  The novelette is another Italian word for the genres which is an anthology of short stories.  More than one story is incorporated within the volume of novelette.</p> <p>The problems encountered in teaching  and learning of prose and the suggestion of possible solutions as well as what should be the teachers role in teaching and learning of prose constitute our focus in this study.</p> <p>Over the years the rate at which students fails their final examinations especially in literature (prose) has given causes for public concern.  The achievements of students in WASC examinations for the past five years was nothing to write on according to Momoh (2010). Many blame the government  for this deficiency while others believe that parents and even teachers are parties to the failure of the students themselves.  It is therefore against this back chop that we decided to carry out this research in other to find solution to the stated problems and possibly improve the teaching and learning of prose in schools.</p> <p>It is our believed that having outlined the problems of teaching and learning the above subject.  Useful recommendations and suggestions for overcoming such problems could then be offered with a view to improving the teaching and Iearning of prose (literature) not only in the selected schools, but also for others offering the course as well.  Education planners Curriculum developments, teachers, student and others concerned individual could find this project useful.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The study is to find possible solution to making the teaching and learning of prose effective in Oko-Afo Senior Secondary School and</p> <p>Government Senior College, Badagry. The following problems are outlined.</p> <p>First the problem of qualified teacher is a great hindrance that affects the teaching of prose in schools.</p> <p>Second the issue of overcrowding in class of literature (prose) makes learning ineffective in a literature class.</p> <p>Also, the, problem, of instructional materials is another issue facing student’s performance in English literature.</p> <p>However the problem of irrelevant textbooks affects the effectives of prose teaching.</p> <p><strong>1.3    PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research project is designed to investigate the following.</p> <p>1.     To identify and examine the cause of the problems of the students failures in literature in external examinations.</p> <p>2.     To investigate the teachers role in teaching prose in our data.</p> <p>3.      To examine factors that enhances and negates the teaching and learning of prose in Oko-Afo Senior Secondary School and Government Senior College Badagry.</p> <p>4.      To proffer possible solution to make the teaching and learning of prose meaningful.</p> <p><strong>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The following are raised to guide the research study in finding solutions to problems of teaching and learning of prose in Oko-Afo Senior Secondary</p> <p>School and Government Senior College Badagry.</p> <p>1.     What are the causes of students' failure in literature in examinations?</p> <p>2.     To what extent does the teacher of literature contribute in students performance in the learning of literature in schools.</p> <p>3.     What factors enhance and negate the students learning literature in schools.</p> <p>4.     What is the solution to effectives teaching and learning of literature in our chosen data?</p> <p>5.     What are the criteria for choosing textbooks at secondary school level?</p> <p><strong>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The teacher and student of English will find the result of this study helpful in many ways.</p> <p>1.        It could serves as sources of further knowledge in solving problems that might be militating against the effective teaching and learning of prose.</p> <p>2.        This research project will help teachers in Oko-Afo senior secondary</p> <p>schools and government senior college Badagry and help students development their vocabulary and reading speed.</p> <p>3.        It also hoped that this project will help the students to re-shape their reading ability and vocabulary.</p> <p>Some useful information derived from the result of this research could be a description about the nature of materials used for teaching of prose, the attitude of teachers towards the subject English and the students.  The project will help the teacher to rectify the deficiency in the subject.</p> <p>The importance of this project study could be felt when most of the solution suggested' are put into practice.  Potentials researchers could find the result useful to them and may serve as stepping stone to provoke further research studies:</p> <p><strong>1.6      LIMITATIQN OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The research tend to make this research study to be of immense value to the teaching and learning of prose in Oko-Afo Senior Secondary Schools and Government Senior College Badagry, it should be comprehensive enough to take care of all secondary schools.</p> <p>The study is limited to Oko-Afo Senior Secondary School and Government Senior College Badagry while selected samples were obtained from the students and teachers.</p> <p>The research work is limited to only novels as a sub-genre of prose.</p> <p><strong>1.7    DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is delimited to the problems of teaching and learning prose in two selected schools in Badagry. The researchers delimit the research work to Oko-Afo Senior Secondary School and Government Senior College Badagry.</p>                                                           \n\nTEACHING AND LEARNING PROSE IN SCHOOLS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " TEACHING AND LEARNING PROSE IN SCHOOLS", "id": 177}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    BRIEF HISTORY OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE</strong></p> <p>As indicated in the introductory part, this chapter of the study is going to examine the work of other linguists or scholars that are applicable to the subject under investigation. We are also going to examine different phonological theories and their relevance to the subject. We need to know about the historical invention of English language.</p> <p>The family of languages to which English belongs to is called Indo-European, a name which derives from the geographical range over which these languages were spoken before some of them spread to the new world \"<strong>INDO</strong>\" - refers to the fact that many of the daughter languages from earliest recorded times were spoken on the Indian Subcontinent and \"<strong>EUROPEAN</strong>\" - refers to the fact that from equally early times, most of the languages of Europe are descended from that common ancestor too.</p> <p>From an anonymous 5th century chronicles we learn that in 441 - 442 the Germanic tribe of Saxons conquered Britain. after prolonged harassment. Another version was given by a Celtic preacher and chronicler Gilda’s says that the Saxons were invited to Britain to assist in protecting the Island from an invasion from the North, they were given lands and allowed to settle in the eastern part of Britain.</p> <p>The authoritative Ecclesiastical History of the English People written in 731 by the English cleric and historian venerable Adams Bede dates the first landing of the Germanic Wamosin Britain to the year 449.</p> <p>The Celts were the first settlers of Britain, they were subdued and eventually ruled and sheltered by the Romans. They were ruled by Romans for 400 years, Celts were defenseless, the languages spoken then was Angle-ish and the name of the country England comes from Angle-land. The Romans loose their grip on Angle-land territory because maintaining occupation forces is so expensive so the Romans were conquered by the barbaric Germanic tribe, they had influence on the English language. Celtic was the first Indo-European tongue spoken in England, it also has influence on English language.</p> <p>The Vickings and Scandinavian influence on English was due to their attack and eventually conquest of England and their language too has an influence on English language.</p> <p>Latin invaded and took over England and their language too overtook the Vicking's influence on English language was prominent then too they all diffuse to make-up English language of today.</p> <p>The four main dialects of old English language were Mercian, Kentish, Northumbrian and West Saxon which is collectively known as Anglian after</p> <p>the process of unification of the diverse Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in 878 by -</p> <p>Alfred the Great, there was a marked decline in the importance of regional</p> <p>dialects. This is not because they stopped existing, regional dialects continued even after that time to this day, as evidence both by the existence of middle and modern English dialects later on, and by common sense people do not spontaneously develop new accents when there is a sudden change of political power.</p> <p>There was a change in pronunciation that began in 1400, while modern English speakers can read Chaucer’s poem with some difficulty, Chaucer’s pronunciation would have being completely unintelligible to the modern ear. Vowels sounds began to move further to the front of the mouth and \"te\" letter \"e\" at the end of words became silent. Chaucer's 'lyf' pronounced leaf</p> <p>became the modern life. In Middle English, name was pronounced 'nam-a',</p> <p>five was pronounced 'feet' and 'down' was pronounced 'doon'. In linguistic term's, the shift was rather sudden, the major changes occurring within a century.</p> <p>The advent of printing press was the major development of English Language in the entire universe. Celtic was the first Indo-European tongue spoken in England, it also has influence on English language.</p> <p>The Vikings and Scandinavian  influence on English was due to their attack and eventually conquest of England and their language too has an influence on English language.</p> <p>Latin later invaded and took over England and their language too overtook the Viking's influence on English language was prominent then too they all diffuse to make-up English language of then and till date.</p> <p>English language is seen as a tree with stems of branches in which phonetics is a branch of it which consists of \"Phonology\".</p> <p>The year 449 AD marks the origin of English language-Norse influence Rome alter overtook England and ruled then for 400years, the language of Christianity Latin has influence in the rise of English language. That period was the old English period which is non-existent today. The period was Bewolf's writing which is unreadable now. The first attempt made by Lord Alfred to standardize it failed. France later over took England and French became their language.</p> <p>In 1476 which was the year that printing press was introduced by William Caxton and Gulberthen brought about standardization of English language,</p> <p>writers have to chose new words in their writings.</p> <p>In 1592 Richard Treatise proposed his treatise, where spellings and grammar became fixed. 1755 - A dictionary of English language was profounded by Daniel Jones.</p> <p>The English Language is one of the exoglossic languages used in Nigeria. It wields so much influence on the Nigeria terrain that it dominates over the 300 local languages that are used in the country.</p> <p>This influence of the English Language in the country can be attributed, to the influence of the colonial leaders and some other native speakers of English, who came into the country even before the colonial leaders e.g. Portuguese. These set of English Language speakers came into the country in the 17th century as missionaries, slave traders and adventurist, they include Irish and the Welsh and English Language (Pidgin) English serves as their means of communication with the illiterates population of African's then.</p> <p>However, the British rule was established in Nigeria in 1900 and led to the influx of many Briton's, who are believed to use the standard form of English Language into the country. Some came into the country as traders, some came as missionaries while some came in as government officials of British colonial rule in Nigeria. This led to the usage of English Language as our official language.</p> <p>Nigeria is a vast and diverse country, a federation of twelve states then, it also occupies 924,000 square kilometers, (356,669 square miles) and has a population of about 70 million, comprising of 250 cultural and linguistic groups of which Yoruba, Hausa and Ibo they have different languages so English Language serves as the only common means of communication between them during the colonial rule and even after independence.</p> <p>The pre-statutory system of the western type of education was the result of</p> <p>the activities of the Christian mission invented in 1842 in the coastal areas</p> <p>and gradually spread to the hinterland of the territory which later became the colony and protectorate of southern Nigeria.</p> <p>The aim of English Language was mainly religious, it is mainly provided for the adults and children converts who had to learn to read the bible, the prayer book and the commentaries and to enhance them in singing hymns. A number of the children were sufficiently proficient in reading and writing to become teachers or catechist in the church, clerks and interpreters in the</p> <p>government service and the commercial houses.</p> <p>At the proclamation of the protectorate of the Northern Nigeria in 1900, there was no school of the Western type in the territory except the Church Missionary Society (C.M.S) school at Lokoja, which was then the headquarter of the Royal Niger Company and a station of the Niger Mission of the Church Missionary Society. There are three sources of the statutory system all of them introduced the colonial government. First, there was Education Ordinance No. 3 of 1887 for the promotion of Education in the colony of Lagos, which was derived from the English system. The colony comprised of Lagos Island and its mainland Badagry, Epe, Lekki and Ikorodu territories corresponding to the present Lagos State.</p> <p>The Ordinance gradually spread into Yoruba land, which the protectorate of Lagos. Next, there was the Education proclamation No. 19 of 1903 which was applicable to the Southern Nigeria, the territory which later became the province of Calabar, Owerri, Onitsha, Warri, Benin, Ogoja and the Owo District of Ondo Province. The proclamation was strongly influenced by the practices of the Presbyterian Mission Education System, with the background of the Scottish Educational System. Industrial Education and the District Primary School later emerged and known as the \"Government School\".</p> <p>Finally, the Girourard-Visher System of the protectorate of Northern Nigeria emerged and was based on the system of the Sudan (Arabic).</p> <p>English Language overshadowed that and it became the Language of the African elites even after independence, when Nigerians assumed the vantage of high ranking position as Officials in Government Parastatals, it still maintained its prestigious position as the Language of officialdom and the elitists.</p> <p>One can attribute the influence of the English Language as the Second Language L,, in Nigeria due to the fact that it serves as the only means of inter-tribal form of communication, between different tribes of Nigeria nation, with about 300 local dialects.</p> <p>Apart from this afore-mentioned, it also serves some other functions e.g. technical functions in Nigeria, these includes its roles as the Language of Law, Education, Health, Mass Media and Government.</p> <p>English Language from the Mid-Primary School through Secondary Schools and Universities functions as the language of instructions in both Government and Private Schools, while this occurs right from creche to kindergarten levels respectively.</p> <p>Since the Nigerian child is exposed to the English Language early in life, one would expect that he will be proficient in its usage but contrary is the case. The situation is so bad that teacher's do not cease to lament about the mass failure of students in English Language as evidenced in their WAEC, NECO and JAMB results.</p> <p>This now leads us to believe that the phonology of the Mother's tongue of Nigerian's children L, has influence over his English Language phonology (L2 language).</p> <p><strong>1.2    BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In this chapter, we would examine all the phonological theories because they are seen as foundation over which scholastic endeavors are built. It is regarded as tools for authenticating an academic exercise.</p> <p>After this, we are going to examine the key term in the topic of this study that is the \"Phoneme\" from which the word \"Phonological\" is derived.</p> <p><strong>1.2.1 THE STRUCTURALISTTHEORY</strong></p> <p>They are the first set of linguists to clearly define or identify the concepts of</p> <p>phonemes in any language. According to them, it is the first level on the hierarchy that makes up any language system. Bowel (1988) defined phonemes as the \"units of sounds associated with meaning.\" In other words, they are those units of sounds that are combined to form words and morphemes, which are in their units of meaning. Fry (1975:1399) gives an insight into one of the major attributes of the phonological level, which is the fact that the phoneme inventory of a given language is a closed set. That is, no addition can be made to it, an individual after acquiring the whole of phonemic system in his language will have to make do with it and form or coin any words he desires using the phonemes in his linguistic inventory.</p> <p>As a result of the above, we are going to have a cursory look at the phonemes of both \"Cursory\", because at this level it is expected that we are familiar with the phonemes of the two languages.</p> <p>This theory was formulated by the linguist Roman Jacobson and it is the best known and most influential theory of phonological development. This theory represents the , first attempt to explain the acquisition of phonemes on the basis of linguistics universal structural law that underlies every modification of language of individual or society. In this theory, the period of language development is divided into two stages which are:</p> <p>(i)      Pre linguistic which is the babbling period during which the sounds composing the child's vocalization do not exhibit particular order of development and are not related to the production of the following period.</p> <p>(ii)      The second is the stage of the acquisition of language proper during which the child follows a relatively universal sound and invariant order of gaining intentional control over the sounds of the surrounding adult's language.</p> <p>This division is based on the widely accepted observation that during babbling, the vocalizations of most normal children exhibit a great quantity and diversity of sound production . (complex vowels, clicks, palatalized and</p> <p>rounded consonants etc) but that as the child begins to acquire words, most of these sounds disappear and some of them re-appear only after a period of years. Thus,the phonetic richness of the babbling period gives way to phonological limitationJacobson (1971). The second stage stands as the transition from the desire to communicate to the ability to communicate.</p> <p>According to Jacobson, the different stages involved in the development of</p> <p>language are strictly regulated by an inherent universal hierarchy of structural laws which he called 'laws of irreversible solidarity.' According to him, this development proceeds from the simple and undifferentiated to the stratified and differentiated.</p> <p>Unlike the behaviorist theory which lays emphasis on the need to reinforce the sounds made by children until it is perfected or equal to the adult's own production. This recognized the babbling stage whereby children make incomprehensible sounds as an important aspect of the child's phonological development.</p> <p><strong>1.2.2 THE BEHAVIORISTS THEORY</strong></p> <p>This is the theory of language development formulated by H.O. Mower in the late 1940. The theory has its origin in the contribution of psychoanalysis which relies on the effective relation between child and mother in the emergence of speech.</p> <p>According to this theory, the first step in speech development is that the child attends to and identifies with the caretaker's vocalization, which is associated with primary reinforcement such as food and patting.</p> <p>Winitz (1969:35-48) describes the process involved in speech development as propounded in this theory using three different stages:</p> <p>(i)      During the first stage, the child's vocalization are said to occur most frequently shortly before feeding because of natural sounds associated with chewing, swallowing coupled with the principle of \"fractional anticipatory goal response\" that is, the child in anticipation makes the kind of sound he will make when he feeds and this response includes: making sounds with the vocal track.</p> <p>(ii)      During the second developmental period, the vocalization of the mother and subsequently those of the child by the virtue of its similarity to the mother's acquire secondary reinforcing properties because the mother's vocalization occur in close with feeding or other reinforcement events.</p> <p>(iii)    The third period - begins when several of the child's utterances are identified by the parents as an approximation of a particular word. The parents reinforce these utterances and the child gradually refines his approximation until it matches the adult's form.</p> <p>This theory has been of great importance in the field of language teaching and learning. Based on it, the environment is seen as exerting a major influence, since it provides the models with which the child imitates and the rewards that make learning take place. It also lay emphasis on reinforcement which encourages the learner, not only that, active responding practice and feedback are other actions that behaviorism lay emphasis on.</p> <p><strong>1.2.3 THE NATURALIST PHONOLOGY THEORY</strong></p> <p>This was formulated by Stampe (1969). The natural phonology of phonological development assumes a universal innate system of phonological processes - unlimited and unordered rules which in its most language innocent stage expresses the full set of restrictions of the human speech capacity. It proposes that the phonetic representatives of the child's</p> <p>productions are the results of the application of this innate system to an abstract phonological representation. Succession revisions of this innate system occur with the learning of each phonetic opposition through linguistic experience with the standard (adult) language.  </p> <p>An important contribution of this theory is its attempt to show the role of acquisition in language learning. The main hypothesis is that, addition generalization and un-ordering processes which characterize language learning results directly from the failure of the child to exploit fully, the mechanisms for resolving contradictory processes. The resultant forms are thereby innovations, which are rejected by the standard that exert a conservative influence.</p> <p>Applying this theory one can fully explain implicational laws such as those</p> <p>proposed of the innate system. Also while applying this process; it will no</p> <p>longer be necessary to posit that the child has a phonemic system of its own, distinct from the adults' system. Rather, one can assume that the child begins by producing modified version of the representations of the adult that it has internalized and that it is only by successive modifications of these forms through the various suppressions of processes that the 'correct' adult pronunciation is achieved.</p> <p><strong>1.2.4 THE PROSODIC THEORY</strong></p> <p>This theory was formulated by Waterson (1970-1971). It represents the Firth</p>                                                         \n\nA STUDY OF THE PHONOLOGICAL USAGE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE BY L2 SPEAKERS IN SELECTED NIGERIAN SCHOOLS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A STUDY OF THE PHONOLOGICAL USAGE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE BY L2 SPEAKERS IN SELECTED NIGERIAN SCHOOLS", "id": 178}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This work is seen to reveal the difficulties and challenges in learning English as a second language especially in non- native background of Igbo speaking students in Lagos state University, (LASU) Ojo.</p> <p>To carry out this exercise, the researcher visited the students, recorded their first and second languages with the use of a questionnaire which has two parts (A and B). Part A consists of personal data of respondent while Part B is an investigation on the project topic that deals with the difficulties encountered by Igbo speaking students learning English as their second language at Lagos State University.</p> <p>This process has a sample technique, introduced to review a population census randomly selected to complete each questionnaire. The questionnaire is arranged in columns and boxes .The descriptive research design was used to take a constructive look at syntactic features of English and Igbo languages reflecting how they are being achieved.</p> <p>It is evident in the research to note similarities between English syntax and Igbo Syntax; except for interference problems; like the influence of the mother tongue prepositions are many in English language, and there is no single word adverb in Igbo language. There can't be more than one preposition in lgbo.  Linguistics should insist on utilizing mother tongue experiences for effective second language teaching and learning in Nigeria. There should equally be in place a language education policy in Nigeria whose total commitment will rest on the supervision of language development in the Nation.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    INTRODUTION</strong></p> <p>English and Igbo Language belong to two different families of language. English belong to the Germanic group of the indo-European family while Igbo is of the Eastern family, Oluikpe (1996:7). This genetic difference in the two languages in contact entails a possible contrastive analysis of the syntactic structure inherit in the two languages they may have seen then as having the relationship of mother tongue (L1) and second language (L2) in terms of their users.</p> <p>The most obvious evidence of the linguistic influence of English- induced structures into a Nigerian language (Bamgbose 1995:9) and vice versa, is paralleled to code-mixing.</p> <p>The phenomena of code-mixing occurs as a result of languages in contrast. Essien (1995:271) says that:</p> <p>\"code-mixing occurs when the speaker, Or the initiator of speech, changes From one language or code to another depending on the situation, audience, subject matter etc.</p> <p>Thus, mutual linguistic influence in any situation of language contact is usual. Just as English has influenced Nigerian languages, so have these languages influenced English. The term 'Nativization', which has now been, generally accepted for describing the Indigenization of English in a second language environment (kachtu 1992: 48-74) adequately summarized the nature of this influence.</p> <p>Nativization of English in Nigeria is not limited to the usual features of transfer of phonological, lexical, syntactic and semantic patterns of Nigerian Languages in Nigeria. It is also concerned with the creative development of English Language, including the evolution of distinctively Nigerian usages. Creativity manifests itself in various ways: first, expressions are coined to reflect the Nigerian experience.</p> <p>Second, authentic Nigerian native idioms are translated into English in such a way as to reflect the mood of the situation or character.</p> <p>The features are not merely deviations from the norms of standard English, but from features which characterize standard Nigerian English. Standard Nigeria English can be understood internationally and thus it is accorded worldwide prestige and internationally accepted. Regional variations of Nigerian English with first language prompted features such as Hausa English, Igbo English and Yoruba English etc. are considered non - standard and are not formally acceptable even in Nigeria.</p> <p>Although, standard in English is not a case that all native speakers of English pronounce words in the same way, most users of the 'new English\" accept the existence of standard but are unable to distinguish it from normal English.</p> <p>Platt et al (1998: 304) says that:</p> <p>'The only way to show that language features Are not idiosyntactic learners errors but part of A language system of a new English is to prove Statically that:</p> <p>Standard in English is the dialect most used by the educated members of the society. It is the form used in government, public records, official pronouncements and the media. This dialect is accorded such widespread social acceptance that it has become first among equals. In this light, the term standard can be extended to the English of such countries like India, Nigeria, Ghana, Singapore etc. These varieties are grammatical with local inp</p> <p>Randolph Quirk (2002:24) gave a more distinguished definition of standard English as what the speakers accept as \"normal English\". He also Said that standard English is that \"which the least attention to itself.\"</p> <p><br/></p> <p>In the light of the above discussion on English, it is completely apparent that the English usage of some part of Nigeria-particularly the Igbo, is neither a standard variety of Nigeria English nor acceptance \"normal English\" even within the Igbo community.  It is undoubtedly unacceptable and draws an unusual attention to itself. Yet, its prevalence among Igbo speakers of English makes it a verifiable investigative phenomenon as I hope to do in this project.</p> <p>1.2    <strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Language has been, described as men's most priceless. It may be considered as man's crowing achievement for various reasons.</p> <p>Language permits man the enormous wealth of contemporary as well as historical knowledge that would be beyond his grasp if based solely on his personal experiences. Language permits a variety of efficient and subtle modes of communication for expressing his innermost feeling and thought ranging from the poetic and musical, to the present and the concrete and transcends time and space.</p> <p>In Nigeria, estimate have ranged from 200 to 400 distinct indigenous languages that fulfill some of these mentioned functions. This makes Nigeria as a multi­lingual society. In addition, English Language, though a colonial language, has remained in Nigeria. Subsequently, the British colonial masters to Nigeria. Bamgbose (1995: 35) remarks that:</p> <p>..... of all the heritage left behind</p> <p>In Nigeria by the British at the</p> <p>End of colonial administration,</p> <p>Probably none is more important</p> <p>Than the English Language</p> <p>English language is language of government, commerce and business, education, the mass media, literature and much internal as well as external communication. In regard to this, one can then infer that the English language is very important in the national and social life of Nigeria.</p> <p>However, the language being an alien language is not the language orientation of a child born in a typical Nigerian community where the mother tongue is probably, lgbo, Hausa, Yoruba or Efik as the case may be. Therefore the child born into the Nigerian community is faced with a complex language situation. He battles with the problem of mastering his own indigenous language and gaining a good command of the English language.</p> <p>The co-existence of English with 400 or more indigenous languages in Nigeria has produced numerous repercussions. One such repercussion is the aspect of linguistic nativization which includes Nigerian language vowels and consonants for English ones; replacement of stress by tone; introduction of culture-specific vocabulary items, preposition combinations and some Ll-induced syntactic structure. These features have been extensively discussed in the works of Bamgbose (1995), thus the present form or status of English in Nigeria is a result of the contact between English and Nigeria language in the socio-cultural and political situations.</p> <p><strong>1.3      STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>It have been observed that our first language or mother tongue (Ll) has a continuous and dominant influence on all languages we subsequently acquire as our second or foreign language (L2).  All attempt to suppress Ll (if seen as a hindrance to effective second language learning will yield no genuine result because it is fruitless. Instead, the level of proficiency of the L2 in question, as it is the case with English in Nigeria, will be falling within and outside the educational system and with it, understandably, the general level of education.</p> <p>Specifically, the falling standard in the English usage of Igbo undergraduates in particular had been attributed to mother tongue negative transfer, false hypothesization or over generalization. Oluikpe (1996:147). Other usage problems had been caused by inadequate knowledge of special syntactic features of certain words and expressions in English. Consequently,</p> <p>Specifically, the falling standard in the English usage of Igbo undergraduate in particular had been attributed to mother tongue negative transfer, false hypothesization or over generalization. Oluikpe (1996: 147). Other usage problems had been caused by the inadequate knowledge of special syntactic feature of certain words and expressions in English. Consequently, the English actually used by undergraduates differ in various ways from standard English. This clearly makes for a complex study of a contrastive analysis of the two languages which stand in the relationship of L1 and L2.</p> <p>There are many features in the structures of English sentences that are not found in Igbo sentence structures and these contrast present learning and usage problems. This is probably the reason why the concept of <em> “</em>straight for English\" technique put forward as a solution for solving the language problem in some multilingual African countries will never yield result. Until the featured of mother tongue (MT) are recognized and incorporated into the already mapped out insights into the effectiveness of English language teaching and learning; particularly the teaching and learning of the language among Igbo undergraduates in the Department of English whose Ll is Igbo language. Thus the problem of usage especially in English syntax is a measure of the failure of utilizing mother tongue experiences for effective second language teaching.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>1.4    PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is primarily concerned with the syntactic problems encountered by Igbo speakers of English and how their first language affects subsequent acquisition of other languages, particularly English language. The methodology will enable us determine for instance, the collocational possibilities and the degree of problems encountered by students as there is no clues (morphological or syntactic) to fix precisely the acceptable collocational patterns.</p> <p>The significance of this methodology affords the students the following opportunities: A careful examination of how the only preposition in Igbo ‘n' a' variously translated in English as in at on etc, influence the use of English prepositions; the implications to the existence of mother tongue interferences with the target language as evinced in the non-use of articles, instances of their superfluous usages', and irregularities in idiomatic usages, whether the absence of absolute genitives in Igbo, that is, the possessive determines for instance mine, ours, yours, theirs, as we have in English, presents usage problems in structures where the attributive genitives, that is, simple possessive determiners such as, my, our, your, their, is required, mention will also be made of the distribution of determiners in Igbo language and their equivalents in English.</p> <p>Finally, the process of embedding in the two languages will be discussed.</p> <p><strong>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTIONS:</strong></p> <p>1.       To what extent is nativization of English not limited to Ll negative transfer?</p> <p>2.       How does the Igbo syntactic structures affect the English usage of Igbo undergraduates?</p> <p>3.       To what extent is the communicative competence of English dependent on the user's consistent effort to always practice with English in both formal and informal settings?</p> <p>4.       Is there any relationship between English and an Igbo syntax?</p> <p>5.       To what extent is 'Igbo English' distinct from other regional varieties of English in Nigeria such as <em>‘</em>Hausa English' , 'Efik English' or Yoruba English?'</p> <p><strong>1.6    RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>Within our context, we have the cognition of some apparent hypotheses that could form our research basis. These hypotheses include the following:</p> <p>1.                  Nativization of English in Nigeria is not limited to the usual features of transfer or phonological, lexical, semantic, but extends to the syntactic patterns or Nigerian indigenous languages into English language.</p> <p>2.                  Regional variations in standard English with first language prompted features such as Igbo English are considered non-standard and are therefore not formally acceptable even in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.                   There is a conscious effort by Igbo speakers of English to aspire towards approximation of the native speaker level of performance.</p> <p>4.       We can tell an English usage with Igbo language prompted features by merely examining the text or listening to the accent.</p> <p>5.                      Students encounter syntactic problems in specific areas like borrowing, coinage, adaptation and translation of certain Igbo linguistic features into English.</p> <p>6.                      Most of the contrastive analysis on the syntactic structures of both languages are not reliable and are detrimental to the students' competence and performance of the two language in contact.</p> <p><strong>1.7    SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study shall be concerned only with the undergraduates of the University of Lagos whose Ll is Igbo language. This implies that we are not interested in the English usage of the average Igbo primary school leaner, low grade workers in establishments, most university dons, editors and judges.</p> <p>Our method of approach will be descriptive and as such will depend on analysis of data.</p> <p>The significance of this endeavour will afford future researchers the reference and motivation to do research on English usage problems, especially of second language users.</p> <p><strong>1.8    OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>Every human knows at least one language, spoken or signed. Linguistics is the science of language, including the sounds, words, and grammar rules. Words in languages are finite, but sentences are not. It is this creative aspect of human language that sets it apart from animal languages, which are essentially responses to stimuli.</p> <p>The rules of a language, also called grammar, are learned as one acquires a language. These rules include <strong>phonology, </strong>the sound system, morphology, the structure of words,<strong> syntax</strong>, the combination of words into sentences, semantics, the ways in which sounds and meanings are related, and the lexicon, or mental dictionary of words. When you know a language, you know words in language, i.e. sound units that are related to specific meanings. However, the sounds and meanings of words are arbitrary. For the most part, there is no relationship between the way a word is pronounced (or signed)</p> <p>Knowing a language encompasses this entire system, but this knowledge (called<strong>competence</strong>) you may know language, but you may also choose to not speak it. Although you are not speaking the language, you still have the knowledge of it. However, if you don't know a language, you cannot speak it at all.</p> <p>There are two types of grammar: descriptive and prescriptive. <strong>Descriptive grammar</strong>represent the unconscious knowledge of a language. English speakers for example, know that<em>lime </em>likes apples\" is incorrect and \"I like apples\" is correct, although the speaker may not be able to explain why. Descriptive grammar do not teach the rules of a language, but rather describe rules that are already known. In contrast, <strong>prescriptive grammar</strong> dictate what a speaker's grammar should be and they include teaching grammars, which are written to help teach a foreign language.</p> <p>There are about 5,000 languages in the word right now (give or take a few thousand), and linguists have discovered that these languages are more alike than different from each other. There are universal concepts and properties that are shared by all languages, and these principles are contained in the <strong>universal Grammar</strong>. Which forms the basis of all possible human languages.</p> <p><strong>Morphology and Syntax</strong></p> <p><strong>MORPHEMES</strong> are the minimal units of words that have a meaning and cannot be subdivided further. There are two main types: Free bound morphemes can occur alone and Bound morphemes must occur with another morpheme. An example of a free morpheme is \"bad\" and an example of a bound morpheme is \"ly\". It is bound because although it has meaning, it cannot stand alone. It must be attached to another morpheme to produce a word.</p> <p>FREE MORPHEME: bad</p> <p>BOUND MORPHEME: ly</p> <p>WORD: badly</p> <p>When we talk about words, there are two groups: lexical {content} and <strong>function </strong>(or grammatical) words. Lexical words are called open class words and include nouns, verb, adjectives and adverbs. New words can regularly be added to this group. Function words, or closed class words, are conjunctions, prepositions, articles and pronouns, and new words cannot be (or are very rarely) added to this class.</p> <p><strong>Affixes</strong> are often the bound morpheme. This group include <strong>prefixes, suffixes, infixes</strong>, and<strong>circumfixes</strong>.  Prefixes are added to the beginning of another morpheme, suffixes are added to the end, infixes are inserted into other morpheme, and circumfixes are attached to another morpheme at the beginning and end. Following are examples of each of these:</p> <p>Prefix: re-added to do produces redo</p> <p>Suffix: - or added to edit produces editor</p> <p>affixes are added to the end of an existing word for purely grammatical reasons. In English there are only eight total inflectional affixes:</p> <p>-s       3rd person singular present     she waits</p> <p>-ed      past tense                          she waited</p> <p>-ing     progressive                        she’s eating</p> <p>-en      past participle                    she has eaten</p> <p>-s       plural                               three apples</p> <p>-‘s      possessive                         Lori’s son</p> <p>-er      comparative                       you are taller</p> <p>-est     superlative                         you are the shortest</p> <p>The other type of bound morpheme are called bound roots. These are morphemes (and not affixes) that must be attached to another morpheme and do not have a meaning of their own. Some examples are ceive in perceive and mit in submit.</p> <p><strong>English Morphemes</strong></p> <p>A.      Free</p> <p>1.       Open class</p> <p>2.       Closed class</p> <p>B.      Bound</p> <p>1.       Affix</p> <p>a.       Derivational</p> <p>b.       Inflectional</p> <p>2.       Root</p> <p>There are six ways to form new words. Compounds are combination of words, <strong>acronyms</strong> are derived from the initials of words, <strong>back-formations</strong> are created from removing what is mistakenly considered to be an affix, <strong>abbreviations or clippings</strong> are shortening longer words, <strong>eponyms</strong> are created from proper nouns (names), and <strong>blending</strong> is combing parts of words into one.</p> <p>Compound: doghouse</p> <p>Acronym: NBA (National Basketball Association) or scuba (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus)</p> <p>Back-formation: edit from editor</p> <p>Abbreviation: phone from telephone</p> <p>Eponym: sandwich from Earl of sandwich.</p> <p>Blending: smog from smoke and fog</p> <p>Grammar is learned unconsciously at a young age. Ask any five year old, and he will tell you that “I eat\" and\" you eat\", but his \"dog eats.\" But a human's syntactical knowledge goes farther than what is grammatical and what is not. It also accounts for ambiguity, in which a sentence could have two meanings, and enables us to determine grammatical relationships such as subject and direct object.  Although we may not consciously be able to define the terms, we unconsciously know how to use them in sentences.</p> <p>Syntax, of course, depends on lexical categories (parts of speech.) you probably learned that there are 8 main parts of speech in grammar school. Linguistics analyzes words according to their affixes and the words that follow or precede them. Hopefully, the following definitions of the parts of speech will make more sense and be of more use than the old definitions of grammar schoolbooks.</p> <p>Open Class Words</p> <p>+ plural endings Det.

Adverbials, comprise, adjuncts, conjuncts and disjuncts. Not many students can identify adverbs without the \"ly\" suffix, just as very few students are familiar with the clause of adverbs. From the research, it shows also that not many students can make use of adverbial phrases correctly. The unpredictable nature of the adverb poses problem to students. The research advises that teachers look at some basic words that are unavoidable in the teaching of verbs. Teachers should explain, the finite, transitive and intransitive verbs. Adverbials include particles and phrases, therefore the term is more complex than the adverb as well' as its unpredictable nature. This should not persuade a teacher to overlook the concepts of adverbial phrase.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The verb is the basic word in a sentence. It is the key word that gives meaning to a concept. The word verb comes from the Latin and \"Verbum\" meaning \"the word\". Traditional grammar defines verb as an action word or words that refer(s) to an action or state. This definition takes care of doing words like jump, laugh dance, eat etc. The grammatical implication of these words is that the actions are being carried out. In this definition, there is no reflection of any word. Example of this type of words include: \"perceive, know, sense, think\".</p> <p>The Oxford Advanced Dictionary defines a verb as a word or phrase indicating what somebody or something does. What state, somebody or something is in, what is becoming of somebody or something.</p> <p>According to Oji Nzobunachi (1988:26) the verb is a word that fits into an inflectional verbal paradigm like nouns. Verbs belong to the open system members. This class get added to the verb class mainly by the process of adoption and modification of words from other classes. Examples are:</p><p> </p> <p><strong>Noun</strong></p><p> </p> <p><strong>Verb</strong></p><p> </p> <p>Beauty</p><p> </p> <p>Beautiful</p><p> </p> <p>Identity</p><p> </p> <p>Identify</p><p> </p> <p>Glory</p><p> </p> <p>Glorify</p><p> </p> <p>Specific</p><p> </p> <p>Specify</p><p> </p> <p>Clarify</p><p> </p> <p>Clarity</p><p> </p> <p>Verbs changes with time. This inflectional changes of the verb leads to the conception of a tense. It might be from present to past.</p> <p>The function uses of the verb are: ­</p> <p>Making statement - Uche is coming.</p> <p>Asking questions - Did you go to school yesterday?</p> <p>Giving command - Stand up!</p> <p>The verb may be in a single word as exemplified above or in a group of two or more words.</p> <p>In English language, there are called verb phrase. A verb phrase usually contains the auxiliary and main verb. According to Christopherson Paul (1980:55) verb phrases can be seen as a sequential performing the function of a verb or can be substituted by a single verb. He also opines that verbal phrases or groups are made up of auxiliary, examples are;</p> <p>a)   They are eating rice</p> <p>b)  He has done the work</p> <p>c)   He will come tomorrow</p> <p>d)  Uche is driving a car</p> <p>In the above examples, ‘are’, ‘will’, ‘has’, ‘is’, are all acting in the auxiliary forms.</p> <p>Adverb is one of the eight major parts of speech as identified by Boadi L.A. (198:64). However, it is very hard to define. This is due to the fact that it varies greatly both in forms and in terms of the position they may occupy in a sentence.</p> <p>A definition of the adverb in terms of form may be misleading at times. This is so because some people hold the opinion that words ending in \"ly\" are: sufficient manifestations of adverbs and from this point of view neglect the fact that there are words like, fatherly, brotherly, dearly, that end in \"ly\" but are' not adverbs. In addition, if the determination of adverbs is on the concepts then some certain adverbs like, here, tomorrow, yesterday, up, often, sometimes and seldom will be neglected. Adverb can therefore be seen as words that modify verbs and adjectives and other adverbs. Adverbs also answer the question, where, when and how.</p> <p>The role of adverbs is very central in the English Language Adverbials comprise, Adjuncts, Conjuncts and Disjuncts. The attention that will be given to adjuncts consists of adverbial of time, place, manner and reason. Adverbs which state where an action takes place are called adverb of place example here, out anywhere. Adverbs of time state when the action of a verb takes place, example: daily, soon, now, today. Adverbs of a reason state \"why\" an action is done, example, why?</p> <p>Thus adverbial can be defined as adverb phrase. A very important aspect of the use of adverbial modification is that of polarity as it is been called. Polarity is the contract between positive and negative utterances. The simplest way of transforming positive sentences into a negative one, is by means of the insertion of the adverb \"not\" in the appropriate place - he is here/he is not here. Usually, however there is a case of redundancy in the system. The adverb `not' often needs the co-operators do, does, did, in order to make the system work, as in I saw him yesterday.</p> <p>Adverbs and adverbial phrases can be classified into two complementary ways:­</p> <p>(a) According to the kind of concepts they express, manner place, time, degree etc.</p> <p>(b) According to the position they normally occupy in the sentence. Unfortunately, there is no single correspondence between the kind of adverbial and the position it occupies in a sentence, but we can draw a few general conclusion and then show how usage may depart from the normal. Adverbial may occur at the end of sentences.</p> <p>The problems posed by adverbials are many and diverse, most students do not recognize adverbials that do not end with the \"ly\" suffix, some do not recognize adverbials that make concessions like \"although, however\" etc. Disjuncts like \"obviously, honestly, frankly speaking\" are not readily identified as adverbials.</p> <p><strong>1.2   PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is to investigate the followings:</p> <p>(1) To examine the extent to which verb and adverbial phrases are important to student who are learning English language as a second language</p> <p>(2) To identify the variable factors that create handicap in the teaching and learning of adverbials in the secondary schools.</p> <p>(3) To arouse interest in both students, teachers and even casual readers on the place of verb and adverbials in sentences</p> <p>(4) The research questionnaire will be used to get- responses from both students and English Language teachers in some secondary schools.  .</p> <p><strong>1.3   STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Verbal and adverbial usages create a lot of difficulties amongst students. Their contextual usage abound owing to their structural and abstract definition. A number of students are unable to use and identify verb and adverbs correctly even in the senior school certificate examination (SSCE). This is mainly due to the fact that they (students) believe that the suffix \"ly\" is sufficient evidence that a word is an adverb, but this is far from true.</p> <p>It is also important to note that teachers of the English `language, seem not to teach verbs and adverbs well; they teach these topics haphazardly, regarding verbs and Adverbial phrases are supposed to be taught for a full week or two, but one will find out that some teachers just teach them for two days and move over to a fresh topic entirely.</p> <p>Moreover, more attention is given to some parts of speech like nouns, adjective than adverbial. They seem to regard them to be more important. Greater emphasis is given to other parts of speech than verb and adverbs, mainly because teachers feel that adverbials rarely appear in external examinations like General Certificate Examination (G. C. E), Joint Admission Matriculation Board (J.A.M.B). Again, some teachers appear not serious in correcting their student’s mistakes in verb and adverbial but rather refer them to textbooks that are not readily available to the students. Even students who come buy such books are unable to understand them, since they are not well taught. Therefore, this study aims at filling these gaps hence this study on the Analysis of verbs and adverbial usages in contextual grammar.</p> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS:</strong></p> <p>1. Do students find it difficult to use verbs and adverbs in sentences?</p> <p>2. Can students identify adverb without the \"ly\" suffix when they occur in sentences?</p> <p>3. Are these students who are familiar with the classes of adverbs such as adjuncts, conjuncts and disjuncts?</p> <p>4. Do students use adverbial' phrases correctly?</p> <p>5. Is the unpredictable nature of adverbs a problem to students learning English as a second language?</p> <p><strong>1.5   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research will help to buttress the relevance of verb and adverbial phrases towards the development of the student's use of English.</p> <p>It will also help in identifying them easily in their everyday</p> <p>English usage. For instance in the sentences such as:</p> <p>(a)    The cat slowly picked the fish and ran away quickly.</p> <p>(b)    Mary stupidly smacked at the man:</p> <p>In these two sentences above, the students are most likely to spot out the adverbs, which are, \"slowly, quickly, and stupidly,\" because they have the ending \"ly\".</p> <p>Furthermore, this research will help to suggest a way through which students and teachers would develop interest in the use and study of verb and adverb as part of the English studies and should not be taught haphazardly - rather they, are to be given greater attention.</p> <p>The study is also significant because of the significance of the verb and adverbials in the study of English. There is the need for students to be conversant -with- verb and adverbials to use them correctly and also to apply them where necessary.</p> <p><strong>1.6   SCOPE AND DELIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>1.  This research is limited to the study of Verb and adverbial phrases and their recognition in contextual grammar</p> <p>2.  The amount of work expected to be done in this research study is limited due to limited resources. As a student researcher, inadequate funds crippled an extensive research, hence limiting the research area to only Ifako local government area of Lagos in which the research resides.</p> <p>3.  However, the researcher is very convinced that the few schools used for the research is a strong representative of the educational level of schools in the local government area. The researcher will bring into focus the use of verb and adverbials amongst secondary school students.</p> <p>4.  Time factor is another basic hindrance to an extensive research, for the research had to be done in a very: short time. Furthermore, inadequate sources and books for the research negated the wide coverage and enhancement of the work. Textbooks on verbs and adverbs were not easily found. This also limited the research on this topic.</p>                                                          \n\nAN ANALYSIS OF VERBS AND ADVERBIAL PHRASES: USES AND PROBLEMS IN CONTEXUAL GRAMMAR<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ANALYSIS OF VERBS AND ADVERBIAL PHRASES: USES AND PROBLEMS IN CONTEXUAL GRAMMAR", "id": 180}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study of language, which constitutes the underlying platform for this research work, is one concept which has defied all forms of easy definition as is done in all other concepts of life. The use of language is what distinguishes man from the monkey, the baboon, the ape and other higher animals; hence it is purely human. Language is the one significant factor of man's social existence. It defines and interprets his life in every situation. It gives meaning to his different engagements and involvements. Without language, man will be no different from other sub­human animals. In affirmation, Ohigbodi Babayide (2000:182) explains that the fact that man expresses his feelings and his thoughts in language is the one hard difference between man and those other lower animals. The most reliable form of communication by human beings, therefore, is the use of language.</p> <p>Language, as a concept in academic endeavour, has certain features and functions peculiar to it. These features range from arbitrariness, system-based, culture dependence, dynamism to creativity and productivity. For the purpose of this research, the last characteristic feature of language listed will be briefly discussed. Creativity and productivity constitute another significant characteristic of language. Despite the fact that language is system-based, having laid down rules that govern the use of any language, yet its skilful users possess the potential and license to manipulate and coin language to suit some personal purpose and to create some desired effect or impact on its listener(s) or the reader(s). This creativity that the use of language offers will be properly discussed and analyzed in the core of this research work. Language also has certain functions which it achieves in the course of its usage. The functions of language have been clearly grouped into these four: information, education, persuasion, diagonal interaction. More emphasis will also be placed on the function of persuasion here as it has more connection with this research work. Here, language is used by a speaker in a way as to convince a listener or reader that a particular idea, goal, or line of action is the best among several alternatives; using in most cases, emotionally appealing language capable of swaying people's thinking. This particular function of language is one that is well known to be employed by advertisers. As a persuasive tool designed to control people's thinking, loaded language, which entails the use of certain words in passing across a speaker's opinion with a view to influencing the listener fn the same vein, essentially appeals to emotions rather than intellect.</p> <p>The sole aim of using language is to communicate; and it is these means and methods of communication, specifically in the field of advertising, using language (verbal and non-verbal / linguistic and non-linguistic) that this research work is centered on. Language serves as the vehicle of communication. This research work will also focus on the linguistic features used in communicating through adverts. As a result, it is necessary to outline what is regarded as.’linguistic features. A quote from one of Shakespeare's works, Winter's Tale,goes thus: \"There -vas speech in their dumbness, language in their very gesture\". Language cannot and should not be restricted to the narrow etymological definition as that which is produced by the human vocal organs and received by the hearing apparatus.</p> <p>In the past when literacy or semi-literacy was largely prevalent, the use of signs and symbols were quite rampant especially to drivers on the highways. A round disc with a cross represented one approaching a rail-road  crossing, a diamond-shaped sign told one to slow down, a square sign signified a zone of school children, etc. Other symbols of colour also abounded such as the red, green and yellow lights for stop or danger, safety or go, and slow respectively. The blinking light for caution is also another. All these also represented the non-linguistic systems of communication. Of note also in these non-linguistic systems of communication is the use of the non-verbal clues. Rudolph F. and Kathleen S. Verderber have, in their book, \"Communicate!” identified four kinds of Body Motions or Kinesics used to communicate. They include eye contact, facial expressions, gestures, and postures. There are also four characteristics under Paralanguage/Vocalics that help to influence and convey meaning in our messages: pitch, volume, rate, quality.</p> <p>Using advertising as the chosen field for the analysis of language, linguistic and non-linguistic, it only highlights its strong connection with language. By no mean standards, \"a well-strategised advert\" is a function of a proper mix of creative ideas and an appropriate, apt use of language. To be noted here is the fact that the \"language\" used here goes beyond mere information to persuasion so as to help to achieve the intended result of the advertiser as one of the language functions in communicating. In the same vein, advertising language as will be discussed in this study has its peculiar forms, formations and coinages. A few examples include: Beanz Meanz Heinz, Cookability, Schweppervescence, Tangoed, Wonderfuel. Syntactic parallelisms like: stay dry, stay happy. Associations like: fresh as a mountain stream. Other glamorisations include charming, characterful, oldeworld, unique. A host of others will be outlined in detail later. Generally speaking, advertising language is more of persuasion rather than mere information. As Leo Brunette quoted, advertising far transcends the purpose of information to that of persuasion.</p> <p>A survey of some texts from advertising will reveal that the examples of words, phrases or constructions are truly different from the varieties encountered on a daily basis. This exercise and more will be carried out in the course of this research paper. In doing this, emphasis will be placed on:</p> <p>•    Certain words and expressions used in adverts such as clean, klin, freshmatic, better, sure, now, hurry, introducing, suddenly, etc.</p> <p>•    How meaning is achieved (semantics)</p> <p>•    Role of linguistic features in adverts</p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>The power of language in certain advertisements cannot be over-emphasized. Language in its verbal and non-verbal form, when properly combined usually helps in the achievement of the intended goal on its listeners or readers. Few of the reasons which have been identified in the use of language as limitations or shortcomings of the adverts include the following:</p> <p>• Inappropriate choice of words</p> <p>• Lack of creativity in language</p> <p>• More imperative than interrogative</p> <p>• Improper orientation on the value of advertising</p> <p><strong>1.3       RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>These objectives are:</p> <p>•    To highlight the peculiar use of language in adverts</p> <p>·      To acknowledge the presence of style even in advertisement </p> <p>•    To explore the various stylistic features employed in these adverts that help to actualize meaning</p> <p>•    To show how certain features such as signs, miming, drama(micro or macro) that are employed in adverts are significant and symbolic in the actualization of meaning</p> <p>·         To ascertain the differences, if any, in adverts that concern a certain age grade.</p> <p><strong>1.4       SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of this research shall be to examine semantically and, the lexis used in the selected household adverts aired in television media houses in Nigeria. This research will study language at the semantic level, examine the different kinds of words used in advertising, especially in the broadcast media. This research will also examine the use of the English language as the language of communication and advertising especially in Nigeria with her diverse culture andlanguage differences. The analysis of the advertisement text may not be fully appreciated if one leaves out the stylistics import of other non-linguistic features of the adverts. The para-linguistic features are also another embodiment of meaning.  It employs concepts like dance, mime, facial expressions, body gestures, etc.</p> <p>To achieve this, premium will be placed on the broadcast advertisements of selected consumer goods. They include Milo, Indomie, Amstel Malta, Bournvita, Peak milk, Maltina and many others.</p> <p><strong>1.5       METHODOLOGY AND THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</strong></p> <p>The aim of this work is to study the effect of language style in adverts. To accomplish this task, the researcher would test the hypothesis through a certain means known as Media Monitoring. This methodology is also known as Content Analysis. Since the media is the major source of data for this research work, certain media stations are being monitored and critically followed so as to be able to get its content which will then be further subjected to a thorough analysis. This methodology also enables the analysis to be done rather subjectively, i.e. the subjective analytical mode.</p> <p>Certain theories will be used as a guide in the analysis of the data. The specific aspect of language which is semantics is the guiding theory. A particular theory of meaning in semantics has been chosen to explain in an explicit way the nature of meaning. This theory is the <strong>Referential Theory of Meaning.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.6       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The overwhelming effect of the persuasive language used in advertising on people and their desires and beliefs cannot be over-emphasized. Advertising, in its bid to project a good image before its listeners usually tries too hard to impress, has always proved an effective tool in all areas of human endeavour.</p> <p>The significance of this study, therefore, is to highlight the importance and influence of certain choice of words and expressions in aiding the goal of advertising on people.</p> <p><strong>1.</strong><strong>THE ANALYSIS OF ERRORS IN THE STUDENTS WRITTEN ESSAY OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS LEVEL</strong></p> <p><strong>2.</strong><strong>THE EFFECT OF PHONETIC AND PHONOLOGY ON COMMUNICATION OR LANGUAGE USE OF UNDERGRADUATES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </strong></p> <p><strong>3.</strong><strong>TEACHERS’ STRESS AS A FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE MASS FAILURE OF STUDENTS IN ORAL ENGLISH LANGUAGE (A CASE STUDY OF SOME  SELECTED SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN MUSHIN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF LAGOS</strong></p> <p>The outcome of this study, after critical investigation, would prove an invaluable source of information for students and scholars hoping to broaden their horizon of knowledge and also to expand and explore the deep terrains in the theory of semantics, even in this aspect of advertising.</p> <p><br/><br/></p>                                                         \n\nSEMANTIC AND LEXIS USED IN SELECTED HOUSEHOLD ADVERTS AIRED IN THE TELEVISION MEDIA HOUSES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SEMANTIC AND LEXIS USED IN SELECTED HOUSEHOLD ADVERTS AIRED IN THE TELEVISION MEDIA HOUSES IN NIGERIA", "id": 181}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       INTRODUCTION <br/> BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p> Modern technologies, particularly, the new media, with their electronic messaging capabilities are changing virtually all aspects of human life around the globe. Advances in science and technology in the last decade – particularly micro-chip dependent technology such as computers, lasers, the internet, satellite, videophones etc. have helped in advancing the frontiers of globalization from which Nigeria is not isolated. The impact of these new emerging technologies is felt even in developing countries which are grappling with serious language problems as a result of socio-cultural and linguistic diversities. This new mode of communication appears to have captured a large clientele of the youths who adapt more easily to change. The youths of today live in a world characterized by the dynamics of electronic messaging which affects their communication mode as well as their writing and which also make their life more complex.                      </p> <p>The complex situation in which the young people are struggling to find direction in their lives or simply to survive and improve their living conditions and develop and improve their identity has been given various names. Some call it the information age, while others prefer the term techno-culture or techcapitalism, global media culture or simply globalization, referring to the dialectic process in which the global and the local exist as ‘combined and mutual supporting principles’. The idea behind all these terms is that across the globe, ICTs are playing a vital role on young people’s lives and in the society at large.                    </p> <p>Electronic messaging therefore came as a result of social needs which are anchored on easy and fast communication. It is perhaps the most consummate among the youths because of the common form of interaction it provides. They have learned to coordinate and indeed co-micro interaction via the mobile phone and internet. Electronic Mail, a new written-language register; In a study of with French speaking adolescents; Olga et al observed that “Adolescents seem to have largely appropriated these new communication tools, including electronic mail ‘Teens and technology’, a survey conducted by the New Internet and American Life Project on 1100 young people, “electronic mail ranked on top and was used by 89% of online teens”(2).This interprets that electronic messaging gives the youths a source of interaction that is not mediated by parents as in the case with the traditional landline telephone. The Nigerian youths as part of the global community have contributed to popularizing the social use of texting and have developed a linguistic and manual dexterity in the composition of messages.      </p> <p>Two aspects of the Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) text based communication which the youths employ for the purpose of fast and easy communication are those done through Social Network Sites (SNS) and Short Message Service (SMS).This they do using peculiar linguistic features that are drawn from their dual linguistic dispositions (bilingualism).Social Network Sites include Facebook, ICQ, Myspace, Skype etc, and according to Lee, C. while quoting Kats et al, Social Network Sites (SNS) have led to an age of ‘perpetual contact’.         </p> <p>Social Network Sites provide an increasingly important communication channel in facilitating social connections among Nigerian youths while SMS avails them with the opportunity of ‘on-the-go’ messaging. Awonusi in his paper entitled “Little Englishes and the Law of Energetics”, A sociolinguistic study of SMS text Messages as register and discourse in Nigerian English’ avers that senders of text-messages however, confront the problem of constraint of time, money and space. As a reaction to the constraint, text users devise various linguistic strategies to communicate comprehensively but briefly, thereby depending on the law of energetic. (47). </p> <p>The integration of internet services into Mobile phone has further made the convenience of mobile phone communication easier for students. This research therefore, attempts to examine the linguistic features of text-based computer mediated communication among Nigerian undergraduates using sociolinguistic theories; the study will among other issues explore the extent to which undergraduates accommodate their interlocutors in their SMS and Facebook. Finally, because modern technology has made it possible for youths to text and access Facebook through mobile phone, this study will henceforth use the mobile phone to refer to the two affordances of the computer-mediated modes of communication, namely: SMS and Facebook.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong>                                                               </p> <p> Many of the SMS text messages are couched in racy, semi-formal or informal telegraphic styles occasioned by the constraints of time and space as well as economic (monetary) considerations. Also, the use of languages in electronic messaging is quite obscure due to the use of peculiar bilingual abbreviatio<strong>ns</strong>, phonetic representation, clippings, alpha numerals, Nigerian English, Pidgin English and indigenous languages which could be interpreted differently. These pose a problem of misinterpretation and misunderstanding hence, there is need to study specifically the linguistic features of electronic messaging as well the ability of undergraduates to accommodate their interlocutors by their language style. </p> <p><strong>1.3    OBJECTIVESOFTHESTUDY                                                                                </strong></p> <p>This research is based on the linguistic features inherent in Facebook (a social network site) and SMS which are specific to University of Lagos undergraduates. This study sets out to undertake critical examination of the linguistic features of the two chosen modes of computer mediated communication namely; SMS and Facebook. The objectives of this study are:                    </p> <p>(1) to classify the degree of convergence in the SMS and SNS of undergraduates;</p> <p> (2) to describe how undergraduates employ code-switching to accommodate their interlocutors     in SMS and SNS;</p> <p> (3) to identify how native languages affect the accommodative ability of undergraduates in SMS and SNS;</p> <p>(4)  to point out the type of code-switching employed by undergraduates in SMS and SNS;</p> <p>(5) to classify the extent to which divergence is employed in SMS and SNS;</p> <p>(6)  to substantiate that undergraduates employ accommodation in SMS and Facebook.    </p> <p><strong>1.4   SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong>                                                                      </p> <p>This study will be restricted to two modes of computer mediated communication SMS and Facebook in mobile phones or computer. The restriction to the two is imperative because it has been discovered that the University of Lagos students are often involved in SMS. Also, Facebook, which students mainly access for socialization reasons, has become a substantial communication pattern among them. Ten SMS messages and ten Facebook Messages extracted randomly from undergraduates of University of Lagos will be used as data for this study. In doing this Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT) proposed by Howard Giles will be used as theoretical framework and the researcher will limit herself to the two major variables of CAT-<strong>convergence</strong> and <strong>divergence.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.5   DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>To achieve the objectives of the study, we have attempted simple exposition of some relevant concepts.</p> <p><strong>1.5.1   SMS</strong></p> <p>The SMS is a contraction for Short Messages Service. It has become a very familiar and widely used form of communication. An online source revealed that “short message services (SMS), what Alabi V. rightly referred to as “the written language of GSM” (1994), is a communication protocol allowing the interchange of short text messages between mobile telephone devices”. Students make maximum use of SMS to communicate written codes from one person to another. In SMS brevity is the tool to comprehensiveness and comprehending information since it allows a limit of 160 characters per SMS.</p> <p><strong>1.5.2    SNS </strong></p> <p>The abbreviation SNS simply means Social Network Sites. It is an online service, platform, or site that focuses on building and reflecting of social networks or social relations among people who for example, share interests and/or activities and people with similar or somewhat similar interests, backgrounds and/or activities make their own communities. A social network service consists of a representation of each user (often a profile), his/her social links, and a variety of additional services. Most social network services are web-based and provide means for users to interact over the internet such as e-mail and instant messaging. Social networking sites allow users to share ideas, activities, events, and interests within their individual networks.</p> <p><strong>1.5.3   Facebook</strong></p> <p>Facebook is one of the many emerging social network sites which students have discovered as another means of communicating. It has been defined in different ways by different people:</p> <p><em>Facebook is a social networking website that is operated and privately owned by facebook, inc. Since September 2006, anyone over the age of 13 with e-mail address can become a facebook user.<br/><br/></em></p> <p>According to Wikipedia encyclopedia facebook has recorded “500 million active users in July 2010”.  As a social network site, facebook has “implanted a wide variety of technical features” its “backbone consists of visible profiles that display an articulated list of friends who are also users of the same system”.</p> <p><strong>1.5.4      Computer Mediated Communication</strong></p> <p>Computer mediated communication (CMC) “is human to human communication using networked computer environments to facilitate interaction”. (Pearson et al 336). CMC differs from other types of electronic communication in the sense that communication is transactional. “Both people involved in the CMC event are responsible for simultaneously sending and receiving messages.”(Pearson et al 337). However, it uses electronic channels to facilitate communication.</p>                                                             \n\nCOMMUNICATIVE STUDY OF ELECTRONIC MESSAGING AMONG BILINGUAL UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMMUNICATIVE STUDY OF ELECTRONIC MESSAGING AMONG BILINGUAL UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS", "id": 182}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>English as it is spoken in Nigerian (Nigerian English) has been localized or internalized, so to say. This has led a unique brand of English influenced by our various regional dialects and languages. Subsequently, there is a deviation from the standard British English, which our schools are said to use. This deviation could be seen in terms of lexis, phonology and grammar. This means that Standard English may not be attainable even at the acrolectal level due to interferences and related factors. These interference affect speech and ultimately, writing. Writing is a part of a person's life that is indispensable and a mastery of writing cannot be overemphasized. Therefore, this brings to the fore: the implication Nigerian English has onNigerian teachers who teach writing skills at the SSS level. According to Chomsky, young children are equipped with what the termed Language Acquisition Device (LAD), which helps them pick up languages faster. This means that children have \"sponge like\" minds. This is a plus as with the right information they can be easy moluded. This project focuses on SSS students because they are still young and can be trained more effectively in the area of writing.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0       BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Language is a very important factor in the educational process. It is an indispensable aspect of communication. Ithas very strong basics for creative thought and without it there would be no meaningful progress in civilization and culture, Makinde (1997:7). The above citation explores the powers of language as a tool for communication and creative thought. Language is used to communicate ideas through the process of thinking, translated to either speech or writing.</p> <p>Therefore the language of wider communication of a country is crucial to the progress and growth of that nation, even academically. Nigeria is a diverse and multi-ethnic country with about four hundred and ten (410) languages Mackey (1992:12). However, with the introduction of the English language in 1842, these numerous languages have influenced, or if we might say, interfered in the way Nigerians use language on the lexical, grammatical and phonological levels of communication. Though English is Nigeria's lingua franca, a unique brand of English has emerged to suit Nigeria’s socio-linguistic and communication needs (which is to an extent a deviation from standard British English). This has led to a localization or domestication. Since English has been influenced by our indigenous languages, the way we write will also reflect this metamorphosis. These variations we referred to as “peculiar Nigerianisms”.</p> <p> On the phonological level, Adegbite (2001:27) points out a reduced vowel system reduced intonation systems, voicing of non-voiced consonants endings. For example: thumb, song, lamb, the insertation of vowel in syllabic consonants and so on. In day-day communication, we hear people erroneously stretch or contact words. For example, the post-vocalic/L/ is deleted in coda position: “bulk” is pronounced as [bÉ], “help [hep] in addition, the word “sit” is pronounced as [si:t], “ship” as [ςi:p], and the word “beat” is contracted to [bit]. It is possible, therefore, that these wrong pronunciations can translate to bad writing and poor spellings.</p> <p> Basically, the grammatical level focuses on how several aspects of the English language are given a Nigeria flavour. For example, a statement as the following is common in Nigerian English users:</p> <p>\"He is guilty, isn't it?\" (Wrong)</p> <p>\"He is guilty, isn't he?\" (Correct)</p> <p>The lexical level is characterized by coinages (chewing stick, cash madam, go-slow, senior brother, co-wife), hybridization's (kiakia bus, bukateria) and direct translations (eran igbe \"bush/mea!\", ese gigun\" long leg).</p> <p>All these border on communication and communication processes. The major essence of it is to get a message across. All the factors and features of Nigerian English play a role in our linguistic and communicative competences. Linguistic competence is often referred to as the native speaker's knowledge of his language. Communication competence on the other hand is an individual's capacity and ability to produce and understand utterances, which might' not be grammatical but appropriate in the socio-linguistic context of its use. This means that the way Nigerians use language will affect communication. For the purpose of this study, writing as a means of communication will be focused on.</p> <p>According to Maduekwe (2007:157), writing is a \" personal act, it is an expression of the self. It draws on intuition as well as on reasoning on sensation and emotion, facts and meaning\". As earlier stated, language is a basis for creative thought and communication. The way Nigerians think in their lingua franca will determine the quality of written communication as it is what is in the mind that is transferred to writing. According to a research done by Olatunji Felicia Funsho (1996), some university lecturers code switch from time to time for the effect, and the fun of it. They use words such as \"Oyinbo\" and \"Ogbanje\" while teaching.</p> <p>The point here is this; if a teacher code switches or code mixes because they do not know the English translation of certain terms or for the fun of it, their students will inevitably imitate them and transfer these deviations to their writings.</p> <p> As a matter of fact, she states that some English Department lecturers in her research, tried not to code switch in class so their students would not copy them. However, others admitted to doing this occasionally for the sake of illustrations to differentiate between English and Yoruba. For example\"</p> <p>/The boy is coming/ (article before noun)</p> <p>/omo na mbo/ (noun before article)</p> <p>They also did (code switching and code mixing) when there were no exact</p> <p>English equivalents for certain words, or terms like:</p> <p>/mammywater/ (water spirits)</p> <p>/Abiku, Ogbanje/ (Familiar spirits)</p> <p>/Olokun/ (the female god of the sea)</p> <p>If this is brought down to the Junior Secondary classroom level, we know that teachers at this level or not exempted from making such deviations in their teaching. As a matter of fact, terms such as \"mammy water\" and ogbanje\" are terms picked up at the tender years of basic education, which includes the SSS classes. Literature and English textbooks with folktales and African stories use such terms for children's books.Subsequently, when students want to write about mermaids, they would use the term “mammy water\" instead. The crux of the matter, therefore, is that when teachers speak this \"Nigerianized version of the English language, their students pick these things from them and it reflects negatively in the quality of their writing.</p> <p>In conclusion, writing is an art, which reflects a certain level of mastery. 'It is evident that factors such as \"Nigerianisms\", code switching and code mixing are prevalent in our Junior Secondary classes; such mastery may never be attained. Students at the Junior Secondary Level are still quite impressionable and can still be helped to improve on their writing skills. In the light of this, this study is aimed at determining the implications of the communicative functions of Nigerian English and how it affects the teaching of writing skills with specific emphasis on the Junior Secondary School level students who are second language (L2) user of English and also, its implication for teachers of English who use Nigerian English in classroom setting.</p> <p><strong>1.2  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>\"It has been argued that learning to write fluently and expressively is the most difficult of the macro-skills for all language users regardless of whether the language questions is a first, second or foreign language: Maduekwe (2007: 162). Judging from the relative difficulty of writing, it is evident that factors such as interference from mother tongue and our \"peculiar Nigerianisms\" could mar or pose a threat to the quality of writing that comes from our youth, especially the SSS students how are still at a tender stage and can be helped to improved on their writing skills.</p> <p>Also, we must realize that interference factors and \"Niqerianisms\" do not only affect students but teachers as well and more so, teachers because they are the ones who teach writing to their students, which is a crucial matter.</p> <p>Therefore, the study seeks to establish the structure and functions of the Nigerian deviation of the Standard English and how this can affect the acquisition of writing skills at the SSS level.</p> <p><strong>1.3       PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to</p> <p>1.      Appraise the writing skills of students at the SSS level.</p> <p>2.      Determine areas of difficulty faced by English teachers who teach writing to English as second language user.</p> <p>3.      Find out the effect of \"Nigerian English\" on the writing skills of S.S.S students.</p> <p>             4.     Suggest ways of promoting writing skills at the SSS level.</p> <p>  <strong>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>This research seeks to provide answers to the following questions.</p> <p>1.         What is the quality/nature of writing at the SSS level?</p> <p>2.         To what extent does language/native language affect teaching and</p> <p>            comprehension of Writing in both teachers and students in second language situation (s)?</p> <p>3.         What is the effect of Nigerian English on the writing skill of SSS students?</p> <p>4.         How can we promote the art of writing in Nigerian student's especially at the SSS level?</p> <p><strong>1.5       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will help teachers of the English language to determine areas they should improve on a regards teaching and modifications that can be made to already existent teaching skills.

While chapter two reviews relevant literature related to the teaching and learning of English grammatical structures in the primary school. The last three chapters centered on research methodology (i.e. methods of data collection), tabulation, analysis and discussion of data collected, summary, recommendations for the improvement of teaching and learning of grammatical structures in the primary school; there is also a general conclusion of all the issues raised in this research work.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.1    <strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>The teaching and learning of English Language is very important in our society today. This is because of the various roles it plays in the geo-political structure of the country. In Nigeria, English Language is used for communication, education, economic and social purposes. In the school system, English Language is not only taught as a subject but it is also the core subject by which over school subject is being taught.</p> <p>Despite the above, less attention is given to the grammatical aspect of English in the primary school. Today, the nature of teaching and learning of English grammatical structure in the primary school has become area of great interest to teachers, researchers, and policy makers because through it the acquisition of the four language skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing) is greatly enhanced.</p> <p>In view of the above, grammatical structure which entails English tenses, parts of speech, punctuation, concord, clauses and phrases, is of immense importance to the teaching, learning and mastery of English language among primary school pupils. Therefore it must not only be taught to the pupils, but it should be taken seriously at the primary school level since primary education is a better foundation on which the future depends.</p> <p>Looking however at what is applicable in some selected primary schools in Kaduna North Local Government Area of Kaduna State, the general practice by both teachers and pupils towards the teaching and learning of English grammatical structure is not encouraging. Emphasis has shifted from learning the grammar of the language to teaching of writing and reading comprehension, the use of past common entrance examination question papers, teaching of spellings, dictation etc instead of adequate instruction/explanation on the aspects of English grammatical structures which is much needed by the pupils.</p> <p>Lack of trained/qualified teachers, inadequate materials (textbooks and teaching aids), poor classroom facilities, ambiguity of some English syllabi, inadequate evaluation of teacher’s work by the supervisory authority, the teacher’s inability to properly evaluate pupils’ work on grammar, are all contributory factors to pupils’ poor performance in not only grammatical structure but other aspects of English language at large.</p> <p>Therefore the teaching and learning of English language in the primary school should be to ensure that pupils have good knowledge and mastery of the grammatical structures and the ability to use these effectively for a better improvement in English language. This is what has actually prompted the need for this research.</p> <p>1.2    <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The problem to be investigated in “An evaluative study of the teaching and learning of English grammatical structures in some primary schools.”</p> <p>The research work is aimed at identifying the causes of pupils’ poor performance in using English structural items correctly. As a result of this, and other problems, this research will specifically investigate the following:</p> <p>i)            How pupils in the primary schools are motivated to learn and use English grammatical structures.</p> <p>ii)          The methods and techniques employed by teachers in the teaching of English structural items in the primary school and the effectiveness of these methods and techniques.</p> <p>iii)        The types of materials (textbooks/teaching aids) used by the teachers and how relevant these materials are to the teaching and learning of English grammatical structures.</p> <p>iv)         The types of teachers employed to teach English language in the primary school.</p> <p>v)           The areas of difficulty faced by teachers and pupils in the teaching and learning of English grammatical structures in the primary schools.</p> <p>vi)         Suggest how best to improve the teaching and learning of English grammatical structures in the primary school.</p> <p>1.3    <strong>Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>          The objectives of this research are:</p> <p>1.           Find out how English grammatical structures are being taught in the primary school.</p> <p>2.           Address the various challenges faced by teachers and learners of English especially in the aspects of grammatical structures.</p> <p>3.           Make educational planners, language policy makers, curriculum developers and educational administrators to be aware of what is happening in the field (class room).</p> <p>4.           Identify problem areas in the teaching and learning English grammatical structures in the primary schools and to proffer solutions to such identified problems.</p> <p>5.           Assess and evaluate the quality of teachers teaching English and the materials used in the teaching of English grammatical structures whether the materials are adequate, relevant or not.</p> <p>6.           Finally this research work will suggest and recommend some measures for improving the standard of English language teaching and learning with special focus on grammatical structures at the primary school level.</p> <p>1.4    <strong>Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>There has been great and serious concern from parents, teachers and educational bodies about the declining standard of pupils’ performance in English language. It is because of this that the researcher sets out to test the following hypotheses:  </p> <p>            i)                That pupils in the primary school show non challant attitude to the learning of English grammatical structures due to its rules and technicalities.</p> <p>          ii)                That some of the teachers teaching English are not qualified to teach English.</p> <p>        iii)                That some teachers use methods that are inappropriate and inadequate for pupils comprehension in the teaching of English grammatical structures.</p> <p>         iv)                That there is general neglect by both teachers and pupils on the aspect of grammatical structures.</p> <p>           v)                That some English textbooks are inadequate, outdated and inappropriate for pupils’ learning background.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>1.5    <strong>Scope and Delimitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>Due to the large size of the study area and the number of primary schools availably, the researcher finds it uneasy to cover the whole primary schools in the local government area. Few schools are therefore randomly selected for the purpose of this study, namely:</p> <p>            i)                L.G.E.A Primary School, U/Sarki</p> <p>          ii)                L.G.E.A Primary School, U/Rimi</p> <p>        iii)                L.G.E.A Primary School, Kaduna</p> <p>         iv)                L.G.E.A Primary School, Kawo</p> <p>           v)                L.E.A Primary School, U/Shanu.</p> <p>         vi)                L.G.E.A Primary School, M/Gari.</p> <p>This research is also going to centre on the teaching and learning of English grammatical structures in the above primary schools only.</p> <p><br/><br/></p>                                                         \n\nEVALUATIVE STUDY OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ENGLISH GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURES IN SOME SELECTED PRIMARY SCHOOLS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EVALUATIVE STUDY OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ENGLISH GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURES IN SOME SELECTED PRIMARY SCHOOLS", "id": 185}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>This study examines strategies for improving low academic performance in English language in secondary schools in Kaduna state. Over the years, there has been a consistent decline in students’ performance in English Language. This sordid situation has caused teachers, parents, curriculum experts and evaluators a serious concern. To carry out this investigation, data were collected from thirty eight (38) English language teachers randomly from twenty secondary schools in Kaduna North Local Government Area. Analysis of the data revealed that poorly trained English language teachers, poor instructional delivery, lack of infrastructural facilities, teachers’ attitude toward innovation, and the traditional content/knowledge oriented curriculum were factors associated with students’ low performance in English language. Based on the findings recommendations were made on strategies that will improve the quality of performance in the subject. In this work, data collected in the area of material, facilities and human resources available for teaching the subject, using questionnaire, personal interview and relevant textbooks. Put together, the research questionnaire distributed were forty.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1      <strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>The modern trend in education and the complex nature of learning and instruction have made the role of the teachers more challenging. This new role does not just involve the more transmission of information to students but it involves looking at the problems associated with learning and instruction. The National Policy on Education (NPE, 2004) in Nigeria emphasized that our children should be educated properly so that they can acquire skills and competencies that would enable them function well and solve problems in the society. The accomplishment and realization of these important educational goals in Nigeria lies in the new trend in the educational approaches.</p> <p>These new approaches to learning and instruction expose the students to conceptualize and effectively manage their own learning and thus reinforce their learning and transfer their training in practical situations. Despite the new approach to learning and instruction, English language at the Senior Secondary School level in Nigeria has been plagued with poor results and low achievements. Annual results from West African Examinations Council (WAEC) reveal woeful performances from the students who have made enrolment for English language examinations a yearly ritual. It is worrisome to note too that the performance of these students has continued to deteriorate year after year. It is understood that if the situation in English Language remains like this, it will affect both the economic and technological growth of the state. This is because a good mastery of English language is mandatory on all students in order to do well in other secondary school subjects. Students who are handicapped in English language are therefore likely to be handicapped in the acquisition of skills in arts and technological related subjects.</p> <p>From the foregoing, therefore, we can conclude that English language is an indispensable language of communication in Kaduna.</p> <p>1.2      <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>This research as stated above concerns itself with the study of strategies for improving low academic performance in English language by suggesting possible solution to the following questions:</p> <p>                  i)                        What are the attitude/feelings of the students towards the studying of English language?</p> <p>                ii)                        What account for the decline in performance in the subject (English language)?</p> <p>             iii)                        Do they have enough material and human resources for the teaching and learning process?</p> <p>             iv)                        Do they understand the subject very well?</p> <p>                v)                        Does the Senior Secondary School Certificate (SSCE) syllabus have either a positive or a negative effect on the student performance?</p> <p>1.3      <strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of this study is to find out strategies for improving the performance of secondary school student in English language. Specifically it ought to:</p> <p>                  i)                        To find out the types of facilities available in the secondary schools for teaching English language.</p> <p>                ii)                        To identify the methods of teaching used in teaching English language.</p> <p>             iii)                        To identify the extent to which teachers are motivated to teach English language.</p> <p>             iv)                        To identify strategies for improving the low academic performance of students in English language.</p> <p>1.4      <strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions were formulated to guide the study:</p> <p>                  i)                        What type of facilities is available for teaching English language in secondary schools in Kaduna State?</p> <p>                ii)                        What are the methods of teaching adopted by English Language teachers?</p> <p>             iii)                        To what extent are English Language teachers motivated?</p> <p>             iv)                        What are the strategies for improving the low academic performance of students in English Language?</p> <p>1.6           <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This research work intends to investigate the student achievement in the subject. The research will be significant in the following ways:</p> <p>                  i)                        The findings of the study will shade light on the nature, contents examination and performance level of the SSCE examination.</p> <p>                ii)                        The findings of the study will contribute meaningfully to knowledge of teaching and learning English language especially with the role of English in the day-to-day communication.</p> <p>             iii)                        The findings of the students will also benefit Ministry of Education in Kaduna State by recruiting qualified teachers in order to improve the performance of the students.</p> <p>1.6      <strong>Delimitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study covers strategies for improving low academic performance in English Language in Secondary Schools in Kaduna State. Respondents were drawn from selected secondary schools in Kaduna North Local Government Area.</p> <p>1.7      <strong>Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>In any type of research work, are many hindrances that the researcher must come across in the course of the assignment. The problem encounter in the course of this could be attributed to delays in gathering the relevant data needed for the research work and uncompromising attitude of the people to give the required information. Time is another major limitation as far as the research work in concern. The time needed to implement the work may not be sufficient for logistic reasons. Financial resources may be lacking in carrying out the required work of the project.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>1.8      <strong>Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>·                    <strong>Performance</strong>: This relates to the execution carried out or putting into effect the task, job or operation.</p> <p>·                    <strong>Teacher</strong>: A professional trained to impart knowledge to pupils/students.</p> <p>·                    <strong>Assessment</strong>: Evaluation or estimation of the nature, value or quality of something or a subject.</p> <p>·                    <strong>Effectiveness</strong>: It is the ability to determine appropriate objectives, that is, the degree at which School’s goals are met within established resources “doing the right thing.”</p> <p>·                    <strong>Indiscipline: </strong>Thiscan be described as a mode of life not in conformation with rule and non-subjection to contain.

<p>1.1      <strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>English language occupies a prominent place in the Nigerian school curriculum.  The English language is one of the legacies to bequeathed Nigerians by the British which will be difficult to do away with.  This is because it is the major medium of instruction in our schools, of business transactions, of communication both nationally and internationally.  It is equally the language of industry since science and technology are <em>“sine qua non” </em> for development.  It is the language of mass communication and propaganda  in mass media.  In literature and Arts, it is the language of novels, poems, short stories, music and drama.  In social occasions, English language is used for conversation and interpersonal relationship.  It is also the key to educational advancement.  The life-wire of all activities in all works of life and key for better job opportunities.</p> <p>It is our official language and therefore imperative that every Nigerian should be able to read, write and communicate in good simple English.  This is important if Nigeria should overcome its health, economic, political and social problems.  For instance, health for all in the year 2020 will be unrealizable if citizens cannot read simple prescriptions in English; transfer of technology will also be unrealizable if many Nigerians cannot read and understand relevant books which are written in English.</p> <p>The language is gradually losing its standard.  This is because the multiplicity of languages in Nigeria has some influence on the English spoken by Nigerians.  One is again baffled to notice that secondary school students perform badly in West African School Certificate in English language Examination.  In view of this, teaching and the use of English language should be given prominent attention in secondary schools as the majority of Nigerian parents are illiterates and cannot provide a conducive home environment for language acquisition nor afford good schools for their children’s education  Azikiwe (1985).  The environment will always affect the language used.</p> <p>The need for mastery of English at the child’s early stages in life is far reaching because it makes for effective communication, better understanding and academic performance as the child moves from one level of education to another.  A child with a solid knowledge of English language at the primary school will encounter less problems in reading and understanding books and materials on science and technology which are to a large extent positively correlated with social and economic development.  There is need therefore for much more concern about effective teaching and learning of English language in our secondary schools and about products of our secondary schools not being able to meaningfully express themselves in English.</p> <p>From the foregoing, the English language is very important now that the country is geared towards technological, social, economic and political development.  A solid foundation in English should be laid for the children, right from the start as the much-talked about transfer of technology will be meaningless if the majority of Nigerians are poor at English as most materials on science and technology are written in English.  Lack of understanding of these materials and poor communication with experts will definitely hamper our move for national development in all spheres of life.  Moreover, for success in the campaign on rural development currently going on which advocates literacy and awareness for rural dwellers, English should be given a premier position in education of the rural dwellers for them to be able to contribute effectively to the improvement and development of their families, communities and the entire nation.</p> <p>Teachers of English have a role to play to lay a solid foundation for the teaching of English as a subject.  The researcher therefore sought to find out from teachers of English in secondary schools as well as senior secondary students, the influence of environment on performance of students in English.</p> <p>However, the English language is not an indigenous language to this country.  Time was, when no word of English was spoken in Nigeria.  It was about the middle of the 18th century when the English language started making  appearance in the linguistic map of the country.  The language came from Britons.  Before the English language, other European languages exited, such as the Portuguese language.  As far back as the 16th century, they came around the Niger Delta and Lagos.  Trade was an important factor to the coming of the English language in Nigeria.  The pattern of trade was cocoa in exchange for gun-powder, clothing materials with the system of trade known as trade by barter.</p> <p>The trade took another dimension of slave trade which is known as the trans-Atlantic and trans-Saharan trades called “the triangular slave trade” (1879).  The slaves carried to America learnt English there.  Apart from the slave trade and explorers, the first deliberate effort to implant the English language was through the missionaries.  We first had the Church Missionary Society also known as (C.M.S) which settled in Badagry.  After them were the Presbyterians, the Methodists and the Baptists, before the Catholic came.  They came to evangelize to preach and educate people about the evils of slave trade.  The factors that contributed to the spread of the learning of English was that these missionaries needed people who would be educated in English to help in reading the Bible (lay readers) and in its translation into native language.  Consequently, schools were established to train lay readers Catechist etc.  There were clergymen like Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther who aided  the spread of the language.</p> <p>The English that was studied then was Queen’s English in the schools followed by religious knowledge, and Arithmetic known as 3Rs.  With the help of the missionaries, the native languages were first documented.  With the advent of missionaries, colonialism came with the entrenchment of English language in Nigeria.  They came to protect their nations and so with time, district courts came and government domains unknown to most Africans.</p> <p>During the colonial era, the colonialist preordained English language as the Queen of subjects so that the civil servants can serve them with it as a working tool.  They started giving grants-in-aids, tied to the quantity and quality of English being taught in the school.  With colonialism, the English language has been formally entrenched in Nigeria.  Besides these factors, other factors have contributed since then.  The educational system has promoted English language in Nigeria:  Hence,</p> <p>1.          It is taught as a subject.</p> <p>2.          It was used as a medium of instruction</p> <p>3.          It was a yardstick for certification</p> <p>4.          It was also promoted in making it a criterion for upward mobility.</p> <p>5.          It became as access subject for higher education, that is, if you want to attend a higher institution you must have your English language.</p> <p>Again, some socio-economic factors have also contributed to the growth of English language in Nigeria.  It gave access to employment right from the colonial era.  People reverted those working with the white man.  So, it gave a social status that is above average.  Until recently, there was still prestige for someone with the mastery of English language.</p> <p>1.2      <strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Nsukka Local government is a bilingual society. It is inhabited mostly by lower-class citizens.  This is why “vernacular” is commonly used in Nsukka Local Government Area especially among students of secondary schools.</p> <p>It has been observed that there are many instances of physical environment in which a society lives being reflected in its language, often in the structure of the lexicon – the way in which distinctions are made by means of single world (Trudgil, 1971).  For instance, the Bedowin Arabic has as large camel vocabulary whereas the Fulani of Nigeria has just one label similarly many words will be used to express cold in temperate region communities and hot in tropical environments and so in Nsukka Local government Area environment.</p> <p>Since the government has implemented the educational language policy in the country, it is vividly true that environment handicap has contributed greatly to the problems but then there are equally other factors that have contributed to the total differences on English language mastery by students, in secondary schools in Nsukka Local Government Area such as:</p> <p>Non use of learning activities, inadequate of skilled teachers, lack of operation of audio-visual with the aid of electricity, mother tongue, interference, pidgin English interference, lack of adequate library facilities, poor social infratructural facilities; physical condition of classroom situation.  Lack of evaluation of inspectorate to schools.  Finally, social class problem and lack of instructional material and poor preparation by teachers.</p> <p>1.3      <strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The importance of the relationship between the English language and society cannot be over emphasized in education of the student and indeed in the growth and development of any community.</p> <p>The English language plays a vital role to the government as it is being used for the purpose of government and administration, as documentation of government records; administrative instruction and minutes, legislation; court records and proceedings.</p> <p>Again English is most noticeable in the field of education as it is being introduced as a subject in the first years of primary school and from the third year of the primary school up to university level as a medium of instruction.  This in effect, means that the Nigerian child’s access to the cultural and scientific knowledge of the world is largely through English since the products of the schools will be absorbed into types of employment where English is the official medium of communication and where congruently, proficiency in English to a necessary qualification, the pre-eminent position of English in the educational system is likely to remain for long time.</p> <p>Furthermore, in the mass media, English is in a predominant position.  All the national newspapers are published in English, Radio, non-musical programmes, newscasters.  Television are almost entirely in English.</p> <p>Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to look at how some environmental factors affect students’ performance in English, its prospects and problems faced by students.  In addition, the study is geared towards making some recommendations.</p> <p>1.4   <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will be of great significance to the students, teachers, parents, educational planners, language planners as well as the government.</p> <p>(a)         It will instill in the learners/students the quest and zeal to study and master English.</p> <p>(b)        To the teachers, it will enable them to be committed by making adequate preparations of their lesson note and lesson plan.</p> <p>(c)         On the part of the parents, the feed back they get through their children’s results will motivate them to encourage their children in the requisition of the language.</p> <p>(d)        To the educational planners, they would be most privileged because the study will take the form of evaluation on what they have earlier planned, thereby putting into consideration the implementation of this policy.  The language planners will discover from this study problems faced by their schools within this language community and design appropriate instructional materials for effective teaching and learning of the English language.</p> <p>(e)         Finally, this work will be useful too to the government.  It will enable them to make available trained personnel both for English language and material resources for the efficient implementation of the policy.  They will also be geared to make and provide learning facilities and equipment such as textbooks, audio-visual gadgets, conducive classrooms and other language laboratory to aid and motivate the students in the proper method of studying English language.</p> <p>In summary, this study will be an invaluable asset to parents in shaping the English language performance of their children because children are affected by the quantitative and qualitative limitations of parental language model.</p> <p>T.R. Bimie (1972) and E.A. Hewit (1968) discovered through a research that teacher’s achievement in English is closely related to parental education and occupation.  This according to them is because students are exposed to various forms of English most of which are not correct.</p> <p>Again, these children as a result, pick up slangs, words and particular linguistic register that they eventually find difficult to drop.  According to Durojaiye   “The influence of a good home background is an invaluable aid to the child’s future language development.</p> <p>1.4      <strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1.          Does the school have enough qualified English language teachers?</p> <p>2.          Does the class size influence or affect written assignments to students?</p> <p>3.          Does the school have a well-equipped library?</p> <p>4.          Do parents socio-economic status or background affect or influence students study of English.</p> <p>1.5      <strong>DELIMITATION</strong></p> <p>This study is specifically concerned with the influence of environment on the performance of students in English language in secondary schools in Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State.  The environment in this sense comprises; the physical school environment, the community environment, home background (socio-economic status), facilities for language teaching and learning and language teaching professional background-teaching skills and commitment.</p> <p>1.6      <strong>LIMITATION</strong></p> <p>This study is restricted to the secondary schools in Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State.  The research work was constrained by inadequate time, finance and lack of cooperation from few persons questioned.  The time alloted to this study was relatively limited.  However, the researcher was able to visit all the places he intends to visit for collection of data.</p> <p>In addition to having limited time, there was financial handicap as regards transportation to and from the town the researcher needs to gather information necessary for the completion of this work.</p> <p>1.7       <strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>Some terms used in this study have been defined in their operation terms to suit the purpose of this study for instance:</p> <p><strong>Environment:</strong>  This has to do with the whole personal behaviour together with conditions and influence that affect the development and life of the student.</p> <p><strong>Teaching Aids/Learning Activities:</strong>  These are materials which enhance teaching and learning, assist or promote the process of teaching and learning; such as textbooks, audio-visual equipment, chalk, chalkboard, biro, flashcards and charts.</p> <p><strong>Pidgin English:</strong>  A language that developed when individuals from different linguistic backgrounds here and there are in need to communicate; used basically for mutual intelligibility.</p> <p><strong>Lingua-franca:  </strong>It is an accepted official language in a multi-lingua society.</p> <p><strong>Interference:</strong>  Negative influence of one language to another usually due to proper mastery of one and an imperfect mastery of the other.</p> <p><strong>Mutual Intelligibility:</strong>  Understanding among language speakers when each of them speaks.</p> <p><strong>Home Background:</strong>  there are factors influencing a child from his or her family environment.</p> <p><strong>Mother Tongue:</strong>  The language of a child’s mother or parents.</p>                                                          \n\n THE IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  THE IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE", "id": 187}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Background of Study</p> <p>          The struggle for women’ right began in the 18th century during the period of intense intellectual activity known as the Age of Enlightenment.</p> <p>In traditional Africa the woman is an object of constant scorn, degradation and physical torture. In the past, women did not exist as individuals with personalities to defend. They rather existed as mere docile and exotic accompaniments to the males. Throughout that period, women lacked a voice to articulate their dilemma and their points of view. They, thus, accepted their fate without resistance. Such passive stance results from societal conditioning through questionable cultural practices. From birth, through childhood and adolescence, to adulthood, Africans receive from society and others around the messages and feedbacks which launch them into roles and behaviors considered appropriate for males and females respectively. Most often, female are accorded inferior roles and such long years of cultural suppression and intimidation, unfortunately, misled the women into an underestimation of their capabilities and self worth. Encased in such a cultural mystique, the African women were particularly driven by a community sense since culture obviates individualism. In those days, these women, in addition to experiencing the same oppressive social condition as their male counterparts in a developing world, were subjected to extra repressive burdens arising from the socio-cultural structures of patriarchy and gender hierarchy. These years of subjugation have, however, produced in today’s women relentless questioning of the status quo. They protest against dehumanization, political enslavement and social oppression. They rationalize that the running of the Africa world is not the preserve for males and thus there should be absolute equality of both sexes in all spheres of life. Such a reaction is termed feminism, which is an ideology that urges, in simple terms, recognition of the claims of women for equal rights with men.</p> <p>          According to Cora Kaplan (162) Literary text are constructed from within ideology, and the reality they articulate is dependent on the historical culture which surrounds them; so too are the literary critical claims about their truthfulness or authenticity determined by the culture from which they arise. Helen Chukwuma (xiv) specifically contends that African feminism is dedicated and informed from within, from social realities that obtain. One of such realities is the persistence of sexist socio-psychological paradigm despite the efforts to overcome “the androcentricism which informs social life”. (Uko, 33)</p> <p>           The persistent sexism in Africa is, however, matched with women’s continued aggressive demand for equal places in men’s former citadel of power and privilege. The chorus African women say to men “whatever the case maybe, you will never again hear us pronounce the words of the Virgin Mary, ‘thy will be done’ while smiling at your despotic power”. (Josephine Felicite in Moses, C.G. and Rabine, L. 308-309). They argue that it is better for men to desire from them those noble and generous feelings which must exist between equals than those mercenary feelings which a slave has for his master. Consequent upon this quest and argument, there is a recent definition of womanhood in the context of the African cosmic order: “A human being endowed with all the capabilities and talents required to effectively function and make impact on all levels of life within society” (Adeife Osemeikhiam, 21).</p> <p>         Notwithstanding the above stance, there still abounds in Africa, evidence of gender stereotypes which simply means a collection of commonly held beliefs or opinions about what are “appropriate” behaviors and activities for males and those that are “appropriate” for females. As a result of this, even though men support women’s condemnation of their (women) societal deprivations, men’s language still betrays subtle inclination to sexist socialization.</p> <p><em>The New Lexicon Webster’s Encyclopedic Dictionary of the English Language</em>, Sexism is exemplified firstly as attitudes and institutions, often unconscious that judge human worth on the grounds of gender or sex.</p> <p>         It is explained as prejudice or discrimination usually against women, based on their gender. Sexist socialization, therefore, refers to the process by which infants and children are brought up to imbibe attitudes and practices that discriminate against women on the grounds of their gender.</p> <p>        This work examines <em>So Long a Letter</em> with a view to highlight its characteristic language usage and as well as the psychological disposition that informs such use of language. Research findings by anthropologists, educationists and sociolinguistics show that traditionally, males use non-standard language; females use the language of rapport while males use the language of report; discursive language style is meant for women while men are given to the language of theories and abstractions; females use polite language meant to maintain harmony and strong relationship as well as to keep conversations open whereas males use the language of assertiveness and insistence. Women use the language of solidarity but men use the language of the expert.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Men in Africa make women understand that they, the men, are the head of the family that is, they are superior to women. They see women as being weak and as a result, women have no say in the activities of the community. They have no rights and are subjugated to do whatever he the men want them to do especially in Africa. Women are made to feel inferior and this breeds some sort of ill feelings in women.</p> <p><strong>Objective of the study</strong></p> <p><strong>The aim of this is to identify how Mariama Ba uses language to portray feminism - the reaction of females against the oppressive and discriminatory culture experienced by them - in her novel <em>So Long a Letter.</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p><strong>          The topic Language in Feminist Literature: a study of Mariama Ba’s <em>So Long a Letter</em>, will serve as a good research material to students and other researchers.</strong></p> <p><strong>          This work will throw more light on the language of feminism and its impact to society.</strong></p> <p><strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>          This project is restricted primarily to the study of the Language in Feminist Literature in Mariama Ba’s <em>So Long a Letter</em>.</p> <p><strong>Research Methodology</strong></p> <p>          The primary material of this work is Mariama Ba’s <em>So Long a Letter</em> while the secondary materials include the various works from the library.</p>                                                          \n\nTHE LANGUAGE OF FEMINISM AND ITS IMPACT ON THE SOCIETY USING THE WORK OF MARIAMA BA’S SO LONG A LETTER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE LANGUAGE OF FEMINISM AND ITS IMPACT ON THE SOCIETY USING THE WORK OF MARIAMA BA’S SO LONG A LETTER", "id": 188}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1     <strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Language is the distinctive quality unique to man. It is what enables man to express him/herself and communicate with his/her fellow man, and it is acquired naturally. According to Fromkin et al “…language is the source of human life and power” (3). They also state that “we use language to convey information to others…, ask questions…, give command…, and express wishes” (173).  There are two specific media of using language: oral – which is by words of mouth; and written – which is a graphic representation of words on paper.</p> <p>It is in the use of language that style comes in. Style shows the difference between one piece of writing and the other. According to Adejare, “style is an ambiguous term…” (1). He further states that the term style means different things to different professions. Some examples are: to a psychologist, style is a form of behaviour, to the critic, style is individuality and to the linguist, it is the formal structures in function (1).</p> <p>       Stylistics is the study of oral and written texts. It is the description of the linguistic characteristics (which means features of linguistics) of all situationally restricted uses of language. Linguistics is the scientific study of language or of a particular language. Linguistics is scientific because it applies the method of objective observation, collection, classification and application of facts to the study of language.</p> <p>Stylistics focuses on texts and gives much attention to the devices, parts of speech and figures of speech. It goes further to look into the effects of the use of the devices on the reader.</p> <p>Talking about the scope of stylistics, Onwukwe Ekwutosi gave four distinctive types of stylistics and they are:</p> <p>1.                 General stylistics</p> <p>2.                  Literary stylistics</p> <p>3.                 Stylo-stylistics</p> <p>4.                 Phono-stylistics</p> <p>General stylistics deals with the non-dialectical varieties found within a language. In other words, it deals with situational or contextual use of language, that is, variation according to use. It also includes variation of language according to field of discourse, variation according to mode of discourse and finally, variation according to style of discourse.</p> <p>Literary stylistics deals with language use in literature, that is, variations, characteristics of individual writer that made mark in literature. Often, we hear people talk about the style of Shakespeare, Milton, Achebe or Soyinka.</p> <p>And also, stylo-stylistics deals with the qualification of stylistic pattern. It studies the statistical structure of literary texts often using computers. Finally, phono-stylistics is the study of expression of aesthetic function of sound.</p> <p>Stylistic features can be described as features that produce style. They include linguistic features such as diction(writer’s choice of words, such as clichés, archaism, polysyllabic, monosyllabic), sentence structure such as loose and period sentences, parallelism, parenthetical expressions and passive expressions. Other features are cohesion, coherence, use of punctuation marks and figures of speech such as metaphor, simile, hyperbole, metonymy and personification, slang, colloquialism and connotation.</p> <p><strong>Diction:</strong> By diction, the reader looks at the simplicity or the difficulty of words chosen by the writer to express himself.</p> <p><strong>Sentence:</strong> It is made up of words that express a complete thought. It is the basic unit of thought in any communication. Both oral and written languages are made up of sentences. There are two main kind of sentences; loose and periodic sentences.</p> <p><strong>Loose sentence:</strong> It is the kind of sentence that states the main point at the beginning. Even when the statement is grammatically complete, one or more explanatory clauses or phrases come after it.</p> <p><strong>Periodic sentence:</strong> This kind of sentence keeps the main point for the end. The sentence is not grammatically complete until the end of the sentence.</p> <p><strong>Parallelism:</strong> It is the use of pattern repetition in a literary text for a particular stylistic effect.</p> <p><strong>Parenthetical expression:</strong> It is used to give more information and also as an after thought in a statement.</p> <p><strong>Passive expression:</strong> This is the use of words in the past tense to show the time of action.</p> <p><strong>Cohesion:</strong> It is a linguistic phenomenon which explains the way discourse is structured or organized with regard to message. It is a binding force that ties together stretches of utterances.</p> <p><strong>Coherence:</strong> This is the arrangement of sentence in a logical order.</p> <p><strong>Punctuation marks:</strong> Are signs in writing to divide sentences and phrases and to make meanings clear.</p> <p><strong>Figure of speech:</strong> A figure of speech is an expression used figuratively rather than literary. It gives a deeper meaning to word. Some examples are:</p> <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Is a comparison between two dissimilar things which have something in common.</p> <p><strong>Simile:</strong> It is a clear comparison between two dissimilar things. These two unlike items however share something in common. It is this common characteristic that is emphasized by the use of like or as …as.</p> <p><strong>Hyperbole:</strong> It is an overstatement where the speaker exaggerates what he is saying out of proportion.</p> <p><strong>Metonymy:</strong> This is using a word for something to refer to another with which it has become closely associated.</p> <p><strong>Personification:</strong> It is giving human quality to an inanimate object.</p> <p><strong>Slang:</strong> Very informal words and expressions that are more common in spoken language, especially used by a particular group of people.</p> <p><strong>Colloquialism:</strong> A word or phrase that is used in conversation but not in formal speech in writing.</p> <p><strong>Connotation:</strong> It is the additional meaning the word gains because of the different environment in which a word has been used in the past.</p> <p><strong>Archaism:</strong> This is the use of old and middle English words which are no longer in general usage today.Some examples are, “thereto”, “thou”.</p> <p><strong>Clichés:</strong> They are phrases or ideas that have been used so often that it no longer has much meaning and is not interesting.</p> <p> A way of stylistic analysis is taking a text and analyzing it at the various levels of linguistic organization – phonological, morphological, syntactic, and semantic levels. It is the identification of patterns of usage in speech and writing. It is usually made for the purpose of commenting on quality and meaning in a text.</p> <p>1.2     <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Though many works have been done on the style of Ngugi wa Thiong’o’s other novels, not much has been done on his style in <em>Wizard of the Crow</em>, which is his most recent novel, published in 2007. Consequently, the researcher intends to examine the style of Ngugi in this latest novel.</p> <p>Secondly, most of the works did not use quantitative stylistic analysis to determine the predominant or most frequently occurring devices. They often simply listed out all the devices used.</p> <p>1.3     <strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objectives of this study is to identify the predominant devices used by Ngugi wa Thiong’o in his novel <em>Wizard of the Crow</em> and what he achieved by using those devices.</p> <p>1.4     <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research will help the readers identify the predominant stylistic devices used by Ngugi wa Thiong’o in his latest novel <em>Wizard of the Crow</em> and why he used them. It will also provide reference material for other researchers in the field.</p> <p>1.5     <strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is restricted to the novel <em>Wizard of the Crow</em>, a novel comprising six books namely; Book 1 – Power Daemons, Book 2 – Queuing Daemons, Book 3 – Female Daemons, Book 4 – Male Daemons, Book 5 – Rebel Daemons and Book 6 – Bearded Daemons, with a total of 264 chapters.</p> <p>To enable the researcher carryout a detailed study of the text and for close textual references considering the limited time available to the researcher, the scope is further restricted to only 30 chapters of the novel. In addition, the researcher will restrict the analysis of the stylistic devices to the use of ellipses, rhetorical questions, parenthetical expressions, italics and long sentences which in the course of reading the novel, the researcher found to have occurred more frequently than the others.</p> <p>1.6     <strong>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>The method to be used in this study will be intensive study of related materials from the library and close textual analysis of the text: <em>Wizard of the Crow </em>using quantitative stylistic analysis. This entails counting and writing down the number of times each of the selected stylistic devices occurred. In addition, 5 chapters will be selected by simple random sampling from each of the six books giving a total sample of 30 chapters out of the total 264 chapters that make up the novel.</p>                                                           \n\nTHE PREDOMINANT DEVICES USED BY NGUGI WA THIONG’O IN HIS NOVEL WIZARD OF THE CROW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PREDOMINANT DEVICES USED BY NGUGI WA THIONG’O IN HIS NOVEL WIZARD OF THE CROW", "id": 189}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong> 1.0      Introduction</strong></p> <p> This Non-African play Dr. Faustus is a medieval play. It presented allegorical characters to represent the life of man, the experiences of temptation, the sins and the struggle for salvation and death. Dr Faustus contends with the forces of good and evil in the form of personified ab      stractions including the Good and Bad Angels, the seven deadly sins and the Devil. The play is didactic in purpose intended to instruct the audience in Christian virtues and to warn against vices. Also in the play, one is taken beyond the frontiers of mental world into the region of space and the supernatural.</p> <p><strong>1.1 Purpose of study</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to explain the themes and styles employed in the play <em>Dr. Faustus</em> by Christopher Marlowe. There exists a detailed study of styles in the text in relation to the themes.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Scope of Study</strong></p> <p>This essay examines the themes and styles in the play, <em>Dr Faustus</em> by Christopher Marlowe. Marlowe uses these elements to realize the subject matter of the work. My choice of Marlowe as a literary artist is informed by his specialty in portraying the essence of man in the light of gaining all but losing his soul. The themes and styles appeal to my literary judgment between renaissance and medieval values, the divided nature of man, power as a corruptive influence which is the focus of this essay.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Methodology</strong></p> <p>This is a quantitative research. The primary source of information for this long essay is the text <em>Dr Faustus</em>.  Others includes; M.H Abrams’ <em>A Glossary of Literary Terms, Anthology: An introduction to literature, Mc  Cullen ,J.T., “Dr. Faustus and renaissance learning”, Collier’s Encyclopedia and Comprehensive Literature </em>by Martins Amechi.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Theoretical Background</strong></p> <p>            The play, <em>Doctor Faustu</em>s by Christopher Marlowe,   has the background of Moralistic approach. This approach is concern with: values, lessons, messages that can help readers improve their lives and understand the world better. This play reinvents the Christian dictum: What shall it profit a man to gain the world and lose his soul?</p> <p>            Doctor Faustus sells his soul to the devil and is sent to hell. Marlowe explains Dr. Faustus religious beliefs: in Acts 1, in Faustus is given the chance to ask Mephistopheles questions about hell. He could be thought of as an atheist because he denies that there is God and thinks of religions as a false ritual.</p> <p>                          He states: “My heart is hardened, I cannot repent. Scarce can I name salvation, faith or heaven, swords, poisons, halters and envenomed my steel</p> <p>Aare land before me to dispatch myself… I am resolved, Faustus shall not repent” (45).</p> <p>When he finally asks for forgiveness and wants to repent to God, he is denied and is forced to spend eternity in hell.</p> <p>            The theme of moralistic play is good conduct this play resonates with a wealth of themes that teaches ethical values and lessons to the readers.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Life and works of the Author</strong></p> <p>            Christopher Marlowe was born in 1564 to John Marlowe, a shoemaker. He had two sister named Dorothy and Ann. He attended king’s school, Canterbury and proceeded to Benet College of Corpus Christi’ Cambridge. He earned his Bachelor’s degree in 1583. In 1587 he proceeded to a master’s degree program which did not pull through as the university had threatened to withhold his final degree. He later completed the program, after which he preceded to London.</p> <p>            His first play <em>Tamburlaine</em> was acted in 1587 or 1588. The story is drawn from the Spanish life of Timur by Pedro Mexia. This won him immediate popularity.  It was followed in 1604 by <em>Doctor Faustus</em>, a great advance upon <em>Tamburlaine.</em></p> <p>            Others include <em>The Jew of Malta</em>, <em>Edward 11, the massacre of Paris</em> and <em>the</em> <em>Tragedy of Dido</em>. In addition to these he wrote short poems such as: come live with me and be my love translated from <em>Oxid’s Amores and Lucani’s pharsalia</em> and a glowing paraphrase of <em>Musaeus’</em> <em>Hero and leanoler</em>, a poem completed by Chapman.</p> <p>            Marlowe was reputed to be an atheist who held dangerous implication of being an enemy of God. Often he has been described as a spy, a brawler and a heretic, as well as a “magician”, “tobacco- user”, and “counterfeiters”.</p> <p> J.A. Donnie and Constance Koriyama have argued against these speculations but J.B Steane remarked: “it seems absurd to dismiss all of these Elizabethan rumors and accusations as the Marlowe myth. Worthy of note is that Marlowe was murdered in prison and died at the age of twenty-nine.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Review of Criticism</strong></p> <p>Available literature shows that works have been done on <em>Dr Faustus,</em> themes and styles.  However, my research reveals these facts about the text. Arian Sachs, who interprets the play as an exploration of protestant theology with an orthodox moral, asserts that: in general, the scheme of values in which the action of <em>Doctor Faustus</em> takes place is the fundamental Christian outlook which prevailed in the Western world from the decline of Roman secularism to the disintegration of the dogmatic tradition long after the play was written. For Sachs, any interpretation of the play which considers Faustus as a figure to be admired by the audience simply overlooks the religious- historical context in which the play was produced.</p> <p>Robert Ornstein similarly dismisses the idea of Faustus as an admirable humanist.</p> <p>Joseph T. McMullen argues that Faustus’ down fall comes about as a direct result of his “culpable ignorance”. As Mike Pincombe states “for all Faustus’ learning, he is still a dilettante  when it comes to wisdom. “This argument is not without evidence; Faustus knowingly signs away his soul, despite Mephistopheles’ words of experience which warn him to “leave these frivolous demands, which strike a terror to my fainting soul!” (Acts3.83-84). He takes his academic skepticism to an absurd degree, challenging the description of hell offered by Mephistopheles. He offers himself visible proof of its inexistence, with the retort “come, I think hell’s a fable”. (Acts1.1.130). despite his reputation in the academic world, one can question Faustus abilities as a scholar; the syllogism that he constructs in the first soliloquy provides an example:</p> <p>Jerome’s Bible, Faustus, view it well. (He reads) Stipendium peccatimors est.</p> <p>Ha!</p> <p>Stipendium, etc.</p> <p>The reward of sin is death. That’s hard.</p> <p>(He reads) Sipecass  negamus, fallimum</p> <p>Et nulla est in mobis veritas if we say that we have no sin We decisive ourselves and there’s no truth in us.</p> <p>Why then be like we must sin and so consequently (Acts1.1.38-48)</p> <p>From the evidence that Faustus provides his assertion is logically sound, but, through either ineptitude or negligence, the biblical quotations upon which it is built are taken entirely out of context, a fact observed by David Belington: “For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God’s is eternal life through Jesus Christ our lord” (Romans 6:23); the second, “if we say we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and truth is not in us. If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness”. (1 John 1:8).</p> <p>            In his <em>Poetics,</em> Aristotle postulated the constituents of tragedy. He states that:</p> <p>Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is admirable, complete and possesses magnitude; in language made pleasurable, each of its species separated in different parts; performed by actors, not through narration; effecting through pity and fear the purification of such emotions.</p> <p>            Nearly two thousand years later in Marlowe’s life time-echoes of Aristotle’s definition of the genre can be heard in Philip Sidney’s <em>An Apology for Poetry. </em>He invests tragedy with a more didactic and utilitarian purpose than does Aristotle.</p> <p>J.C. Maxwell presupposes that: Faustus is everyman and his sin is a re-enactment of the sin of Adam-pride”.</p> <p>Marlowe <em>Dr. Faustus</em> as a tragedy set in 18th Century Elizabethan Era is an example of the definition of tragedy postulated by Aristotle. According to his definition, tragedy or tragic situations can only happen to a man born of high reputes, rise so high or achieve so high to become master over all his surveys. Such a man must have a basic flaw in his nature or character that would make him fall from that pinnacle and in most cases, that flaw must be of hubris proportion. Pride against  the gods.</p> <p>According to Laura Reis Mayer, <em>Dr Faustus</em> is a morality play, a historical allegory, the tale of a hero gone bad due to the dilemma presented by an ever changing world. (3)</p> <p>The Greek playwright Sophocles explored the basic themes in<em> Dr Faustus</em> in Oedipus when the fallibility of the protagonist was attributed to his harsh and rash temper. Shakespeare also employs this basic theme in tragedy <em>Julius Creaser, King Lear </em>and<em> Macbeths.</em></p> <p>            Arthur Miler the 20th Century American playwright contrasted Aristotle’s definition of tragedy in his classic play of <em>Death of a Sales Man</em> when he explains the tragedy of the common man as opposed to tragedy relating to a man of high birth.</p> <p><strong>1.7 Justification</strong></p> <p>Looking at the above reviews, it becomes obvious that works have been done on <em>Dr Faustus</em>. My research is different from all these because it centers on the themes and styles. I chose the topic because it has ethical values that are realistic and relevant to modern societies. The situation in the text depicts life and human experiences in modern day society and this is what the topic of this essay examines.</p> <p><strong>1.8 Thesis Statement                                                                                                 </strong>This essay resonates with a wealth of themes such as the conflict between medieval values and renaissance, power as a corruptive influence, the divided nature of man and the styles in the text.</p>                                                          \n\nTHEMES AND STYLE IN CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE’S DR.

The population of study comprised of all the workers in all the selected industries located within Oshodi and Agege Local Government Area of Lagos State.  The sample of study consisted of one-hundred and twenty (120) workers from five (5) industries located within Oshodi-Isolo Local Government Area of Lagos State.  The study adopted the use of questionnaire as the instrument for data collection. The data collected were analysed using the frequency counts and simple percentage to complete the demographic data of the participants and to answer the research questions while all the research hypotheses were tested using the chi-square (x2) method at 0.05 level of significance. The findings of the study revealed that the special language needs of Lagos State workers are on English language communication skills (listening, speaking, reading, writing). Writing and speaking skills have been found as the most special language skills needed in the Lagos  State workplaces. And that workers from Afriprint are mostly in need of training in these special language skills among others. Based on the findings of the study, the following recommendations were made by the researcher. There is need for industries to organize periodical in-service training especially in terms of their workers communication skills. Since English language is the official language in Nigeria and the major medium of communication in the midst of a multilingual population, English proficiency of workers need to be facilitated by organizing seminars and workshops aimed at enhancing workers English language skills.It is also important to conduct periodical assessment on the workers special language skills in order to ascertain the particular area of weakness and design the remedial programmes to assist the workers among others.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>There is urgent need for every industry to begin to take precautionary steps towards developing the proficiency level of their employees for maximum productivity. There is a strong apprehension that the current global employability will be only for graduates who are proficient in the language needed for the job particularly in countries like Mexico, Angola,, Nigeria among others. For an establishment to continue to make productive impact on its immediate environment, there must be adequate communication skill among the workers in the workplace. </p> <p>Communication is an indispensable activity in the workplace. Within industrialized nations like Nigeria; the expectation of fluency in speech is omnipresent. Understanding the interaction dynamics of the workplace is vital to a successful business enterprise.  No rapid progress can be made in the absence of effective communicative skill.  The success of any form of establishment is hinged on proper communication skill and the right choice of words in delivering duties in the workplace.</p> <p>Language is defined according to Maduekwe (2007) as the most sophisticated communication tool of life and a vehicle for communication in the workplace.   Special language use in the workplace refers to situations where a worker needs language to perform all or part of his occupational duties. English, which is the official language inNigeria can never be overemphasized. Language of business, education, technology, judiciary, job interview, communication etc. Today, millions of Nigerians speak in English language.</p> <p>This English language isdeveloped in England and now used throughout<strong> t</strong>he British commonwealth of nations, in the United States of America and in other parts of the world.</p> <p>The first attempt is to establish the use of the English Language in Nigeria dates back to 19th century when industrial revolution started in Europe and there was quests for raw materials and market for the finished goods produced in these industries.  The British and Portuguese merchants invaded the West African Coast to trade with Nigeria businessmen and since business transaction cannot be thrive in the absence of a common Language, a Language of communication (English) gradually emerged as a medium of transaction.</p> <p>Much later, some shrewd Nigerian Businessmen in Calabar sent their children to England to learn English while some others had their children taught English to enable them establish a strong trade link with the Europeans (Njoku and Izuagba, 2014).</p> <p>Importance of communication in the workplace is enormous. Within industrialized nations like Nigeria; the expectation of fluency in speech is omnipresent. Understanding the interaction dynamics of the workplace is vital to a successful business enterprise. According to Nwachukwu (2008), the most common means by which human beings communicate with one another is language. Language is used to create, reinforce and maintain social structures at and beyond workplace. Any workplace where the line of communication is free and open, there are development and any misunderstanding is easily settled. But where the line of communication is clogged, there are bounds to be prejudice, bias and suspicion,business is static and progress is hampered.</p> <p>It is expected that every worker in Nigeria should at least be literate in English language especially in Lagos state where companies are always in the increase having workers of diverse backgrounds. Instead,what is being experienced is the continued growth of limited English proficient workers that make up the entire workforce. The statistics of the department of Labour (2004) and the census Bureau (2006) indicate that, the need for school drop-out workers will continue to rise and that by the year 2020, 43%(24.7 million)of all prospective job openings will be for people with minimum education level of which many have limited English proficiency.</p> <p>To investigate the effectiveness of the interaction between employers and pre-dominantly monolingual at the workplace, a needs analysis research must be conducted. Needs are not things to be determined by a pre-constructed checklist or by mere looks .It is determined by the process of analysis .Needs are wants, desires and goals. It represents the gap between what the learner wants to get out of his working experience and his current state of knowledge, skill and enthusiasm (Noessel,2003). This need could be language needs, financial needs, intellectual needs, psychological needs or two put together. To determine this need, a researcher has to conduct a research to identify a particular need through the process of needs analysis.</p> <p>Needs analysis is known to be the primary component of ENGLISH FOR SPECIFIG PURPOSES (ESP). It is the systematic collection and analysis of all subjective information necessary to define and validate defensible curriculum purposes that satisfy the language learning requirement of workers within the context of a particular workplace that influences work effectiveness(Brown,1995).Needs analysis is the core of every successful ESP program. It determines the need for which a worker requires a language and arranging the needs according to priorities. It involves fact finding and data collection.</p> <p>Needs analysis was first emerged in language teaching in the 1960s.It was closely associated with English for specific purpose (Brindley,1989). The importance of language needs analysis in the workplace lies in the fact that the outcome should be a list of goals and objectives of the worker’s need for language which serves as the basis for developing test, materials, teaching activities, and evaluation strategies etc.</p> <p>It is a well-known fact that, the process of a standard needs analysis is said to be the most important step to course development, material design as well as in determining vocational, workplace language and communication needs of workers.</p> <p>English for specific purposes(ESP) on the other hand is an approach to the teaching of English as a second language(ESL) that focuses on determining the linguistics needs of a specific group of learners and then design course to satisfy the needs in the most efficient manner. Because ESP addresses a specific group of learners, with similar characteristics, its course design usually focuses on the topics and language of a specific discipline, occupation or activity(Strevens,1988;in Dudley-Evens and st.John,1998).</p> <p>The need for ESP arose from General English. As the name implies, general English is the English we study in school for general use.</p> <p>However, the emergence of ESP was not a planned and coherent movement, but rather a phenomenon, which grew out of a number of converging trends;</p> <p>First, the demand of a new world created after the Second World War in 1945 which later dominated by technology and commerce. As a result, there was demand for an international language for business promotion and the demand fell on English language. This promoted English language to the international standard. Prior to this development, English language was regarded as a sign of well-rounded education. And was no longer learnt for pleasure or prestige but created a new generation of learners especially businessmen and women who wanted to sell their products, mechanics who had to read instruction manuals and doctors who needed to keep up the development in their field as well as students whose courses and texts are available in English.</p> <p>Second, the oil rise of the early 1970s(oil exploration). According to Huchinson and Walters(1987), English suddenly become a big business and the constraint of time and money led to the need for creation of cost effective courses with clearly defined goals.</p> <p>Third, was as a result of new ideas in the study of linguistics. Instead of the formal traditional ways of describing the formal features of the language, the new studies shifted attention to discovering the ways in which language is actually used in real communication(Widdowson,1978).There become an important difference between the language of a particular field of study which led to the argument by  Linguist saying that, if language differs from one situation to another, it is then possible to determine the features of specific situations and then make those features the basis of learners’ course. The notion that, English needed by a particular group of learners could be identified by analyzing the linguistics characteristics of their specialized areas of work or study then gained ground.</p> <p>  “The guiding principle became; tell me what you need English for and I will tell you the English that you need”(Huchinson and Walters,1987)</p> <p>Forth, was the new development in educational psychology which emphasized the central importance of learners and their attitude of learning(Rogers,1969).Learners were seen to have needs and interest which would have an important influence on their motivation to learn and therefore, on the effectiveness of their learning. This led to the creation of learner-centered curriculum design.</p> <p>It is worthy of note that, the first conference on ESP was convened in the year 1969 (Mackey, 1976) when its original name was changed from the term “Language for special purposes” to its present name “English for specific purposes” due to the notion that, attention for this course is not only on the learners but also on the language resources of the learners like; English for law, English for medicine, English for engineering, English for business etc.</p> <p>Furthermore, ESP is divided into two broad areas according to Kennedy and Bolitho (1984) namely; English for Occupational Purposes (EOP) and English for Academic Purposes (EAP). EOP is taught in situations where learners need English for work. while EAP is taught generally within educational institutions to students using English in their studies.</p> <p>EOP is divided into two; English for professional purposes(medicine, law, business, etc) and vocational purposes(priest, mechanics, artisans, etc) and is further divided into pre-vocational and vocational English.Pre-vocational English is concerned with finding a job and interview skills while vocational English is concerned with language of specific trades or occupation.</p> <p>It is pertinent at this point to state that this research work is to investigate the special language needs of workplaces in Lagos State..</p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Commutation is an indispensable activity in the workplace. The most common means  by which human  beings communicate with one another is language. Workers’ ability to</p> <p>Communicate with their employers and acquire sufficient language skills to function in the workplace are two of the key points to their success and the success of the business as well.</p> <p>In recent years, language-related problems at workplaces have been at the center of controversy surrounding workforce. The statistics of the department of Labour (2004).</p> <p>Bureau (2006) indicate that, the need for flawed English workers will continue to rise and that by the year 2020, 43% (24.7 million) of all prospective job ‘openings will be for people with effective communication skills of which many graduates have limited English proficiency. www.cambridgeenglish.or/roly-cambridge-english found that; in every industry, there is a gap between the English language skills required at work and the English skills that employees have.</p> <p>Moreso, an analysis of speech error on[ English for occupational purposes (EOP) at the International Islamic university Malaysia (IIUM), (2014) examine that, workers  make wrong use of grammatical words frequently e.g. wrong use of nouns, use of uncountable nouns, nouns use as verbs, wrong use of preposition in phrase, wrong addition of preposition,  wrong  use of verbs, wrong use of phrasal verbs, wrong of adjective ending in — ed and — ing and redundant expression.   It was concluded that preposition was the most frequent type of grammatical error made by the learners. In addition, intra lingua transfer was found to be the most prominent source of error. It has also be found in a study conducted by Nita Falizee Selamant on EOP students (2014) that, the difficulty in communication among workers is actually the low English proficiency and the most difficult communication task is public speaking. Word Applied Science Journal (2015) indicates that Lagos employers have considerable reservations when it comes to graduates’ employability skill, particularly their flawed English Language competence. Given the challenges faced by scarcity of work in Lagos to match employers’ requirements.</p> <p>Therefore there is need for a deeper understanding of how language in the changing workplace is related to the operations of companies in Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>13        PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study   is to investigate the special  language proficiency level of Lagos State workers. Specifically, the study is designed to:</p> <p>1.         Identify the level of English proficiency of Lagos Workers.</p> <p>2.         Determine the particular language problems workers are experiencing  in Lagos State.</p> <p>3.         Determine the nature of language skills a worker needs order to perform well in the workplace.</p> <p>4.         Determine which workers from a particular workplace are most in need of training in a particular language skill.</p> <p>5.         Determine if an existing ESP course designed adequately addresses the language needs of a potential worker.</p> <p><strong>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>This study aims at the following research questions;</p> <p>1.         What is the level of English proficiency of  a worker in relation to the work tasks assigned to him?.</p> <p>2.         What are the particular language problems workers are experiencing in Lagos State?</p> <p>3.         What are the nature of language skills a worker needs in order to perform well in the work place?</p> <p>4.         What type of ESP training course design adequately addresses the language needs of a potential worker?</p> <p>5.         Which workers from a particular workplace are most in need of training in a particular language skill?</p> <p><strong>1.5       RESEARCH HYPOTHESES:</strong></p> <p>1.         The level of English proficiency of a worker does not have significant effect on task assigned to him.</p> <p>2.         The existing ESP course design does not significantly address the language need of potential workers.</p> <p>3.         Workers do not have a significant need of training in a particular language skill.</p> <p><strong>1.6       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The importance of language in our workplaces can never be over emphasized knowing that English language is a  must for workplace communication especially in Lagos State that is populated largely by people of diverse ethnic groups.   However,  interpersonal communication skill is the key to every successful business venture and the ability of a worker to speak  fluently is advantageous towards the development and progression   of the work.</p> <p>This study will be useful to the following:</p> <p><strong>Workers:</strong> It will benefit workers who need to improve on their language skills both and outside the workplace knowing that English is essential for work and survival society. It will improve work efficiency and enhances worker’s self-esteem and ns instrumentally and intrinsically motivated to learn more there will be no more hesitation in complaining of any observation, or giving instructions to junior workers, taking part in decision making etc. also instructional manuals will be easily interpreted since an operator can comprehend the instruction. Hence, mistakes are avoided and stress is reduced.  </p> <p>Moreso, the learner will meet EOP needs like reading and writing work related faxes and emails using information sources, communicating with foreigners about work1writing work related reports using tactful language with people especially customers, and understanding basic principles in work correspondences. Moreover, since English has become a necessary tool for job employment, EOP learners stand the opportunity to obtain a lucrative job, get promoted and perform  effectively in the working world.</p> <p>Curriculist: as suggested by many studies in the literature of this study, Dudley-Evans and St John (1998 60) assert that analysis of workers’ special language needs is a crucial step towards designing the curriculum, since it determines all course components. Also, it will help them to plan and improve Nigerian education by conducting the educational  which the skills and competency gaps of EOP learners in Nigeria educational sector before drawing recommendation on how will be resolved. As such, the outcome workers’ needs which serve as the basis for evaluation strategies.etc.</p> <p>Moreso, it will equip the curriculist with the knowledge of guidelines to be followed in  planning programmes for EOP learners such as;</p> <p>• Knowledge on the part of employees, on the communicative function of EOP’</p> <p>• Understanding on behalf of employees of the expectations of those who need English in order to carry out a job.</p> <p>Knowledge, on the part of the employees, the theory and practice of EO.</p> <p>Moreover, sensitizes the curriculist that one of the most important characteristics of EOP is material writing and communicative competence which could intrinsically interesting since they focus mainly on course design approach idea and course objectives. Perhaps, subscribe to the idea that an effective syllabus must attempt to overcome the deficiencies of the workers’ commutative competence under which they are operating (Brian 1998).</p> <p><strong>The Teacher/EOP Tutors</strong></p> <p>Dudley Evans and St. John (199895) state that the teaching process of any kind of language for occupational purposes should take as a starting point the analysis of the four traditional skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing) within an appropriate context, that being, as far as possible, the conditions in the workplace. The study will help the LOP tutors or teachers to take cognizance of the above assertion. Nevertheless, sensitizes them that the most important argument regarding selective learning is that adults need to obtain information they can apply outside the academic world. It will help them in the selection of authentic materials, contents and activities relevant to the LOP learners. The Study will also create job opportunities, investment opportunities and natural education growth to the EOP teachers by the government/foreigners (tourists or experts) e.g.</p> <p>Chinese, Arabians, Indians, Portugese etc. when seeking their services in nation building.</p> <p><strong>The Researcher</strong></p> <p>The study will aid the researcher to the understanding of the basic phenomenon on the second language needs of workers in the workplace. It will give the researcher the knowledge on how to best address the world’s problem. Also Researchers had data in which they can base their discussions for policy making.</p> <p><strong>The Stakeholders</strong></p> <p>The Study will provide an insight to parents and guardians on the type of language skills their ward need when face with language related problems in workplace. Finally, it will be of benefit to all the stakeholders such as policy makers, managers of businesses, government, education educators etc. on their perception of EOP programmes for improvement and development of workforce in the larger society. Therefore, to cope with the advanced worlcl4one must increase his/her level of English proficiency.</p> <p><strong>1.7       THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</strong></p> <p>This study will look at the following theories:</p> <p>1. Theories of motivation</p> <p>2. Theory of communicative competence</p> <p>THEORIES OF MOTIVATION</p> <p>Psychologists have studied human motivation extensively and have derived a variety of theories about what motivates people. This section briefly highlights the motivational theories that are regularly discussed in language Learning.. These include theories that focus on motivation being a function of (1) employed5needs of various types, (2) extrinsic factors, and (3) intrinsic factors. Each set of theories will be discussed below.</p> <p><strong>Needs-Based Theories of Motivation</strong></p> <p>Maslow’s Hierarchy of Need—Maslow (1954) postulated a hierarchy of needs that progress from the lowest, subsistence- level needs to the highest level of self-awareness and actualization once each level has been met. The theory explains how an individual will be motivated and strive to progress to satisfy’ the next higher level of need. The five levels in Maslow’s hierarchy are .</p> <p>·        physiological needs—including food, water, sexual drive, and other subsistence- related needs</p> <p>·        Safety needs—including shelter, a safe home safe work environment, employment, a healthy and safe worker environment. access to health care, money, and other basic necessities.</p> <p>·        Belonging needs – including the desire for social contact and interaction, friendship, affection and various types of support.</p> <p>·        , Esteem needs—including status, recognition, and positive regard; and,</p> <p>·        .Self-actualization needs—including the desire for achievement, Personal growth, development, and autonomy.</p> <p>The movement from one level to the next was termed satisfaction progression by Maslow, and it was assumed that over time individuals were motivated to continually progresses upward through these levels. ‘While useful from a theoretical perspective, most individuals do not view their needs in this way, making this approach to motivation a bit unrealistic.</p> <p>Alderfer’s ERG Theory—the three components identified by Alderfer (1972) drew upon</p> <p>Maslow’s theory, but also suggested that workers were motivated to move forward and</p> <p>backward through the levels in terms of motivators. He reduced Maslow’s levels from</p> <p>Five to the following three:</p> <p>·        Existence—which related to Maslow’s first two needs, thus combining the physiological and safety needs into one level;</p> <p>·        Relatedness—which addressed the belonging needs; and,</p> <p>·        .Growth—which pertains to the last two needs, thereby combining esteem and self- actualization.</p> <p>Alderfer also added his frustration-regression principle, which postulated that individuals would move in and out of the various levels, depending upon the extent to which their needs were being met. This approach is deemed by students of management to be more logical and similar to many individuals’ world views.</p> <p>Herzberg’s Two Factor Theory—Herzberg (2003) further modified Maslow’s needs theory and consolidated down to two areas of needs that motivate employees. These were termed; .</p> <p>·        Hygiene’s—these were characterized as lower level motivators and included, for example, “company policy and administration, Supervision, interpersonal relationships, working conditions, salary, status, and security.</p> <p>·        Motivators—these emphasized higher level factors and focused on aspects of work, such as achievement, recognition for achievement ,the work itself, responsibility and growth or advancement”</p> <p>Herzberg’s is an easily understood approach that suggests that individuals have desires beyond the Hygiene’s and that motivators are very important to them.</p> <p>McClelland’s acquired Needs Theory— the idea here is that needs are acquired throughout life. That is, needs are not innate, but are learned or developed as a result of one’s life experiences (McClelland, 1985).This theory focuses on three types of needs:</p> <p>·        Need for achievement— which emphasizes the desires for success, for mastering tasks, and for attaining goals;</p> <p>·        </p>                                                         \n\nAN INVESTIGATION OF SPECIAL LANGUAGE NEEDS ANALYSIS OF WORKPLACES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN INVESTIGATION OF SPECIAL LANGUAGE NEEDS ANALYSIS OF WORKPLACES", "id": 191}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>This study examined lesson time, lesson duration, school climate and class size as predictors of students’ Mastery of English studies in Lagos State Secondary Schools. This study adopted a Descriptive Survey Design. The population of this study comprised all the public secondary school teachers in Education District II, Lagos State. A simple random sampling technique was adopted for this study. Two English teachers were randomly selected from ten(10) public secondary schools. A total of twenty (20) English teachers were selected. The instrument for data collection was a researcher made questionnaire. The data collected were analysed using the frequency counts and percentages for the demographic data and research questions while question 1 was analyzed using the multiple-regression at 0.05 level of significance. The findings  shows  that classroom variables  of lesson time, lesson duration and school climate contribute significantly to the  Mastery  of English  Studies and that  there is  a significant relationship between teachers qualification  and  Mastery of English  Studies among  others. Based on the findings of this study, the following recommendationwere suggested: English lessons should be fixed in the morning hours on the time table. This will facilitate teaching and learning as the mind is still fresh and not yet stressed up as a result of the days activities. The lesson duration should not be too long else, the students will be discouraged and it should not be short so that the curriculum content will be covered among others.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>The complex nature of language makes its proper teaching and learning a tasking exercise, requiring time and dedication on the parts of the teacher and the learner. In Nigeria, English language plays a dominant role not only in the field of education but also in other spheres of the Nigerian society such as the economic, social, political, and religious. According to Jowitt (2000) English language began to play a significant role in the Nigerian society in the nineteenth century when white men began coming into Nigeria in increasing numbers. The establishment of British rule in 1900 brought with it fresh influx of white officials to fill the new Government posts. The colonialists promoted the use of the language as the official language and language of education. In this regard, Ike (2001:17-18) notes that:</p> <p>The ascendency of English language in Nigeria was the brain-child of the education ordinance of 1882 which formally made English language a compulsory subject in all Nigerian schools as well as the main channel of instruction and a vehicle for the training of the much needed manpower to run the fledging government service. The Education ordinance of 1882 was followed in quick succession by those of 1896, 1918 and 1926 all ingeniously aimed to promote the new language for general internal use.</p> <p>Schooling has multiple purposes, in the long run, higher levels of schooling are associated with higher earnings and economic mobility, better health, lower mortality rates, and greater democratic participation. For these reasons, most societies require children to attend school for a specified number of years or until they reach a certain age. Many of the benefits of schooling occur in part because students learn some new knowledge or skills that enhance their ability to communicate, solve problems, and make decisions. Much of the debate over schooling is essentially about how to maximize the amount of students learning, typically as measured by various assessment instruments such as standardized achievement tests. From a societal viewpoint, since resources most notably, time are required for learning, and are scarce, the amount of learning needs to be maximized at least cost.</p> <p>Learning is complex, involving cognitive processes that are not completely understood. Typically, school system have established a primary mode of learning that involves groups of students of about the same age interacting with a single individual leading activities  in a confined physical space, directed towards learning a particular topic in other words, students are placed in classes. The number of other students in the class can vary. At the extreme, there can be one or more adults facilitating learning with one or two students. At the other, a student may be one of a few hundred being taught by a single instructor (or, with new internet technology, one of millions).</p> <p>The number of students in a class has a potential to affect how much is learned in a number of different ways. For examples, it could affect how students interact with each other; the level of social engagement. This may result, for example, in more or less noise and disruptive behavior, which in turn affect the kinds of activities the teacher is able to promote. It could affect how much time the teacher is able to focus on individual students and their specific needs rather than on the group as a whole. Since it is easier to focus on one individual in a smaller group, the smaller the class size, the more likely individual attention can be given, in theory at least. The class size could also affect the teacher’s allocation of time and, hence, effectiveness, in other ways, too for example, how much materials can be covered. Teachers may choose different methods of teaching and assessment when they have smaller classes. For examples, they may assign more writing, or provide more feedback on students’ written work, or use open-ended assessments, or encourage more discussion. Exposure to a particular learning environment may affect learning over the time period of exposure, or it may have longer term or delayed effects (e.g by increasing self-esteem or cognitive development that has lasting effects).</p> <p>For these reasons, changes to the class size are considered a potential means of changing how much students learn. Not only is class size potentially one of the key variables in the production of learning or knowledge, it is one of the simplest variables for policy makers to manipulate. However, the amount of student learning is dependent on many different factors. Some are related to the classroom and school environment in which the class takes place, but others are related to the student’s own background and motivation and broader community influences.</p> <p>An individual simply cannot advance in any given area of study without committing a certain amount of time to grasping new content, practicing and honing skills and then harnessing knowledge and skills to realize specific aims. Think of the chess master who plays match after match to improve his game or the scientist who toils long hours in her laboratory to unlock the mysteries of an intricate phenomenon. For them, becoming more adept in their chosen field results,  in no small part, from the time they invest.</p> <p>The great irony is that nation’s public school system has, by its rigid adherence to the conventional calendar of 18s six and a half hour days for roughly 100 years, essentially disregarded the fundamental connection between time and learning. Considered that while the expectation for how schools prepare the next generation of Nigerian workers and citizens have risen dramatically, education and policy leaders have usually not updated policies and demands. The school calendar looks much the same as it did a century ago. The complexity of the world and the base level of knowledge and skills needed to thrive in the 21st century have only grown. Having more time in school to meet these ever intensifying demands would seem all the more pressing.</p> <p>This background therefore necessitates the study of the correlation between lesson time, lesson duration, school climate and class size on mastery of English studies.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>Over the years, results released by the West African Examination Council (WAEC) have shown an alarming rate of failure in the Senior Secondary School Examination (SSCE), particularly in the English Language, amongst several other subjects.</p> <p>English is a second language (L2) as well as the official language in the Anglophone West African Countries. As an international Language, English serves as a language of commerce and international relations. Thus, a high level of proficiency in the use of the English Language is highly desirable for success in an era of globalization. Given the consistently low level of performance in the subject, it seems that the traditional method of teaching and learning of the subject is no longer effective in handling the challenges. The problem is that our public school system has by its rigid adherence to the conventional calendar disregarded the fundamental connection between time and learning, education and policy makers have usually not updated policies and practices around learning time to meet the mounting demands. The school calendar looks much the same as it did a century ago; the classroom  are over populated, making it difficult for the teachers to manage and this leads to students misbehavior, less engagement in lessons, and consequent poor performance in their academic work.</p> <p>It is based on this backdrop, that this work embarked on a study of lesson time, lesson duration, school climate and class size as predictors of mastery of English Studies in Lagos State Secondary Schools</p> <p><strong>1.3 Purpose of study</strong></p> <p>The major objective of this study is to examine the influence of lesson time, lesson duration, school climate and class size on mastery of English Studies.</p> <p>Other specific objectives of the study are to:</p> <p>1.    examine the correlations between lesson time, lesson duration, school climate and class size on mastery of English studies</p> <p>2.   determine the relationship between teachers’ qualification and mastery of English studies</p> <p>3.   asses the relationship between the use of instructional materials and mastery of English Studies</p> <p>4.   relationship between teaching methods and mastery of English Studies</p> <p><strong>1.4 Research questions</strong></p> <p>The following questions were constructed in the study:</p> <p>1.   What is the correlation between lesson time, lesson duration, school climate and class size on mastery of English Studies?</p> <p>2.   Is there any relationship between teachers’ qualification and mastery of English Studies?</p> <p>3.   What is the relationship between the use of instructional materials and mastery of English Studies?</p> <p>4.   Is there any relationship between class interaction and mastery of English Studies?</p> <p><strong>1.5 Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>This study will be of immense benefit to the following stakeholders in the Nigerian Education such as students, teachers, school administrators, policy makers and the society.</p> <p>Students will benefit from this study as it will sensitize the teachers on the appropriate teaching methods to use in facilitating the mastery of English Studies.</p> <p>Teachers will benefits because, the study will motivate the various authorities who are concerned with the provision of instructional facilities to make adequate provision for teaching and learning and this will increase teachers productivity as they make use of the relevant materials in enhancing learning.</p> <p>School administrators will also benefit as this study will sensitizes them on the various aspects of the school climate for academic excellence in the various schools.</p> <p>Policy makers will benefits, hence the study will provide an insight on the areas that require policy changes and adjustments as this will benefits the educational institutions by enhancing the quality of education.</p> <p>The society will benefits because when students’ performance is improved upon, the school graduates will join in building the nation in all ramification of development.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Scope of the study</strong></p> <p>This study will cover all the junior secondary schools in Education District II, Lagos state on:</p> <p>Ø  The correlation between lesson time, lesson duration, school climate and class size on mastery of English Studies.</p> <p>Ø  Teachers’ qualification and mastery of English Studies.</p> <p>Ø  Use of instructional materials and students mastery of English Studies</p> <p>Ø  Teaching methods and mastery of English Studies</p>                                                          \n\nLESSON TIME, LESSON DURATION, SCHOOL CLIMATE AND CLASS SIZE AS PREDICTORS OF STUDENTS’ MASTERY OF ENGLISH STUDIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " LESSON TIME, LESSON DURATION, SCHOOL CLIMATE AND CLASS SIZE AS PREDICTORS OF STUDENTS’ MASTERY OF ENGLISH STUDIES", "id": 192}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The study attempted to investigate the patterns of interaction in English language JSS2 classroom in Mainland Local Government Area of Lagos State, Nigeria. The study equally reviewed some important and extensive literatures under sub-headings. The descriptive research survey design was applied in the assessment of respondents’ opinions towards the subject matter.In this study, two null hypotheses were formulated and tested with the application of the Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient Statistical tool at 0.05 level of significant. Also, the simple percentage frequency counts were used to analyze the questionnaire responses of the selected respondents together with the research questions for teachers and students respectively. A total of 100 (one hundred) respondents, 50 (fifty) male and 50 (fifty) female teachers were selected for this study. At the end of the data analyses, the following results were obtained thus: There is a significant relationship between the patterns of interaction and students’ performance in English language JSS 2 classroom and there is a significant relationship between classroom interaction and barriers to students’ learning in the English language classroom. Based on the conclusions reached at the end of this study, the following recommendations are made by the researcher: Teachers should not discriminate against their students in the school. They should ensure that all their students are loved and preferred. This will help all the students in different ways in the school. Rather, teachers, irrespective of their gender, should ensure that they do not give preferential treatment to their students so as to avoid being biased against those students they dislike and giving undue advantage to their favourites in the school. Treating students equally by teachers will enhance interactions between the teachers and their students.</p> <p><strong><em>Keywords: Patterns, Effectiveness, Interaction, Classroom Teaching and Learning</em></strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Interactions in language classrooms are important social activities for students through which they not only construct knowledge, but also build confidence and identity as competent language users. Learners learn through talking, in other words through verbal interaction. Classroom is the major medium through which teachers teach and students demonstrate what they have learned.</p> <p>In an in-depth ethnic study of teacher-student interaction, it was found out that students develop multiple identities through their classroom interaction with their language teachers. The study took place in an ESL classroom where native English language teachers are available. Luke and Lin (2007:188) present a telling story about how students negotiate identity and cultural resources, which are \"translated into non-institutionally sanctioned language practices and identities\" Perhaps, the social knowledge students bring into the classrooms might be those \"non-institutional language practices\", which schools and teachers are supposed to build on in order to enhance their learning.</p> <p>The pattern of classroom interaction employed largely depends on the teacher’s own teaching philosophy and training. Some teachers stress the grammar-translation method and teach English through the students' native language. Others use a more communicative method in which grammar constructions are not overly explained. Community language learning is another strategy for language teaching. Here, the teacher avoids lecturing and allows students to correct and learn from each other.</p> <p>Some teachers advocate \"the silent way,\" strategy where the teacher says as little as possible and the students are encouraged to discover the language on their own. However, most teachers do not strictly stick to one teaching method or strategy, but rather combine different aspects of several strategies to create effective classroom interaction. Student needs input from a source who knows the target language, and that is why the silent way is not a very effective teaching method. Students will not learn to produce a language without input and exposure, and both vocabulary and grammar are important tools for language learners (Adams, 2003).</p> <p>Interaction in the classroom entails the conversation between teacher and students, as well as among the students, in which active participation and learning of the students becomes vital. This also accommodates conversations as part of the socio-cultural activities through which students construct knowledge collaboratively. Conversations between and among various parties in the classroom have been referred to as educational talk (Mercer and Dawes, 2008) or presentational talk. Presentational talk is the one-way lecture conducted by the teachers in the classroom, which contributes little to encouraging and engaging students in a communicative dialogue.</p> <p>Exploratory talk is a purposeful conversation, often deliberately designed by teachers, which provide opportunities to students to engage in hesitant, broken, and full conversations enabling them to try out new ideas, to hear how they sound, to see what others make of them, to arrange information and ideas into different patterns. When students engage in interactions, they produce symmetric dialogue context where everyone can participate, get respected and get the decisions made jointly.   Students' participation in interaction, therefore, helps them enrich their linguistic resources and build the confidence to communicate with others in English (Adeleke, 2004).</p> <p>Interaction in the classrooms' is emerging as one of the leading conventions to enhance the students' linguistic resources as well as equipping them with appropriate skills for communication. On the other hand, pattern is a kind of arrangement, design or outline whereby teacher and student interact within the classroom context. In the classroom, teachers and students are seen as members of the contexts in which spoken language are taught. Patterns of classroom interaction in the English language are one of the bases of learning in any society and its importance cannot be overemphasized.</p> <p>According to Nwosu (2001), it is learnt that the knowledge and skills that allow individuals to continue to participate in these activities through our relationships with more experienced or trained people.</p> <p>Through repeatedparticipation with various forms of assistance such as coaching, scaffolding, modeling and catching, individuals internalize what they learn from our social interaction and transform it into our own version of knowledge and abilities. In other words, a knowledgeable participant provides support with which the learner or beginner can participate in social interaction, thereby extending the learner current skills and knowledge to a higher level of competence (Barnes, 2000). Classroom interaction as a classroom activity and practice, enhances the development of the two important language skills which are speaking and listening among the teacher and learners. This helps the learner to be competent enough to think critically and share their views among their peers.</p> <p>Learning is not considered as the internal assimilation of structural component of language systems, rather it is a process of changing patterns of participation in specific social practices within communities of practices. In this respect, the classroom is considered a very important social setting. In this setting language is acquired by learners during activities that are created through the face-to-face verbal interaction between teachers and students and among students.</p> <p>It may be true that the content and processes of language learning are fundamentally related to the instructional practices created in the classroom and that the learning is initiated and facilitated by teachers most of the time. However, it would be better to assert that both teachers and students establish the norms and expectations for realization of their roles and relationships as teachers and learners. In the classroom, teachers and students are seen as members of the contexts in which spoken language has social and educational junction. In the language patterns of classroom communication systems, the role of language extends beyond communication of mere information to the establishment and maintenance of relationships in the classroom (Allports, 2002).</p> <p>In the past, the traditional approach of teaching was solely adopted by most of the teachers; where the learners used to be dependent only on the lecture delivered by the teacher. They were not exposed to enough practice of speaking on their own and hence the interaction among the students in the classroom was almost absent. But as the education system changed with time so has the teaching methods. Through classroom interaction, the learners will be able to get themselves involved with concepts, ideas and various other devices and products for language and culture learning (Jung, 2000).</p> <p>The roles of the teacher during these sessions are passive yet very crucial. It is the responsibility of the teacher to create a learning atmosphere inside the classroom. It is through interactive sessions that the teacher can extract response from learners and motivate them to come out with new ideas related to the topic. Learners' learn through talking, in other words, through verbal interaction. In addition to teacher talk, which has been considered to account for most of classroom discourse, the importance of student talk in the target language also has been increasingly recognized in language as a second learning.</p> <p>According to Jung (2000), through talk, learners learn both the structural components of a language and its communicative application and also share in the co-construction of knowledge. The teacher's role is crucial since teachers integrateevery element under their rule to create or facilitate an appropriate learning environment in the classroom. Teachers can foster classroom conditions that encourage or restrict successful student participation. The teacher is the one who should be aware of differences among learners in order to diagnose needs, apply the proper level of learning support at any given time, and withdraw it at the right time. It can be found that the significance of the teacher's role reflected on his/her utterances with the students.</p> <p>This study is set to investigate the patterns of interaction in the classroom as a second language among senior secondary school students in Lagos State, Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem:</strong></p> <p>Interaction plays the primary and important function in a classroom which is to integrate teachers and students together to achieve the goals and objectives of the classroom interaction as essential for working in secondary schools (Alamezie, 2004).</p> <p>Interaction between teachers and students serves to support secondary school students as they go into higher institutions of education for further learning. Thus, teachers and students must interact effectively for students to realize their potentials. Teachers must explain the required work students must complete in order to succeed and improve the students’ interaction in classroom and beyond. It has also been noticed that teachers do not interact with one another about students and also do not discuss how students learn in other subjects, this shows that interaction has not been effective in schools (Adeoye, 2002).</p> <p>For this reason of poor or non-interaction amongst teachers and their students, the resultant effect is poor academic performance in the English language in the schools. Lack of interactive classroom in the English language among teachers and their students, has created a distance between the teachers and the students, and subsequently lowered the academic standards in the school.  This study intends to assess the patterns of interaction in teaching and learning of English as a second language in the classroom among senior secondary school students in Lagos State, Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Purpose of the study:</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of this study is to ascertain the patterns of interaction in the English language classroom as a second language among secondary school students in Lagos, State, Nigeria.

What are the strengths and weaknesses of interaction patterns in the English language JSS 2 classroom?</p> <p>5. What are the objectives of the patterns of interaction in the English language JSS 2 classroom be determined?</p> <p><strong>1.5 Research Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>1. There is no significant relationship between the patterns of interaction and students’ performance in English language JSS 2 classroom.</p> <p>2. There is no significant relationship between classroom interaction and barriers to students’ learning in the English language classroom.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Significance of the Study:</strong></p> <p>The findings of this study will be beneficial to the followings: students, teachers, parents, school authority and the society etc.</p> <p>Students will benefit from the findings and recommendations of this sudy in terms of having a better insight on the essence and important roles of effective interaction in English language classroom among senior secondary school students. The study will also assist the students to be able to see the need for them to engage themselves in effective and result-oriented interactions so as to maximize the benefits therefrom.</p> <p> The study will also assist students to form the habits of intense interaction with one another in order to be proficient in English language both in school and at home. This study would also help to enhance interaction in the classroom setting which would establish an open discussion and assist on the value of each student contribution. The findings would also help the classroom setting to adapt to a changing word of effective interaction.</p> <p>Teachers in the English language will benefit from this study as it will enable them to know or have deep insight on the importance of interaction to efficiency in English language at the secondary school level in Nigeria.</p> <p>Parents will equally benefit from the study as the finding of the study will enable students’ parents to be in the know concerning interactions in the English language classroom in secondary schools in Lagos State, Nigeria.</p> <p>The School Authority will also have an insight on the benefit of interactive pattern in the English language and its positive effect on students’ spoken English, their academic performance and general attitudes of students in the society.</p> <p>The members of the society such as stakeholders and the significant others in the society would derive some benefits from the study as it will give them some good knowledge of the importance of interactions among teachers and their students in the school and the society. </p> <p>Generally, the successful completion of this study, it is hoped that it would help to enhance interaction in the educational system which would establish an open school climate which allows for lively discussion and insists on the value of each person’s contribution. It is also hoped that education policy makers like Ministry of Education, Teacher Service Commission of Lagos State (TESCOM), teachers and students would benefit immensely from it.</p> <p><strong>1.7 Scope of the Study:</strong></p> <p>The scope of this research is to analyze the patterns of interaction in an ESL classroom in selected schools in Mainland Local Government Area of Lagos State, Education District IV. The research also will cover the research design which is basically descriptive research design in which questions will be used as instruments. Only the senior secondary schools will be involved in the study.</p> <p><strong>1.8 Operational Definitions of Terms:</strong></p> <p>The following operational terms were defined in the study:</p> <p><strong>Patterns of Interaction-</strong> This means the way and manner classroom interactions are carried out among teachers and students in the classroom at the senior secondary school level in Nigerian schools.</p> <p><strong>Interaction:  </strong>Interaction is a kind of action that occurs as two or more objects <strong>have </strong>an effect upon one another. It comes from Latin word \"Inter\", meaning \"between\" and \"Ago\" meaning to do or to act-any \"action between\" is considered an interaction, like the interaction between a teacher and a student. This is also, a kind of action that occurs as a result of group or individual discussion on a particular subject(s) and or object(s) having an effect upon one another.</p> <p><strong>ESL</strong>- This means English as a Second Language.

Widmayer &amp; Alayne (2007) defined Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI) as an interactive instructional procedure whereby a computer is utilized to exhibit the instructional material and monitor the learning that takes place. With CAI the students receive feedback from the computer and maintain some degree of control (Oyenuga, 2008). Some of the computer assisted instruction methods include simulation, animation, drill and practice. The CAI instruction when used in combination with drill provides instruction in such a way that each drills lesson has a series of frame or branches. How? One aspect of student learning that is potentially linked to student performance in any course is the issue of students’ access to drills solutions. No prior study has addressed this issue. Yet, this is an important research question as the decision to release or withhold drills solutions has a wide range of implications for students and instructors (Preciado, 2009). Drills allow for learning in a close, comfortable environment with the same tutor over time. In a study by Schmeck, (2008) it was found that smaller class sizes at school significantly raised final grades. This idea has been extended to the drill system at the secondary school level. Small groups are successful in providing a safe space to ask the questions that one is unable to ask during crowded classroom. Drill also offer the personal attention one may require for learning to take place. In recent times, the practice of teaching students in small groups at schools has emanated from the ancient practice of philosopher-tutors (Steward  &amp;  Aiken, 2009). The educational principle of these philosopher-tutors was to recognize the individual   differences of students and focus on developing an individual student’s thinking process (Steward et al., 2009). In the 20th century, this form of tutoring has been adopted for the common form of schooling with some modification. Perhaps due to economies of scale, students are taught in small groups rather than individually. Steward et al. (2009) summarized the benefits of tutoring as a form of education. These include the personal attention given to students, providing continuous feedback on student progress, mentoring students on learning how to learn, and using students’ academic strengths to overcome weaknesses. Research suggests that tutoring results in positive outcomes in terms of measures of academic achievement, measures of self-esteem, and intrinsic interest in the subject (Strong &amp; Smith, 2011). In the current twin pedagogical structure of teaching followed by drills; drills play a pivotal role in reinforcing and extending the knowledge disseminated to students via teaching. Typically, students attend classes for a first exposure to the course materials and drills provide a platform for consolidating student learning through more interactive discussion and problem-solving activities.</p> <p>Teaching, especially in large classrooms, is typically a one-way communication from the teacher to the students. In contrast, drills provide the appropriate forum for a two-way communication between the instructor and students. As drills permit interactive discussion on course topics via drills questions and problem-solving activities, drills play a key role in consolidating students’ course-specific knowledge.</p> <p>Further, in English teaching courses where student assessment comprises mainly closed-book examinations during and at the end of the term, questions on the examination may largely follow the format of drills questions. In such an environment, students would be keen to access drills solutions.</p> <p>However, there are arguments both for and against releasing drills solutions. Drill provides generally new information to the students in much the same manner as a human teacher or tutor might.      </p> <p>According to Tella (2007) drills are based on the principles of programmed learning or instruction. Drill involves a sequence of tasks, exercises, or words repeated over and over until they can be performed faultlessly. Drills, drill and practice are interactive and help students remember the concepts they have been taught previously (Widmayer and Alayne, 2007). English Language learning strategies, such as the drilling technique will be able to help the limited learners in writing. At least by doing the drill and practice it will enable the students to write essays given by the teachers because they are familiar with the formats especially in terms of descriptive essays. This type of essays is one of the easiest topics to do by the learners because they will describe the person, place or things with the adjectives they have learned to be used in their descriptive essays. It has become essential for learners at all schooling levels to write and understand their written texts or what they have written.</p> <p>Actually most teachers have implemented this technique without realizing it they are using this technique in their teaching and learning process. According to Blasingame &amp; Bushman (2007), Yenice (2013), Slesnick (2008) as cited in Wilder &amp; Mongillo (2007): Basically without realizing it, most of the language teachers are using this drilling technique or this strategy to help their low proficiency students in passing their English papers. They have used this technique in years of teaching the students but did not know the specific terms to describe it.</p> <p>Usually the English language teachers would use this technique in teaching writing because in most of the time and throughout the years the low proficiency students had to be drilled to make sure that they would be able to write a few sentences during their examinations. As Heward points out, drill and practice can be conducted in ways that render it pointless and a waste of time. Research has shown, however, that when properly conducted, drill and practice is a consistently effective teaching method. For example, a recent meta-analysis of 85 academic intervention studies with students with learning disabilities found that regardless of the practical or theoretical  orientation of the study, the largest effect sizes were obtained by interventions that included systematic drill, repetition, practice, and review (Blasingame &amp; Bushman, 2007). Drills when used in combination with practice provides instruction in such a way that each drills lesson has a series of frame or branches. In addition, the use of drills and practice for instruction brings with it several benefits as a teaching/learning medium. These include self-paced learning, self-directed learning, the exercising of various senses and the ability to represent content in a variety of media. In a study, Momoh-olle (2009) found that male generally outperformed girls in retention test in English while Ngwoke (2008) found a similar result in Linguistic. Students’ interest, achievement and retention in any learning activity are sustained by the active involvement of the learner in all aspects of the learning process. Ogwo and Oranu, (2007) and Ngwoke (2008) emphasized that unless the teacher stimulates students’ interest in learning, students’ achievement will be minimal. Hence, it is essential that English teachers use teaching method which ensures students’ active involvement in learning and provide suitable learning environment to improve achievement and stimulate interest of students in English.</p> <p> Drills is defined as a form of specialized learning with qualified coaching, the use of micro-computers for learning drills. Or with any other explanation that the drills is learning guidance in the form of referrals, assistance, guidance, and motivation for students to learn efficiently and   effectively.  Providing assistance means helping students to learn the subject matter.</p> <p> According to Rusman (2011) learning drills are a way of learning to train students on the lesson material that has been given. Drills will be implanted through certain habits in the form of exercise. With continuous practice, it will be embedded and then it will become a habit. In addition, in order to inculcate the habit, these drills can also increase the speed, accuracy, completeness of doing things and can also be used as a way to repeat the training material that has been presented; it can also increase the speed.</p> <p> As an instructional strategy, drill &amp; practice is familiar to all educators. It \"promotes the acquisition of knowledge or skill through repetitive practice.\" It refers to small tasks such as the memorization of spelling or vocabulary words. Drill-and-practice, like memorization, involves repetition of specific skills, such as addition and subtraction, or spelling. To be meaningful to learners, the skills built through drill-and-practice should become the building blocks for more meaningful learning.</p> <p><strong> Statement of the Problem:   </strong></p> <p>Learning outcome of every student majorly depends on the type of teaching methods, teaching strategies, and instructional techniques or approaches employed by the teacher during instruction.  Traditional teaching methods such as lecture, demonstration and field trip adopted for teaching English Language in Junior secondary school by teachers are often referred to as conventional teaching method termed to be teacher centered instead of students centered. This method teaching technical subjects discouraged creativity and disallowed students from thinking beyond what is presented to them by their teachers. The students are reduced to passive learners and as a result become apathetic and repulsive to learning.   Lack of application of effective methodology  for teaching technical subjects as   major reason for    low   academic achievements of students in   junior secondary schools.  Traditional method of  teaching   do not adequately equip teachers with contemporary views of students’ intelligences and their vast learning capabilities. Hence, this traditional teaching methods used by these teachers may be responsible for the low academic achievement in English language.  Therefore, to find solution to these problems, there is need to determine the effect Computer drill and practice alternative teaching method on the academic performance of students in English Language in junior secondary school.</p> <p> <strong>Purpose of the Study </strong>:</p> <p> The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of drill and practice on the academic performance of students in English language in junior secondary school in Lagos State. Specifically, the study will seek  to:</p> <p>1. Determine the achievement scores of students taught English Language with drill and practice those taught using conventional teaching methods.</p> <p>2. Determine the interest of students taught English Language with drill and practice those taught using conventional teaching methods.</p> <p>3. Compare the achievement scores of boys and girls taught English Language using drill and practice.</p> <p>4. Compare the interest scores of boys and girls taught English Language using drill and practice.</p> <p><strong>Research Questions:  </strong></p> <p>The following research questions was formulated to guide this study:</p> <p>1. What is the difference in the  mean achievement scores of students taught with  drill and practice compared with  those taught using the conventional teaching methods?</p> <p>2. What are the mean interest scores of students taught English language with drill and practice those taught using the conventional teaching methods?</p> <p>3. What is the difference in  the achievement scores of male student compared with female student when taught with drill and practice?</p> <p>4. What are the mean scores of male and female taught English language using Computer Drills and practice the test for retention of learning?</p> <p><strong>Research Hypotheses :</strong></p> <p>The following null hypotheses was tested in the course of the study.</p> <p>HO1:  There is  no significant difference between the mean achievement scores of students taught  with  drill and  practice and compared with those taught using conventional teaching methods.</p> <p>HO2: There is  no significant interaction effect of treatments given to students by gender with respect to their mean scores in the English language achievement test.</p> <p> HO3: There is  no significant interaction effect of treatments given to students by gender with respect to their mean scores in English language interest inventory items. </p> <p> HO4: There is no significant difference between the mean achievements scores of boys and girls taught English Language using Computer drill and practice.</p> <p><strong>Significance of the Study</strong> :</p> <p>The benefits that occur from this study are many, specifically,</p> <p><strong>STUDENTS</strong>:  The findings of this study if found to have positive effect and implemented will also be of benefit to students’ participation and interest in the class room activities. There will be improvement in students’ achievements and interest through the use of drill and practice, command to achieve active engagement, frequent interaction, immediate feedback from work done and connection to real world of work. This in turn will enable students to pass their JSCE examinations in English Language.</p> <p><strong>TEACHERS</strong>:  Teachers will benefit from the result of this study in that they will use the standardized instrument to evaluate the students, rather than the teacher-made test. English Language teachers’ work will become easier and interesting as they will be playing supervisory roles whereby student centered interactive instruction will be used to secure and sustain the attention of the students in learning English Language. The knowledge of drill and practice if found effective will help the teachers to improve their instructional delivery to bridge the gap in achievement, interest of boys and girls in English Language.</p> <p><strong>MINISTRY OF EDUCATION</strong>:  Ministry of Education will benefit from the findings of this study. Effectiveness of drill and practice, will no doubt influence the decision of the Ministry of Education on the need to provide computers and laboratories in junior and senior secondary schools if found to have positive effect. Furthermore, findings will also sensitize the Ministry to organize conferences, workshops and seminars to train English Language teachers on the use of drill and practice to improve their instructional delivery.</p> <p><strong>CURRICULUM DEVELOPERS</strong>: The result will be of immense benefit to the English Language curriculum developers because they will find it valuable especially in the provision of empirical evidence on the effectiveness of drill and practice in the teaching of English Language.</p> <p><strong>Definition of Terms</strong>:</p> <p>Drill:  is a classroom technique used to practise new language. It involves the teacher modelling a word or a sentence and the learners repeating it.</p> <p>Practice: is the act of rehearsing a behaviour over and over, or engaging in an activity again and again, for the purpose of improving or mastering it.</p> <p> Teaching Methods: It refers to the general principle, pedagogy and management strategies used for classroom instruction.</p> <p>Conventional Method: is concerned with the teacher being the controller of the learning environment. Power and responsibility are held by the teacher and they play the role of instructor (in the form of lectures) and decision maker (in regards to curriculum content and specific outcomes).</p>                                                            \n\nEFFECTS OF DRILL AND PRACTICE ON THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF STUDENTS IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN JUNIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF DRILL AND PRACTICE ON THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF STUDENTS IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN JUNIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL", "id": 194}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>According to spelling experts, it is very important that the learners of a secondary language should be equipped with the basic words as to be able to communicate effectively in that language. So, in as much as the learners should efficient in the spoken aspects, it is crucial and necessary that the words should be spelt correctly.</p> <p>This is were good spelling habit comes in.</p> <p>To spell means to name correctly in order, the letter that make up a word. However, to many students there are difficulties being encountered in this essential academic activity spelling. This is the focus of this research work. It has been established that really; students commit spelling errors for various reasons ranging from their own carelessness to inappropriate teaching methodology and environmental factors.</p> <p>In Nigeria, teachers should make students understand necessity of good spelling habits. Curriculum designers should designate appropriate time for spelling programme.</p> <p>This research work has therefore looked into the crucial issue of spelling errors. Through the teachers’ answers to the questions and the students’ performance in the test administered, it has been established that the problem of spelling errors actually exist among Nigerian secondary school students.</p> <p>This, no doubt, affects their performance and so, possible remedies have been suggested in this study.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>To spell means, to name in order, the letters of a word for instance T-W-O = two spelling is an academic activity. It is a skill which marks the learners with such scholarly qualities as intelligence, cultivated, neat, efficient and conscientious.</p> <p>In any human society, the need for a common language  cannot be over-emphasized. No society can exist comfortably together if the members of such society cannot communicate effectively among themselves.</p> <p>In Nigeria, English language is the lingua – franca (the official language) The language of Government, businesses, education, law, politics religion, mass media and international communication.</p> <p>This is the inevitable situation because Nigerian is a multilingual society with many different ethic groups such as Yoruba  Edo, Igbo, Tiv,  Hausa, and so on. Since it is only in English language that all these groups can communicate, we can realize the indispensable role which English plays in Nigeria.</p> <p> PURPOSE OF STUDY </p> <p>The purpose of the study is to look into the problem of spelling errors among Nigerian secondary school students and its effects on their general performance in English language. This researcher will also give practical suggestions on what the learners themselves, teachers and curriculum experts could do to raise the standard of English language in Nigeria. This can be achieved by adhering to the suggestions (to be given) on how to inculate correct spelling habits in the students.</p> <p> STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </p> <p>This researcher is concerned with spelling errors among Nigeria secondary school students which no doubt affect their general performance in English language.</p> <p>Normally, whenever there is any problems the first thing to do is to try to identify the cause of such a problem and then seek possible remedies to it because “a problem, once identified, is almost solved”.</p> <p>Many factors are responsible for spelling errors among Nigerian secondary school students which make it difficult for them to resolve independently spelling problems. These factors are as follows:</p> <p>i.            Complex nature and illogicality of the English language for example – different sounds or tones are given to the same letter or combination as in:- Head/hed/j Bread/bred/.</p> <p>ii.          Some words of English language are not spelt as pronounced because in English language, there is no sound to letter correspondence. One factor responsible for this is that English words contain prefixes mostly derived from prepositions  in French, latin   and Greek. Thus the poor Nigerian secondary school students who did not study either latin or Greek find themselves in difficult situations.</p> <p> RESEARCH QUESTION </p> <p>There are certain problematic questions which revolve around the issue of errors in spelling on which these researcher work is based. These are:-</p> <p>(a)         Is spelling necessary in the teaching and learning of English language?</p> <p>(b)        What is responsible for poor spelling among Nigerian secondary school student?</p> <p>(c)         Can poor speller make good grades in their examinations, assignments or tests?</p> <p>(d)        What method can be adopted in the teaching and learning of spelling in Nigerian secondary school?</p> <p>(e)         What activities, exercise and teaching aids are useful in achieving success in teaching spelling to student?</p> <p>(f)          Can spelling errors among students be eradicated?</p> <p>(g)         What possible remedies can be establish to spelling errors?</p> <p>Whatever useful answers given for the above questions will no doubt pin – point the root of spelling errors among Nigeria secondary school students.</p> <p> LIMITATION OF SCOPE </p> <p>This research work is based on three selected secondary schools in the Somolu management committee of Lagos State these schools are Angns Memorial Senior High School, Igbobi College, Mainland Senior High School.</p> <p>Altogether one hundred and fifty form five students in these three schools are used at the sample for this research.</p> <p> SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>Really, it is a personal experience and concern that motivated me to research into the problem of spelling errors among Nigerian secondary school students, I was a secondary school student myself and participated in teaching practice. Judging from the importance of correct spelling and other related issues (like effects of errors in spelling on students’ general performance) there is therefore the justification and necessity to look into the problems which student encounter in spelling English words correctly.</p> <p>The possible remedies which this study will high light will shed light on ways and means of tackling the problem of spelling errors among Nigerian secondary school students.</p> <p>Therefore, the findings of this report will provide useful information to students, teachers, and curriculum planners as well as the whole community since the society is part and parcel of the curriculum process.</p> <p>To curriculum designers, this report will be a guide on how to plan and effective spelling programme for our secondary school as well as providing a frame work for .</p> <p>1)          Examining and describing the spelling performance of Nigerian secondary school students.</p> <p>2)          Discussing the role of readiness and spelling assessing the case of poor students.</p> <p>3)          Presenting a detailed assessment of the role of spelling rules in an effective spelling programme.</p> <p>4)          Assessing the importance of good methodology in teaching of spelling in Nigerian secondary school.</p> <p>The findings of this report will be generally useful to everybody since spelling errors is not a problem of students alone but has a vicious cycle- secondary schools, higher institutions, community and if such a problem is rampant in any educational system the parent get concerned and then lay blames on the teachers and curriculum   planners.

The study employed a descriptive survey research design. An instrument titled:  Teachers and students’ use of school and class libraries for developing reading culture in senior secondary schools (TSUSCLDRCSS) was used to collect relevant data for the study. The ten (10) secondary school involved were selected based on stratified sampling technique method and the statistical tools employed to analyse the data collected were percentages while the inferential statistics of chi-square(x2) was used to test the stated hypotheses at 0.05 level of significance. 200 sample sizes were used for the study. Four (4) research questions and four (4) research hypotheses were designed and formulated for the purpose of the study. The study revealed that there was a significant influence of school library in promoting reading culture among SSS teachers and students. It also revealed that there was a significant difference between the availability of books and the school library. The study also revealed that there was a significant influence of school library materials on SSS students and teachers. The study further revealed that there was significant difference between factors militating against the SSS teachers and students in developing reading culture in Lagos State. Based on the findings of this study, recommendations and suggestions were made for students, parents, lecturers and university administrators and relevant agencies for further research.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The concept of school libraries has become a subject of renewed interest for researchers and educationists alike both nationally and internationally (Walker, 2005). Researchers have indicated some definitive concepts with respect to the use of school libraries. The library provides physical or digital access to material, and may be a physical building or room, or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include books, periodicals, newspaper, manuscript, films, maps, prints, documents, microform, CDs, videotapes, DVDs, Blu-rays Discs, e-books, databases and other formats. Libraries range in size from a few shelves of books to several million items. In the 21st Century, the role of the School Library is imperative to the teaching and learning program of a school. The main goal of the library is to encourage the development of lifelong learning in our students, by promoting a reading culture and developing sound research skills(Akinbode, 2005).</p> <p>All over the world libraries are dedicated to providing free and equitable access to information for all, be it in written, electronic or audiovisual form. They play a key role in creating literate environments and promoting literacy by offering relevant and attractive reading material for all ages and all literacy levels and by offering students, teachers and family literacy classes. They embrace the social responsibility to offer services that bridge social, political and economic barriers, and traditionally make a special effort to extend their services to marginalized people. Libraries assist in finding, using and interpreting appropriate information that opens up opportunities for lifelong learning, literacy enhancement, informed citizenship, recreation, creative imagination, individual research, critical thinking, and ultimately, empowerment in an increasingly complex world (Amucheazu, 2006).</p> <p>Reading is an activity which helps to develop the mind and personality of human beings and ultimately enriches their intellectual lives. As students learn to enjoy reading; learning becomes relevant and in that way improves their reading culture and self concept. Reading helps readers have mastery of their lives, and situations in life.  Examples of how people in the books managed their situations give students knowledge of how to cope with similar situations. According to Elaturoti (2011), students can only achieve their potentials in life if they have developed interest in the use of their school or class library. This is because reading helps an individual to achieve greater control, increased independence and a greater sense of self worth and belonging (Meribe, 2005).</p> <p>Apart from provision of reading materials, school libraries provide reading programmes that motivate students to read for pleasure.  Reading culture are reading activities school or class libraries provide to create awareness of the collection and motivate students to read for pleasure and academic achievement. They are reading experiences provided in the school or class library to encourage students’ use of the collection and inculcate voluntary reading cultures in students.  The reading programme include display, exhibition, access to reading materials, lending of books, storytelling, debate, book talks (Carbo and Cole, 2005). Engaging students in variety of reading experiences through book talks, readers’ theatre, and storytelling will help students develop habit of listening, comprehension and recall.  Students’ participation in debate and book club will challenge them to read widely and seek information in the library. Asiabaka (2008), maintained that school facilities management play a pivotal role in the actualization of educational goals and objectives by satisfying the physical and emotional needs of the staff and students. School records are an important means of accountability because they provide proof.</p> <p>Library seeks to promote a reading culture in the students, teachers and the Community. Reading for enjoyment is encouraged through the library’s extensive fiction collection, which includes graphic novels and a range of general interest magazines. Library also plays a vital role in supporting the teaching and learning program of the School. Access to a wide range of relevant resources and equipment is available from the Library, via the catalogue.  The Library team collaborates with classroom teachers to develop information literacy skills, making use of the excellent facilities provided in the Library Learning Space and appropriate online databases.  Lack of interest in reading among students is one of the causes of low education quality in Nigeria. In fact, reading is a source of knowledge. Teachers should not only focus in teaching in classrooms, but in motivating students to improve their knowledge (Bassey, 2006). Although the main purpose of a library is a source of knowledge, it is more often used as place to store books. Students still prefer to choose other activities than reading books in a school or class library.</p> <p>The issue of poor reading culture in the Nigerian society cannot be overemphasized. Because reading makes great people and great nations, the researchers were moved to carry out this study to see how far the use of school library programs can go in promoting the dilapidating reading culture which is getting worse. Providing equity of access to reading resources, engaging authors’ visits, and supporting books fairs, exhibition and displays are means to building lifelong readers.  Specifically reading culture promotion is one of the cardinal roles of school library (Dike, 2008).  Four out of the nine contributions expected of the school libraries in Nigeria are on reading development.  According to the Minimum Standard; libraries promote the development of reading skills and encourage long term learning habits through reading, listening to and viewing a variety of learning materials.  Reading culture form the key to continuous success in school as well as personal enrichment of the teachers/students. Libraries also provide opportunities for further reading and use of materials other than prescribed classroom textbooks. Stimulate research and independent study by providing a wide variety of materials so that it does not only supply information in printed form, but also in pictures, films, tapes etc.  This makes learning more exciting. It provide materials for recreation and encourage teachers/students to read for pleasure.  Free voluntary reading also helps students in the acquisition of other language skills, success in their academic, improved reading ability, vocabulary knowledge, emotional stability, enjoyment of leisure hours, and increased knowledge of political, economical and social issues in his environment. (Sandars, 2007). The study is therefore going to look into the teachers and students use of school libraries for developing reading culture in secondary school.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Most secondary schools in Nigeria are facing non-availability of properly established libraries and proper literacy programmes (Ajumobi, 2004).  Even those that may have library facilities, these are either poorly stocked or have outdated books which may not inspire students to read. Lack of school libraries or poorly established libraries have a negative impact on literacy levels of students. The non-availability of library resources in most case often force students to read only what they are taught by teachers during class. (Tella, Ayeni and Popoola, 2007). Many factors are responsible for the decline in students’ use of school libraries and reading culture in our society. Some of these factors include unfamiliarity with reading on the part of many students, inadequate development of reading skills amongst students, lack of continuity with reading programmes on the part of the teachers, and language interference, amongst others. The distraction by the fallout from technological innovation in the world today, such as the easy availability of the entertainment media, games and gambling, the inadequate funding of educational institutions including funding of libraries and e-library units.</p> <p>Also, through the introduction of information and communication technologies, students are seen carrying their phones and texting messages, listening to music, yahoo yahoo, etc. They neither study nor read and thus are getting deformed. Their command of English language is poor, so also is their vocabulary and diction. All these are because they do not read anymore (Akinbola, 2007).</p> <p>The teachers should provide assignments that require students to use library resources so as to spread the culture of reading beyond the library walls; the teachers as well as school administrators must understand the need for a culture of reading in schools to support the recreational reading lives of students and to develop the reading habit in our students, preparing them for future academic success and lifelong literacy and learning. It is a concern that many students do not choose to read, and teachers need to work to build and maintain a strong culture of reading in schools so that students do not just learn to read at school, but choose to read in their free time as well. This study intends to look into teachers and students’ use of school and class libraries for developing reading culture in senior secondary schools. </p> <p> <strong>1.3 Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study intends to look into teachers and students’ use of school and class libraries for developing reading culture in senior secondary schools.</p> <p>Therefore, the study specifically intends:</p> <p>1.      To look into the use of school library in promoting reading culture among the SSS teachers and students.</p> <p>2.      To examine the availability of books in the school library.</p> <p>3.      To examine the relevance of school library materials to SSS students and teachers.</p> <p>4.      To find out factors militating against the SSS teachers and students in developing reading culture in Lagos State</p> <p><strong>1.4 Research Questions</strong></p> <p>2        How do teachers and students use school library in promoting their reading culture?</p> <p>2.      To what extent are books available in school library?</p> <p>3.      To what extent is the relevance of school library materials to SSS students and teachers?</p> <p>4.      What are the factors militating against the SSS students and teachers in developing reading culture in Lagos State?</p> <p><strong>2.5</strong><strong>Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p><strong>HO</strong>:1. There is no significant influence of school library in promoting reading culture among SSS teachers and students.</p> <p><strong>HO</strong>:2.  There is no significant difference between the availability of books and the school library.</p> <p><strong>HO</strong>:3.

Ultimately, this study will bring out the benefits that students and teachers obtain from the provision of a school library so that future projects of building schools should include libraries.</p> <p>It is also hoped that the research will, in this regard, further help contribute to improving literacy programmes and library services in schools to help achieve the 2nd millennium development goal as reading culture promotes an informed citizenry that is able to influence development by making informed decisions in matters of governance.</p> <p>Lastly, it is hoped that the research will open up new avenues for further research to be conducted.</p> <p><strong>1.7 Limitation of Study</strong></p> <p>The study will be constrained by time, finance and mobility. The study will cover only four senior secondary schools in Mainland local Government Area of Lagos State. The study will covers the school library in promoting reading culture, availability of books and the school library, school library materials and factors militating against the SSS teachers and students in developing reading culture.</p> <p><strong>1.8 Operational definition of terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Reading</strong> - is an activity which helps to develop the mind and personality of human beings and ultimately enriches their intellectual lives</p> <p><strong>Reading Culture</strong> - a way of life where reading is regarded as highly appreciated and valued by members of a given community, in this case the school community.</p> <p><strong>School Librarian</strong> - a professionally qualified librarian employed to operate a library within a school.</p> <p><strong>Class Library</strong>: a collection of sources of information and similar resources, made accessible to a defined classroom for reference or borrowing.</p> <p><strong>School Library:</strong> is an information on services, which provide physical or digital access to materials, and may be a physical building, or a virtual space, or both.</p> <p><strong>Developing Reading Culture: </strong>is a sustained regime of reading textual and non-textual materials for the purpose of broadening the horizon of knowledge within and outside one’s disciplinary interest.</p>                                                            \n\nTEACHERS’ AND STUDENTS USE OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES FOR DEVELOPING READING CULTURE IN SENIOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " TEACHERS’ AND STUDENTS USE OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES FOR DEVELOPING READING CULTURE IN SENIOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS", "id": 196}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong><em>Abstract</em></strong></p> <p><em>This study investigated the effectiveness of Nigerian Pidgin English in Nigerian senior secondary school in Lagos state.

It is a second language because Nigerians already had their first language or Mother Tongue (L1) before the incursion of this foreign language called ‘English’ into the country. In this instance a foreign language (English) left its native environment and met with another language or languages (Nigerian indigenous languages). It is true that the culture and values of the people are embedded in the language they speak. As such it is said that ‘language is culture’ and none can be separated from each other.</p> <p>Language is a very important factor in the educational process. It is an indispensable aspect of communication. Ithas very strong basics for creative thought and without it there would be no meaningful progress in civilization and culture, Makinde (1997:7). The above citation explores the powers of language as a tool for communication and creative thought. Language is used to communicate ideas through the process of thinking, translated to either speech or writing.</p> <p>Therefore the language of wider communication of a country is crucial to the progress and growth of that nation, even academically. Nigeria is a diverse and multi-ethnic country with about four hundred and ten (410) languages Mackey (1992:12). However, with the introduction of the English language in 1842, these numerous languages have influenced, or if we might say, interfered in the way Nigerians use language on the lexical, grammatical and phonological levels of communication. Though English is Nigeria's lingua franca, a unique brand of English has emerged to suit Nigeria’s socio-linguistic and communication needs (which is to an extent a deviation from standard British English). This has led to a localization or domestication. Since English has been influenced by our indigenous languages, the way we write will also reflect this metamorphosis. These variations we referred to as “peculiar Nigerianisms”.</p> <p>English language did not come to Nigeria just on its own. Its incursion into Nigeria was caused by lots of factors like trading, slavery, colonization and missionary activities in Nigerian by the Europeans and this was done in phases. As such English as a language is a borrowed blanket which has been converted to a personal use by the borrowers so as to suit their purposes.</p> <p>The exact date that English language usage started in Nigeria is not certain. However, it is believed that the first intimate contact between the British and some ethnic groupings in Nigeria was in Southern Nigeria. This must have been at some period before the Atlantic slave trade.</p> <p>The term pidgin is used to refer to a language which develops in a situation where speakers of different languages have a need to communicate but do not share a common language. Once a pidgin has emerged, it is generally learned as a second language and used for communication among people who speak differently.</p> <p>Language is the most creative and unlimited instrument for social communication and it helps us to understand the deep seated social relevance, culture involvement and the human relatedness of language. Having said this, we can therefore agree that pidgin is a language of its own and not just a supplementary tongue as some people see it, since it serves as an unlimited instrument of social communication especially in a multilingual community as Lagos State.</p> <p>According to R. Linton he states that “the culture of a society is the way of life of its members, the collection of ideas and habits which they learn, share and transmit from generation to generation” (12). These cultures, ideas and habits can only be transmitted from generation to generation through language. In linguistic, every language is considered adequate to represent the communicative needs of its people and as such should not be made to suffer any biases.</p> <p>This cannot be said of Nigerian Pidgin – even though it is a language – because various attempts have been made by different faction to eradicate the use of Nigerian Pidgin English. These attempts have however been unsuccessful because of the significant value the language has to its users. It is a language that has brought people together in spite of their differences in ancestral culture and language by creating a local culture for itself which blends ideas from different cultures.</p> <p>According to Adetugbo [1984:8], a certain Oba in Benin was reported to have spoken Portuguese. The language was in use for economic interest and because it was the language of commerce and diplomacy in the ancient Benin kingdom. Actually, the advent of English in Nigerian can be classified into three major periods, namely: the period before the missionary activities, the period during missionary activities and the period after the amalgamation of the southern and northern protectorate. It is important to add that there is no clear cut demarcation between these periods as each period shades into another period.</p> <p>The structure of Pidgin is quite different from that of Standard English in its Phonology, Morphology and Syntax. Nigeria is fast colonizing the West African region with Pidgin English. Pidgin English as spoken in Nigeria is a kind of language derived from English, Portuguese and Dutch. Pidgin English as spoken in Nigeria is interesting with very unique pronunciations. Words in Standard English could turn out to mean or denote something else in Pidgin.</p> <p>As Platt, Weber and Ho accurately observe in their book, The New Englishes, (RKP 1984) \"In some nations...the New Englishes have developed a noticeable range of different varieties linked strongly to the socio-economic and educational backgrounds of their speakers.\" It borrows words, patterns and images freely from the mother-tongue and finds expression in a very limited English vocabulary.</p> <p>Critics on the poor performance of English language at the West African School Certification Examination have always commented that Pidgin English has not only affected students in their subjects area but also hampered their chances in other disciplines. It is the mind of the researcher to investigate and verify the above claim and possibly ascertain the extent of the negative effect of Pidgin English among students in Senior Secondary School in Nigeria The researcher in this work is out to investigate the influence of Pidgin English on the use of Standard English among senior secondary school students and suggest the possible means of eliminating the adverse effects Stern (1983:152),</p> <p>It is on records that as from 1553 English men paid frequent visits to the Nigerian shores, especially the ports of Ancient Benin and old Calabar, and the type of communication which evolved between the English men and the Nigerians was a simplified kind of communication in English called Pidgin. Note, however that Portuguese and not English was probably the earliest European language to be used in Nigeria.</p> <p>The global spread of the English language is one of the most far-reaching linguistic phenomena of our time. Evidence of this worldwide phenomenon of language contact, variation and change can be seen through such designations as world Englishes, new Englishes, modern Englishes, West African Englishes, South African English, Australian English, Indian English, to mention just a few. The phrase “Nigerian English” has also appeared in the last four decades or so. Out of the Nigerian variety of English some sub-varieties have emerged like the Nigerian Pidgin English.</p> <p>1.1 <strong>Brief History of Nigerian Pidgin English</strong></p> <p>The Portuguese were the first Europeans who traded in pepper and slaves from the Nigerian coastal area. They first arrived in Benin (city) at the end of the 15th century. From the mid 16th century, the British took over as major trading partners. With the abolition of the slave trade at the beginning of the 19th Century, British colonial interests shifted to agricultural production for exportation to Europe. In 1842 and 1846 the first missionary stations were established in Badagry (near Lagos in the Southwest) and Calabar (in the Southeast) respectively. The missionaries were mainly interested in spreading Christianity among the African pagans. In the schools they established in the Southern part of Nigeria (they were not allowed to settle in the Islamic North of the country) they also taught agriculture, crafts and hygiene. In order to easily reach the population, the language of instruction was usually the mother tongue of the natives. But the Africans refused to send their children to school because they needed them to work in the house and on the farms. Consequently, the missionaries paid compensation to the parents. All the same, the first generation of students was made up mainly of children of slaves who the village communities thought they would not miss much. The mass withdrawal of English colonial officers just before and after Nigeria’s independence down turn in the Nigeria economy and the disappearance of the middle class with the attendant breakdown in social and family values.</p> <p>The British colonial government increasingly felt the need for Africans who were literate in English and would serve British colonial and trade interests (for instance as teachers, interpreters and clerks for local native courts and the trading companies). Therefore, missionary stations were ordered in the 1880s to teach English in their schools. In the long run, however, the missionary schools were unable to meet the demands for educated Nigerians, and the colonial government began to establish state schools from the turn of the century. The first state school was in fact founded as a result of pressure from Muslims in Lagos in 1899 who had no access to missionary schools and felt they were at a disadvantage. Despite all these efforts, communication was indeed difficult between the Nigerians and the colonial masters thus a means of easy communication had to be devised which was a simplified way of structuring and speaking English. The simplification could be seen in all the levels of a new contact language that emerged (Pidgin). The emergence of churches and the use of pidgin English to evangelise people.</p> <p><strong>1.1.1 CHARACTERISTICS OF NIGERIAN PIDGIN</strong></p> <p>The new contact language is a simplified language in the areas of Lexis, Phonology and Grammar</p> <p><strong>1.1.11 NIGERIAN PIDGIN LEXIS</strong></p> <p>Pidgin draws its lexical items from the dominant language namely English, while others are drawn from the indigenous languages. For examples,</p> <p>a)      Yoruba: oyibo – ‘white man’,</p> <p>wahala - trouble</p> <p>b)      Portuguese: pikin – ‘child’</p> <p>palava – ‘trouble’</p> <p>sabi – ‘to know’</p> <p>c)      Hausa: wayo – ‘tricks’</p> <p>Secondly, there is extensive use of reduplication in its lexis. This is partly to identify meaning and partly to avoid confusion which could result from phonological similarity. Examples: katakata (confusion, chaos), wakawaka (walk or wander perpetually), toktok (talk, gossip).</p> <p>In addition, Pidgin lexis is filled with Compound Words like <strong>‘</strong>kresman’ – (crazy man), ‘switmaut’ – (flattery), ‘wochnait’ – (night watchman).</p> <p><strong>1.1.111 THE GROWTH OF NIGERIAN PIDGIN</strong></p> <p>The growth of Nigerian Pidgin from a rudimentary speech form which was strongly aided by gesture to an elaborate form is examined in some details by Elugbe and Omamor (1991). At first, it was used between the visiting English and their Nigerian hosts. Later, the Nigerians, who had no common language of their own, began to use this form among themselves. This had the effect of stabilising and expanding the language because it then had to cope with the expanding experiences of its Nigerian users.</p> <p>The continued use of the English in Nigeria made the number and interest of its speakers to continue to expand, and this encourages the growth of Nigerian Pidgin. The continual growth and use of Pidgin English challenges was a challenge and threat to the existence of English and this brought about the emergence of Standard English. This development was a logical consequence of two factors.</p> <p>In the first place, the English recognised that they could not do business in a language in that they could keep records, which they considered inferior and was unintelligible to English speakers newly arrived from Britain. Nigerian pidgin was thus relegated to situations involving only Nigerians, or the English and those Nigerians who could not speak or understand the standard variety of English.</p> <p>Secondly, schools were established and a standard variety of English was being taught. This variety became the language of trade and industry, missionary work and government. So important did this variety become that its possession became a passport to a good position in society, with its social and material benefits.</p> <p>The growth of English in Nigeria did not remove the usefulness of Nigerian Pidgin. Not everyone had access to a school and the process of acquiring English was decidedly longer and more tedious than that of ‘picking up’ Nigerian Pidgin. It remains a hallmark of Nigerian pidgin that its speakers use it with a lot of freedom and creativity.</p> <p>In the days of the colonial government, the missionaries were very influential and they used that influence to ensure that activities leading to the development of Nigerian languages were not banned. Adopting a mother-tongue approach to evangelism, they believed that the gospel was best delivered to potential converts in the language they understood best. Thus, they doubled as missionaries and linguists, studying the local languages, committing them to writing and attempting to translate the Bible, or parts of it, into these languages. There were also colonial administrators who doubled as civil servants and linguists. Thus, the colonial government had to grant some recognition to the ‘vernaculars’- as the indigenous languages were called.</p> <p>The recognition of the local languages did not extend to Nigerian pidgin. Even those who helped to sustain it by speaking it refused to recognised it, a situation that exists even today. One meets highly placed government officials who speak Nigerian Pidgin but do not believe it should be allocated a role in the language policy in Nigeria. It is therefore obvious that Nigeria Pidgin has survived and flourished by generally being readily useful and handy, thus filling a veritable communication vacuum in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.1.1V THE BENEFITS OF NIGERIAN PIDGIN</strong></p> <p>Nigeria Pidgin has major benefits which are not exploited in language planning in Nigeria. Since the search for unity is a primary concern of government, one would have thought that Nigerian pidgin would be brought into the planning process. It is a major asset, for example, it shares with English the unique feature of being the only ethnically neutral language in Nigeria.</p> <p>Another of its assets is that it is a national language. As Elugbe (1990: 10) has pointed out, a language may be national by being spoken all over Nigeria, by being indigenous and by being declared ‘national’. Nigerian Pidgin is national because it meets two of these requirements:</p> <p>1)                          It is geographically spread all over Nigeria and spoken by Nigerians of different ethnic origins.</p> <p>2)                          It is indigenous to Nigeria because it originated, is sustained and is expanding here in Nigeria.</p> <p>It should be added that Standard English meets only the condition of being spoken all over Nigeria. In fact, only Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba, which are the major indigenous languages, meet all three criteria in the definition of ‘national’ in Nigeria.</p> <p>In education, Nigeria has a mother-tongue policy which requires that every child be taught in a mother-tongue medium at the pre-primary level and during the first three years of primary school. The policy also states that, where the mother tongue should be used as the language of the immediate community (LIC), that is, the dominant language of the community which the child already speaks is recommended. There are areas in Nigeria where Nigerian Pidgin has acquired the mother tongue status and there are many Nigerians for whom it is as much a first language as the mother tongue (because they speak it with the same facility as they speak their different mother tongues, such that they are bilingual in their mother tongues and Nigerian Pidgin). It therefore follows that Nigerian Pidgin can be used in teaching many Nigerians where many local languages would have been required. This would remove the psychological shock which pupils experience when they leave home and find a new language which they do not speak and understand well. It is also a matter of common sense that a child (or anybody for that matter) learns better when taught in a language he understands very well. Therefore, our language policy ought logically to lead to the development of Nigerian Pidgin for use as official medium for teaching in our schools.</p> <p>Recognition and development of Nigerian pidgin would also greatly reduce the cost of implementing the language provisions of our educational policy because the LIC option is basically a cost and time saving device and because Nigerian Pidgin is a dominant language in many communities across many states. This was the thinking of the national Commission for mass literacy, adult and Non-formal Education in 1992 when it set out to produce literacy materials in Nigerian Pidgin. Unfortunately, the project has since been suspended.</p> <p>Nigerian Pidgin as a veritable tool of interaction serves as a ‘bridge’ between the mother tongue and Standard Nigerian English (NSE). According to Faraclas (nd),</p> <p><em>‘Nigerian pidgin has most of the linguistic features of (NSE) and those that typify many other Nigerian languages. Therefore, as long as Nigerian Pidgin is not accorded the place it deserves in Nigerian education, an invaluable tool for the teaching of English will continue to lie wasted and unused’.</em></p> <p>Faraclas concludes by recommending that ‘<em>official recognition should be extended to</em> <em>Nigerian Pidgin as a major Nigerian language’</em>. Such a step would make Nigerian Pidginfully national in all the three senses of the terms, as mentioned above.</p> <p>The creativity of Nigerian Pidgin which has been mentioned is probably linked to the relative ease with which it is acquired or learned. A simple comparison shows what the difference is between learning Standard English and learning Nigerian Pidgin:</p> <p><strong>Nigerian Pidgin</strong>                                <strong>English</strong></p> <p>Rait                                                   Write</p> <p>He de rait                                          He is writing</p> <p>He rait                                               He wrote</p> <p>He don rait                                        He has written</p> <p>I dey come                                        I’ll be back</p> <p>Dem                                                   Them</p> <p>Sometin/Sontin                                  Something</p> <p>Wetin happen?                                    what happened?         </p> <p>The invariable form of Nigerian Pidgin ‘<em>rait’</em> contrast sharply with the parsing of ‘write’ in English. In addition, Nigerian pidgin is made easier by the fact that its lexicon can and does take words not only from English but also from other Nigerian languages. This means that speakers resort to words in their own languages where they think that the Nigerian Pidgin form should be strengthened. Elugbe and Omamor (1991) suggest that such creativity is reflected in the ease with which songs are composed and sung in Nigerian Pidgin. One should now add that songs written or song-composed require a certain relaxed and assured ease with a language. Therefore, Nigerian Pidgin speakers are always very much at ease with it. This creativity also reflects in a popular comedy show called ‘Night of Laughter’ where the entire programme is done in Nigerian Pidgin English. The modern information technology (Mobile Phone) on seeing the ease and creativity in Nigerian Pidgin has created a soft ware in Pidgin for its teaming population of clients. To be sincere, prompt customer care information service are better and are more understandable in Nigerian Pidgin than in Standard English. People from Warri, sapele, Kwale, benin-city, Ibusa among others are famous for their excellent ability to communicate eloquently in the language. Interestingly even the country leaders, clergy men and women, Justices, Judges, professors, the educated and non-educated understand and fully communicate in Pidgin English.</p> <p>The language is fast growing and the idea once held that the language is a language of the illiterates is fast eroding and gradually getting replaced as the unique language of Nigerians as even national team footballers of the country use the language as means of communication on the playing field. At least Nigeria now has a name in Pidgin English which is “Naija’ so the next time you hear Naija mentioned know it refers to Nigeria our beloved country.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>A pidgin is a simplified language that develops as a means of communication between two or more groups that do not have a language in common, in situations such as trade. Pidgins are not the native language of any speech community, but are learnt as second languages. Pidgins usually have low prestige with respect to other languages. The word ‘pidgin’, formerly also spelled ‘<em>pigion’</em>, derives from a Chinese Pidgin English pronunciation for ‘<em>business’</em>. This was originally used to describe Chinese Pidgin English; it was later generalized to refer to any pidgin. Pidgin may also be used as the specific name for a local pidgin in places where they are spoken. For example, the name of ‘Tok Pisin’ is derived from the English words ‘talk pidgin’, and its speakers usually refer to it simply as \"Pidgin\" when speaking it.</p> <p>The use of Pidgin English in our society has assumed a wider dimension than previous periods in history. The widespread is so much that it has spilled over into classrooms in schools. According to Akporero (1989), the use of Pidgin English by student and teachers in our school has assumed alarming proportions that there is no longer any unidentifiable factor as causative. From Akporero’s assertion, only one characteristic remains prone factor- literacy. The implication here is that literacy is tending to accelerate the use of Pidgin English rather than eliminating it Akporero is of opinion that Nigerian Pidgin is a language of its own, whose formation is consequent on a multiple borrowing of different words from more than one language. This in itself goes to emphasize the convenience of its use especially by persons from different linguistic communities who have no need for a bi-lingual intermediary. Gilbert Ansré (1971) observes that “it is not quite correct to say that one language has influenced the other. By this, he implies that language itself is an abstraction from human social behavior and so one language cannot influence another except through the mediation of users of the two languages. Thus when we say one language has influenced another, we are merely inferring that the speaking of the language have incorporated items of another in their own.  The problems were created:</p> <p> Problems in students spoken and written of English language which often result to mass failure in English language secondary school examination.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is;</p> <p>i.                    To examine the impact of Nigerian pidgin on the written English of selected senior secondary school students in Lagos State.</p> <p>ii.                  To evaluate the impact of Nigerian pidgin on students performance in English language.</p> <p><strong>iii.</strong>To determine the reason why students communicate in Nigerian Pidgin.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Research Questions</strong></p> <p>i.                    Does Nigerian pidgin affect the written English of selected senior secondary school student in Lagos State?</p> <p>ii.                  How does Nigerian Pidgin affect student performance in English language?</p> <p>iii.                Is there any reason why students communicate in pidgin English?</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong><strong>Research Hypothesis</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>01</strong><strong>:     </strong>Thereis significant difference between Nigerian pidgin and written English in some selected senior secondary school student in Lagos State.</p> <p>H02:      There is significant relationship between impact of Pidgin English and student’s academic performance in English.</p> <p>H03       There is significant relationship between student’s communication with Nigerian pidgin and English language</p> <p><strong>1.6          Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>As more and more people including students speak pidgin, the need therefore arises for the examination of its influence on standard English among the secondary school students in Nigeria.

It also ascertained the teachers awareness of the benefits of extensive reading, the types of reading materials available for extensive reading for schools, the extent teacher engages student in extensive reading and the techniques/strategies teachers employ in developing extensive reading for communication competence. The study employed the use of descriptive and inferential methods. Under the descriptive method, data collected was analyzed descriptively by the use of tables which involved the use of simple percentages. While the inferential statistics of Pearson product moment correlation was adopted as the statistical tools to test and validate the stated hypothesis. The findings of the study revealed that the relationship between extensive reading and communication is positive, strong and significant. Based on the findings of the study, it was recommended that there is the need to enact a policy that encourages construction of libraries in secondary schools, provision of relevant information resources and, qualified librarians to run such libraries and parents should encourage their children and wards to read at home, and watch children educational television programmes.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Language acquisition without reading is difficult. Reading is a good way of comprehension. A good reader is able to understand sentences and structures of a written text. One important way to develop communication competence is through extensive reading. Students by reading extensively will be exposed to different new scope of vocabulary which is necessary in reading comprehension (Pazhakh and Soltani, 2010).</p> <p>People learn to read by reading, and the ability to read proficiently is best achieved through extensive reading. Likewise, there is widespread consensus that there is a correlation between communication competency and extensive reading, for which communication competency and reading comprehension can be regarded as a mutually beneficial process. This mutual benefit means that vocabulary facilitates learners’ ability to decode meaning from the context (Teng, 2015).</p> <p>Light (1997) has described communicative competence as “being able to meet the changing demands and to fulfill one's communication goals across the lifespan” .Communicative Competence should accomplish four main purposes including: expressing wants and needs, developing social closeness, exchanging information, and fulfilling social etiquette routines (Light, 1997). Communicative competence is comprised of grammatical competence, discourse competence, sociolinguistic competence, and strategic competence (Canale &amp; Swain, 1980; Canale, 1983 &amp; Savignon, 1997). Communicative competence is manifested within the national standard through the interpretive mode, interpersonal mode, and presentational mode of communication (Mart, 2012). The interpretive mode of communication is characterized by the ability to interpret and understand spoken and written language whereas the interpersonal mode of communication describes the ability to maintain conversation between two or more individuals. The presentational mode of communication is highlighted by information presented through spoken or written language. When combined, these three modes of communication represent authentic real world communicative settings (Mart, 2012).</p> <p>Reading is an indispensable tool in learning that forms an integral part of any learning situation, and the bedrock of education. Therefore, access to information is crucial to individual advancement as well as corporate educational development. Adetunji (2007) described reading as the act of translating symbols or letters into word or sentences that have meaning to an individual. It is also the understanding of what is seen in a text, which is the ability of the reader to take incoming visual information, process that information and obtain meaning from it. Information is indispensable. According to Yusuf (2007), bridges the gap between knowledge and ignorance. One of the major avenues for acquiring information is reading. Reading is the foundation upon which other academic skills are built. It offers a productive approach to improving vocabulary, word power, and language skills.</p> <p>Communicative competence has always been the goal of every language classroom wherein instructions are geared toward the components on organizational, pragmatic, systematic and psychomotor (Brown, 1994). From the communication competence perspective, it is important to address academic reading as a meaning-based activity that is purpose and comprehension-driven. Reading is motivated by the reader’s particular purpose and propelled by increasing comprehension of the texts. Further, given that language is embedded in contexts and tasks, academic reading assessment should focus on contexts and purposes and address narrow language abilities as they emerge from the local context. Whether it involves primary school children or university students, it seems clear that most comprehension is linked to a purpose, and it is thus important to examine reading within the context of that purpose. It is on this note that the study investigated the perception and extent of the use of extensive reading in promoting communication competence in secondary school.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>By and large, the importance of reading cannot be overemphasized, because no learning activity or situation can take place without reading. But one of the major problems facing Nigerian students is their inability to communicate effectively (Ajayi, 2012).</p> <p>This problem can be conceived to be linked with the absence of reading habit among students or non-challant attitude to reading to the use of the internet. Although there are many reasons why people read, but observations and researches have shown that there is a low reading habit among students in recent times, especially in developing countries, because reading is not considered as a relevant leisure activity as it does not form part of children’s social interaction and watching of television. Another major problem that leads to the absence of reading habits among students is on the advents of ICTs like the internet, cell phone, video games and other viewing gadgets.</p> <p>Umar (2009:10) is of the view that students now have viewing culture instead of reading culture because of the advents of these ICTs gadgets. Also the lack of available information resources like texts books both in the school library and at homes also could lead to lack of students forming the habits of reading. One series problem in reading comprehension is that among students are used to comprehending a passage on sentence level rather than on discourse level. This frailer causes some students to be dependent on understanding every single sentence in a text, even when this is not necessary to fulfill their reading purpose, with the result they tend to rend all texts at the same speed. In addition, the student heavily relies on dictionaries to get the meanings of some new words. It is against this background that the study examines the role of extensive reading in promoting communication competence among secondary school students in Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research work is to investigate the extent of the use of extensive reading in promoting communication competence in secondary school with reference to some secondary schools in Shomolu Local Government Area of Lagos State.The specific objectives are;</p> <p>1.      To ascertain the teachers awareness of the benefits of extensive reading.</p> <p>2.      To identify the types of reading materials available for extensive reading in schools.</p> <p>3.      To determine the extent teacher engages student in extensive reading.</p> <p>4.      To determine the techniques/strategies teachers employ in developing extensive reading for communication competence.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Research Questions</strong></p> <p><strong>1.</strong> To what extent are teachers aware of the benefits of extensive reading?</p> <p><strong>2. </strong>What are the types of reading materials available in schools for extensive reading?</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> To what extent do teachers engage students in extensive reading activities?</p> <p>4. What techniques and strategies do teachers employ to develop extensive reading skills for communication competence<strong>?</strong></p> <p><strong>1.5 Hypothesis</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>0</strong>: There is no significant relationship between extensive reading and student communication competence</p> <p><strong>1.6 </strong><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>Extensive reading is a useful strategy for students to improve their communication competence. The study provides other researchers with some reliable instruments, action procedures, and experimental findings for use in future research. To the researcher’s knowledge, there are no studies about the effect of extensive reading on communication competence in the context of Nigerian secondary schools. Most of the studies were conducted on the effect of extensive reading on reading proficiency or the effect of extensive reading on other skills separately. However, most of the related studies approve that using extensive reading is an effective tool for achieving communication competence</p> <p>Finally, the research will also help school owners to come up with better reading strategy to improve the communication competence of their students through the active role of teacher. It will also help sensitize the government in improving the syllabus as well as raising the standard of learning so as to student communication competence by making available all the necessary materials within the school setting so as to encourage extensive reading among secondary school students.</p> <p><strong>1.7 Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p> The scope of this study is to investigate the extent of the use of extensive reading in promoting communication competence in secondary school with reference to some secondary schools in Shomolu Local Government Area of Lagos State</p> <p><strong>1.8 Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Reading: </strong>Reading is a process of constructing meaning through dynamic interaction among the reader’s existing knowledge, the information suggested by the text being read, and the context of the reading situation.</p> <p><strong>Extensive Reading: </strong>Extensive reading is the teaching of reading in terms of language skills by studying reading texts intensively in order to practise reading skills such as distinguishing the main idea of a text from the detail, finding pronoun referents, or guessing the meaning of unknown words.</p> <p><strong>Communication: </strong>Communication is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules.</p> <p><strong>Communication Competence: </strong>Communication competence is seen a as “being able to meet the changing demands and to fulfill one's communication goals across the lifespan.</p> <p><strong>Grammatical Competence:</strong> Grammatical competence is the knowledge of the structure and form of a language; some of which include its morphologic, syntactic, phonemic and graphemic features.</p> <p><strong>Discourse Competence:</strong> Is the knowledge of the interrelationship between and logic across sentences and phrases is characteristic of discourse competence.

Their struggles to overcome colour barred in a developed economy “RESERVED FOR EUROPEANS ONLY”.<br/>    1.1     PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>            This study seeks to show how Peter Abrahams presents his text Tell Freedom to explain how the psychological effects of racial discrimination leads to the disillusionment and protest of the non-white South Africans against the Apartheid policy during the apartheid period. It also aims at exploring the theme of a degenerating socio economical life of the non-white during the apartheid era. He also writes the text Tell Freedom artistically, which gives it an aesthetic colouring and an unusual verisimilitude.<br/>SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>    Peter Henry Abrahams De Ras has written a lot of literatures. He wrote poems which include; ‘Here Friend’ in 1940 and ‘A Blackman Speaks of Freedom’ in 1941. He holds the distinction of being the first South African to write an English novel after Sol Plaatje’s novel Mhudi was published in 1931. Among his novels are; Dark Testament (1942), Song of the City (1945), Mine Boy (1946) Path of Thunder (1948) Wild Conquest (1950), Return to Goli(1953), Tell Freedom (1954), A Wreath for Udomo(1956), A Night of Their Own (1965), This Island Now (1966) and The View from Coyoba (1985). This study will focus on the novel, Tell Freedom, and references from anti-racism (anti-apartheid) literature (i.e. novels, poems, memoirs, essays etc.)  and how the novelist uses it to expose the ills and the effects of racial discrimination in the Apartheid South African society. <br/>1.3METHODOLOGY<br/>                 The methodology involves a critical study of the primary text to identify the problems (ills) associated with racial distinction on the non-European South Africans during the Apartheid era and their protest or struggle for freedom as projected by the novelist.  After identification, the problems (ills) are classified into one: the psychological effects of racial discrimination. While their struggles are classified as a whole: Disillusionment; protest against racial discrimination. Analysis is carried out based on the two broad classifications. Through the analysis, it is observed that a direct relationship exists between the problems the non-white South Africans accepted as a norm and their eventual protest against this discrimination based on race. This study also demonstrated that education in the novelis an eye opener and a tool the non-white South Africans used in their fight to end the Apartheid policy.<br/>                Apart from the primary text, we have employed secondary sources to support or refute our argument. We have also used the Internet for necessary and relevant information.<br/> 1.4THEORETICAL BACKGROUND<br/>       Racial discrimination and disillusionment is analysed in Tell Freedom by looking at the aftermath of deprivation, starvation, illiteracy, unequal rights, suspended universal suffrage, colour barred (For Europeans Only) amongst others and the psychological effect it had on the non-white South Africans and the gradual process to the road of disillusionment as seen in the life of the novelist and the characters he created in his autobiography Tell Freedom through the psychoanalytic theory of criticism.  <br/>       Psychoanalytic criticism adopts the methods of \"reading\" employed by Sigmund Freud and later theorists to interpret texts. It argues that literary texts, like dreams, express the secret of the unconscious desires and anxieties of the author, that a literary work is a manifestation of the author's own neuroses. One may psychoanalyze a particular character within a literary work, but it is usually assumed that all such characters are projections of the author's psyche.<br/>           One interesting facet of this approach is that it validates the importance of literature, as it is built on a literary key for the decoding. Freud himself wrote, \"The dream-thoughts which we first come across as we proceed with our analysis often strike us by the unusual form in which they are expressed; they are not clothed in the prosaic language usually employed by our thoughts, but are on the contrary represented symbolically by means of similes and metaphors, in images resembling those of poetic speech\".<br/>       Like psychoanalysis itself, this critical endeavour seeks evidence of unresolved emotions, psychological conflicts, guilt, ambivalences, and so forth within what may well be a dis unified literary work. The author's own childhood traumas, family life, sexual conflicts, fixations, and such will be traceable within the behaviour of the characters in the literary work. But psychological material will be expressed indirectly, disguised, or encoded (as in dreams) through principles such as \"symbolism\" (the repressed object represented in disguise \"condensation\" (several thoughts or persons represented in a single image), and \"displacement\" (anxiety located onto another image by means of association).<br/>           African writers have an enduring propensity for social and political commitment. Their texts mostly reflect and refract the socio-political events and the effect it had on their personalities and their societies. Initially, African literature was a tool for celebrating the heroic grandeur of the African past; later it was used for anti-colonial struggle. Presently, it is being employed as a veritable weapon for depicting the postcolonial disillusionment in African nations. Therefore, African literature is always chained to the experiences of the peoples of the continent.  It is observed that in Peter Abrahams Tell Freedom, postcolonial pains in African nations are imaginatively captured with apt narrative devices.   <br/>         Peter Abrahams in Tell Freedom is asking questions such as: what is the difference between the whites and non-white? Why was he denied quality education and everything good reserved only for the European and their children? what is wrong in living in a proper house and living a decent life in a society he belongs to by birth? is it a crime to be coloured in South Africa? why is the minority white exerting power and authority over the majority non-whites?      <br/>1.5    REVIEW OF CRITICISM<br/>           Tell Freedom by Peter Abrahams has gained wide audience. The novel which was published by Alfred A. Knopf, New York in 1954. Is a memoir of the poet / novelist, while he was still in South Africa. Literary critics acknowledge Tell Freedom as one of the first autobiographies based on life in South Africa.<br/> In The Nigerian scholar, Kolawole “Ogungbesan’sThe Writing of Peter Abrahams, he commends the writer’s style in Tell Freedom as being overly selective. An incident is selected because it has contributed to the making of the artist and is recorded in such a fashion as to make the most mundane works and issues bloom with the most far reaching output (P. 91). However, this commendation was given after the author had noted that Abrahams “fails in making (such) incidents fuse into a powerful whole”. (P. 89)<br/>Ogungbesan says also that Abraham’s characters are ‘wooden’ as in his other novels. (P.90) He says, people to Abrahams, whether fictional or non-fictional are always more important as symbols than just human beings (P.90). In truth, Abraham’s characters are wooden, perhaps this is the author’s method of symbolizing the fact in truth, and these characters never develop. They are in a perpetual state of physical, psychological and spiritual stability. They firmly belong to the past and perhaps the author does well to keep them there.<br/>       He (Ogungbesan) points to the last two pages of Tell Freedom as the only dark cloud in the story that is remarkably free from bitterness. Indeed, as the only indication of any hint of protest… He continues, “The author has chosen to show remarkable compassion throughout his work” The author’s Marxist tendencies did much to guide his political orientations as reflected in his works.<br/>       It appears that Ogungbesan shares the same opinions with Tucker who says in Africa inModern Literature that the works of Allen Paten, Nadine Gordimer and Peter Abrahams     <br/>        “Represent the spirit of forgiveness”.<br/>  Tucker goes on further to say:“That in their work, temporary political and social defeat is secondary   to men’s eternal spiritual resistance to isolation by colour”.<br/> Wade refers to Tell Freedom as a:“Dramatized autobiography”<br/>          He notes that the book operates on two levels. Like all auto biographers, he seeks to “explain, and identify” himself in relationship to his environment.  Secondly, he is spurred on to write mainly by the need to give information about shared “objective” conditions.<br/>Ogunsanwo on the other hand considers the text, Tell Freedom as:         <br/>    “A truly autobiographical protest literature and states that it is <br/>    meant to gain a sincere and practical respect for human <br/>    Dignity by arousing white conscience over black <br/>    Frustration in South Africa”. (P.38)<br/>He opines that Abrahams makes a conscious effort to broaden the normal limits of autobiography by recreating personal experiences and also portraying general prevailing conditions. He says the book is:<br/>    “Both a record of events in the author’s life and an immediate<br/>     Impressionistic evocation of representative moods and <br/>    Moments which transcends any particular place <br/>    And moment”. (38)    <br/>       However, dramatized or not, the autobiography has a special advantage in South Africa, because as Olney comments “it is more effective weapon of achieving the necessary emotional and moral effect rather than purely imaginative novel,” (P.270) this, in his opinion, is because:<br/>        “The nightmare that occurs as waking reality in the broad <br/>        Of day and in the streets of Johannesburg or Pretoria <br/>        Demands the realistic and interior first person voice of <br/>        Autobiography to achieve its fullest force”. (270) <br/>    Observations from different newspaper and online media has linked the text Tell Freedom with brilliance.<br/>  A review on Good Reads says:<br/>“Peter Abrahams - the veteran South African version (author) – writes <br/>tenderly yet powerfully. And he has been doing so for many decades,<br/>having been publishing books on his native country since the 40's!! In his books, including this one, he always comes across as a pacifist, or/and humanist.<br/>This is a man whose childhood was spent during the terrible times of discrimination among races in South Africa. This work is an early biography of his, and can move one to tears intermittently. We see from his childhood that the white man is ‘god’. As a child he learnt this only too well when in a certain episode, to please the ‘white baas’, the child receives a horrific whipping by his own guardians! This amidst other unfortunate episodes like a mishap at the (water) well, and his ill-judged juvenile attempts to steal. The author's early life is soured because of racial discrimination – but not only him; his family, his relatives...it goes on and on. Harrowingly. Ultimate despair. His love for writing however developed from a very early age, and for me, this is the most remarkable part of this work. There was virtually no encouragement for him in this wise, but he kept on writing, including penning striking poems as a kid. The powers-that-be even had to warn him against this (writing). His determination to leave the beleaguered country, to feel free, to write about \"freedom\" elsewhere (in other countries) is very commendable considering that era and its stultifying restraints. And so in the end the author takes to the sea, somewhat...That he went on to succeed as a writer - very well too, and inspiring many other African writers in the process, over the decades - might be regarded as icing on the cake. A remarkable man and writer”.<br/>            The New York Times says:<br/>“Over the decades, in his reporting and in his fiction, Mr. Abrahams<br/>addressed the promises and the perils of black rule after colonialism, <br/>the possibilities of a post racial society and questions of personal identity.<br/> Those he felt acutely as a mixed-race South African — ‘coloured’, under<br/>the country’s apartheid system — married to a white woman, and as an<br/>exile for most of his life. Above all, the spectacle of racial injustice in his <br/>homeland spurred him”.<br/>Kirkus Magazine opines that:<br/>“Tell Freedom is an autobiography of a South African poet, who rejected<br/>the horrors his country offered his people- the Coloureds - this has beauty <br/>and the marked poignancy of a hopeless struggle against overwhelming odds. For at his thirty-seven years of age Peter Abrahams looks back on a life that ran the gamut of trials-physical, emotional and intellectual to the point that he couldno longer recognize a real place for himself in Africa, even among the whites who were trying to further the causes of tolerance and freedom. His biography is conversational and grippingly sensitive in style. Beginning with early childhood, he takes us with him- into his own small poverty- stricken house in Johannesburg, into his friendship with a Zulu boy, into his first encounter with white youths who stoned him and whose father later blamed the Coloureds for the incident. With his teens came both a ray of hope and a sad romance- for when he is given the opportunity to go to a diocesan college, his girl's family moves away without leaving word. At college there is the hope of a new social order, but as it comes, in the form of Marxism, it is disillusioning to Abrahams who later feels, though he knows the communists are not the only forces at work against ‘apartheid’, that he must escape to Europe in order to write and thus do his best for his country. A book that combines the emotional appeal of a Paton story with vivid, frank actuality, and sheds important light on Africa. To those who remember his Path of Thunder and Wild Conquest (both Harper books- 1948-50), with keen delight, this will have special significance”.<br/>A review on Amazon by Winston G Allen Jr. (13 years old as at November 30, 2003) reads:<br/>“When I started reading this book I knew that I was about to dig into the truth of the everyday lives of children in South Africa. This mystery is an autobiography. I have read some materials about South Africa but this book really tells it all. The book started out with Peter living in Johannesburg …”.<br/>Winston goes further to say that he believes this book highlights the true and real childhood of South Africa's children. This book, Tell Freedom, is a Mystery that only those of the high hierarchy can solve if they will. I believe there is still much evidence of this type of hurt today in some parts of South Africa. This is also present all over the world. Somebody will have to do something to prevent poor children from such ridicule and hardship. It has been going on too long. I believe a change will be welcomed at this time. I would recommend that this book be read by all age groups. It is an excellent portrayal of life as an under privilege”.<br/>1.6    JUSTIFICATION<br/>       This study makes no attempt to idealize Peter Abrahams or his works. However, it cannot be denied that as readers, we are often hampered by our own preconceived notions. ZakesMda, the South African writer, calls them ‘abstract perceptions’. It is utterly easy to read Tell Freedom and never dig below the label of an autobiography.<br/>        In some ways, they are like the audience at an art gallery who admire the paintings from a distance, acknowledging the high quality of the frames used and the perfect blend of colours applied but not quite understanding the essence; for Tell Freedom is in essence more than just the story of racism but also encompasses the negative effects suffered by the author and the majority non-white South Africans.<br/>This study examines the nature of psychoanalytic approach in Abrahams` Tell Freedom. The review of this work as psychoanalytic novel as can be observed from the discussion so far, establishes the fact that the novel, Tell Freedom, has a lot of critics. These critics have shared their various contradictory ideas about the novel. Although these ideas seem to share to some level of similarities with this study, they are also different in some ways. While some critics believe that the novel speaks of the injustice melted down on the non-white South Africans during the Apartheid era, others believe that the memoir is a protest against racial discrimination by the oppressed non-white South Africans who decided to take their destinies in their own hands.<br/>       In essence, Tell Freedom is far more than an autobiography just as a national anthem is far more than a song. This study takes its focus on two broad headings; the psychological effects of racial discrimination and disillusionment; protest against racial discrimination as an aftermath of the enactment of the Apartheid (distinction based on race) policy.<br/>1.7        THESIS STATEMENT<br/>This study establishes that the distinctions based on race in Peter Abrahams’ text, Tell Freedom, shows how the psychological effects of racial discrimination which the non-white South Africans suffered lead to their disillusionment and protest against racial discrimination that bedevilled the South African society during the Apartheid era.<br/> 1.8BRIEF HISTORY OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION (APARTHEID) IN SOUTH AFRICA<br/>          Tell Freedom was first published in 1954, exactly eight years after the enactment of apartheid laws in South Africa. South Africa was colonized by both England and the Netherlands in the seventeenth (17th) century. English domination of the Dutch descendants (known as Boers or Afrikaners) resulted in the establishing the new colonies of the Orange Free State and Transvaal. It was the discovery of diamonds in these lands that resulted in an English invasion that sparked off the Boer war. Following independence from England, the two groups held an uneasy alliance until the 1940’s when the Afrikaner National Party (ANP) was able to gain a strong majority. Strategists in the National party invented apartheid as a means to cement their control over the economic and social system. Initially, the aim of apartheid was to maintain white domination while extending racial separation. But starting in the 60s, till the dismantling of Apartheid in the early 90s, a plan of ‘Grand Apartheid’ was executed, emphasizing territorial separation between black and whites, restriction of movement and police repression.<br/>     It was the formal enactment of apartheid laws in 1948 that formally institutionalized racial discrimination. Racial laws touched upon, amongst other things, a prohibition of marriage between non-whites and whites, the sanctioning of “white only jobs”. It also emphasized the restriction of movement within areas and required that all blacks carry ‘pass books’ containing fingerprints, photograph and information on access to non-black areas. The subsequent years up till 1994 when apartheid was formally disentranced to be replaced by a democratically elected government, marked some of the greatest landmarks in arrests, demonstrations, imprisonments and executions ever witnessed in South African history.<br/>   1.9       POLITICAL AND SOCIO ECONOMIC ALIENATION IN THE APARTHEID SETTING<br/>What was apartheid?<br/>Translated from the Afrikaans meaning 'apartness', apartheid was the ideology supported by the National Party (NP) government and was introduced in South Africa in 1948. Apartheid called for the separate development of the different racial groups in South Africa. On paper it appeared to call for equal development and freedom of cultural expression, but the way it was implemented made this impossible. Apartheid made laws forced the different racial groups to live separately and develop separately, and grossly unequally too. It tried to stop all inter-marriage and social integration between racial groups. During apartheid, to have a friendship with someone of a different race generally brought suspicion upon you, or worse. More than this, apartheid was a social system which severely disadvantaged the majority of the population, simply because they did not share the skin colour of the rulers. Many were kept just above destitution because they were 'non-white'.<br/>In basic principles, apartheid did not differ that much from the policy of segregation of the South African governments existing before the Afrikaner Nationalist Party came to power in 1948. The main difference is that apartheid made segregation part of the law. Apartheid cruelly and forcibly separated people, and had a fearsome state apparatus to punish those who disagreed. Another reason why apartheid was seen as much worse than segregation, was that apartheid was introduced in a period when other countries were moving away from racist policies. Before World War Two the Western world was not as critical of racial discrimination, and Africa was colonized in this period. The Second World War highlighted the problems of racism, making the world turn away from such policies and encouraging demands for decolonization. It was during this period that South Africa introduced the more rigid racial policy of apartheid.<br/>People often wonder why such a policy was introduced and why it had so much support. Various reasons can be given for apartheid, although they are all closely linked. The main reasons lie in ideas of racial superiority and fear. Across the world, racism is influenced by the idea that one race must be superior to another. Such ideas are found in all population groups. The other main reason for apartheid was fear, as in South Africa the white people are in the minority, and many were worried they would lose their jobs, culture and language. This is obviously not a justification for apartheid, but explains how people were thinking.<br/>Apartheid Laws:<br/>Numerous laws were passed in the creation of the apartheid state. Here are a few of the pillars on which it rested:<br/>Group Areas Act, 1950, This was the act that started physical separation between races, especially in urban areas. The act also called for the removal of some groups of people into areas set aside for their racial group.<br/>Population Registration Act, 1950; This Act demanded that people be registered according to their racial group. This meant that the Department of Home affairs would have a record of people according to whether they were white, coloured, black, Indian or Asian. People would then be treated differently according to their population group, and so this law formed the basis of apartheid. It was however not always that easy to decide what racial group a person was part of, and this caused some problems.<br/>Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act, 1959 This Act said that different racial groups had to live in different areas. Only a small percentage of South Africa was left for black people (who comprised the vast majority) to form their 'homelands'. This Act also got rid of 'black spots' inside white areas, by moving all black people out of the city. Well known removals were those in District 6, Sophiatown and Lady Selbourne. These non-white people were then placed in townships out of the town. They could not own property here, only rent it, as the land could only be white owned. This Act caused much hardship and resentment. People lost their homes, were moved off land they had owned for many years and were moved to undeveloped areas far away from their place of work. Some other important laws are the:<br/>Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, 1949<br/>Immorality Amendment Act, 1950<br/>Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951<br/>Resistance before 1960.<br/>          Resistance to apartheid came from all circles, and not only, as is often presumed, from those who suffered the negative effects of discrimination. Criticism also came from other countries, and some of these gave support to the South African freedom movements. Some of the most important organizations involved in the struggle for liberation were the African National Congress (ANC), the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC), the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) and the United Democratic Front (UDF). There were also Indian and Coloured organized resistance movements (e.g. the Natal Indian Congress (NIC), the Coloured People's Organization), white organized groups (e.g. the radical Armed Resistance Movement (ARM), and Black Sash) and church based groups (the Christian Institute). We shall consider the ANC.<br/>The ANC -  The ANC was formed in Bloemfontein in 1912, soon after the Union of South Africa. Originally it was called the South African Native National Congress (SANNC). It was started as a movement for the Black elite who were educated. In 1919 the ANC sent a deputation to London to plead for a new deal for South African blacks, but there was no change to their position.<br/>The history of resistance by the ANC goes through three phases. The first was dialogue and petition; the second direct opposition and the last the period of exiled armed struggle. In 1949, just after apartheid was introduced, the ANC started on a more militant path, with the Youth League playing a more important role. The ANC introduced their Program of Action in 1949, supporting strike action, protests and other forms of non-violent resistance. Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo and Walter Sisulu started to play an important role in the ANC in this period. In 1952 the ANC started the Defiance Campaign. This campaign called on people to purposefully break apartheid laws and offer themselves for arrest. It was hoped that the increase in prisoners would cause the system to collapse and get international support for the ANC. Black people got onto 'white buses', used 'white toilets', entered into 'white areas' and refused to use passes. Despite 8 000 people ending up in jail, the ANC caused no threat to the apartheid regime. The ANC continued along the same path during the rest of the 1950s, until in 1959 some members broke away and formed the PAC. These members wanted to follow a more violent and militant route, and felt that success could not be reached through the ANC' .<br/>          In addition, The Afrikaans word apartheid ('apartness') is much in evidence after 1948 as a central plank of South African government policy, but it is only another word for the segregation of the races already promoted by Hertzog and accepted by Smuts. The difference in the post-war years, under successive National Party prime ministers (Malan 1948-54, Strijdom 1954-58, Verwoerd 1958-66, Vorster 1966-78), is the obsessive vigour with which systems of segregation are devised and imposed.<br/>           A population register is established to fix the racial classification of every South African citizen. Marriage between whites and non-whites (and even inter-racial sexual intercourse) becomes a criminal offence. Towns and rural areas are divided into zones in which ownership of property, commercial activity and residence is limited to people of a specific racial group. Africans travel into white areas to work, but they require passes to do so. <br/>          The universities are reserved for white students, while 'apartness' is carried to extreme lengths in the educational arrangements for everyone else: Coloureds, Asians and even the major African tribal groups (Sotho, Xhosa, and Zulu) are now provided with colleges of their own. In everyday life separate facilities are introduced where previously there was no formal segregation - in buses and trains, post offices and libraries, cinemas and theatres.<br/>              The non-white population of South Africa is progressively excluded from the nation's political processes. The Coloured citizens of the Cape Province, for example, are deprived in 1956 (after a long legal battle) of their previous electoral rights. The advocates of apartheid claim that these limitations are balanced by a separate political system designed for the African majority. The promotion of Self Government Act, in 1959, arranges for the creation of ten African homelands (also known as Bantustans) which will be to some extent self-governing, though their policies remain subject to veto by the national administration in Pretoria. The Transkei, dating from 1959, is the largest and earliest of the Bantustans.<br/>           The policy of apartheid brings widespread international opprobrium. After being censured by fellow members, South Africa withdraws from the British Commonwealth in 1961 and becomes a republic. The General Assembly of the UN condemns apartheid in 1948, the first year of National Party rule, and in 1962 calls on member states to apply economic sanctions. Most African states do so, but western governments are reluctant to take this step - particularly the USA and Britain in the 1980s under Reagan and Thatcher. By 1986 public pressure in the USA is so strong that congress, overriding Reagan's presidential veto, imposes trade and financial restrictions and bans air travel to South Africa. Other western countries follow suit.<br/>            Meanwhile popular revulsion at apartheid has led to the isolation of South Africa in fields such as sport and culture. South African teams and competitors no longer feature at international events. Theatre companies and orchestras refuse to go on tour to the apartheid republic, or face censure from their fellow professionals if they do so.<br/>But the most significant opposition to apartheid is internal. It begins with non-violent protest in the tradition of Gandhi, but possibly includes in 1966 the assassination in parliament of the prime minister, Hendrik Verwoerd (stabbed by an immigrant of mixed racial descent, but of severely unbalanced mind and with no clear motive). With mounting desperation, as the white regime becomes ever more repressive, violence escalates. Spearheading the campaign are two linked organizations, the ANC and the PAC.<br/>    The deprived African is politically, economically and socially severed from the material comfort which his land offers because of the colour of his skin (RESERVED FOR EUROPEANS ONLY).  Alienation is a condition in which the individual is physically or psychologically ostracized. It is a condition of psychic fragmentation. It is not surprising in a society governed by the principle of polarity among colour lines that the black man invariable becomes a stranger in his country. <br/>    Politically, black South Africans have no right to vote. They can only exercise their franchise in their homelands which are independent states to which each African is assigned to by the Government according to the record of origin. The aim is to prevent any involvement with the South African Parliament which holds complete hegemony over the homelands. Africans living in the homelands need passports to enter South Africa; they are aliens in their own land.<br/>    Economically and Socially because of these restrictions, black South Africans are unable to make an impact in the society. Life is an endless cycle… as they seek to bear the white man’s yoke. Labour restrictions prevent them from getting the kind of jobs which would provide adequate money. Educational restrictions prevent them from going to schools and getting the knowledge which would empower the people. They were therefore alien in their environment from all that was good, progressive and from their essential consciousness, ultimately denied.        <br/>1.10         DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>RACIAL DISCRIMINATION<br/>    According to the Oxford Advance Learners Dictionary 8th edition.<br/>Racial: Of or relating to a race or a people. i.e. <br/>Race: is a group of people who share the same language, history, culture, etc.<br/>Discrimination: is the practice of treating somebody or a particular group in the society less fairly than others.<br/>Therefore, Racial Discrimination is the discrimination on grounds of race.<br/>And in describing the nature of Racial Discrimination study.com says that in simple terms, racial discrimination is the practice of treating people differently, or poorly, because of the colour of their skin. For example, if two qualified applicants are interviewed for the same job (one black and the other white) and one is hired because of his skin colour. Then the organization or the company is guilty of racial discrimination.<br/>       By the manner of presentation of this prose Tell Freedom Peter Abrahams tries to expose and expound the ills caused by racial discrimination on the country South Africa. This he does to the extent that one hardly notices when and where he makes comments against the system. <br/>APARTHEID<br/>Apartheid as the Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary 8th edition defines it as: <br/>     A political system in which members of different races have <br/>    different political and social rights and lived, travelled, spent<br/>    their free time apart from each other.<br/>      According to Daily Times of June 19, 1991 Apartheid policy in South Africa was born by the White National Party before 1948 general election and it was built on Britain’s 1910 constitution for South Africa with laws of segregation. By this it was planned and executed that the four races; blacks, whites, coloureds (mulatto) and Asians that constitute the people of the country should live in different areas and enjoy unequal amenities and rights.<br/>    To make the Apartheid policy admissible the Authorities in South Africa enacted and passed into law certain obnoxious laws which placed several restrictions on the blacks. Among the laws was the unpopular pass law which was the separate amenities act passed in 1953. The pass law means that every black should carry with him everywhere he is going to a passbook. Without the passbook you are not allowed to reside, work, walk in a place.<br/>DISSILUSIONMENT<br/>Disillusionment as the Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary 8th edition defines it as:<br/>    “A feeling of disappointment resulting from the discover<br/>    that something is not as good as one believed it to be”.<br/>Feeling disillusionment means one is bummed out because he or she no longer believe in something –usually because one finds out it isn’t as amazing as one thought. The definition of disillusionment doesn’t sound so bad:  being freed from false beliefs or illusions.<br/><br/>\n\nRACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND DISILLUSIONMENT IN PETER ABRAHAMS’ TELL FREEDOM<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND DISILLUSIONMENT IN PETER ABRAHAMS’ TELL FREEDOM", "id": 199}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF IZON LINGUISTIC FEATURES IN EBI YEIBO’S POETRY<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1          Background to the Study<br/>Linguistics is the study of human natural language. It is an exciting area of study because all other fields of study also make use of language in their studies. Language is the chief means by which human beings communicate their ideas. Since language is human’s chief means of communication, everybody uses language in society. Although everybody uses language in society, different people use language in diverse ways. <br/>    The use of language is influenced by several factors which include the family, religion, society, educational background, exposure, etc. the profession of an individual greatly influences his use of language, and every speaker of a language has his preferred choice of words (diction). Writers, especially poets, use language mostly differently from the established codes of the language. Poets have what is known as “poetic licence” which permits them to ignore some rules and conventions generally observed by users of the language. This licence does not mean, the writer can use anything but the licence refers to creative licence where the poet can employ his creative idea to bring in new areas of his experience. Creativity brings aesthetic value to a piece of writing, especially poetry. Yeibo, who is a creative writer is not an exception who takes his knowledgeable advantage of his Izon language to employ Izon linguistic features in his poetry written in English.<br/>    In this research work, we are going to see some of those Izon linguistic features Yeibo employed in his poetry and analyze them to see how they have contributed to the aesthetic and communicative values of his works. In a bilingual setting, people infuse the code of one language into another. This infusion is not disorderly, there must be parallelism and Yeibo has been parallel in his infusion of the Izon linguistic code in the English code.<br/>    Therefore, it is anticipated that after going through his work, one will be educated on how to mix the codes of two different languages without causing incomprehensibility to the reader.<br/>1.2    Purpose of Study<br/>The purpose of this study is to point out and discuss the significance of the Izon linguistic features in Ebi Yeibo’s poetry. It brings out how the Izon linguistic features are used aesthetically by the poet to discuss the bureaucratic inefficiency of government, corruption, poverty, infrastructural, moral and institutional decay in the Niger Delta area.<br/>    The study shows that there is a relationship between the linguistic features of the Izon language and the English language as the poet employs the Izon linguistic features to write his poems in English. The study identifies the various Izon linguistic features in the collections and expresses their values. The study demonstrates that Yeibo has taken advantage of his status as a native speaker of Izon and his experience of the Ijaw environment to use Ijo linguistic elements to embelish his poetry.<br/>The native speakers of any language are competent users of that language and hardly commit errors. Apart from not committing errors, they use the language in special ways to send their messages that non-native speakers hardly comprehend. The way native speakers use language is worth studying and this is the aim of this research work. Yeibo, who is a native speaker of the Izon language, has effectively employed some Izon linguistic patterns in his poetry written in English. The various Izon linguistic features employed by Yeibo send different and strong messages to the reader. The reader, who might be a non-native speaker might find it difficult to comprehend the messages. These Izon linguistic features in question are: lexical borrowings, code-switching, Izon proverbs and Idioms, native rhetorical patterns, and semantic extension and dislocation.<br/>    This work is aimed at identifying the various Izon linguistic features employed by Yeibo, analyzing them, discussing them, and interpreting the intended messages by the poet to the readers. The reader who would come across some of these Izon linguistic features for the first time might find it difficult to comprehend them. Therefore, this work would help to ease the difficulties encountered by the readers. The work would not only interpret the linguistic features but would also reveal to the reader that there is a relationship between the Izon language and the English language where Yeibo who understands both languages used them all in his poetry to convey his messages. The Izon linguistic features employed by Yeibo are deviations from the English code but deviation is also a style in language used by linguists to send special messages.       <br/>1.3    Ebi Yeibo and His Writings <br/>    Knowledge about the poet and his background is necessary because it provides information about his linguistic, socio-cultural, psychological and physical background which is useful in understanding the texts and his use of language, especially the employment of Ijaw linguistic features. Ebi Yeibo was born on the 24th of February, 1969 to his Ijaw parents. He hails from Ayamassa Community in Ekeremor Local Government Area, Bayelsa State. The major occupations of his people are fishing and farming. As fishermen and farmers, they use Ijaw language mainly in their conversations and interactions. Ebi Yeibo who is also part of this occupation uses the Ijaw language as a typical Ekeremor man which also influences his choice of words in his poems. He had his Bachelor Degree in English from Delta State University, Abraka, 1996 and had his Master’s Degree from the University of Ibadan, 2000 in stylistics. He is a Lecturer I. He teaches in the Department of English and Literary Studies, Niger Delta University, Wilberforce Island, Bayelsa State. He is currently studying for his Ph.D also in Delta State University, Abraka. Ebi Yeibo being a stylistician and having an in-depth knowledge of his Ijaw language, employs the Ijaw linguistic features stylistically in his poetry which makes his collections have linguistic and aesthetic values. Some of Yeibo’s poems in A Song for Tomorrow have appeared in newspapers, journals and anthologies, including: The Guardian (Nigeria); The Post Express; Daily Times (Nigeria); ANA Review (Association of Nigerian Authors);     Passport to the New World (ed.S.Ayenawu, Apex Books, 2001); and The Silence within (International Library of Poetry, Owings Mills, USA, 2001). <br/>    Besides contributions in newspapers, journals and anthologies, Yeibo has published several poetry collections which include: Maiden Lines (1997), A Song for Tomorrow (2003), The Forbidden Tongue (2007), Shadows of the Setting Sun (2012), and The Fourth Masquerade (2014). Yeibo has won several prizes which include: ANA Oyo State Poetry Prize (2000); ANA Delta State/Tanure Ojaide Poetry prize (2003 and 2004); ANA Bayelsa State Poetry Prize (2008); Isaac Boro Prize for Niger Delta Literature (2008); and received Honourable Mention, ANA/NDDC Poetry Prize (2005) and Pat Utomi Book Prize for African Literature.  <br/>1.4    Scope of the Study <br/>    This analysis of Izon linguistic features is limited to three of Ebi Yeibo’s Poetry collections – The Fourth Masquerade, Shadows of the Setting Sun, and The Forbidden Tongue. These three collections are chosen because of the Izon linguistic features and the messages they share. The three collections all employ the Izon linguistic features like lexical borrowings,     Izon proverbs/idioms, native rhetorical patterns, etc. to discuss the issues of corruption, oppression, poverty, greed, political instability, the bureaucratic inefficiency of government; infrastructural, moral and institutional decay, the deplorable conditions under which the     Niger Delta people negotiate their existence, the threatened Niger Delta scape and, on some occasions, the lingering effects of colonialism on the African continent. Ebi Yeibo is not the only Izon writer that has employed linguistic features in his poetry. Other writers especially, Gabriel Okara and J.P. Clarke have also employed Izon linguistic features in their works. Amongst all, J.P. Clarke used the Izon linguistic features more in his works than others. One of Clarke’s works that he employed the Izon linguistic features most is “Vernacular Tradition”. In  Vernacular  Tradition , Clarke employed Izon linguistic features that give the work local colouring and aesthetic value. Both Okara and Clarke’s works have received more exhaustive critical attentions than Yeibo’s works. Besides the much critical attentions Okara and Clarke’s works have got, they did not discuss socio-political issues like Yeibo’s. Yeibo’s collections deal more on current socio-political issues affecting the Niger Delta Area.      1.5    Methodology <br/>    The methodology of this work is qualitative in approach because it is interpretative in nature. It explains and evaluates the linguistic features of the texts. These findings include words, narratives, individual quotes, literary style etc. (Owiredu 70).The Izon linguistic features in the chosen texts are identified and explained bringing out their aesthetic values and communicative significance. Each of the features identified has its functions and     purposes and these are explained. In this analysis, only few examples are cited from the primary texts to illustrate its linguistic feature. In the main work, more examples are given exhaustively. Henceforth, the following abbreviations are given for the primary texts: TFM (The Fourth Masquerade), SSS (Shadows of the Setting Sun), and TFT (The Forbidden Tongue).<br/>1.6    Theoretical Background <br/>    This study is guided by Geoffrey N. Leech’s comment on the “Linguistic Convention in Poetry” where Leech says “there is no such thing as literary register, a code of accepted usage in literature” (Leech 12). The study adopts Leech’s notion of style as deviation since the Izon linguistic features in Yeibo’s poetry deviate from the English code.<br/>    Linguistics is the study of language in general, but the use of language in different fields of discourse may be different. The use of language in poetry may deviate from the established code of English because poetry uses language mostly connotatively or figuratively. According to Leech, poetic language may be different from ordinary language in three     aspects. First, poetic language may violate or deviate from the generally observed rules of the language in many different ways, some obvious, some subtle. Both the means of and motives for deviation are worth careful study.<br/>    Secondly, the creative writer, and more particularly the poet, enjoys a unique freedom, amongst users of the language, to range over all its communicative resources, without respect to the social or historical contexts to which they belong. This means, amongst other things, that the poet can draw on the language of past ages, or can borrow features belonging to other, non-literary uses of language, as Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot, for example, have made use of the English of banal, prosy conversation in some of their poems. <br/>    Thirdly, most of what is considered characteristic of literary language (for example, the use of tropes like irony and metaphor) nevertheless has its roots in everyday uses of language, and can best be studied with some reference to these uses (6).<br/>    The study is also guided by Leech’s “Varieties of Poetic Licence” where Leech says that the poet has the right to ignore rules and conventions generally observed by users of the language. The licence Leech is talking about here is creative licence; whereby a poet may transcend the limits of the language to explore and communicate new areas of experience. Poetic licence does not mean anything goes in the language of poetry. As with a legal code, if transgressions are too frequent and too violent, the system breaks down. There are limits in the degree of freedom and also the types of freedom exercised. Poetic licence is certainly displayed more at some levels of linguistic patterning than at others. If the rules are broken down too much, it gives little value to poetry. Therefore, poets are to be careful on how they exercise their freedom. Yeibo in his collections makes careful use of his freedom as a poet, so the Izon linguistic features employed in his poems which are deviations from the English code do not     affect his works to the point of incomprehensibility. <br/>    This study also takes insights from Leech’s types of deviation where Leech mentioned various types of linguistic deviation which are (1) Lexical Deviation, (2) Grammatical Deviation, (3) Phonological Deviation, (4) Graphological Deviation, (5) Semantic Deviation, (6) Dialectal Deviation, (7) Deviation of Register and (8) Deviation of Historical Period. <br/>          Lexical Deviation. In this type of deviation the poet invents new words and infuses them into the existing words in a language. Leech refers to this type of deviation as “neologism or invention of new words” where he (Leech) says the poet may exceed the normal resources of the language (42). He adds that neologism is not limited to the poet, journalists, copy writers, scientists and even ordinary citizens in ordinary conversations see neologism as the readiest way to express their feelings or opinions .That is, lexical deviation or neologism eases conversation. In a situation where a person does not have the exact word to use in a conversation can bring in a word from another language to fill in the gap in a particular context. In lexical deviation or neologism, a writer in his style of writing can apply an existing rule in a greater generality than his customary: that the usual restrictions on its operation are waived in a given instance. This is not far from the lexical borrowings discussed in our work where Yeibo borrowed Izon lexical items in his collections written in English. The words such as biran,  oleilei, ageri, eseni, etc. are used in Yeibo’s  poetry. These words are Izon words but they combine to make Yeibo’s collections a whole. The infusion of these words do not only ease  Yeibo’s conversation with his readers but also gives local colouring  to the works. Anybody that picks these collections and reads them knows where they are coming from.<br/>         Grammatical Deviation. This type of deviation encompasses Morphology (The grammar of the word) and Syntax (the grammar of how words pattern with sentences). Some of the syntactic patterns in Yeibo’s poetry do not conform with the English code. This is because Yeibo has mixed the Izon and English codes together. “Whether the cock crows or not, the day will break”. “ Not to mourn yet until they enter pot”. The first expression has ‘day break’ referring to the day as something that is fragile and can break. What he means here is the dawn of a day or the breaking of dawn. In English, only dawn breaks but Yeibo has extended it to ‘day break’ thereby violating the syntactic rules of English. The second sentence “Not to mourn until they enter pot” does not have the linguistic elements of a canon sentence. We do not know what says we should not mourn until they enter pot. English canon sentences have subject- Verb-Object (SVO). This sentence lacks these elements and do not send a real message. However, the typical Izon man understands the message and can interpret it. The interpretations made by the Izon man make the work more comprehensible to the non-Izon reader (s). Hence, the purpose of this research work. It is thus, evident to say that Leech’s grammatical deviation is a good guide to this work.<br/>           Phonological Deviation. Phonology is the study of the application of speech sounds in a language. Phonological deviation has to do with the irregularities of pronunciation of words in a speech context. Therefore, phonological deviation in English poetry is of limited importance (Leech 46). In English, the only phonological irregularities that are necessary to note are conventional licences of verse composition, elison, ephesis, apocope, and special pronunciation for the convenience of rhyming, as when the verb live is pronounced like the adjective live. Again, some poets place word stresses in unusual places: like bastárd by Browning and Júly by  D.G. Rossetti (Leech 47). Although, we have said that phonological deviation is of limited importance to our work, it is worthy to mention that Yeibo’s collections have some word stress patterns that are different from English. A very good example is wúwú  wúwú wúwú. English does not have such word stress pattern. The speech sounds in English are different from those of Izon. <br/>           Graphological Deviation. Graphology is the study of writings in a language. It studies how words are spaced, how letters are written and how punctuation marks are used, etc. <br/>The Izon graphology is different from English. In the case of emphasis, the Izon language repeats words. That is why we see the expressions like ala beni kolo kolo, which means salt water is bitter in English. In the case of the possessive case of nouns, English adds apostrophe and s to the noun. That is, the house of John, becomes John’s house. But Izon does not show the possessive case in such manner. John’s house in English will be realized as John wari, thereby, omitting the apostrophe. Yeibo’s collections also deviate graphologically from the English code, especially in those areas that Izon linguistic features are employed.<br/>The graphology of a poem gives beauty to a poem. The accepted code of English poem is to begin each line with a capital letter and end with a small letter. Any violation of this rule is a deviation from the norm. But some poets intentionally deviate from this norm and arrange their poems in different ways. It is worthy to note here that graphological deviations also have their own underlying information and these information need to be interpreted.  Yeibo deviated graphologically in his collections in divert ways especially, For Hamza Al-Mustapha, where the entire poem is arranged haphazardly in a truncated manner. The haphazardly truncated manner of the poem is used to address a recent political incident thereby making mockery of the Nigerian Judiciary.<br/>Graphology is wider than orthography because it refers to the whole writing system, punctuation, paragraphing as well as spelling. Graphology affects phonology because a word is pronounced as it is written. <br/>         Semantic Deviation. Semantics is the branch of linguistics which studies the meaning of words, phrases, clauses, sentences, etc. Semantic deviation in poetry has to do with the use of words by a poet to mean things other than their canonical meanings in a language. Yeibo in his collections deviated severally by extending the meanings of some words and dislocating the meanings of others. For instance, the English word hippopotamus is a name given to a large grey African animal with a big head and mouth that lives near water. Yeibo dislocated its meaning by using it to refer to the Federal Government of Nigeria. Another instance of semantic deviation found in Yeibo’s poetry is the use of town crier. In English, town crier is someone employed to walk round the streets of a town, shouting news, warnings etc. but Yeibo also dislocated its meaning.      He used it to refer to the lamentation of the Niger Delta people. <br/>         Dialectal Deviation. Dialect is a variety of a language that is spoken only in one area, with words or grammar that are slightly different from other forms of the same language spoken by other people.  Dialectal deviation does not have much impact on our work because English and Izon are not the same language. Though, Yeibo’s dialect in the Izon language affects his choice of words and grammar which he translates into the English language. Some examples of dialectal difference in Yeibo’s poetry are eseni,biran, and abuko which are indi, bura and bugo in kolokuma dialect of the same Izon language.<br/>            Deviation of Register. Register is the technical words, style and grammar used by speakers and writing in a particular situation or in a particular type of writing. The job a person does affects his choice of words. For instance, a lawyer uses words differently from a doctor, and a journalist from an accountant. The different ways these professions use language is what is referred to as register. Modern poets have asserted their freedom from constraints of ‘poetical’ language. It is therefore to the present age that we turn for the most striking examples of poetic licence in the domain of register (Leech 50). The poet or creative writer employs a unique freedom, amongst users of the language, to range over all its communicative resource, without respect to the social or historical contexts to which they belong. This means, amongst other things, that the poet can borrow features belonging to other, non-literary uses of language in some of their poems. Yeibo is not an exception to this, he used poetic language in his poetry which is different from ordinary language. That is why some of his poems appear simple at the superficial level. But when  you read further, you find the complexity of the words. The poet has no boundary with respect to dialect and register. <br/>          Deviation of Historical Period. History is the study of the past, especially areas that affect us and relating it to the present. The English language study has passed through many stages, ranging from the dark ages to the present day. That is why we have the Old English, Middle English and Modern English. The studies of the Old English and Middle English are documented. Some poets still make use of some archaic words in their modern day poems. The poet is not restricted to the language of his own period. The medium of English poetry in the English language viewed as a historical whole, not just as a synchronous system shared by the writer and his contemporaries. James Joyce thought that a writer must be familiar with the history of his language –that he must, in short, be a philologist. T.S. Eliot expressed a similar point of view,in more general terms, when he insisted that no poet…….has his complete meaning alone. His significance, his appreciation is the appreciation of his relation to the dead poets and artists (Leech 51).<br/>In a bid to be familiar with the history of the English language and the appreciation of his relation to the dead poets and artists, Yeibo used some archaic terms in his poetry to send  his message. These archaic words add aesthetic value to his work and make him a proficient writer.                                                                                                                         <br/>    Yeibo’s use of Izon linguistic features in his collections has connections with almost all Leech’s types of deviation discussed above because the Izon linguistic features in the study include lexical borrowing which is connected with lexical deviation where the Izon lexical items deviate from the English lexical items. The other types of Leech’s deviation also have links with Yeibo’s use of Izon linguistic features because the features themselves are deviations. <br/>1.7    Review of Related Scholarship and Justification of Study  <br/>    Ebi Yeibo’s works have attracted critical comments from various readers, scholars, and people of different endeavours in life. The comments and criticisms from various individuals on Ebi Yeibo’s works include his imaginative use of language to portray his ideas and feelings, his aesthetic use of Ijaw linguistic features in his works, his use of poetic devices, rhythm and musicality etc.<br/>1.7.1    Scholarship Relating to Theme<br/>One of those who have commented on the themes in Yeibo’s poetry is Ogaga Okuyade. Okuyade examines Yeibo’s The Fourth Masquerade and discusses the themes of corruption, poverty, bureaucratic inefficiency of government and institutional decay of the Niger Delta. According to Okuyade, Yeibo has continued to express through poetry his dissatisfaction of the political leaders as they oppress the people of the area and refuse to develop the area. Okuyade’s comments also extend to Yeibo’s Shadows of the Setting Sun as he (Okuyade) discusses the themes of failure, political instability, economic bondage, and broken covenant. To Okuyade, the same set of politicians crippling the nation are the same people responsible for the propagation of the political programme. These politicians do not want to leave office for others. They want to rule perpetually and oppress the masses. Okuyade’s discussions on the themes in Yeibo’s The Fourth Masquerade and Shadows of the Setting Sun support our work as we are concerned with how Yeibo deploys the Izon linguistic features in his poetry to address the issues of poverty, oppression, infrastructural, moral and institutional decay, the deplorable conditions under which the Niger Delta people negotiate their existence, the threatened Niger Delta scape and the lingering effects of colonialism on the African Continent. <br/>    Another critic who comments on the themes in Yeibo’s poetry is Sunny Awhefeada. Awhefeada discusses the themes of comfort, assurance, broken covenants, and embattlement. Although, Awhefeada’s comments are on themes, he (Awhefeada) says Yeibo discusses the themes of comfort, assurance, broken covenants, and embattlement in a sarcastic and metaphoric manner. Awhefeada’s themes also complement Okuyade’s themes as they both discuss the failures of political leaders and their inhuman attitudes towards the Niger Delta people. Both Okuyade and Awhefeada’s comments support our work as we are concerned about the relationship between the oppressing political leaders and the oppressed Niger Deltans.<br/>    Austine Amanze Akpuda is another critic who comments on Yeibo’s poetry. Akpuda’s comments are on the themes of courage, destruction and forcefulness. Akpuda says Yeibo’s use of these themes is capable of inviting for the sheer bravado of naming wrongs the way masquerades do in Nigeria (10). Akpuda’s comments are centered on Yeibo’s The Fourth Masquerade. Neither Shadows of the Setting Sun nor The Forbidden Tongue is discussed. Thus, our scope is wider in the present research.<br/>    Luke Eyoh discusses the themes of courage, protest, and the beauty of unity. The themes of Eyoh are also connected to our work because The Forbidden Tongue talks about the courage the Niger Deltans should summon so that they can unite and protest against the oppression on them. Eyoh’s comments are brief and direct. His comments are on The Forbidden Tongue alone, nothing about Shadows of the Setting Sun and The Fourth Masquerade is mentioned. <br/>    Isidore Diala also comments on Yeibo’s poetry. His discussion is on the themes of grief, endurance and passion. Diala’s comments like Eyoh’s are also brief and direct. Diala’s comments do not make much impact on our work because they are too brief. Besides, they are only centered on The Forbidden Tongue. No comment is made on Shadows of the Setting Sun, neither on The Fourth Masquerade.<br/>1.7.2     Scholarship Relating to Language, Style and Literary Devices<br/>    Language according to J. D. Murthy is the medium of communication through which we express our emotions, ideas, feelings and thoughts to our fellow people.<br/>    The concept style is difficult to define (Vallins I62). We are faced with so much ambiguity in the meaning of the word style, but in relation to literature, style is the manner of writing which differentiates a person from another writer. Poetry is a literary form in which language is peculiarly patterned for effect and the reflection of the feelings of the composer. “Preface to the Lyrical Ballads”, William Wordsworth defines poetry as the “spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings recollected in tranquility.”<br/>The language and style of Yeibo’s poetry have attracted many comments from different people. One of those who comments on the language and style of Yeibo’s poetry is Ogaga Okuyade. Okuyade comments on Yeibo’s use of metaphors, paradox, euphemism, simile, imagery and symbolism. According to Okuyade, Yeibo’s use of these literary devices shows his competence in the literary world. Okuyade further adds that Yeibo’s use of these literary devices in his poetry is focused on the evolving social, cultural, and political events, and how geography, economics, and politics connive to deny the Niger Delta people their God-given right to manage and enjoy the natural resources in the area (12). The Niger Delta people have been marginalized for decades. Yeibo, who is from the Niger Delta, in a bid to express his ill-feelings about the government on how they treat his people, does this through poetry. Okuyade also adds that Yeibo has been humorous and sarcastic in his collection “For Hamza Al-Mustapha”. In this poem, Yeibo provokes laughter by weaving a recent national issue into a popular Ijaw folklore about an elusive fish that is capable of making fun of the fisherman and his fishing paraphernalia, no matter how skillful he deploys his fishing kits. The poem addresses a recent political issue where the judiciary which was supposed to be the hope of the people, connived with the political leaders and compromised. Okuyade’s comments on Yeibo’s style and literary devices in his poetry are so much related to our work because he talks about euphemism, imagery and paradox which go in line with our Izon proverbs. Although, Okuyade’s comments here are related to our work, he does not talk much on The Forbidden Tongue. His emphasis is on the The Fourth Masquerade and Shadows of the Setting Sun.   <br/>    Another critic who comments on the language, style and literary devices of Yeibo’s poetry is Austine Amanze Akpuda. Akpuda’s comments are centered mainly on the language of Yeibo’s The Fourth Masquerade. Akpuda says the language of The Fourth Masquerade is deceptive in nature because it looks simple at the superficial level but great depth is to be found underneath (10). He says the qualities of directness and deceptive simplicity become immediately apparent to anyone who picks this collection for the first time. As you read-on, you discover in no time that you are sailing onto the deep waters of puzzlement. Akpuda, who is interested in Yeibo’s use of language in his poetry, further adds that Yeibo deploys the storytelling motif, which helps him advance meaning. Storytelling is the most readily accessible and most popular African tradition of conveying message. The poem begins with a traditional African festival where the poet underscores the centrality of the gods in achieving his vision. A typical African festival subsumes the spiritual and the physical, represented by masquerades, gods and humanity who must work together. Yeibo fantacizes the beauty and harmony the world would attain if man and gods work in one accord. Again, Akpuda’s comments also have connection with our work because the Izon oral tradition is full of storytelling. When a typical Izon man wants to advise, caution and admonish, he uses tales which is part of the culture. Our work is on the Izon linguistic features. Therefore, the language which is in connection with our study of the Izon proverbs is best achieved. Although, Akpuda’s comments support our work, they are limited to The Fourth Masquerade. Neither The Forbidden Tongue nor Shadows of the Setting Sun is mentioned. <br/>    E. E. Sule is another scholar who comments on Yeibo’s poetry. Sule discusses the humorous and satiric nature of Yeibo’s collections, especially The Fourth Masquerade. Sule, just like Okuyade also comments on Yeibo’s satiric nature as he addresses the corrupt judicial system of Nigeria through the popular Hamza Al-Mustapha’s case. According to Sule, while being satiric, Yeibo’s collection also provokes anger, especially because of the certainty of freedom the judiciary offers the political class even in the full glare of the masses. Sule also points out that Yeibo’s poetic reflections on the Niger Delta are so engaging and artistically arousing a sense of sadness and regret (13). The comments of Sule on Yeibo’s poetry reveals the creative and knowledgeable nature of the poet in his language as he (Yeibo) uses the Izon linguistic features in his poetry to send heartfelt messages to his readers. Note here again that Sule’s comments are centered on Yeibo’s artistic use of language which supports our work, but his comments do not touch Shadows of the Setting Sun, neither do they touch The Forbidden Tongue. His comments only rely on Yeibo’s The Fourth Masquerade. <br/>    Luke Eyoh also discusses the literary devices of alliteration, consonance, irony and imagery. Eyoh says the use of these devices is musical and courageous in Yeibo’s poetry. Music is a motivation factor in the life of humans, especially when they want to unanimously carry out a task in one accord. The Niger Deltans need to be courageous to fight against the oppression on them by the government. Eyoh’s comments are very brief and direct, but so powerful. Although powerful, and supports our work, his comments appear only on The Forbidden Tongue. Our scope is wider in the present research.<br/>    Yeibo’s collections also attract comments from Isidore Diala, who discusses the literal devices of personification, oxymoron and imagery. Diala’s comments, like Eyoh’s, are also very brief and direct, but so powerful and passionate, as he says the language of Yeibo’s poetry is capable of transforming anger into hope. But he talks only on The Forbidden Tongue, and nothing is said on both The Fourth Masquerade and Shadows of the Setting Sun. Since Diala’s comments centre only on one of Yeibo’s collections, they do not make much impact on our work because our work is wider in the present research.<br/>    J.O.J. Nwachukwu-Agbada also discusses the devices of metaphor, personification and symbolism. Nwachukwu-Agbada says the metaphors in Yeibo’s poetry come to us like fragrances that we would live to remember forever. Nwachukwu-Agbada also adds that the language of Yeibo’s poetry is so alluring and gives hope to the enduring Niger Deltans. The language is seen as capsules that cure our emotional sicknesses. Nwachukwu-Agbada’s comments as brief as they are also talk about The Forbidden Tongue alone. Nothing is said about the other two collections, therefore, the impact on our work is not much. <br/>    Okuyade’s comments also complement Sunny Awhefeada’s comments which say that Yeibo’s poetry occupies a vibrant space when discussing the history and evolution of modern Nigerian poetry in English (8). Both Okuyade and Awhefeada are of the view that Yeibo is even more visible within the corpus of writing we today label Niger Delta literature – a literature which is not only combative, but is gradually becoming programmatic and ritualistic (8). It is worthy to note here that while Okuyade’s comments on the language and style appear on both Yeibo’s The Fourth Masquerade and Shadows of the Setting Sun, Awhefeada’s comments appear only on Shadows of the Setting Sun. Sunny Awhefeada establishes that from a close reading of Yeibo’s Shadows of the Setting Sun, one can easily observe remarkable development in his poetry, especially at the level of technical maturity (8). His argument is that Yeibo’s Shadows of the Setting Sun is undoubtedly the finest contribution to contemporary African poetry in English, for now when one considers the question of craft and message (8-9). He says that the poems in the Shadows of the Setting Sun unlike the poems in other collections are held together by a central recurring motif and the symbols and images he deploys are not only well organized, they vividly reinforce, concretize and configure the material subjects they are meant to articulate (9). One trait one easily notices in this collection is the nature of Yeibo’s language; one easily observes how the poet arranges his symbols and images, his use of folk materials for Izon oral tradition and its prosody and the charming grip of the Ethiopia River (9). Awhefeada also pointed out that a recognizable and distinctive Yeiboan voice has emerged with the publication of Shadows of the Setting Sun at the level of language and idea (9). Yeibo’s Poems in the Shadows of the Setting Sun have two influences at work: they carry the volcanic enchantment of Okigbo’s poetry and the sagacity and elegance of Osundare (9). Note here again that, although Awhefeada’s comments support our work, they are limited to Shadows of the Setting Sun. Neither The Fourth Masquerade nor The Forbidden Tongue is discussed.<br/>    Other critics that comment on Yeibo’s writings are James Tar Tsaaior, Joe Ushie, Toyin Adewale–Gabriel, Maik Nwosu, and Tanure Ojaide. These critics commented on Yeibo’s collections that they are capable of penetrating deep into the very sub-soil of his (Yeibo’s) Niger Delta cultural milieu like the aristocratic iroko tree, generously investing it with a histo- contextual halo and cultural continuum (12). In Yeibo’s poetic hemisphere, he wonders and wanders in thus vast waste land without refreshing oases called Nigeria like that peripatetic griot or troubadour weaving songs that denounce the perfidies and malfeasances of those who have imposed themselves on the nation as soldiers and politicians and yet without any sense of patriotic fervor, vision and mission, besides their egocentric ends and self-aggrandisement ((13). Yeibo laments the squelching of our dreams, the squandering of our fervent hopes and aspirations and the stunting of our once luxuriant and ambitious growth. He yearns for national renaissance as historic counterpoint to the ostensible interminable nightmare we have been struggling unavailingly to wake up form (13). Their criticisms are on Yeibo’s stylistic use of poetic language to express his dissatisfaction of the way political leaders treat his Niger Delta people in spite of the fact that they produce the oil that the entire nation feeds on. These comments also have a link with our work, though they are centred on Yeibo’s A Song for Tomorrow and other Poems which is not part of our work. Our work is on Yeibo’s The Fourth Masquerade, Shadows of the Setting Sun, and The Forbidden Tongue.<br/>1.8    Thesis Statement    <br/>Ebi Yeibo deploys Izon lexical borrowings, code-switching, Izon proverbs and idioms, native rhetorical patterns as well as semantic extension and dislocation to address the issues of corruption, poverty, bureaucratic inefficiency of government, infrastructural, moral and institutional decay of government in the Niger Delta.<br/><br/>  \n\nTHE SIGNIFICANCE OF IZON LINGUISTIC FEATURES IN EBI YEIBO’S POETRY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE SIGNIFICANCE OF IZON LINGUISTIC FEATURES IN EBI YEIBO’S POETRY", "id": 200}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>RAPE IN LUCY JONAH’S SHROUDED SECRETS<br/>Abstract</b><br/>Lucy Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets recounts the causes, circumstances and effects of rape on victims. The narrative gives a vivid and realistic picture of how innocent people fall preys to sexual predators who carry out the evil called rape. This paper examines the scourge of rape which permeates the novel and the different schemes rapists employ to carry out their wicked acts as well as how such deviant acts hurt victims socially, physically and psychologically. Insights are drawn from Freud’s psychoanalytic theory to examine how characters are influenced psychologically, and affected by their actions and inactions. Poverty, quest for greener pasture, ignorance and peer influence are some of the causes of rape as illustrated in the novel. Self- help, rugged dressing for ladies, eating a familiar meal, engaging in pleasurable activities and reflecting on nostalgic experiences are suggested as panaceas to the scourge of rape in the novel.<br/>Keywords: Rape, victims, panaceas, outcast, psychoanalysis. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>  Introduction    -    -    -    -<br/>1.1Scope of Study-    -    -    -    -    -<br/>Purpose of Study-    -    -    -    -<br/>Methodology-    -    -    -    <br/>1.4 Theoretical Background    -    -    <br/>1.5 Review of Related Scholarship and Justification of Study    -<br/>1.6 Thesis Statement    -    -    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>CIRCUMSTANCES AND CAUSES OF RAPE   -        <br/>2.1Introduction -        -        -              -                -                  -                        -            -         <br/>2.3 Poverty and Broken Home        -             -                 -                     -                  -             <br/>2.4 Quest for Greener Pasture                -                      -              -                 -                - <br/>2.5 Conclusion      -             -               -                 -                -                   -                 -    <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>SOCIO-PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF RAPE           -         <br/>3.1 Introduction         -                 -                    -                    -             -                 -             <br/>3.2 Social Effects         -                     -                     -                   -                  -                -           <br/>3.3 Physiological Effects -               -                 -              -                  -                -                  <br/>3.4 Psychological Effects               -                 -                  -               -                   -        -<br/>3.5 Conclusion -      -           -                   -                   -                  -                  -              -<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>SOLUTIONS/PANACEAS                        <br/>4.1 Introduction      -                 -                  -                  -                      -            -              -<br/>4.2 Self- Liberation          -                   -                      -                       -                      -             <br/>4.3 The Role of NGOs   -              -             -            -                 -                     -                    <br/>4.4 Mode of Dressing -             -               -           -             -                 -                -              <br/>4.5 Symbolic Cleansing -           -               -                  -             -              -                    -      <br/>4.6 Culinary Delight and Nostalgia          -              -       -                    -                -           -<br/>4.7   The Therapeutic Effect of Sharing Experience       -               -               -               -   <br/>4.8 Conclusion -             -              -             -                -              -             -              - <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>SUMMARY, FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION<br/>5.1 Summary -          -       -             -            -             -             -           -            -                -<br/>5.2 Findings -                -                 -           -             -              -               -              -        -<br/>5.3Conclusion-           -             <br/>5.4 Works Cited    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -           <br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/> Introduction <br/>Almost all human societies have sunk low into the abyss of immorality and wickedness. Visitor attack their hosts and friends and family members betray one another recklessly. Lucy Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets beams its searchlight on sexual violence which shatters its victims in the novel and in real life.<br/>    One of the primary functions of literature is to mirror social ills with a view to changing for the betterment of all. This fundamental task of literature finds a place in Lucy Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets. The novel captures the defects that mar orderliness and decency in society, beaming its literary light on the evil of rape and other domestic vices that go with it. The challenge of rape is a contemporary issue that seems to have eluded all proferred solutions. Shrouded Secrets was published in 2016 by Lucy Jonah and its major preoccupation is the scourge of rape in society.<br/>1.1 Purpose of Study<br/>The study examines the scourge of rape and specifically highlights its causes, circumstances, effects on its victims and its solutions as found in Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets.<br/>1.2 Scope of Study<br/>    This essay is limited to Lucy Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets published in 2016 and this is because the novel is detailed enough to capture the objective of this study. It is written like a collection of short stories on the subject of rape. Relevant excerpts from other related texts are cited where necessary. In what follows, we discuss the theory that underpins this essay, the methodology, as well as well present the incidents of rape in the novel, underscoring their circumstances, causes and socio-psychological effects. This study discusses how the scourge of rape is portrayed in Shrouded Secrets and examines the solutions presented by the author. It also critically examines the socio-psychological causes and effects of rape. The study uses insight from Sigmund Freud’s Psychoanalytical theory which lays bare the psychological make-up of the characters and their personalities.  <br/>Lucy Jonah was born in 1946 and grew up mainly under the custody of relatives who lived a communal life so she learnt a lot from different people. She got married around eighteen years old to a man who was fairly older than her. The marriage was fruitless so she opted out for another one that gave her two children. Around 1976 she ran a sandwich course in College of Technology, Yaba, Lagos State in Secretariat Administration and Printing Technology. She took other correspondent courses and private tutorial in the art and act of printing and publishing. Jonah once worked with the then Examination Success Correspondence as an editor but she was later taken to other departments owned by the same company. She is an accomplished writer, business woman and renowned publisher in Lagos. Some of her personal life experiences are fictionalized in her prose works, especially in The Trial of Sins.     She has the following publications (novels) to her credit: When Men Were Gods ( 2016 ). The Choice (2000) Ehianuka (an autobigraphy) (2006), The Trial of Sins (2016 ), Shrouded Secrets (2016) and The Pot and the Tripod(2016 ).<br/><br/>1.3 Methodology <br/>The method of analysis adopted in this essay is qualitative. This means that an in-depth textual analysis of the primary text was carried out. Relevant materials like academic articles from journals, text-books and the Internet are used. Analysis and interpretation of text are based on the researcher’s understanding and that of scholars who have written on the problem of rape. The psychological approach to literature is used in this study since it deals with the human minds in relation to society. Specifically, Freud’s Psychoanalytic theory underpin the analysis of the endemic incidents of rape in the novel.<br/>1.4 Theoretical Background<br/>    The literary theory adopted in this essay is Sigmund Freud’s Psychological criticism, also psychoanalytic criticism, which seeks to know how the subconscious state of characters and writers’ states of mind are brought to the fore in literary works. Rapists and raped victims have feelings which can be better understood by paying attention to their unconscious state of being. Freud’s concept of id, ego and superego summarize how the conscious and unconscious elements of the mind influence human behaviours in the face of societal laws regulating human conducts.  Ann B. Dobie maintains that the Psychological criticism is employed, “to probe the workings of the human psyche in order to understand why people act as they do” (48). Human feelings arise from the psyche, hence this essay focuses on Freud’s components of the mind which he tags the id, ego and superego and how they affect people’s behaviours  (rapists and raped victims) in the case of this study. <br/>The human psyche is very complex because it goes through many stages or phases of development before it attains maturity. These psychological stages include the Oral Stage, the Anal Stage and the Phallic Stage. Charles E Bressler writes that, “as infants, we experience the oral phrase: when we suck our mother’s breast to beefed, our sexuality (or libido) is activated. Through this activity our mouths develop into an erotogenic zone that will later cause us to enjoy sucking our thumbs and still, later in life, kissing” (123). According to Wikipedia, “the mother thus logically becomes your first “love object”, already a displacement from the earlier object of desire (the breast). When you first recognized the fact of your father, you dealt with humbly identifying yourself with him; however, as the sexual wishes directed toward your mother grew in intensity, you become possessive of your mother and wished your father out of the picture. (the Oedipus) Complex” (Web). Bresseler goes on and says that “in the second or anal stage the anus becomes an object of pleasure when children take the delight of defecation and, simultaneously, realize that they are independent person who are separate from their mothers. During this stage the anus becomes an erotogenic zone” (123).<br/>    It is noted in Wikipedia that this stage is between two to four years, “following the oral phase, which is split between active and passive impulses: the impulse to mastery on the one hand, which can easily become cruelty; the impulse to scopophilia (love of gazing). According to Freud, the child’s pleasure in defecation is connected to his or her pleasure in creating something of his or her own, a pleasure that for women is later transferred to child bearing. Bressler says that, “in the final phase, the phallic stage, a child’s sexual desire or libido is directed toward the genitals when the child learns the pleasure that results from stimulating one’s sexual organs”(124). Wikipedia holds that the penis or clitoris “becomes your primary object-cathexis. In this stage, the child becomes fascinated with urination, which is experienced as pleasurable both in its expulsion and retention” (web).<br/>    Society has sexual boundaries which specify the extent to which a well developed genital can explore. Freud uses the Oedipus, Castration, and Electral complex to explain how the sexual organs and libido are controlled. This means that the cordial bond between a girl-child and her father or that of a boy-child and her mother must be removed. According to Bresller, “if a child’s sexual development is to proceed normally, Freud maintains, each must then pass through the castration complex. From observing themselves, their mothers, and perhaps their sisters, little boys know they have a penis like their fathers, while their mothers and sisters do not. What prevents the male child from continuing to have incestuous desires with his mother is fear of castration by his father” (124). Wikipedia calls this stage “latency period during which your sexual development was more or less suspended” (web); that is, repressed. For the girls, Bresller says that:<br/>Whereas boy must successfully negotiate the Oedipus complex in order to become a normal man, a girl must successfully negotiate the Electral complex if she is to make the transition from a girl to a normal woman. Like a boy, a young girl is erotically attracted to her mother, and like the boy, she too recognizes a rival for her mother’s affection; the father. Unconsciously, however, the girl realizes that she is already castrated like her mother. Since she knows her father possesses that which she desires, a penis, she turns her desires to him and away from her mother. After the seduction of her father fails, she turns back toward the mother and identifies with her. Her transition into womanhood being complete, the girl realizes that one day she, too like her mother, will possess a man. Through her relationships with a man, her unfulfilled desire for a penis (penis envy) will be mitigated and her sense of lack will be somewhat appeased. (124-125)<br/>Freud argues that there is a psychological riot or conflict in a girl’s sexual organ and it must be repressed. Freud’s theory as illustrated in Wikipedia states that, “the young girl, also experiences the castration complex, with the difference that her tendency is to be a victim of what Freud terms “penis-envy” a desire for a penis as large as a man’s. After this stage, according to Freud, the woman has an extra stage of development when “the clitoris should wholly or in part hand over its sensitivity, and at the same time its importance to vagina” (web). All the sexual developments which Freud explains are better expressed in his Dynamic, Economic and Tripartite model.<br/>    Freud psychoanalytical theory has many models which explains human nature and behaviours. These models of the human psyche reveal the state of the mind in relation to human conducts in society. Dynamic model is the first model and it deals with the conscious and the unconscious part of human mind. Bressler writes that:<br/>our minds are a dichotonomy consisting of the conscious (the rational) and the unconscious (the irrational). The conscious, Freud argued perceives and records external reality and is the reasoning part of the mind. Unaware to the presence of the unconscious, we operate consciously, believing that our reasoning and analytical skills are solely responsible for our behavior. Nevertheless, Freud is the first to suggest that it is the unconscious, not the conscious, that governs a large part of our actions. (121)<br/>human minds are actually endowed with two parts which conflict with each other and whichever won controls a larger part of our actions either good or bad, that is, rational or irrational. Bressler goes forward to say that, “the irrational part of our psyche, the unconscious, receives and stores our hidden desires, ambitions, fears, passion, and irrational thoughts” (121). All human beings have the capacity to reason and before actions are taken, the mind is involved. Even unintentional actions and slip of the tongue emerge from our minds. Though they are considered unconscious actions.<br/>    Economic model is the second model developed by Freud and he maintains that this model has two parts: the pleasure principle and the reality principle. Bressler states that:<br/>The pleasure principle craves only pleasures, and it desires instantaneous satisfaction of instinctual drives, ignoring moral and sexual boundaries established by society. Immediate relief form all pain or suffering is its goal. The pleasure principle is held in check however, by the reality principle, that part of the psyche that recognized the need for societal standards and regulations or pleasure. Freud believed that both these principles are at war within the human psyche. (122)<br/>In every society, there are the good, the bad and the ugly and the diverse people behave differently. The bad like rapists, armed robbers or corrupt leaders crave for immediate satisfaction thus Freud maintains that it is the pleasure principle which controls their actions. The good is controlled by the reality principle hence the pursue noble acts.<br/>    Tripartite Model is the third aspect of Freud’s psychoanalytical theory and this dwells on the three conflicting parts of the human psyche. They are the id, the ego and the superego. M.H Abrams states that “Psychoanalytic criticism deals with a work of literature primarily as an expression in an indirect and fictional form of the state of mind and the structure of personality of the individual author” (256). This theory offers insight that can be employed to x-ray human behaviours and actions. It enables critics to probe why a deviant may rape a helpless victim and how victims feel about their pain. Dobie further asserts that “in an effort to describe the conscious and the unconscious mind, Freud divided the human psyche into three parts: the id, the ego and the superego. They are for the most part unconscious. <br/>The id for example, is completely unconscious, and only small part of the ego and the superego are conscious. Each operates according to different, even contrasting, principles” (51). Human minds are affected by different factors within a specific environment and these affect behaviours which depend on individuals desires and state of mind which in turn affect society. This is applicable to the phenomenon of rape and the mindset of rapists. The psychic drive of humans is located in their id which Dobie describes as:<br/>the repository of the libido, the source of our Psychic energy and our psychosexual desires, gives us our vitality. Because it is always trying to satisfy its hunger for pleasure, it operates without any thought of consequences, anxiety, ethic, logic, precaution, or morality, demand swift satisfaction, and fulfillment of biological desires, it is lawless, asocial, a moral. As Freud describes it, it is only striving to bring about the satisfaction of the instinctual needs to the observance of the pleasure principle. (51)<br/>     Man would like to live in unrestrained pleasure if given the chance. The part of man which craves for unlimited pleasure is the id. It is the reckless and it is the part of the mind that pushes a man to rape a defenceless girl. Eward H. Straunch states that “man’s action is caused by certain subconscious impulses and forces over which he has little or no control” (96). In the same direction, Dobie goes further by stating that “the id can be a social destructive force unrestrained, it will aggressively seek to gratify its desires without any concern for law, customs, or values” (51). Dobie and Strauch agree that there is a psychological impulse or force that is the id which influences human unrestrained actions. Their position validates the view that psychological criticism can explain why certain actions are taken by characters like rapists who fail to control their sexual impulse in the face of societal laws. <br/>    Within the human mind is a psychological apparatus which restrains the destructive drive of the id. This may be referred to as human conscience which checks the excesses of humans. Dobie argues that, “the ego, which operates according to the reality principle, is one such regulating agency. Its function is to make the id’s energies non-destructive by postponing them or diverting them into socially acceptable actions… it mediates between our inner selves and the outer world” (51). Every civilized human society has customs, traditions and laws which are put in place to guide against selfish and reckless behaviours. Sometimes, the need for unlimited pleasure forces a man to go against societal codes of conducts. If this is not promptly checked, it will degenerate into a society describes by Thomas Hobbes in “Leviathan”. In such society, there will be, “ continual fear and danger, violent death, and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short” (62). Society must be rid of vices and kept under a decent control. If there is nothing like conscience, that is, ego to check the id, there will be reckless destruction here and there. <br/>    In the assertion of Dobie, “the superego, provides additional balance to the id, for it furnishes a sense of guilt for behaviour that breaks the rules given by parents to the young child. Similar to what is commonly known as one’s conscience, it operates according to the morality principle, for it provides the sense of moral and ethical wrongdoing” (51). The superego ensures that society is kept in perfect order as a result of this it moderates the actions of man such that no matter how cruel a human can be, there are still restraining elements controlling his actions. This is an aspect of psychoanalysis that deals with society. The belief that human psyche and environment influence our behaviours in society is stressed by Strauch who argues that, “psychic and environmental factors determine how we react and what we do”(96). Everyone has a way of reacting to societal constructs like laws, customs and traditions. While some people strive to be conformists, others become deviant. Superego, the restraining psyche of man however balances the forces which lie between “how we react and what we do” to quote the words of Strauch. <br/>     On his examination of psychological theory, Wilbur Scott maintains that the application of the theory on literary texts “enables and encourages a deeper probe into the dramatization of human situation” (69-70). The scourge of rape as a social distress is one of the human situations society has been fighting from time immemorial. Every society has laid down rules which everyone is expected to adhere to but sometimes non-conformists do things in their own ways. For example, it is the same sexual pleasure a rapist gets that a married man gets form his legally married wife. A rapist, however, chooses to shun the processes and customs attached to marriage and relationship. Instead, he forcefully grabs and violates any woman to satisfy his urge ignoring sexual and moral boundaries.<br/>    This study relies on Freud’s psychological principles to explore the problem of rape in society as depicted in Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets. One of the principles is the Pleasure Principle which focuses on man’s desires to readily get immediate satisfaction without regard for societal or moral laws and the other one is the Reality Principle which moderates the actions of man in line with societal laws and morals.<br/>1.5 Literature Review <br/>    Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets has not attracted critical comments as such being a recent text. This essay, however, employs critical comments on sexual misconducts in other studies. The concept of rape is examined as part of this study’s review of literature.<br/>The concept of rape and classification according to Wikipedia, the free Encyclopedia is adopted.<br/>It defines rape as : <br/> a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without that person's consent. The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority, or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability or is below the legal age of consent. The term rape is sometimes used interchangeably with the term sexual assault. The rate of reporting, prosecuting and convicting for rape varies between jurisdictions. Internationally, the incidence of rapes recorded by the police during 2008 ranged, per 100,000 people, from 0.2 in Azerbaijan to 92.9 in Botswana with 6.3 in Lithuania as the median. Worldwide, rape is primarily committed by males. Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by people the victim knows, and male-on-male and female-on-female prison rapes are common and may be the least reported forms of rape. Widespread and systematic rape (e.g., war rape) and sexual slavery can occur during international conflict. These practices are crimes against humanity and war crimes. Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted ethnic group. People who have been raped can be traumatized and develop posttraumatic stress disorder. Serious injuries can result along with the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. A person may face violence or threats from the rapist, and, in some cultures, from the victim's family and relatives. (Web)<br/>Rape is a sexual intercourse carried to on a victim who is usually over powered by his or her violators. This forceful and unlawful penetration may be directed to a victim’s anus, viginal, mouth and this may be done with objects, the perpetrators’ sex organ or body parts like fingers. Once the consent of a victim is not obtained before a sexual intercourse is carried out, rape has can be said to have taken place. It is a crime that is punishable under the law but it appears that patriarchy makes male perpetrators of rape to go almost free. Relevant agencies fight rape to protect the dignity of humans especially helpless girls. <br/>Types of Rape<br/>Acquaintance Rape<br/>    This type of rape occurs among people who are close, for example, co-workers, school mates, family friends and distant family members. Victims of acquaintance rape are often caught unaware because they often trust their violators prior to the attacks.<br/>Gang Rape<br/>    This occurs when a group of people plan to sexually assault their victims perhaps someone who is proving stubborn to them. This type of rape often leaves victims heavily battered or in a near death state.<br/>Juvenile Rape<br/>    This is sexual abuse on children. It is more of incest because children are often left in the hands of their close relatives or neighbors who turn out to be sexual predators.<br/>Prison Rape<br/>    Inmates in prison cells sexually assault one another since it is sometimes difficult to express their sexual urge with the people they need. It is also linked with custodial rape ( in prison custody) where warders violate people under their care ( patients or prisoners).<br/>War Rape<br/>    Soldiers are always guilty of this since victims or prisoners of war are always at their mercies. They use threat and force to sexually assault helpless people caught in war scenes.<br/>Theft Rape<br/>    This is a forceful sexual intercourse that is carried out by armed robbers on their victims. Some bandits derive pleasure in it so they assault their preys after looting them.<br/>Ceremonial/Ritual Rape<br/>    Some deadly rituals or initiations required some superior members to sleep with new in takes. This is done under a terrible condition that victims may not be able to resists therefore it leaves them brutally injured.<br/>Monica Udoette and Joy Nwiyi note that African writers do not turn a blind eye to the issue of wayward behaviour like sexual assault:<br/>Issues relating to sexual behavior and activities in African social circles have not always enjoyed the privilege of being brought to the fore. The social religious and cultural biases of Africans, as it were, seem to have kept these issues “concealed” as much as possible. However (un) acceptable sexual activities and relationship(s) within and outside African society are being interrogated by African writer in recent times. (245)<br/>Udotte and Nwiyi are correct because the issue of rape is one of the trending issues in African literature. It is a serious matter which affects the well-being of every sane society. In a bid to put a stop to it, Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets satirizes all those who celebrate or support sexual assaults. The novel reveals the evil of rape with a view to finding a permanent solution to it. As earlier noted every society has codes of conduct which must be adhered to. It is, however, disheartening that some individuals break such societal codes and norms, as Ogaga A. Obaro says, “Individual deviance is deviant behaviour involving a person acting alone contrary to established customs, mores and laws of the group or society. Thus, the armed robber, the thief, the burglar, the murderer, the rapist, the drug addict, the prostitute and so forth who acts as single individual is an individual deviant” (26-27). Ogaga clearly points out that certain individuals in society find it difficult to abide by laws guiding social conducts hence they do things in their ways, this is an act of deviance which civilized society frowns at. Jonah condemns the abuse of women especially young girls whose sexuality is violated in society that cares less for women’s rights. Rape occurs every minute and it is disturbing that little or nothing is done to discourage this ungodly act especially by those who subscribes to patriarchy. As a moralistic writer, Jonah uses her novel Shrouded Secrets to protest against rape in order to protect the interests of raped victims who die in silence.<br/>     Nawal El Saadawi’s Woman at Point Zero has a similar theme of rape and sexual molestation which is at the front burner of Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets. Just like Omosigho who is sexually assaulted by his uncle, Ibekwe Ezeakolam in a study on Woman at point Zero notes most men derive pleasure in exploiting women. He asserts that “another layer of female oppression comes from men, starting from Firdaus’ father, uncle, husband Bayoumi, and Marzouk the pimp. Firdaus is passed from one abusive guardian to another after the death of her parents. A well-educated uncle repeatedly molests her sexually” and “ persuaded by his wife and taken in by the prospects of a big dowry, the uncle forces her into an early marriage with more-than –sixty-year old sheikh Mahmoud” (76). This bitter experience is echoed in Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets. It is similar to the story of Omoshigo the protagonist and Salamatu, her clinical client, <br/>    Jonah and Saadawi agree that the incident of rape is alarming therefore they project it in their works as evil. Canon Gilbert O. Madubuike asserts that, “ any sexual behaviour therefore, that does not contribute to the welfare of the individual or society can be regarded as risk behaviour. Such behaviours as rape,, watching pornographic films”… (21). Every society must cultivate right behaviors which can promote and protect human dignity. Rape is a terrible sexual behaviour which has ruined many victims. Maduibuike further states that, “sexual risk behaviour has a lot of psychological and physiological implications on the survival of the human race. For example, Chukwuma (2008), assert that many victims of rape (a major type of sexual-risk behavior, suffer a lot of humiliation and even death” (27). This assertion is apt because it captures the experience of characters presented in Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets. Rape has a devastating effects on those who survive it. Jone-Frances Agbu affirms Madubuike’s assertion when she says that “child sexual exploitation involves a breach of trust or an exploitation of vulnerability and frequently both. Sexually exploited children not only face on their developing sense of their sexual identity, but a blow to their construction of the world as a safe enough environment and their developing sense of other as trustworthy” (74). Rape hurts victims beyond what can be described and that is why civil or humanitarian groups fight very hard to halt all sexual-devastating behaviours. From the foregoing, it is evident that no critical work is found to have been written on Shrouded Secrets. This essay therefore examines the scourge to underscore its socio-psychological causes and effects. <br/>1.6 Thesis Statement <br/>In all the incidents of rape in intriguing circumstances in Shrouded Secrets, Lucy Jonah vividly presents the crudity and lasting sociological effects of rape on its victims and consequently demonstrates how the scourge should be tackled in society.   <br/><br/>\n\nRAPE IN LUCY JONAH’S SHROUDED SECRETS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RAPE IN LUCY JONAH’S SHROUDED SECRETS", "id": 201}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THEMATIC PREOCCUPATIONS AND NARRATIVE DEVICES IN CHIMMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE’S  PURPLE HIBISCUS AND KAINE AGRARY ’S YELLOW YELLOW</b><br/><b>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE:<br/>  Introduction<br/>1.1Scope of Study-    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>Purpose of Study-    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>Methodology-    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>1.4 Theoretical Background    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>1.5 Review of Criticism    -    -    -    -            -    <br/>1.6 Thesis Statement    -    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER TWO:<br/>Thematic Preoccupations in Purple Hibiscus   -        -               <br/>2.1 High-Handedness<br/>2.2 Rebellion<br/>2.3 Disintegration<br/> Thematic Preoccupations in Yellow Yellow<br/>2.4 Degradation of the Niger Delta<br/>2.5 Quest for Economic Survival<br/>2.6 Moral Decadence-              -                 <br/>CHAPTER THREE:<br/>Narrative Devices Deployed in the Novels<br/>3.1 Suspense<br/>3.2 Point of View<br/>3.3 Symbolism<br/>3.4 Irony<br/>CHAPTER FIVE:<br/>Conclusion-           -             -                -            <br/>Works Cited    -    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>Introduction <br/>Purpose of Study<br/>This essay examines thematic preoccupations in Chimmamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus and Kaine Agrary’s Yellow Yellow.

Qualitative method is a type of research approach which examines the concept, meaning metaphor or symbols used in the projection of a text’s message. It does not use data, statistics and figures like the quantitative approach, however, it seeks an in-depth analysis of a text. In this essay, the primary texts for this study are thoroughly read and relevant portions are analysed. Pertinent and scholarly comments from articles online and in print journals are used in the interpretation of the texts. Moreover, the concept of formalism to the study of literary texts is employed as the basis of this study’s analysis.<br/>1.4 Theoretical Background<br/>This essay adopts the tenets of formalistic approach in the study of literary texts. In other words, the formalistic approach to the study of literary texts is used as the theoretical background in this study. Formalistic theory prioritizes the place of form and structure in the study of literary works. The deployment of literary devices in the realization of authors’ messages in literary works is considered significant in the interpretation of a text. In other words, literary devices such as language, setting, characters, point of view, irony, suspense are studied. Formalist concern is with a text and not factors outside the text for this reason formalistic critics carry out intrinsic and not extrinsic study of a text. Looking at a text from within excludes social and historical context in which the work is set. Therefore, context in which the work is set. Therefore, biographical, social, political, psychological or ideological information is not given a worthy or serious attention in the analysis and interpretation of a text. Literary elements or narrative devices employed in a text are given priority. According to M.H. Abrams:<br/>formalists have also made influential contributions to the theory of prose fiction. With respect to this genre, the central formalist distinction is that between the “story” (the simple enumeration of a chronological sequence of events) and a plot. An author is said to transform the raw material of a story into a literary plot by the use of a variety of devices that violate sequence and perform and defamiliarize the story elements; the effect is to foreground the narrative medium and devices themselves, and in this way to disrupt and refresh what had been our standard responses to the subject matter. (108)<br/>Abrams’s opinion correctly summaries the key concept of formalistic approach to the study of literary texts. The theory maintains that the components of a literary text must be given a top priority if its meaning must be realized with accuracy. Formalistic critics read a text closely and locate the author’s message strictly inside the text. Wilfred L. Guering et al. also elaborate on the place of formalist criticism in the realization of a text’s meaning. They assert that, “the object of “formalistic” criticism is to find the key to the structure and meaning of the literary work a key that inevitably reveals itself as necessary to the experience of the work as an art Form” (45). The surest and most reliable way of arriving at the meaning of a text is to study its internal structure and form. They go further to say that, “this approach is based on the idea that, although extra-literary considerations such as the author’s life, his times, and sociological phenomena may be interesting and sometimes quite helpful, the heart of the matter ought to be, quit simply: what is the literary work, what are its shape and effect, and how do these come about? in short, we search for the form, necessary for a real understanding of the work” (45). It is very important to state that formalistic approach is unique because it practitioners pay attention to details in their interpretation of a text. No aspect of a text is given unworthy attention. A formalistic critic does not study central characters alone but minor characters as well. This approach enables a critic to carry out a complementary analysis which highlights the relationship between all characters either major or minor.<br/>    Formalism at different times, has adopted different names but its tenets and approach remains the same. The world of literature accommodates the formalistic approach because it is flexible and not rigid for this reason, difference in name does not result to difference in idea and approach which formalists use in their analysis. Abrams affirms that there is a tie between Formalistic Approach and New Criticism hence readers use them interchangeably. According to Abrams, “American New criticism, although it developed independently, is sometimes called “formalist” because like European formalism, it stresses the analysis of the literary work as a self-sufficient verbal entity, constituted by internal relations and independent of reference either to the state of mind of the author or to the actualities of the “external” world” (108).<br/>Ann B. Dobie comments on Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s assertion on form which maintains that, “form is actually the whole that is produced by various structural elements working together” (34). Each literary text has different segments on which its overall message hinges. In the view of this, formalistic adherents maintain that the reliable way to identify the meaning of a text is to look within its intricate elements which the author deployed in its composition. Rather than looking at external factors like psychological, sociological and historical ideology to explain the meaning of a text, efforts should be invested in the analysis of a text’s internal form and structure because they give rise to meaning.  Intrinsic exploration of a text therefore requires that a critic means should focus on the inherent or integral segments or parts of literary texts which largely account for their meanings. Going by this reasoning, there are close ties between a text’s thematic preoccupation and literary devices deployed by authors. Formalist critics investigate how a work is structured to realize its themes and this literary quest begins with the organization a text’s plot.  That is all the artistic elements which are employed to build up the structure and form of the text are given worthy attention.<br/>    Some texts do not yield their meaning easily and if these texts are subjected to all sorts of ideological theories, they become ambiguous. Formalistic theory does not impose certain ideologies on literary texts and this makes it less demanding to uncover the meaning of texts. It may therefore be out of the way to apply a psychological approach to a text that dwells on political persuasion. A formalistic approach however offers an open end approach to the study of a text. It does not give straight jacket rules that hinder free analysis and interpretation. Charles E. Bressler argues that the meaning of a text is located in its structure. Bresseler holds that critics should pay attention to a text’s structure because, “its meaning must reside within its own structure. Like all other objects, a poem and its structure can be analyzed scientifically… It is the critic’s job, they conclude, to ascertain the structure of the poem, to see how it operates to achieve its unity, and to discover how meaning evolves directly from the poem itself” (44). What Bressler is saying is that external considerations such as the authors’ sociological background, biography, political orientation or socio-culture orientation ought not to be focused on in the analysis of literary texts therefore Bressler maintains that to “analyze all images, symbols, and figures of speech within the text” (47). Formalism is a literary theory which stimulates readers to focus on the form of a text as a reliable way of arriving at the meaning of such text. Formalists analyse and interpret a literary text by looking at its plot structure, setting, characters diction, symbols and the point of view from which an author tells his story. Critics who follow the formalistic persuasion believe that the biography of an author, the psychology and the sociology of his days are not dependable way of arriving at the meaning of a text.<br/>Finally, it is crucial to state that the whole or sole business of a formalistic critic is to shred a text into bits and examines how each literary element deployed in the text helps such text to realize its meaning. Texts are therefore independent of readers subjective reasoning. Close reading of a text is a popular method formalistic critics employed in the reading of a text. Such approach of interpreting a text becomes necessary because sometimes the meaning of a text is hidden. Until elements like symbols, metaphor, setting or language and so on are uncovered, certain layers of meaning will not be brought out. This approach affords a critic to identify the relationship among different aspects of a text. This pattern of analysis and interpretation of a text is structurally inclined on this ground formalistic critics are considered to be structural because they emphasis on the structural form of a text their criticism.<br/>     Most critics who comply to the tenets of formalism tend to favour it because it is objective and not subjective. It gives each critic a refreshing opportunity to look at a text from an individual point of view rather than looking at a text from the stand point of a theory with restricted ideology. In other words, formalistic approach does not compel critics to follow the tenets of disciplines outside literature therefore critics focus on a text and not ideas outsides it. The formalist approach is applied in this study.          <br/>1.5 Review of Related Scholarship<br/>    Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus has attracted many critical and scholarly comments but Agary’s Yellow Yellow has not. What scholars have said about the two novels are examined. In a study on sex, gender and sexuality, Femi Ehijele Eromosele looks at the portrayal of characters’ attitudes towards themselves as depicted in Adichei’s Purple Hibiscus, Half of a Yellow Sun and The Thing around your Neck. In his argument, Purple Hibiscus, “is an indictment against fanatic brand of Catholicism-or any other religion that seeks to suppress the development of the total human in the name of holiness” (101). A study of Kambili’s relationship with other characters especially Father Amadi brings her suppressed sexuality out. Prior to her contact with the priest, her father has dominated her emotional, psychological and physical being such that she does not know how to properly relate with male characters. This further suppresses her to the extent that her cousin, Amaka calls her, “Atulu” that is, a sheep. Ogechikwu A. Ikediugwu claims that, “the sharp contrasts that exist in the developments of both sexs”(3) helps to point out the differences between Adichie’s male and female characters. For instance, she notes that the “female characters recognize the communal spirit of Africans and try to respect it in all their endeavours. They are accomodating, loving, supportive and protective while at the same time assertive of their rights whenever the situation demands for it” (14). This is true of Aunty Ifeoma who stands up to defend the feminist voice in Purple Hibiscus. It is on this premises that Maureen Amaka Azuike writes that, “the protagonists of Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus and Half of a Yellow sun have taken charge of their lives by taking decisions which may leave the readers absolutely breathless” (82). Beatrice is one of the characters who takes a bold step in fighting for her freedom. She poisons her husband who bullies her and this actually leaves readers speechless and breathless. Beatrice has endured all manners of ill-treatment with a submissive spirit but suddenly she becomes irrational and as a consequence she kills her husband. This unexpected action makes Purple Hibiscus a classic example of radical feminist text.<br/>    Symbolism is a powerful device which writers employ to give extension of meaning to their works. There are symbolic objects like palm, missal, blood, figurine etc in Purple Hibiscus. Andre Kabore asserts that, “palms symbolize victory or triumph” (32) and “the figurines are always associated with Mama or at least mentioned in connection with her” (34). Mabore writes that:<br/>Mama is so happy with the figurines that she hugs herself. The glass is delicate, easily breakable. It is a sign of fragility in comparison to something stronger like the heavy missal which may personify Papa himself. The author establishes a link between the figurines and Mama’s gentle attempts to cope with her husband’s violence. Mama is physically weaker than papa. Interestingly, each time she is beaten by her husband, after her miscarriages for example, she spends some time with the figurine as if retracting to thinks over and find solution to stop such abuses. (34)<br/>Adichie draws a link between her characters and certain objects which physically represent their inner emotions. For instance, Mama’s personality and passion rest in the figurines which means a lot to her and her world view. Kabore maintains that, “since the smashing of the figurines, the relationship is the family have changed. Mama secretly gets ready for vengeance” (34). Mama bottles her emotion in the figurines and the moment Papa dares to break the figurines, things fall apart in the family. The figurines which represents Mama’s reserved personality is broken and her true image is brought out. Brender Cooper argues that “the figurines in other words, are Mama’s protecting spirits” (5). This is a kind of her personal god to her. She sees her shell broken and this fuels her anger and the yearning to end her task master’s life. She subsequently kills her husband who opposes her happiness and joy. Kabore concludes by saying that the symbols in the novel, “are ambivalent, revealing the complexity of characters which are full of strange contrasts and contradictions” (36).<br/>    Lawal M. Olusola and Fatai Alabi Lawal affirm that Adichie deploys language to bring out the artistic strength of Purple Hibiscus. Olusola and lawal argue that, “the linguistic acumen displayed by the author here looks into how women are underestimated, downgraded, second classed and rather looked down upon by their men counterparts and how women are rising to the occasion to take on men’s challenge on this” (12). Language is a tool in which people reconstruct their world. It is observed that Adichie’s deployment of language in Purple Hibiscus reveals that women are portrayed as less human through their description and portrayal by men. Olusola and lawal concluded that, “there is a lot of deployment of linguistics adroitness and ideological disposition by Adeichie in Purple Hibiscus” (15). Words are used to socially class women such that they appear less important. The ideology of patriarchy which demeans the female gender is pursued through the use of language which relegates women.<br/>    Florence O. Orabueze in her critique of Purple Hibiscus observes that it is an embodiment of man’s struggle for emancipation. Patriarchy is considered a terrible institution because it seems to empower men to subjugate their household. This is the position of Orabueze. She write that in Purple Hibiscus:<br/>Adichie shows that violence begets violence. She shows that the brutality, which Eugene Achike suffered in his travail to acquire the white man’s way, has turned him into a horrendous brute. He directs this brutality on his family in the name of Christianity. He beats Jaja, his son, until his little finger is paralyzed for falling two catechism questions that make him not to be the first in the class. He beats his wife several times that her face and eyes look like black-purple colour of an overripe avocado. He brutally assaults her several times when she was pregnant that the fetuses aborted. (226)<br/>This is a clear case of brutality, tyranny, and total cruelty against humanity. It is surprising that Eugene should be at the helm of such in human act and it is most disappointing that he cannot achieve the sort of perfection he seeks through brutality. For every action, there is a reaction which tries to balance two forces. In the words of Orabueze:<br/>Adichie shows that a man with such excesses imposition of suffocating restriction and brutalization and dehumanization of his family must pay for them. The whole structure of the novel is rooted in irony and there are several ironical situations. Eugene Achike, in battering the family insists that he wants them to attain the state of perfection, but in killing him they seem to be imperfect. This shows that his brutal training of his family is inadequate. (228)<br/>The reward of Eugene’s brutality against his dear or loved ones is death which his wife personally dishes out. Her mind is sunk low that the only reasonably punishment for her bully is death. Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus consequently warns that brutality should not be celebrated as a virtue in the pursuit of obedience and compliance. Sophia O. Ogwude notes that Adichie leaves readers speechless, “at the degree of Eugene’s in humanity of others under the pretext of religious zealousness” (116). Eugene acts under the impulse of religion but his extremism portrays him as a religious catalyst whose reaction is corrosive to people around.<br/>    Sonika Sethi looks at the shift in generations that Adichie captures in the novel. The old orders are crumbling fast and the new generation people find it difficult to accept existing state of affairs, that is, the status quo. This gives rise to the issue of tradition and modernity in the novel. Sethi notes that:<br/>The unprecedented maturity in handling the theme of tradition versus modernity in her debut novel makes Adichie a novelist par excellence. Purple Hibiscus not only depicts the strife between modernity and tradition but also dares to take up the conflict that clogged the minds of thousands of Nigerians in the times of newly acquired independence.  Transition is never an essay process and Adichie has aptly demonstrated the fact through her characters belonging to three generations. The story in a way reminds the reader of Achebe’s Things Fall Apart which is an excruciating tale of the members of a society who once stood together like a rock to preserve their culture but fall apart under the influence of powerful external force that targets the younger generation. The struggle between old beliefs and new religion is apparent in Purple Hibiscus.(web)<br/>Without doubt, there are series of contention in Purple Hibiscus and this is due to the failure of one party to yield to the other one. Papa, that is uncle Eugene holds a dangerous opinion about his religion where as his son Jaja does not buy his extremist ideas. His mother endures it a while and his sister also manages to bear it. Jaja does not so he confronts his father. This perhaps triggers Mama who eventually kills her wicked husband. Davin Stevens posits that, “the conflict between rebellion and obedience is also prevalent in Adichie’s novel Purple Hibiscus” (Web). Jaja’s father is very strict and brutal therefore he expects members of his family to be submissive to his authority. His highhandedness however makes kambili to be a recluse and Jaja a rebel. Stevens concludes that, “authority and rebellion constitute a lifelong struggle in Africa” (Web). This claim is true when placed side by side with Nigerian socio-political landscape. There are children-parents conflict and citizens-government conflict as well. <br/>    J.E. Akung and A. Iloeje look at Kaine Agary’s Yellow Yellow from the point view of ecology and social collapse. There is a constant fall in the state of the earth and this partly blamed on human activities which has degraded the face of the earth. J.E. Akung and A. Iloeje write that: <br/>The novel explores the socio-cultural effects of oil exploration on ecology. It examines the effects of coastal communities in contact with the sea in the Niger-Delta. Some of these include what Kaine Agary calls, “Born troway”, “African profits”, “father unknown”, “Ashawo-pickin.” Zilayefa the heroine of the novel is a product of one of such contacts. The bulk of some of these contacts makes up for the tendency towards criminality in the Niger-Delta region in addition to poor leadership at all levels of governance. (Web)<br/> the novel projects most of the social challenges that make life unbearable for those who live along the coasts and creeks of Niger-Delta. Apart from the natural disasters they face due to oil exploration, there are many man-made social problems which have reduced the inhabitants’ human dignity. E.D. Simon in his own analysis of Yellow Yellow argues that:<br/>Saro Wiwa’s fight for social justice and minority rights has made him a man of the people. That he was able to mobilise and draw attention, locally and internationally to the plight of his people marked him out as one of the greatest activist of our time. Kaine Agary’s novel, Yellow-Yellow situates itself within the Niger Delta discourse as well as the polemics surrounding the women in this region. Agary’s inspiration as a writer derives from Saro Wiwa’s commitment for social justice for the Ogoni people, who have been marginalised, deprived and exploited. Pushed to the wall, these people have no choice but to bounce back in order to force the government and indeed humanity to understand their predicament. This has led to untold violence: killing, maiming, gunrunning, destruction/vandalization of pipelines and recently kidnapping of foreigners and Nigerians for ransom. Young girls/women who cannot find jobs to do or education, find succour in the hands of foreigners who exploit their sexuality. The plight of women in the Niger Delta region is indeed pathetic. Agary’s Yellow-Yellow is a literary enterprise whose main thrust is to expose further the socio-economic predicament of the people as well as explore the debilitating effect of poverty on the feminine psyche.(157)<br/>Those in the Niger Delta region are exposed to effects of oil spillage besides the problem of unemployment has turn the youths into criminals and unrest almost become a daily affair there. Women and young girls engage in prostitution to survive hardship. According to the assertion of Beatrice Orife, “Yellow-Yellow, Destination Biafra and Condolences raised vital issues about the survival of man in a degraded environment; however, Agary’s ‘Yellow Yellow shows that the people of the oil rich Niger Delta region groan under the evil hands of the multinational that exploit the land, to the detriment of the people. She mirrors the disastrous effects, both human and environmental of oil exploration in the Niger Delta” (170). Those with money exploit the weak thereby creating different social problems in society.<br/>Most characters in Yellow Yellow lack basic education thus Bayo Ogunjimi indicts ignorance of the cause of the people’s plight.  He says that, Agary’s characters are depicted as ‘illiterate, gullible and rural, exploited because of conservative dogmatism and adherence to superstition” (85). Education is a vital too of emancipation but the characters in the novel seem to be less informed and this doubles their challenges. Precious Ona adds that “to Agary, the suffering is in two forms: the women suffer in the hands of the foreign oil expatriate and in the hands of local men who discriminate, subjugate and relegate them to the background. For the young girls in Agary’s fiction, the only escape is through prostitution. The hazards of prostitution are numerous. Apart from sexually transmitted diseases, the men abuse women physically or pushed objects like bottles into their privates as part of their fun” (35). The challenge of the novel’s heroine lays bare the fact that people in that region are endangered humans due to the endless hardship they go through. It is from this point of view that Ignatius Chukwumah studies the novel. According to Chukwumah in his comment on Yellow Yellow, he argues that  “Kaine Agary’s Yellow-Yellow is a literary enterprise whose main thrust is to expose further the socio-economic predicament of the people as well as to explore the debilitating effect of poverty on the feminine psyche” (2). The novel is therefore an embodiment of social problems in the novel.<br/>From the works seen so far on Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus and Agrary’s Yellow Yellow, none seems to have fully discussed their thematic thrusts nor given the novels’ narrative devices worthy attention. This essay therefore attempts a new study geared towards the study of narrative devices and thematic preoccupation in Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus and Agrary’s Yellow Yellow.<br/>1.6 Thesis Statement<br/>           This essay posits the thematic preoccupations in Chimmamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus as: high-handedness, rebellion, disintegration and the thematic preoccupations in Kaine Agrary’s Yellow Yellow as : environmental degradation, quest for economic survival and moral decadence through the use of suspense, point of view, symbolism and irony deployed in the narrative devices used in both in both novels.<br/><br/>\n\nTHEMATIC PREOCCUPATIONS AND NARRATIVE DEVICES IN CHIMMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE’S  PURPLE HIBISCUS AND KAINE AGRARY ’S YELLOW YELLOW<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THEMATIC PREOCCUPATIONS AND NARRATIVE DEVICES IN CHIMMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE’S  PURPLE HIBISCUS AND KAINE AGRARY ’S YELLOW YELLOW", "id": 202}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EPISTOLARY POETRY OF DENNIS BRUTUS<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0 Life and Works of Author    -    -    <br/>1.1    Purpose of Study-    -    -    -<br/>1.2    Scope of Study-    -    -    -    -    <br/>1.3    Methodology-    -    -    -<br/>1.4    Theoretical Background    -    -<br/>1.5  Review of Criticism    -    -<br/>1.6 Thesis Statement    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER TWO    <br/>Revelation of Hidden or Confidential Facts    -<br/>CHAPTERTHREE<br/>Expression of Isolation      -        <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>The Use of First Person Narrative Style -          <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>Depiction of Physical Distance -        -          <br/>CHAPTERSIX<br/>Conclusion    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>Works Cited    -<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    Life and Works of Author<br/>           Dennis Brutus was on 28th November 1924, at Salistury, Southern  Rhodesia, to South African parents. He died on 26th December 2009. Brutus was of indigenous Khoi, Dutch, French, English, German and Malaysian ancestry. At age four, his parents moved back home to Port Elizabeth and upon their return, Brutus was classified as a black under apartheid racial code.<br/>          Brutus graduated from the University of Fort Hare with BA honours in 1946. He taught English and Afrikaanss at different high schools in South Africa. At the height of his teaching career he was  dismissed for his open and direct  criticism of the apartheid system. He became a Professor Emeritus at the University of Pittsburge and this crowned his career as a teacher.<br/>He was a strong lover of sports and it was during his active involvement in it that he had a firsthand knowledge of apartheid. He learnt politics under the Trotskyist Movement and he joined many revolutionary groups. His activities against apartheid were second to none. He was banned from many public activities and his studies in Law at the University of Wiwaterand was stopped. He moved to England for further studies.<br/>A prolific poet, he has the following collections to his credit: Sirens, Knuckles and Boots ( 1963), Letters to Martha and Other Poems from a South African Prison (1968), Poems from Algiers (1970), A Simple Lust (1973), China Poems (African and Afro-American studies and Research Centre (1975), Stubborn Hope (1978), Salutes and Censures (1982), Airs &amp; Tributes (1989), Still the Sirens (1993), Remembering Soweto, ed. Lamont B. Steptoe (2004), Leafdrift, ed. Lamont B. Steptoe (2005), Poetry and Protest: A Dennis Brutus Reader (2006), It is The Constant Image Of Your Face: A Dennis Brutus Reader (2008). In 2007, Brutus was invited to be inducted into South African Hall of Fame but he turned the offer. In 2008, he received the Lifetime Honorary Award by South African Department of Arts and Culture.<br/>1.1 Purpose of Study<br/>    This essay examines the epistolary features of selected poems of Dennis Brutus.<br/>1.2 Scope of Study<br/>This essay is limited to Dennis Brutus’ Letters to Martha and other Poems from a South African Prison. The choice of this collection is based on the fact that it embodies the epistolary tradition.<br/>1.3 Methodology<br/>     This research uses quantitative method in its analysis. The epistolary features of selected poems from Dennis Brutus’ Letters to Martha from a South African Prison are studied. Each of the letters is read with emphasis on its epistolary characteristics. Articles in journals, books and internet based materials are used as secondary materials in this study.<br/>1.4 Theoretical Background<br/>Ernest-Samuel Gloria Chimeziem comments on the origin of the epistolary form thus: <br/>The epistolary form of prose narrative was first popularized in the 18th century by a European- Samuel Richardson, through his novel Pamela (1740). The narrative was well received that within a short time, it inspired several prose authors, prominent among whom are, Charlotte Lennox with her novel Herriot Stuart (1951).  And ToniasSmollet author of Humphrey Clinker (1771). In Africa, Senegalese born Mariama Ba popularized this narrative style with her 1980 Noma award winning novel, So Long a Letter. (99)<br/> The advancement of other modern style of writing has hindered the growth of epistolary narratives. Chimeziem contends that, ‘the dearth of epistolary narratives limits the appreciation and study of that form of prose narration’ (99). It is evident that writers do not really fancy this genre in the recent times and as a result, it is less common. The sharp decline in letter writing may be accountable for this.<br/>        According to Laura Patch, ‘the fictional epistolary novel is one in which the author conveys the study through documents. In the most traditional understanding, epistolary novels are series of letters’ (2). Writers of epistolary literature convey their messages through letters, that is, conversation and dialogue of characters are achieved through exchange of letters. Patch stresses that ‘most epistolary novels are love stories, emphasizing distance, confidentiality, and secrecy’ (11). Janet Gurkin Altman agrees that exchange of letters is the fundamental vehicles of epistolary narrative (48). To put it in another way, epistolary writers arrange series of letters to form the plot of their narratives. M.H. Abrams also supports Altman’s assertion when he says that ‘the narrative is conveyed entirely by an exchange of letters’ (228). Letter writing is therefore central to epistolary tradition.<br/>    In the understanding of some scholars the epistolary narrative has a feminine origin. In the opinion of Patch, ‘epistolary novels are a contradiction. They are considered the female genre because they are for women and presented in the feminine style of writing. The epistolary novel as a genre arose because women began to receive an education, and though it was still not completely acceptable, the most acceptable form of writing for a female was that letters’ (10).Without further consideration, it is straightforward that epistolary narratives use exchange of letters as mode of narration. Gabriella delLungoCamiciotti observes that ‘recently renewed scholarly interest in historical letter writing has given rise to several studies which explore the culture of the epistolary form, from different perspectives’ (17).The style of creating characters in epistolary literature drew the attention of Lisa Pearl, Kristine Lu, and AnoushehHaghighi. They note that deliberate differences in how authors represent characters have been a core area of literary investigation since the dawn of literary theory. Here we focus on epistolary literature, where authors consciously attempt to create different character styles through series of documents like letters’ (2). The character creation of epistolary narratives is not straight forwards since less information is given about characters. Only some of their traits are hinted.<br/>     Epistolary novels reflect the writer’s isolation. According to Elizabeth Campbell, ‘the letter writer in epistolary fiction is usually isolated’ (338). The far distance between two closed people causes isolation. This brings a psychological disturbance at time. By exchanging letters, these distant people try to bridge the gap between them. Their worries and loneliness are fully expressed. Compbell contends that writers of letters especially the lonely, ‘must speak to someone about their difficulties’ (338). An exchange of letters is therefore seen as a way of tackling distance problem or barrier in communication and relationship.<br/>    Gabriella Del LungoCamicioti believes in the fact that, ‘printed letter collections make private matters public’ (26). Camiciotti’s observation is relevant because printed letters truly ‘make private matters public’ (26). For instance, Brutus in his Letters to Martha from a South African Prison reveals the agonies, horrors and dehumanization that characterize prison life. Without being there, people in the outside world can still share the tribulations of those in prison. This is usually made possible through the personal letters of those in prisons. In the opinion of Katharine Basset Patterson, ‘the epistolary form reflects the context of social (public) interaction and codes of social behavior, what is said and the manner in which it is said’(24). This means that letters are revelatory in nature. Writers of letters write to express their confused or tensed feelings. What Patterson is saying is that letters are written to convey the thoughts of writers. <br/>1.5 Review of Criticism<br/>     Dennis Brutus is a vibrant activist who stands shoulder to shoulder against oppressors of black South Africans. According to an online source, YourDictionary.com:<br/>While he was in prison Brutus decided to stop writing this kind of poetry. The five months he spent in solitary confinement caused him to re-examine his verse and his attitudes toward creative self-expression, and he resolved thereafter to write simple, unornamented poetry that ordinary people could comprehend immediately. His Letters to Martha and Other Poems from a South African Prison (1968) contains brief, laconic statements deriving from his experiences as a prisoner. The diction is deliberately conversational and devoid of poetic devices. Instead of seeking to express two or three thoughts simultaneously, Brutus was strives to say only one thing at a time and to say it directly. (Web)<br/>This quotation simply explains why Brutus writes his letters without an elaborate language. As a poet who wants to be heard by many, Brutus uses a simple language to express his thoughts. He expresses his hatred for apartheid, a system that is built on segregation and discrimination. Victor Dlamini celebrates Brutus for using ‘his incisively eloquent views to oppose tyranny and injustice wherever they occur in the world’ (2). Art and society are intertwined so Brutus through his poetry seeks justice and freedom from powerful forces or agents of apartheid. He engages his creativity in search of freedom for the helpless blacks in his terrorized country.  Joy M. Etiowo posits that Brutus inspires revolutionary poets in Africa. Etiowo’s assertion reads that ‘what Brutus inspires in these poets is vision, is resilience, is the fact that poetry can be put to use against the forces of evil’ (117). Brutus and other South Africa Writers dismantled apartheid with their incendiary write-ups. KonteinTrinya acknowledges the relevance of Brutus’ poetry when he says that ‘poetry provided the prominent platform which Dennis Brutus staged his agitation against oppression’ (2). Brutus uses his poetry as a satirical weapon to fight injustice and oppression embedded in apartheid. Poetry, to Brutus, is not an expression of merriment but a literary weapon for fighting social ills structural injustice. Brutus has the vision of a good society in mind so he speaks against oppression wherever it is perceived. Emmanuel IkechukwuAsika posits, that ‘Brutus is among poets referred to as alternative poets whose poetry sought to speak to ordinary man’ (101).  The plights of the masses are the burdens on Brutus’ shoulders. He fights to see South Africa set free from oppression and tyranny. This makes Brutus a selfless leader. Halize Van Vuuren concludes that Brutus’ style of poetry ‘foregrounds disintegration of the self or depersonalisation’ (44). Brutus is a simple activist who sacrifices his life for the liberation of the oppressed apartheid infested South Africa. ChidiAmuta acknowledges his selfless services thus, ‘poets have often found themselves fighting on the side of the people. This is why poets as diverse in nationality and outlook as Christopher Caudwell, John Corford, Louis Aragon, Christopher Okigbo, Maxim Gorky and Denks Brutus have dedicated their art and sometimes their lives to the pursuit of freedom’ (177). Brutus fights for a free society where everyone will be equal before the law. This is the beauty of his write-ups. He writes poetry with revolutionary impulses and through this, the oppressed are awoken from their depressed state. Amuta strongly believes that Brutus is a good example of Marxist poet who quests for freedom. B. Sanchez says that Brutus is a courageous freedom fighter who ‘devoted his life and art to opposing apartheid in South Africa’ (Web). Abrian Roscoe shares this opinion when he says that Brutus ‘identified himself and his community with this rubbish. He and his people are the cast-offs of South African society’ (30). He readily identifies with the oppressed. KonteinTrinya says, ‘Dennis Brutus’ rhythms have remained fresh now as then under the shadows of apartheid. The enduring appeal of his poetry is a testimony to its beauty over and above the duties that had midwifed it, it is the lasting relevance of good painting- the classic painting of a social landscape on the canvas of art’ (6). Brutus composes his revolutionary poems with a dignified language that soothes the painful experiences of the downtrodden. John Lent says that, ‘by manipulating us into psychological realities through such vivid images of landscape in this way, I believe Brutus succeeds in forcing the love and horror in his homeland out into the relief of our own consciousness’ (110). In other words, Brutus uses a compelling language to engage his readers’ attention.<br/>According to Trinya, people especially the down trodden admire Brutus because ‘Brutus does not shy away from social responsibility in his poetry’ (1). This is truly praiseworthy. Lee Sustar and Aisha Karim are of the opinion that ‘Brutus’s poetry is representative of contemporary third world writing. If there is a generalization that can be made about such literature, it is that its creation is itself a political act. And Brutus belongs to that tradition of contemporary third world writers whose writings have consciously grappled with the inescapably political nature of such literature’ (12). For a long time, third world countries are kept in perpetual darkness by foreign lords who exploit them. Their evil enterprise is achieved mostly through selfish political institutions. Brutus sees political institutions as the target of his revolutionary poetry. One of such political institutions Brutus fights is apartheid. He clamps down on all forms of injustice and oppression that keep his people under the yoke of apartheid.<br/>Africa is blessed with natural resources which attracted the white to the continent. Their presence has introduced injustice, oppression, exploitation across Africa. These socio-political vices are responsible for leadership problem Africans endure. Etiowo makes a comparison between the plights of South Africans, and Niger Deltans. In her articulation, she asserts that<br/>While Brutus’ poetry is affected by the unjust apartheid system, the poetic imagination of the Nigerian poet Obi, (2006) is fuelled by the injustice experienced by her people of Nigeria’s Niger Delta region as a result of the discovery of oil in that regions. Just like gold and other minerals in South Africa encouraged the hold to power and oppression by the whites and the debasement of the black in South Africa, so does the presence of crude oil accentuate the environmental degradation of the Niger Delta by multinational oil companies who represent political and economic cartels of the world. (119)<br/>In his articulation, Etiowo reasons that Brutus and Obi fight not just oppression and deprivation but the imperialists whose selfish multinational cartels represent dangers in Africa. Etiowo notes that, Brutus ‘was a fierce voice against oppression of any kind, and one of his tools is poetry’ (117). Brutus is fearless, and his audacious postures often put fear into the authority that promotes apartheid. Through his write ups, he has been able to suppress the injustices and oppressions the blacks face in Africa. Consequently, he is a savior to the oppressed in South Africa. <br/>    So far, we have explored critical comments on Brutus and his works. From all these comments it undeniable that Brutus is a man of his people. With his relentless effort, he fights the menace called apartheid. Many works have been done on Brutus’ poetry, however, nothing is found on his poetry dealing with epistolary literature. This study attempts to explore the characteristics of epistolary literature in selected poems in his collection, Letters to Martha from a South African Prison.<br/>1.6 Thesis Statement<br/>This essay posits that the revelation of confidential facts, depiction of physical distance, expression of isolation and the use of the first person point of view are the characteristics of the epistolary tradition in Dennis Brutus’ Letters to Martha from a South African Prison.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE EPISTOLARY POETRY OF DENNIS BRUTUS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EPISTOLARY POETRY OF DENNIS BRUTUS", "id": 203}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PROBLEMS OF CULTURAL DIVERSITY AMONG THE URHOBOS</b><br/><b>TABLE CONTENTS</b><br/>Chapter One: Background to the Study<br/>Introduction<br/>Aim and Objectives of the Study<br/>Significance of Study<br/>Scope of the Study<br/>Methodology<br/>Literature Review<br/>Endnotes<br/>Chapter Two: Traditions of Origin of the Urhobo Clans<br/>Introduction<br/>Traditions of Origins/Migration<br/>Royal Titles and Royal Salutations<br/>Endnotes<br/>Chapter Three: Cultural Diversity Among the Urhobos<br/>Introduction<br/>Marriage<br/>Language<br/>Pattern of dressing<br/>Men’s Dressing<br/>Young girls<br/>Women<br/>Other Cultural Practices<br/>Problems of Cultural Diversity among the Urhobos<br/>Endnotes<br/>Chapter Four: Conclusion<br/>Bibliography<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>Introduction    <br/>The Urhobo are people of southern Nigeria near thenorth western Niger Delta. Urhobo is the major ethic group in Delta state. The term Urhobo is used to describe all the land marks and indigenes of the settlement covering delta central and part of south senatorial district (Warri main town)1. The Urhobos speaks the Urhobo language. The Urhobos comprise of twenty two (22) kingdoms or clan and now twenty  three(23)  although some writerssay they are twenty five (25).The various kingdoms that makes up the Urhobo have always lived  together as one people but some problems are likely to arise from the differences in the cultures of these various kingdom, their stories of migration, religion, marriage, dressing, linguistics dialects. <br/>    The Urhobos live in a territory bounded bylatitudes 60 and50, 150 North and longitudes50, 400 and60, 250East in the Delta state of nigeria2. Their neighbors are the Bini(s)to thenorth,Ijaw to the south,the Itsekiri to the West,  the  Ukwani’s  to  the North East, and the Isoko  to the  South East. It covers a total area of about 2,000 square miles. The Urhobo nations is the largest and most populated ethnic group in Delta state and the fifth (5th) largest nation in Nigeria.3<br/>    Peter P. Ekeh, founder ofUrhobo historical society wrote in his book, Studies in Urhobo Culture, that “Urhobo is physically embedded in the Atlantic forest belt that stretches from Senegal in West Africa to Angola in central Africa. Historically, the region was the most prestine in all of Africa. Historically the Portuguese  Burst into its territories. In the late 15th century, its forest people cultivated their own form of civilization untouched by outside influences. A bulk of the Urhobo people reside in the southwestern states of Delta and Bayelsa state in Nigeria, also referred to as the Niger Delta. Many live in small and major cities in regions and local government areas in Ughelli, Warri, Ethiope Okpe and Sapele. Some major cities and towns include, Okparabe, Arhavwarien, Warri, Sapele,Abraka, Ughelli, Effrun, Aladja, Ovwian, Orerokpe, Amukpe, Okpara-inland, Egini, Kokori, Kiagbodo, Isiokoro, Jesse, Ogharaefe, Effrun - otor, Ewu, Jeremi, Emadadja, Okwagbe, Ovu, Orogun Owawha, Otogor, Edjekota-ogor, Ofone, Otor-udu, Ekpan, Jeddo, Uwheru, Orhuwhorun e.t.c.Local government areas where Urhobo traditional  homes are located in Delta state are; Ethiope East and west,Okpe, Sapele, Udu, Ughelli North ad Ughelli South, Uvwie and Warri South.<br/>    The Urhobo have four (4) main traditions of origin. The Autochthony, Tradition of migration from an original Edo territory. Tradition of origin from ife and the tradition of origin that link the Urhobos with the Sudan and Egypt4. The Tradition of migration from Benin is the most accepted tradition of origin among the Urhobos. The Tradition says that the Urhobos migrated from an Edo territory around where  the  ancient  towns  of  Udo  and  Benin are  currently located. The geographical characteristics and natural resources played an important role in the migration history of the Urhobos. At the end of the Ogiso  dynasty, many Urhobos and other Edo groups left Udo in different directions, Each at its own pace in search of more peaceful and economical territories.The Urhobos left under separate leaders in different directions and at different developmental stages, during different periods. When some of the emigrants left Benin, they found in their destinations in Urhobo territory some Edo speaking settlers. The Urhobo claim theycame from Benin but they were not bini people who turned to be Urhobo on reaching their territories, instead, they assert that they were already Urhobo before they left Benin.<br/>There are various dialect among the Urhobo groups. The various dialects found among the Urhobo like the okpe, uvwie and orogun exclusive other languages, (okpe, uvwie and orogun speakUrhobo) are examples of internal identities within the Urhobo socio-cultural unit5.The Urhobo group settled in their various territories at different time ranging widely between 200 years and 2,000years ago. No one Urhobo unit conquered the other to impose a centralized government, Instead each group settled unto itself. It is perhaps partly as a result of the separatist settlement and the wide differences in the times and routes of migrations that the okpe, uvwie and orogun developed and retained their language distinctions while others had quite prominent dialects of the Urhobo language6. Among the twenty five (25) kingdom/clans of Urhobo are,<br/>S/N    Name of Clan<br/>1    Abraka Clan    <br/>2    Agbarha-Otor Clan<br/>3    Agbarha-Warri Clan<br/>4    Agbarho  Clan<br/>5    Agbon Clan<br/>6    Arhavwarien Clan.<br/>7    Eghwu Clan<br/>8    Orogun Clan<br/>9    Okpe Clan<br/>    Sources;D.E. Egere, The Urhobo People and the Dynasty7<br/>Okpe kingdom is the largest of all Urhobo politics. It is the largest kingdom of the Urhobo Nation. The river Ethiope separates okpe territory from that of Oghara and Idjerhe. Okpe land of Urhobo stretches from the river Ethiope on the Northside to Uvwie clan in the south and from Agbon and Agbarho clans westwards to the sea. The okpe people are the descendants of the four princely brothers namely, Orhue, Orhoro, Evbreke and Esezi whose ancestors migrated from benin about 1170 AD.8<br/>There are various cultures that exist among the Urhobo clans, although these differences are not so much some of these differences can be seen in the migration story of the various clans, their dressings, their religious belief and festivals and even their dialects. Some of these differences have in recent time brought about some problems which shall be evaluated in this essay. <br/>Aim and Objectives of the Study<br/>The aim of the study is to examine problems of cultural diversity among the Urhobos. The specific objectives include: <br/>To examine the traditions of origin of the Urhobos.<br/>To examine the various cultural aspects of the Urhobos.<br/>To examine the challenges facing Urhobo culture.<br/>To highlight the integrative role of Urhobo culture .<br/>Significance of the Study.<br/>The importance of this study is to identify the Urhobo people  in general, the various clans / kingdom that make up the Urhobo Nation, the diverse culture that exist among the various Urhobo groups and the problems of these diverse culture in the Urhobo society today. <br/>Scope of the Study.<br/>The scope of this work covers the history and cultural diversity among the Urhobos in the pre-colonial times.<br/>Methodology.<br/>In writing this long essay, primary and secondary methods of gathering materials will be adopted.

The primary texts are analyzed based on the researcher’s knowledge and secondary material sourced from academic journals, text books, and the internet.<br/>1.4 Theoretical background<br/>Rebellion<br/>This essays adopts the concepts of rebellion in an effort to enrich of this study’s review of literature. Aya Mohammmed Kassasbeh defines Rebellion as:<br/>a social phenomenon that has been known since ancient times which often leads to changes in the political and social structures. It can be defined as a sudden and substantive change or a material change to any predominant system. The concept of rebellion varies from one person to another. (1)<br/>Kassasbeh’s definition of rebellion is apt in that it embraces all the scope of rebellion and highlights on the primary goals of rebellion which are to express dissatisfaction and effect necessary change. Kassasbeh states again that, “rebellion has been associated with literature because literature is the only outlet to express what is going on inside human beings. In any literary work, there is a very great ability in providing the reader with feelings and sentiments that help him/her to come to terms with a period full of social and intellectual contradiction and challenge” (1-2). Much as the researcher agrees that literature is one of the modes of expressing dissatisfactions, the researcher disagree with kassasbeh that “literature is the only outlet to express what is going on inside human beings. ”  There are other outlets like guerrilla warfare, street protest and the deployment of satirical music. Literature only enables writers to freely express their annoyance in different ways that suit their taste, that is, by a way of direct or indirect satire or allegory.<br/>     Rebellion is a stiff resistance of authoritative domination or suppression of people’s rights. People with radical minds hate whatever can hinder their freedom and happiness. In most cases, rebellion leads to a forcible overthrow of a social or political order. Literature is one of the modes of seeking freedom and people across the world have often engaged it in their quest for emancipation. This is the very reason we have protest or revolutionary literature. Drama is a foremost genre of literature which has been at the forefront of struggles to liberate individuals and society from domination and suppression. Chidi Amuta write that:<br/>the rise of revolutionary drama in a given society requires the existence of social, economic and political situations requiring revolutionary intervention. But more than the other forms and perhaps only to poetry, drama is very amenable to revolutionary expression and can become very instrumental to revolutionary situations for reasons that are intrinsic to the nature of both drama and revolution. (155-156)<br/>In agreement with the above assertion, literature gives room to activists to express their dissatisfactions therefore it is highly instrumental in the quest for emancipation. This assertion finds a place in Oyedepo’s The Rebellion of the Bumpy-Chested and Graft’s Sons and Daughters. The two revolutionary plays seek freedom for oppressed children and wives. The aggrieved wives fight their husbands to a standstill and the non-conformist children dare their parents. Rebellion against a domineering authority often leads to revolution either on a small or large scale.<br/>Amuta defines revolution as, “a collective activist phenomenon with far reaching implications for social political and cultural lives of society” (156). As noticed in the plays under this study, the homes of the characters experience different degrees of crises which take away their happiness and unity.<br/>    Rebellion, revolt, resistance and insurgency share similar ideology which is to effect change in a given society where there are restrictions and suppression of human rights. I . S.  Ogundiya writes that:<br/>An insurgency is an armed rebellion against a constituted authority (for example, an authority recognized as such by the United Nations) when those taking part in the rebellion are not recognized as belligerents. While the goals of the rebels, and insurgents and terrorist may be similar, perhaps the distinguished features are: the nature and intensity of the agitation, method and strategy of pursuing the grievances. (26)<br/>The activities of women under Captain Sharp in The Rebellion of the Bumpy chested portray them as insurgents who fight to have their rights as wives protested from the grip of patriarchy. Patriarchy is an aged long institution which has played a key role in the stratification of society. For example, men are often considered heads therefore patriarchy puts them first when decisions are to be taken. In homes, offices, religions gatherings and in the political terrains, men seem to dominate their female counterparts. Radical wives with reckless id however fight to undo the influence of patriarchy.<br/>    Rebellion always arises where one generation stands to resist the influence of the other. Prior to the composition of The Rebellion of the Bumpy chested and Sons and Daughters, wives and children have obeyed patriarchal authority with less resistance. In the 20th century, resistance of the old order gains ground thus wives revolt against husbands and children kick against their parents. Transition from one generation to the other is hardly taken or tolerated without confrontation. Sonika Sethi argues that, “transition is never an easy process and Adichie has aptly demonstrated the fact through her characters belonging to three generations” (Web). Like     Graft and Oyedepo, Adichie presents a wife and children who fight against patriarchal and all forms of suppression. The revolutionary actions of characters in the plays under study shows that new generation lays the old aside in order to fashion out a new order that will suit modern life. Sons and Daughters and The Rebellion of the Bumpy Chested are classic examples of literature of revolt. kassasbeh writes that:<br/>Literature of revolt was known in many civilizations and cultures, such as the French, German, British, American and even Arab. This type of literature does not appear vainly, but it appears for several reasons among these reasons is the existence of social and political contradiction between the dictates of the authority and the aspirations and dreams of people. (2)<br/> Literature of revolt seeks to overthrow an old order with the view to establishing new ones. The temperament of individuals is controlled by the interrelationship between the id, ego and superego. Rebellion or revolt is inevitable if the id dominates the influence of the ego and superego which ensure that everybody maintains moderation and orderliness. <br/>This study employs Sigmund Freud’s Psychological criticism to understand how the human mind (Psyche) provokes reactions towards oppression persecution and undue limitation human rights and freedom. Commenting on the psychological criticism, M.H. Abrams writes that it is a literary theory which “deals with a work of literature primary as an expression in an indirect and fictional form of the state of mind and the structure of personality of the individual author” (289). Writers compose their works from the recess, that is, inner part of their minds. The contents of their minds are expressed through characters who they craft to pass their messages across to readers or audience. Abrams asserts that:<br/>also present in the unconscious of every individual, according to Freud, are residual traced of prior stages of psychosexual development from earlier infancy on ward, which have been out grown, but remain as “fixations” in the unconscious of the adult. When triggered by some later event in adult life, a repressed wish is revived and motivates a fantasy, in disguised form of a satisfaction that is modeled on the way that the wish had been gratified in infancy or early childhood, the chief enterprise  of the psychoanalytic critic, in a way that parallels the enterprises of the psychoanalyst as a therapist, is to decipher the true content, and thereby to explain the emotional effects on the reader, of a literary work by translating its manifest elements into the latent, unconscious determinants that constitute their real but repressed meaning. (291)<br/>The mind is the seat of man’s reasoning which produces physical actions that are displayed in individuals conducts. The mind is the faculty of man’s reasoning and thoughts. This psychological study of characters in Draft’s Son and Daughters  and Oyedepo’s The Rebellion of the Bumpy Chested  explores how their actions reveal the contents of their minds. Humans react differently to situations that confront them and this is based on the components of individual’s mind. Charles E. Bressler writes that “Freud developed various models of human psyche, which became the changing bases of his psychoanalytic theory and his practice. Early in his career, he posited the dynamic model, asserting that our minds are a dichotomy consisting of the conscious (the rational) and the unconscious (the irrational)” (121). The unconscious part of the human mind takes note of happening in the physical world and registers such happenings. As stated above, the unconscious part of our mind prompts humans to take actions about happenings that affect them negatively. That is why it is called the “irrational” part of the human psyche. Bressler observes that “Freud is the first to suggest that it is the unconscious, not the conscious, that governs a large part of our actions” (121). If this assertion is applied to the characters in Oyedepo’s The Rebellion of the Bumpy chested and Graft‘s   Sons and Daughters, it will be revealed that the irrational part of their minds is fully awake. They resist what their psyche (the unconscious) perceives as injustice, oppression and inhibition. The actions of the female characters in The Rebellion of the Bumpy chested goes beyond the tenets of feminism. Feminism encourages all oppressed women to stand up against whatever is responsible for their suppression but it is noticed that some women ignore this clarion call while others fervently quest for their freedom. They fight very hard to undo the burden patriarchy places on them. The difference between the first and second set of women lies in their minds’ psychological makeup. This is well elaborated in Freud’s tripartite model. Bressler whose study is based on this model writes that the “model divides the psyche into three parts; the id, the ego and the superego” (123). These three psychological components govern human beings’ actions and inactions. Simply put, they act inter independently and influence or control the actions. Ann B Dobie commenting on the id writes that:<br/>the Id, which is the repository of the libido, the source of our psychic energy and our psychosexual desires, gives us our vitality. Because it is always trying to satisfy its hunger for pleasure, it operates without any thought of consequences, anxiety, ethic, logic, precaution, or morality. Demanding swift satisfaction and fulfillment of biological desires, it is lawless, asocial, amoral. As Freud describes it, it is “only a striving to bring about the satisfaction of the instinctual needs subject to the observance of the pleasure principle. (51)<br/>This part of the mind is highly irrational because it does not think twice before it propels humans to spring into action. It is aggressive thus it explains why a wife or a child may go against societal ethic or belief. Bressler supports Dobbie’s assertion about the id when he says that “containing our secret desire, our darkest wishes, and our most intense fear, the id wishes only to fulfill the urge of the pleasure principle and “unchecked by any controlling will, the id operates on impulse, wanting immediate satisfaction for all its instinctual desires” (123). Characters created by authors are given life which enables them to act as real humans. Most of the characters in the primary texts for this study have “secret desires” and “dark wishes” which manifest in their aggressive actions. Some of the wives kick against patriarchal norms to assert their individual rights and some of the children obstinately refute their parents’ high handedness. In other words, the act of resistance springs from the irrational part of the minds which the id stands for. Dobbie says that, “obviously the id can be a socially destructive force. Unrestrained, it will aggressively seek to gratify its desire without any concern for law, customs, or values. It can even be self-destructive in its drive to have what it wants” (51). This claim is valid because some of the characters studied in this essay do not care if they lose their marriage. The children examined also go against their parents’ control to assert their freedom of will.  What all these characters crave for is the satisfaction of their own desires which is guided by their id.<br/>    The ego is another part of the mind which acts to put the id under control. Bressler states that:<br/>the second part of the psyche Freud names the ego, the rational logical, waking part of the mind, although many of its activities remain in the unconscious. Whereas the id operates according to the pleasure principle, the ego operates in harmony with the reality principle. It is the ego’s job to regulate the intitule desires of the id and to allow these desires to be released in some non-destructive way. (123)<br/>Human minds under the control of the id is reckless despite societal regulations. There are non-conformists who act in contrast to societal values and laws. The ego, however, restrains their id such that most of its destructive actions are checked to avoid chaos in society. Societies have norms, rules and regulations governing the lives and conducts of people. For instance, most African societies favour patriarchy. It is, however, noticed that sometimes some people go against norms put in place to guide conducts in such societies Each human is endowed with psychological trait which is responsible for his or her actions taken in the face of any difficulty. Edward H. Strauch says, “that man is born with certain patterns of perceiving, feeling and thinking which individual experiences actualize” (99). Society expects individuals to conform to its norms but individuals with unrestrained id do things in their own way. Some of the wives in The Rebellion of the Bumpy Chested fit into this category and some children in Sons and Daughters show that they have “certain patterns of perceiving” life different from their parents.<br/>    There is a close relationship between the id and ego in relation to how man relates to his society. Strauch notes this when he says that the ego resembles what Carl Jung calls “persona.” According to strauch, “Jung also singles out the persona, which is a mask the individual wears in response to social convention and ethnic tradition. In contrast to one’s private individuality, the persona is the public personality and this persona grows out of the dominant archetype in one’s nature” (99). The ego in the mind of every one censors the actions of the id so as to prevent acts that are capable of sniffling life out of the smooth conduct of society. Some children as well as some wives in the plays used for this study do not rebel against their parents and husbands. Their reactions towards what they face show that their ego has strong domination over their id. It can be inferred that the ego makes people conservative and tolerant. In other words, a wife who is submissive and a child who has regards for his or her parent’s wishes have ego which enable them to tolerate others. They do not have aggressive mind set, that is, id which encourages rebellion.<br/>    The superego is the third part of the tripartite model and it reinforces the activity of the ego which is to regulate the possible recklessness of the id. Dobie states that the superego:<br/>provides additional balance to the id, for it furnishes a sense of guilt for behavior that breaks the rules given by parents to the young child. Similar to what is commonly known as one’s conscience, it operates according to the morality principle, for it provides the sense of moral and ethical wrongdoing. Although parents, who enforce their values through punishments and rewards are the chief source of the superego, it is expanded by institutions and other influences later in life. (51-52)<br/>Dobie’s assertion really touches the core of this study. She mentions parent-children relationship which is pertinent to Graft’s Sons and Daughters. Parents are the first contact children have before they mix up with people and institutions in the larger society. They help children bring out their superego to the fore. M. H. Abrams writes that the superego is responsible for “the internalization of social standards of morality and propriety” (290). The superego creates a balance between individuals and society so as to ensure harmony. That is why parents tend to groom children to meet societal standards. Society for example expects every child to be law abiding otherwise upbringing given by parents will be blamed.<br/>    The psychological criticism is applied in this study to help the researcher understand why some children are rebellious and others are cool headed thus they obey their parents’ wishes. This is also applicable to wives who also confront their husbands’ patriarchal power. This study explores the parts of characters’ minds which propel them to take actions at every given time. Their id has been identified as responsible for the processing and governing of their feelings and emotion resulting in attitudes and actions display at every given time. Put in another way, the mind is responsible for the daring quest of radical feminists like some wives depicted in Oyedepo’s The Rebellion of the Bumpy Chested. Moreover, it is responsible for the juvenile delinquency of some of the children presented in Graft’s Sons and Daughters. Leaning on Freud’s tripartite model which comprises of the id, ego and superego, this study examines how the mind informs some of these characters’ resistance as depicted in the primary texts.<br/>1.5 Review of Scholarship <br/>    Oyedepo’s The Rebellion of the Bumpy Chested has attracted comments from different critics. One of them is Iyabode Omolara Daniel. She examines the play from a linguistic point of view. She states:<br/>Oyedepo succeeds in presenting a larger than life portrait of captain sharp. She also suggests that women can effectively organize themselves politically; the characters completely destabilize the status quo. Captain Ara sharp’s tactics of achieving her political goal are presented as questionable. In relation to the male characters the characters become empowered, both psychologically and physically; but in relation to their leader, this reality does not hold: they remain powerless. Captain sharp succeeded in excerting influence and power through language but achieves the state of affairs that she fought against; women without power. (99)<br/>Language is a powerful tool in which people shape and re-shape their world. Oyedepo is of the opinion that language is vital in negotiating equality with men, hence, she portrays Captain Sharp as eloquent. As noted by Daniel, the play emphasizes the power of language in the quest for emancipation.  Captain Sharp becomes fierce and she encourages her comrades to follow suit. This results in a violent confrontation. Some critics of radical feminism however condemns the use of force either verbal or non-verbal.  In his own assertion, John Yeseibo says that:<br/>the play addresses key gender issues such as bride wealth and basically challenge institutionalized male monopoly of leadership in political sheres and the need to reverse this trend. As an African feminist guided by its basic tenets, Stella Oyedepo believes that the liberation of me is a necessary condition in redressing the marginalization of women. She is of the unswerving view that rabid radical feminism in the Nigerian cultural context will not be able to ameliorate the denigrating status of women in society. This view she has demonstrated in The Rebellion of the Bumpy Chested. She therefore advances complementarity as the panacea for socio-political – economic transformation through the world of play. (4)<br/>Yeseibo strongly condemns Captain Sharp’s approach to women liberation because it is alien to African culture. He believes that radical feminism is not the right approach to women’s emancipation because it creates chaos and destabilization in society. Women in the play quest for liberation that will guarantee them equal right with men. To achieve this, Yeseibo notices that, “Sharp undertakes an indoctrination of the other female rebels in the play who effect the ideology of revolt in their homes” (2). Rather than making women responsible, radical feminism transforms them into revolutionaries. This is true and valid when viewed from African perspective. There will be no peace in any family where the husband and wife engage in daily confrontation. <br/>    Society has many male oriented institutions which raise men’s ego. In another article, Yeseibo identifies patriarchy as the source of women’s suppression and limitation. He states that, “Clem and James tried to reduce a woman to a mere property. It is because of these perceived difference towards women that, according to sharp, the B.C.M “aims at the emancipation of women form the oppressive domination of the men” (p.73). she therefore vows to attack this patriarchal order that creates gender imbalance between the sexes” (142) for a long time, human societies have evolved and revolved but the idea that men is superior to women seems to  wax stronger daily.<br/>Men project patriarchal ideology thus they are the target of women who aim to dismantle all forms of restriction which men symbolize. Osita C .Ezen Wanebe states:<br/>Stella Oyedepo’s The Rebellion of the Bumpy-chested (2002) is a farcial representation of all that radical feminism stand for. Ms. Ara Sharp, who chooses to remain single, gather women in a sisterhood spirit and forms a women liberation movement, Bumpy Chested Movement (BCM), aimed at the emancipation of women from the oppressive domination of men. The first enemy mapped out for attack and overthrow is the man, especially the husband of the members. (186)<br/>While some of the BCM members have husbands, Ara Sharp the captain of the group does not have any. She considers herself too supreme for any man to possess as mere property. Some who agree to marry do not allow their husbands to exhibit any form of patriarchy. This creates tension in most of their homes. Ostia does not support this because marriage is not a bed of roses however it should not be a thorn in the flesh of couples. Those who fight for supremacy must put the interest of their marriage above individual interest.<br/>    African especially the women are peaceful and submissive hence most African women opt for conservative feminism. On the other hand, some women drum support for radical feminism.  The African conservative feminists and radical feminists cause division in the concept of feminism as practice in Africa. Benedict Binebia lists Oyedepo’s The Rebellion of the Bumpy –Chested as one of the such plays. In his assertion, Binebai says that:<br/>Some African dramatists have written plays in which The Wives Revolt by J.P Clark; Our Husband Has Gone Mad Again Rebellion of the Bumpy-Chested by Stella Oyedepo, Mulkin Matta by Harghar, Beyond Nightmar by Ben Binebai and Dance on His Grace by Barclars Ayakoroma. But in some play texts written by women, women seem to be divided. Julie Okoh’s Edewede, Mask,  Zulu  Sofolo’s  Wedlock of the Gods. This points to the fact that the women’s house of feminism is divided one. (148)<br/>Binebai sees series of confusion in feminist quest and this observation is apt. Different women pursue feminism from different directions. Binebai’s observation is affirmed by E.B. Adeleke when he says that: <br/>the army of wives, led by captain Sharp in The Rebellion, unanimously identify the enemy as man, specifically the husbands of member irrespective of whether the man is guilty or not. Jointly, they map out strategies not only to dethrone the man, but to take over his oppressive roles. These women entertain no alternative other than the total uprooting and reconstruction of social structures. Differences in cultural context, individual situations, and mitigating circumstances are not taken into consideration. The reader witnesses an unreasonable bandwagon effect which has given rise to unfavourable view of Femi in spite of the fact that history and literature provide ample evidence of the woman’s oppression and subjugation, particularly in patriarchal social system. (129)<br/>Women are human beings who deserve to be respected or whose rights ought to be regarded as those of men. Much as it is important for women to fight and protect their rights, they must not throw society into confusion. This is the take of Adeleke and Binebai. They agree that men have structured society to favour themselves, however, they do not endorse women’s radical ideology which has tainted the feminist quest in Africa. Oyedepo’s The Rebellion of a Bumpy-Chested preaches radical feminism which makes it a favourite of most women. Male critics in contrast condemns it because it is seen as a negative influence on women. Sincerely, the quest for individual right must not create disharmony.<br/>    Eli Dokosi is his criticism of Graft’s Sons and Daughters notes that the playwright presents two generations caught up in a tussle of supremacy of view about life and career. He writes that:<br/>in a typical African setting, elders are not to be challenged, more so when it comes to choices for their wards. James Osofu, father to Aaron Osofu and Maanan, believes education is pivotal to success and wealth as he will do his maximum best to educate his children in the best of schools and choose their profession for them even if they rather prefer some “lowly” and “useless” profession.<br/>Mr James Osofu expects his authority not to be questioned and wants his children to appreciate the sacrifices he makes for their education as his elder sons George the doctor and Kofi the chartered accountant seem to make him think, instead of the radical and non-conformist duo. Of Aaron and Maanan his youngest children. (Web)<br/>Sons and Daughters presents family conflict between father and children who see life differently. Aaron and Maanan are James Osofu’s children who think independently. In contrast to their elder ones who gladly pursue the careers chosen for them by their father, Aaron and Maanan kick against their father’s choice of career because they have a mind which affords them independent reasoning.<br/>Dokosi observes that there is a contrast between the older and the younger generation. The play, Son and Daughters also illustrates the evolution of a radical society from a conservative once. Dokosi concludes that the play shows, “a contrast of materialistic and idealistic motives, morality, degeneration, illiteracy, might and will” (Web). The children of James Ofosu that is, Aaron and Maanan have a strong will which their father’ highhandedness cannot suppress.<br/>    Some parents do not see any sense in studying courses under arts and humanity. This is noted in an online blog, A Ghanaian Voice com. The blogger notes that, “many Ghanaians take pride in talking about their successful son/daughter who is a lawyer, doctor, engineer” (web). The older generation always creates future for the younger generation but Graft writes Sons and Daughters to call attention to the changing world. In a modern age, children choose what they want irrespective of parents’ perception. According Wikipedia, Sons and Daughters “is a contribution to debates about careers and values among secondary school pupils” (Web). Sometimes, strict parents want their children to study professional courses. The blogger referenced above notes that Graft ‘s Sons and Daughters, however, challenges such parents who do not respect their children’s views. The blog’s commentary reads that “the play reflects the mindsets of many Ghanaians back then when the play was written and it reflects the lax and perhaps small-minded attitudes of many Ghanaians towards the arts. Many Ghanaians towards the arts. Many Ghanaians feel that for one to make it in life, one must be a lawyer, doctor, engineer etc. Recognition is given to professions like law, medicine, business et cot the neglect of profession like play writing, acting, dancing” (Web). Society has changed such that children quest for professions or careers that are appealing to them. This is the core of Graft’s message in the play.<br/>1.6 Justification of Study<br/>     From the available reviews on Oyedepo’s The Rebellion of the Bumpy-Chested and Graft’s Sons and Daughters, it is clear that the focus is on women’s quest for freedom and the value of or freedom of asserting individual will. This essay attempts a fresh study with emphasis on the depiction of resistance to patriarchy and parents’ high handedness. This study is different from others because it attempts to investigate how characters’ psychology influences resistance.<br/>1.7    Thesis Statement<br/>    Revolt in J.C De Graft’s Sons and Daughters and Stella Dia Oyedepo’s The Rebellion of the Bumpy-Chested reflect dissatisfaction of characters with parental control and patriarchy at the domestic and societal level.<br/><br/> \n\nRESISTANCE IN J.C.

The renewed interest has been a cheering development especially in the increasing period of demand and expectation from the Igbo community. In the advancement in information technology, linguistics studies need to move with the time and Igbo language in particular need not stay behind. <br/>    Language is a system of communication which is used by people of a given locality. Language makes it possible for man to transfer knowledge across in space and time. It serves not only as the principal medium that Germans communicate with, but also a means of socialization it links people together and bind them with their cultures. In fact, without language, people will not be identified. <br/>    Igbo language is one of the three recognized vernacular known as WAZOBIA, (Nwadike, 2005). Igbo language is important to an Igbo speaking individual for communication, transaction, teaching as well as learning. It is spoken in many parts of Igbo communities comprising Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, Imo and River States of Nigeria. Igbo language has the major forms, the standard and non-standard variety. The non-standard variety is known as dialect. Dialect according to Hartman and Stork (1971; 65-66) is a regional or social variety differing in pronunciation, grammar and vocabulary from the standard language which is in itself a favoured dialect. A dialect is chiefly distinguished from other dialects of the same language by features of linguistic structure. “grammar (specially morphology and syntax), vocabulary and pronunciation. Although some linguistic include phonological features such as vowels, consonants and intonation among the dimensions of the dialects. In the sound system of American English for example, some speakers pronounce ‘greasy’ with an ‘s’ sound while others pronounce it with a ‘z’ sound. <br/>    The standard variety can be regarded as one of the dialects of a given language, though one that has attracted special prestige. Standard language arise when a certain dialect begins to be used in a written form, normally throughout a broader area than that of the dialect itself. The way in which this language is used, for example in administrative matters, literature and economic life leads to the minimization of linguistic variation. In most developed countries, the majority of the population has an active speaking, writing at least passive understanding of the standard language. <br/>    Ikekeonwu (1980) grouped the Igbo dialects into five clusters according to both phonological and grammatical criterion. They are, Niger Igbo, Inland West Igbo, Inland East Igbo,  Wawaa Igbo/Northern Igbo and Riverian Igbo. Each clusters has up to thirty dialects. <br/>    Therefore, this study sets to describe the sound system of Umuchu dialect of Igbo as compared to the sound system of standard Igbo.  A comparative study of this nature sets to identify the similarities and the difference in the Umuchu dialect and standard Igbo sound system with the aim of determining the relationship between them. <br/>1.1    UMUCHU DIALECT AND ITS SPEAKERS<br/>    Umuchu dialect is one of the dialects of Igbo. It is classified under Aguata in Ikekeonwu (1986) dialect classification. The dialect has a unique linguistic feature. <br/>    Umuchu is a broader town between Anambra and Imo states of Nigeria. It is bounded on the south western extremely of the present Aguata local government area of Anambra state. It is bounded on the south of Arondizuogu, Umuakoma and Akokwa in Ideato south local government area of Imo state, while on the north and northwest by Achina and Enugu, Umuomaku respectively. In the West by Uga and Amesi and in the east by Umuomaku, Umunze and Agho-mule river. <br/>    The Umuchu is made up of three major traditional village groups called Ihetenato, Amanassa, and Okpu-na-Achalla. The major  occupation of the people of Unuchu are farming and trading.<br/>1.2    IGBO LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERS<br/>    According to Hartermann (1952) and Greenberg (1966), Igbo language is a member of the Niger-Congo family of language. Igbo language is therefore under the Kwa group of language of the Niger Congo branch of the Niger- Kordofanian language group. Igbo language belong to the rain forest culture group thereby enlisting itself as is component  of the Kwa group of language in accordance with Williamson’s classification of Nigerian languages. <br/>    Igbo language is spoken by over a million people mainly found in the south-east geo political zones of Nigeria in states like Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo. They are also found in some parts of Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta state. They are made of several clans which is nearly impossible and quite unnecessary too to list them all. <br/>    Igbo language which is spoken in the own forest region occupying a vast area of land bounded by the Edold group which include Bini, Esan, Etsako and others. Eastwards towards the Cameroonian boarder by the Yako, Eka, Ibibio, Anang, Bolagi, Ejaghem and Bakwara language group. As previously explained, Igbo people are located in most of the country’s eastern states, when naming the vast area of its spread we have Anioma, Oshimili, Ukwuani in Delta state referred to as Delta Ibo. It is pertinent to note  here that this geographical spread have contributed in no small measure to determining how each dialect filtered into each other. By this it is expected that two dialects which are in close proximity than others tend to be more similar to each other than with others. A lot has been done on the Igbo language which include a standard orthography, sound systems etc. The Igbo family tree is shown below. <br/>Niger Kordofanian <br/>Niger – Congo                            Kordofania<br/>1.3    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>    Language is a very vital tool in the life of every individual and the society at large. Language has different variations which are called dialects. Major attention has been on the languages, giving lesser attention to the variants of these particular languages. As a result of this, most variants or dialects has not been properly studied. <br/>    Most speakers of a dialect cannot properly analyse the machinery  of their dialects and cannot attest the differences and similarities of their dialect and the standard form of the dialect. Most speakers assume that all dialects or variants of a language are all the same in all ramification with the standard language because there is a mutual linguistics understanding when speaking them. This points brings to limelight a very important questions, which is how one can know the difference that exist between a dialect of a language and the standard form of that dialect.<br/>1.4    PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>    This study looks at the sound system analysis on the variation of Umuchu dialect of Igbo language and standard Igbo. The main goal is to identify, analyse and establish the functional sounds in the Umuchu dialect and standard Igbo. This work by no means look out for the similarities and differences identified between the Umuchu dialect and standard Igbo to discover whether they are mutually intelligible. This research in no small measure contribute to the knowledge of the sound system of the dialect and language. It is also hoped that it will give vitality to the dialect and help the present generation to develop their proficiency in reading and writing their dialect. <br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>    Every Research carried out has its benefit both to the researcher and the readers of the work. Therefore, this study will be helpful to both the scholars and readers of the study. <br/>    It will be of great benefit to scholars who would like to go on a further research. The documentation of this work will help to preserve the Umuchu dialect and Igbo language in general. <br/>    It will be of great help to the researcher by broadening the mind of the researchers in the understanding of the sound system of the Umuchu dialect and Igbo language at large. <br/>    Teachers and students who will teach or study Igbo language will  find this very beneficial.<br/>1.6    SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>    This study on the comparative study of the sound system of the Umuchu dialect and standard Igbo captures identifiable sounds in the  dialect and language bringing out the vowel and consonant sounds, and also the tones. <br/>    All the attested sounds captured in the language will be compared to determine the mutual intelligibility between the Umuchu dialect and the standard Igbo. <br/>1.7    LIMITATION OF STUDY<br/>    The greatest limitation in this study is finance. Finance needed in carrying out a standard research is not always easy for a student. One actually need lots of funds to source for credible information and data. <br/>    Time was also a huge problem as the researcher was made to work under a given period of time.<br/>1.8    RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>    The following questions are posed to serve as a guide for the research. <br/>What are the vowels and consonant sounds present in the Umuchu dialect and standard Igbo?<br/>What are the tones present in the Umuchu dialect and standard Igbo?<br/>Are there any similarities and differences between the  <br/>Umuchu dialect and standard Igbo?<br/>Are the Umuchu dialect and standard igbo mutually intelligible?<br/>1.9        METHODOLOGY<br/>    This part of the study focuses on the research methodology. The data are gotten from native speakers using the Ibadan 400 worldlest where 200 words was choosen and transcribed and also tone marked. Therefore, the phonemes of the language are identified and the vowel and consonant phonetic charts are drawn for the  dialect and language under  investigation. The sound patterning (i.e. how the sounds are combined to form words will be looked at). <br/><br/>  \n\nCOMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE SOUND SYSTEM OF UMUCHU DIALECT AND STANDARD IGBO LANGUAGE <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE SOUND SYSTEM OF UMUCHU DIALECT AND STANDARD IGBO LANGUAGE ", "id": 206}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>LITERARY DEVICES IN AMMA DARKO’S FACELESS<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE:<br/>  Introduction<br/>1.1 Life and Works of the Authors -      -             -            -            -           <br/>1.2Scope of Study-    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>Purpose of Study-    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>1.4 Methodology-    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>1.5 Theoretical Background    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>1.6 Review of Criticism    -    -    -    -            -    <br/>1.7 Thesis Statement    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>CHAPTERTWO:<br/>Characters/Characterization             -              -                -                  <br/>CHAPTER THREE:<br/>Setting                 -             -           -                  -                       <br/>CHAPTERFOUR:<br/>Satire                               -             -            -            -                        -            <br/>CHAPTER FIVE:<br/>Conclusion-           -             -                -            -                   -                   -             -    <br/>Works Cited    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>Introduction<br/>Life and Works of Author<br/>    Amma Darko is born in 1956 to Mr. and Mrs. Darko who hailed form Aburi, an Eastern region of Ghana. She was born in Koforidua but she was raised in Accra. Darko schooled at Kumasi Metropolitan City. She studied Industrial Design. Upon her completion of a diploma programme in 1980, she made effort to study in the USA but she could not embark on the journey. She worked for the center of Technological counselling at the University of Kumasi for a year. Between 1981 and 1987, she lived in Germany where she fully developed and harnessed her writing potentials. She later worked as a tax expert but she later retired to fully start her writing career. While in Germany, she wrote many works in German and she later translated them into English.<br/>    Darko is a novelist who has many published works to her credit. The following are novels published by her:Beyond the Horizon (1991), Faceless (Die Gesichtslosen) (2003),  Not Without Flowers (2007), The Housemaid, “Stray Heart’ (Verirrtes Herz) (2000), Spinnweben (“Cobwebs”) 1996, Between Two Worlds  (2015), The Necklace of Tales  (2015). <br/>Her literary prowess and creativity earned her a scholarship in 1998 from the Akadamie Schlos Solitude. In recognition of her creativity, the Ghanaian literary authority conferred the Ghana Book Award on her in 2008. This is the highest literary Honour in the country. She has equally enjoyed the fellowships of International Writing Program-Iowa; USA, International Writing Program-Hong Kong.<br/>1.2 Scope of study<br/>    This study is limited to Amma Darko’s novel entitled Faceless. The novel is chosen above her other works because her use of literary devices is well foregrounded. The major literary devices studied are characterization, setting and satire.<br/>1.3 Purpose of study<br/>    This study examines the effective use of literary devices in Amma Darko’s Faceless.  It becomes necessary to study Darko’s use of artistic devices because the novel’s themes are anchored on them.<br/>1.4 Methodology <br/>    The method of analysis adopted in this study is qualitative. The primary text is thoroughly read and in-depth analysis is carried out on relevant excerpts. The excerpts are given textual analysis based on the researcher’s knowledge and secondary materials collected form library, academic journals, text books and the internet.<br/>1.5 Theoretical background <br/>    This research adopts formalism as the theoretical framework for this study. Formalism is a literary approach to the study of a text and it emphasizes the need to study the form of a literary work. Its primary interest bothers on how literary devices like language, setting, characters, point of view, irony, suspense are used to realize the form and content of a literary piece.According to Ann B. Dobie, “Coleridge’s concept of the organic, inherent nature of form in a literary work (noted earlier) is reflected in the formalists’ assumption that although the external, easily noted ordering of a poem or story may be significant in an analysis, form is actually the whole that is produced by various structural elements working together” (34). Formalistic critics posit that the best way to study the meaning of a literary text is to pay attention to the artistic devices deployed by the author. Rather than looking for an external ideology to explain it. On this note, formalists favour intrinsic exploration of a text rather than its extrinsic study. Intrinsic means that there are inbuilt, inherent or integral parts of a text which inform its meaning. M.H. Abrams argues that:<br/>Formalists have also made influential contributions to the theory of prose fiction. With respect to this genre, the central formalist distinction is that between the “story” (the simple enumeration of a chronological sequence of events) and a plot. An author is said to transform the raw material of a story into a literary plot by the use of a variety of devices that violate sequence and perform and defamiliarize the story elements; the effect is to foreground the narrative medium and devices themselves, and in this way to disrupt and refresh what had been our standard responses to the subject matter. (108)<br/>The literary devices deployed in telling a story are key to the realization of a text’s meaning and messages. Chris Baldick argues that formalism emphasizes on the literariness of a text.According to him formalist rely only texts to bring out its meaning. He says that, “the most important concept of the school was that ofDEFAMILIARIZATION: instead of seeing literary as a reflection of the world” (226).<br/>Wilfred L. Guering et al. clearly spell out the objective of formalistic critics. In their articulation, they contend that:<br/>The object of “formalistic” criticism is to find the key to the structure and meaning of the literary work a key that inevitably reveals itself as necessary to the experience of the work as an art Form. This approach is based on the idea that, although extraliterary considerations (such as the author’s life, his times, and sociological phenomena may be interesting and sometimes quite helpful, the heart of the matter ought to be, quit simply: what is the literary work, what are its shape and effect, and how do these come about? in short, we search for the form, necessary for a real understanding of the work. (45)<br/>Formalism seeks to know how a work is structured or organized in relation to plot. It finds out how a storyline is started and ended to determine such story’s plot.Furthermore, it examines how characters are moulded and the way minor and major characters are placed. All these build up the form of the text.<br/>    Charles E. Bressler offers a scholarly comment on formalism and this is in line with what this theory’s supporters are known for. Bresseler commenting on where the meaning of a text lies possess a pertinent question. He asks:<br/>Where, then, can we find a poem’s meaning? According to the New Critics, it does not reside in the author, the historical or social context of the poem, or even in the reader. Because the poem itself is an artifact or an objective entity, its meaning must reside within its own structure. Like all other objects, a poem and its structure can be analyzed scientifically… It is the critic’s job, they conclude, to ascertain the structure of the poem, to see how it operates to achieve its unity, and to discover how meaning evolves directly from the poem itself. (44)<br/>Bressler’s assertion is similar to Dobie’s cited earlier which maintains that a text meaning must be sought within it and not outside. It means that external considerations like the author’s biography, political or socio-culture view should not be imported into a text’s analysis.Bressler emphasizes the need to identify and interpret all part of a text when he opines that an objective formalist ought to“analyze all images, symbols, and figures of speech within the text. Note the relationships, if any, among the element, both within the same category (between images, for example) and among the various elements (between an image and a symbol, for example” (47). One advantage the formalistic approach has over others is that it is more objective. It isthought that if art is not seen as an independent whoe, it will be seen as an extension of other disciplines like religion or history. T.S. Eliot, William Empson and I.A. Richard are leading formalists hence their scholarship reinforced the use of formalism in the 20th century. Dobie asserts that “T.S Eliot, I.A Richard and William Empson began to develop their ideas of how to read a text. Important to their thinking, for example, was Eliot’s announcement of the high place of art as art rather than as expression of social, religious, or political ideas”(33). A Text is a whole and within it lies everything a critic needs to interpret and evaluate it. Eliot opines that the best way to obtain the meaning of a text is to subject it to formalistic evaluation. Above all, formalism gives critics room to study the kind of language an author uses to create the world in which the literary work is situated. In view of this, the figurative features of a text’s language is looked at.<br/>    At one point or the other, formalism has been given different names. It should be noted that there is a close link between formalistic approach and New Criticism such that the two terms are used interchangeably. Abrams comments on this thus, “American New criticism, although it developed independently, is sometimes called “formalist” because like European formalism, it stresses the analysis of the literary work as a self-sufficient verbal entity, constituted by internal relations and independent of reference either to the state of mind of the author or to the actualities of the “external” world” (108). A literary text explored in this way will yield unambiguous or subjective meaning of a text.<br/>     This essay adopts the principles of formalism in the study of literary devices deployed in Darko’sFaceless. A close study of each device in relation to formalistic doctrine will enable the researcher to appreciate the artistic layout of the novel.<br/>1.6 Review of Related Scholarship<br/>    Kofi Anyidoho examines the decadence of society presented in Darko’s novels. His critical study bothers on The Housemaid, Faceless and Beyond the Horizon. Anyidoho notes that these novels:<br/>Tell one long and disturbing tale. Sadly, it is a tale of a diseased society that seems to have lost its hold on the life of its children. It is a provocative tale of a society that has developed an ability of guiding its young ones, especially the girl-child, into a life dedicated to prostituting every conceivable virtue for the sake of flimsy materials possessions. (x)<br/>Anyidoho’s comment is apt because a close study of these novels especially Facelessreveals a Ghanaian society cum African society that is sick and “diseased” as rightly noted above. Faceless introduces readers to a reckless society where immoral acts prevail over decent lifestyle. Darko in the novel reveals that most African families have sunk low into the pits of poverty which drives many into the streets where life is short and nasty. Anyidoho commends the satirical effort of Darko which aims towards achieving a balanced society where human happiness can be guaranteed. This assertion is captured thus in Anyidoho’s words: <br/>Fofo still needs the kind of helping hand offeredby kabriaand her colleagues at MUTE, the all-female NGO dedicated to helping dig out the many buried voiced of the dispossessed… The problem of street children has grown beyond any one individual or organization. It requires the collaboration of the kind we find here between the women of MUTE and the radio presenter on Harvest FM, Sylv Po, to help save the situation. (xv11)<br/>Faceless is a wake-up call to every African who wants to see the continent become an ideal society especially for the unborn generation. It is on this account that Darko portrays MUTE and Harvest FM as social reformation centers. <br/>    In a comparative study on Darko’s Facelessand Lawrence Darmani’s Grief Child, Cynthia Osei and Cecilia Adder beam their searchlight on the phenomenon of street children which has endangered many lives in Ghana and Africa at large. Faceless identifies child abuse as a serious challenge which African leaders have failed to solve. Osei and Addei however contend that the problem of child abuse or molestation “can be curbed entirely starting from within the immediate family setting of the growing child”(108).Their comment points to the failure of many parents who have sacrificed African values for their quest for worthless material possessions. Many African families are dying as a result of parents’ negligence which has forced many under aged children to take their destinies in their own hands. This has also led to abuse of children by evil people who take advantage of parents’ weakness. Osei and Addei, however, suggest that there should be social centers where “children who are abused should have the personal determination and willingness to rise above their conditions by seeking help from the right source”(108). This assertion finds a place in MUTE created by in Faceless where helpless children can get shelter from the harsh condition of street life. Fofo goes there and she is helped by professional social workers who showed her love that her parents deny her.<br/>    Mawuli Adjei in her study of Faceless depicts men as sexual terrorist who inflict pain on women. Adjei writes that:<br/>In Faceless, women children are sexually and physically brutalized by the likes of Onko, Kwe, Kpakpo, Macho, and Poison. Male violence, monstrosity and depravity are refracted through the conduct of these male characters. These monsters pervade the work of Faceless in a manner that leaves the reader male or female, totally disgusted and angry. (53)<br/>Adjei is of the opinion that men are presented as task masters who suppress and oppress women. At one point or the other all the men listed above exploit all of women that come their ways.Juliana Daniels Osofu, also takes on Faceless from a feminist angle. She explores the subjugation women are subjected in society and efforts made to be liberated. She notes that:<br/>The women in the novel(s) seek to rub shoulders with their fricative counterparts in contributing to national progress and development and more importantly, to gain individual self-actualization. Hence there is the need to shun the traditional notion of educating the boy child rather than the girl.In the face of antagonism and male chauvinism in contemporary society, Darko points out women have no option but to come together in a network that gives them the audacity to stand up to injustices against them. This is seen in the role of the MUTE ladies who come to the rescue of Maa Tsuru and Fofo. (187)<br/> Osofu calls on all women to seek emancipation from all forms of oppression which can limit their freedom. She praises all the women who run MUTE with the view to bringing succor to helpless girls and women. She notes that Darko usesFaceless to encourage all women to fully participate in programmes that can save women from exploitation. <br/>    Felicia Annin looks at social decay that renders African societies less functional. She notes in Faceless:<br/>Amma Darko uses many instances to portray society. Among such issues include the attitude of government functionaries to their work. The police are cited in this story as public servants who are to champion the course of citizens in the society. However, the vivid description of the police station as well as the attitude of the Inspector symbolically depicts the inefficiency and power less this institution has been rendered o in our society. (810)<br/>As Annin rightly observes, Faceless paints a picture of a society that is ridden with decay or dead institutions.Thedescription of the police station and the attitudes of the officers on duty reveal a high level of decadence. For the help of harvest FM, the killer of Baby T. would have gone unidentified. With the state of the police station and the attitudes of the inspector on duty, one can rightly say that the government has failed to protect the welfare of its citizens. <br/>    Faceless is presented as a riddle that must be solved hence it takes the style of a detective story. Edgar Fred Nabutayi’s comment on Faceless is dedicated to Darko’s style of narration. Nabutayi notes that the author,“uses narrative to document the multifaceted nature of children sex work in some African cities. Her detective plot and thriller style coverage places her in the literary public sphere a socio-analytic dossier concerning institutional practices and agents that facilitate underage prostitution.” (1890) Darko’s style resemble popular American thriller novels which feature detectives going after criminals. Darko exposes how crimes revolve around society with their attending effects on every individual in society. Francis Etse Awitor lends support to the assertion of Nabutayi when he says that, “Faceless offers a commentary on a diseased society which has lost the control over its children. They are offered cheaply and without remorse to the streets, where they are sold, exploited and abused sexually, assaulted and forced into prostitution”(130). This is a serious challenge African societies face and it has rightly come under Darko’s satirical attack.<br/>    Contemporary literature mostly focuses on modern societies and latest issues. Mary Allen Haggins commends Darko who writes on societal issues which concern less important people’s children. In her articulation, she says that, “Darko brings to surface the forgotten, the repressed, the taboo: poor Ghanaian girls who are coerced into local, urban prostitution for profit of the family members” (73). Darko goes down to the level of the downtrodden and writes about their everyday life in a corrupt and wayward society. She reveals to the elites especially the leaders that lack of basic needs permeates the world of the downtrodden consequently their children are forced into the streets where they are subjected to hardship and exploitation.Haggins indicts family heads who profits from the prostitution of their girl children. Some parents like Maa Tsuru and Kpakpo strive on their children’s burden since they never make any effort to cater for their needs. The moment they realize the children are old enough to be admitted into the street, they send them there. On this account, Haggins calls on all family heads to ensure that their children are well brought up in order to have a society that is totally free from street children and petty crimes that go with reckless lifestyle.<br/>    From the foregoing, this study has attempted to review previous scholarly comments on Darko’s Faceless. Really, many critics have commented on the novel however they mostly looked at the novel form social points of view. This research work therefore sets out to carry out an artistic study of the text’s deployment of literary devices.<br/>1.7 Thesis Statement<br/>    This essay argues thatAmma Darko’s Facelessforegrounds social challenges through the deployment of effective characterization, symbolic setting and satire.<br/><br/>\n\nLITERARY DEVICES IN AMMA DARKO’S FACELESS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " LITERARY DEVICES IN AMMA DARKO’S FACELESS", "id": 207}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>RAPE IN LUCY JONAH’S SHROUDED SECRETS<br/>Abstract</b><br/>Lucy Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets recounts the causes, circumstances and effects of rape on victims. The narrative gives a vivid and realistic picture of how innocent people fall preys to sexual predators who carry out the evil called rape. This paper examines the scourge of rape which permeates the novel and the different schemes rapists employ to carry out their wicked acts as well as how such deviant acts hurt victims socially, physically and psychologically. Insights are drawn from Freud’s psychoanalytic theory to examine how characters are influenced psychologically, and affected by their actions and inactions. Poverty, quest for greener pasture, ignorance and peer influence are some of the causes of rape as illustrated in the novel. Self- help, rugged dressing for ladies, eating a familiar meal, engaging in pleasurable activities and reflecting on nostalgic experiences are suggested as panaceas to the scourge of rape in the novel.<br/>Keywords: Rape, victims, panaceas, outcast, psychoanalysis. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>  Introduction    -    -    -    -    -<br/>1.1Scope of Study-    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>Purpose of Study-    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>Methodology-    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>1.4 Theoretical Background    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>1.5 Review of Related Scholarship and Justification of Study    -    -    <br/>1.6 Thesis Statement    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>CIRCUMSTANCES AND CAUSES OF RAPE   -        -               <br/>2.1Introduction -        -        -              -                -                  -                        -            -         <br/>2.3 Poverty and Broken Home        -             -                 -                     -                  -             -<br/>2.4 Quest for Greener Pasture                -                      -              -                 -                - <br/>2.5 Conclusion      -             -               -                 -                -                   -                 -    <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>SOCIO-PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF RAPE           -              -                 -         <br/>3.1 Introduction         -                 -                    -                    -             -                 -             -<br/>3.2 Social Effects         -                     -                     -                   -                  -                -           -<br/>3.3 Physiological Effects -               -                 -              -                  -                -                  -<br/>3.4 Psychological Effects               -                 -                  -               -                   -        -<br/>3.5 Conclusion -      -           -                   -                   -                  -                  -              -<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>SOLUTIONS/PANACEAS                        -            -            <br/>4.1 Introduction      -                 -                  -                  -                      -            -              -<br/>4.2 Self- Liberation          -                   -                      -                       -                      -             -<br/>4.3 The Role of NGOs   -              -             -            -                 -                     -                    -<br/>4.4 Mode of Dressing -             -               -           -             -                 -                -              -<br/>4.5 Symbolic Cleansing -           -               -                  -             -              -                    -      <br/>4.6 Culinary Delight and Nostalgia          -              -       -                    -                -           -<br/>4.7   The Therapeutic Effect of Sharing Experience       -               -               -               -   <br/>4.8 Conclusion -             -              -             -                -              -             -              - <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>SUMMARY, FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION<br/>5.1 Summary -          -       -             -            -             -             -           -            -                -<br/>5.2 Findings -                -                 -           -             -              -               -              -        -<br/>5.3Conclusion-           -             -                -            -                   <br/>5.4 Works Cited    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -        -           <br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/> Introduction <br/>Almost all human societies have sunk low into the abyss of immorality and wickedness. Visitor attack their hosts and friends and family members betray one another recklessly. Lucy Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets beams its searchlight on sexual violence which shatters its victims in the novel and in real life.<br/>    One of the primary functions of literature is to mirror social ills with a view to changing for the betterment of all. This fundamental task of literature finds a place in Lucy Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets. The novel captures the defects that mar orderliness and decency in society, beaming its literary light on the evil of rape and other domestic vices that go with it. The challenge of rape is a contemporary issue that seems to have eluded all proferred solutions. Shrouded Secrets was published in 2016 by Lucy Jonah and its major preoccupation is the scourge of rape in society.<br/>1.1 Purpose of Study<br/>The study examines the scourge of rape and specifically highlights its causes, circumstances, effects on its victims and its solutions as found in Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets.<br/>1.2 Scope of Study<br/>    This essay is limited to Lucy Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets published in 2016 and this is because the novel is detailed enough to capture the objective of this study. It is written like a collection of short stories on the subject of rape. Relevant excerpts from other related texts are cited where necessary. In what follows, we discuss the theory that underpins this essay, the methodology, as well as well present the incidents of rape in the novel, underscoring their circumstances, causes and socio-psychological effects. This study discusses how the scourge of rape is portrayed in Shrouded Secrets and examines the solutions presented by the author. It also critically examines the socio-psychological causes and effects of rape. The study uses insight from Sigmund Freud’s Psychoanalytical theory which lays bare the psychological make-up of the characters and their personalities.  <br/>Lucy Jonah was born in 1946 and grew up mainly under the custody of relatives who lived a communal life so she learnt a lot from different people. She got married around eighteen years old to a man who was fairly older than her. The marriage was fruitless so she opted out for another one that gave her two children. Around 1976 she ran a sandwich course in College of Technology, Yaba, Lagos State in Secretariat Administration and Printing Technology. She took other correspondent courses and private tutorial in the art and act of printing and publishing. Jonah once worked with the then Examination Success Correspondence as an editor but she was later taken to other departments owned by the same company. She is an accomplished writer, business woman and renowned publisher in Lagos. Some of her personal life experiences are fictionalized in her prose works, especially in The Trial of Sins.     She has the following publications (novels) to her credit: When Men Were Gods ( 2016 ). The Choice (2000) Ehianuka (an autobigraphy) (2006), The Trial of Sins (2016 ), Shrouded Secrets (2016) and The Pot and the Tripod(2016 ).<br/>1.3 Methodology <br/>The method of analysis adopted in this essay is qualitative. This means that an in-depth textual analysis of the primary text was carried out. Relevant materials like academic articles from journals, text-books and the Internet are used. Analysis and interpretation of text are based on the researcher’s understanding and that of scholars who have written on the problem of rape. The psychological approach to literature is used in this study since it deals with the human minds in relation to society. Specifically, Freud’s Psychoanalytic theory underpin the analysis of the endemic incidents of rape in the novel.<br/>1.4 Theoretical Background<br/>    The literary theory adopted in this essay is Sigmund Freud’s Psychological criticism, also psychoanalytic criticism, which seeks to know how the subconscious state of characters and writers’ states of mind are brought to the fore in literary works. Rapists and raped victims have feelings which can be better understood by paying attention to their unconscious state of being. Freud’s concept of id, ego and superego summarize how the conscious and unconscious elements of the mind influence human behaviours in the face of societal laws regulating human conducts.  Ann B. Dobie maintains that the Psychological criticism is employed, “to probe the workings of the human psyche in order to understand why people act as they do” (48). Human feelings arise from the psyche, hence this essay focuses on Freud’s components of the mind which he tags the id, ego and superego and how they affect people’s behaviours  (rapists and raped victims) in the case of this study. <br/>The human psyche is very complex because it goes through many stages or phases of development before it attains maturity. These psychological stages include the Oral Stage, the Anal Stage and the Phallic Stage. Charles E Bressler writes that, “as infants, we experience the oral phrase: when we suck our mother’s breast to beefed, our sexuality (or libido) is activated. Through this activity our mouths develop into an erotogenic zone that will later cause us to enjoy sucking our thumbs and still, later in life, kissing” (123). According to Wikipedia, “the mother thus logically becomes your first “love object”, already a displacement from the earlier object of desire (the breast). When you first recognized the fact of your father, you dealt with humbly identifying yourself with him; however, as the sexual wishes directed toward your mother grew in intensity, you become possessive of your mother and wished your father out of the picture. (the Oedipus) Complex” (Web). Bresseler goes on and says that “in the second or anal stage the anus becomes an object of pleasure when children take the delight of defecation and, simultaneously, realize that they are independent person who are separate from their mothers. During this stage the anus becomes an erotogenic zone” (123).<br/>    It is noted in Wikipedia that this stage is between two to four years, “following the oral phase, which is split between active and passive impulses: the impulse to mastery on the one hand, which can easily become cruelty; the impulse to scopophilia (love of gazing). According to Freud, the child’s pleasure in defecation is connected to his or her pleasure in creating something of his or her own, a pleasure that for women is later transferred to child bearing. Bressler says that, “in the final phase, the phallic stage, a child’s sexual desire or libido is directed toward the genitals when the child learns the pleasure that results from stimulating one’s sexual organs”(124). Wikipedia holds that the penis or clitoris “becomes your primary object-cathexis. In this stage, the child becomes fascinated with urination, which is experienced as pleasurable both in its expulsion and retention” (web).<br/>    Society has sexual boundaries which specify the extent to which a well developed genital can explore. Freud uses the Oedipus, Castration, and Electral complex to explain how the sexual organs and libido are controlled. This means that the cordial bond between a girl-child and her father or that of a boy-child and her mother must be removed. According to Bresller, “if a child’s sexual development is to proceed normally, Freud maintains, each must then pass through the castration complex. From observing themselves, their mothers, and perhaps their sisters, little boys know they have a penis like their fathers, while their mothers and sisters do not. What prevents the male child from continuing to have incestuous desires with his mother is fear of castration by his father” (124). Wikipedia calls this stage “latency period during which your sexual development was more or less suspended” (web); that is, repressed. For the girls, Bresller says that:<br/>Whereas boy must successfully negotiate the Oedipus complex in order to become a normal man, a girl must successfully negotiate the Electral complex if she is to make the transition from a girl to a normal woman. Like a boy, a young girl is erotically attracted to her mother, and like the boy, she too recognizes a rival for her mother’s affection; the father. Unconsciously, however, the girl realizes that she is already castrated like her mother. Since she knows her father possesses that which she desires, a penis, she turns her desires to him and away from her mother. After the seduction of her father fails, she turns back toward the mother and identifies with her. Her transition into womanhood being complete, the girl realizes that one day she, too like her mother, will possess a man. Through her relationships with a man, her unfulfilled desire for a penis (penis envy) will be mitigated and her sense of lack will be somewhat appeased. (124-125)<br/>Freud argues that there is a psychological riot or conflict in a girl’s sexual organ and it must be repressed. Freud’s theory as illustrated in Wikipedia states that, “the young girl, also experiences the castration complex, with the difference that her tendency is to be a victim of what Freud terms “penis-envy” a desire for a penis as large as a man’s. After this stage, according to Freud, the woman has an extra stage of development when “the clitoris should wholly or in part hand over its sensitivity, and at the same time its importance to vagina” (web). All the sexual developments which Freud explains are better expressed in his Dynamic, Economic and Tripartite model.<br/>    Freud psychoanalytical theory has many models which explains human nature and behaviours. These models of the human psyche reveal the state of the mind in relation to human conducts in society. Dynamic model is the first model and it deals with the conscious and the unconscious part of human mind. Bressler writes that:<br/>our minds are a dichotonomy consisting of the conscious (the rational) and the unconscious (the irrational). The conscious, Freud argued perceives and records external reality and is the reasoning part of the mind. Unaware to the presence of the unconscious, we operate consciously, believing that our reasoning and analytical skills are solely responsible for our behavior. Nevertheless, Freud is the first to suggest that it is the unconscious, not the conscious, that governs a large part of our actions. (121)<br/>human minds are actually endowed with two parts which conflict with each other and whichever won controls a larger part of our actions either good or bad, that is, rational or irrational. Bressler goes forward to say that, “the irrational part of our psyche, the unconscious, receives and stores our hidden desires, ambitions, fears, passion, and irrational thoughts” (121). All human beings have the capacity to reason and before actions are taken, the mind is involved. Even unintentional actions and slip of the tongue emerge from our minds. Though they are considered unconscious actions.<br/>    Economic model is the second model developed by Freud and he maintains that this model has two parts: the pleasure principle and the reality principle. Bressler states that:<br/>The pleasure principle craves only pleasures, and it desires instantaneous satisfaction of instinctual drives, ignoring moral and sexual boundaries established by society. Immediate relief form all pain or suffering is its goal. The pleasure principle is held in check however, by the reality principle, that part of the psyche that recognized the need for societal standards and regulations or pleasure. Freud believed that both these principles are at war within the human psyche. (122)<br/>In every society, there are the good, the bad and the ugly and the diverse people behave differently. The bad like rapists, armed robbers or corrupt leaders crave for immediate satisfaction thus Freud maintains that it is the pleasure principle which controls their actions. The good is controlled by the reality principle hence the pursue noble acts.<br/>    Tripartite Model is the third aspect of Freud’s psychoanalytical theory and this dwells on the three conflicting parts of the human psyche. They are the id, the ego and the superego. M.H Abrams states that “Psychoanalytic criticism deals with a work of literature primarily as an expression in an indirect and fictional form of the state of mind and the structure of personality of the individual author” (256). This theory offers insight that can be employed to x-ray human behaviours and actions. It enables critics to probe why a deviant may rape a helpless victim and how victims feel about their pain. Dobie further asserts that “in an effort to describe the conscious and the unconscious mind, Freud divided the human psyche into three parts: the id, the ego and the superego. They are for the most part unconscious. <br/>The id for example, is completely unconscious, and only small part of the ego and the superego are conscious. Each operates according to different, even contrasting, principles” (51). Human minds are affected by different factors within a specific environment and these affect behaviours which depend on individuals desires and state of mind which in turn affect society. This is applicable to the phenomenon of rape and the mindset of rapists. The psychic drive of humans is located in their id which Dobie describes as:<br/>the repository of the libido, the source of our Psychic energy and our psychosexual desires, gives us our vitality. Because it is always trying to satisfy its hunger for pleasure, it operates without any thought of consequences, anxiety, ethic, logic, precaution, or morality, demand swift satisfaction, and fulfillment of biological desires, it is lawless, asocial, a moral. As Freud describes it, it is only striving to bring about the satisfaction of the instinctual needs to the observance of the pleasure principle. (51)<br/>     Man would like to live in unrestrained pleasure if given the chance. The part of man which craves for unlimited pleasure is the id. It is the reckless and it is the part of the mind that pushes a man to rape a defenceless girl. Eward H. Straunch states that “man’s action is caused by certain subconscious impulses and forces over which he has little or no control” (96). In the same direction, Dobie goes further by stating that “the id can be a social destructive force unrestrained, it will aggressively seek to gratify its desires without any concern for law, customs, or values” (51). Dobie and Strauch agree that there is a psychological impulse or force that is the id which influences human unrestrained actions. Their position validates the view that psychological criticism can explain why certain actions are taken by characters like rapists who fail to control their sexual impulse in the face of societal laws. <br/>    Within the human mind is a psychological apparatus which restrains the destructive drive of the id. This may be referred to as human conscience which checks the excesses of humans. Dobie argues that, “the ego, which operates according to the reality principle, is one such regulating agency. Its function is to make the id’s energies non-destructive by postponing them or diverting them into socially acceptable actions… it mediates between our inner selves and the outer world” (51). Every civilized human society has customs, traditions and laws which are put in place to guide against selfish and reckless behaviours. Sometimes, the need for unlimited pleasure forces a man to go against societal codes of conducts. If this is not promptly checked, it will degenerate into a society describes by Thomas Hobbes in “Leviathan”. In such society, there will be, “ continual fear and danger, violent death, and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short” (62). Society must be rid of vices and kept under a decent control. If there is nothing like conscience, that is, ego to check the id, there will be reckless destruction here and there. <br/>    In the assertion of Dobie, “the superego, provides additional balance to the id, for it furnishes a sense of guilt for behaviour that breaks the rules given by parents to the young child. Similar to what is commonly known as one’s conscience, it operates according to the morality principle, for it provides the sense of moral and ethical wrongdoing” (51). The superego ensures that society is kept in perfect order as a result of this it moderates the actions of man such that no matter how cruel a human can be, there are still restraining elements controlling his actions. This is an aspect of psychoanalysis that deals with society. The belief that human psyche and environment influence our behaviours in society is stressed by Strauch who argues that, “psychic and environmental factors determine how we react and what we do”(96). Everyone has a way of reacting to societal constructs like laws, customs and traditions. While some people strive to be conformists, others become deviant. Superego, the restraining psyche of man however balances the forces which lie between “how we react and what we do” to quote the words of Strauch. <br/>     On his examination of psychological theory, Wilbur Scott maintains that the application of the theory on literary texts “enables and encourages a deeper probe into the dramatization of human situation” (69-70). The scourge of rape as a social distress is one of the human situations society has been fighting from time immemorial. Every society has laid down rules which everyone is expected to adhere to but sometimes non-conformists do things in their own ways. For example, it is the same sexual pleasure a rapist gets that a married man gets form his legally married wife. A rapist, however, chooses to shun the processes and customs attached to marriage and relationship. Instead, he forcefully grabs and violates any woman to satisfy his urge ignoring sexual and moral boundaries.<br/>    This study relies on Freud’s psychological principles to explore the problem of rape in society as depicted in Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets. One of the principles is the Pleasure Principle which focuses on man’s desires to readily get immediate satisfaction without regard for societal or moral laws and the other one is the Reality Principle which moderates the actions of man in line with societal laws and morals.<br/>1.5 Literature Review <br/>    Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets has not attracted critical comments as such being a recent text. This essay, however, employs critical comments on sexual misconducts in other studies. The concept of rape is examined as part of this study’s review of literature.<br/>The concept of rape and classification according to Wikipedia, the free Encyclopedia is adopted.<br/>It defines rape as : <br/> a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without that person's consent. The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority, or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability or is below the legal age of consent. The term rape is sometimes used interchangeably with the term sexual assault. The rate of reporting, prosecuting and convicting for rape varies between jurisdictions. Internationally, the incidence of rapes recorded by the police during 2008 ranged, per 100,000 people, from 0.2 in Azerbaijan to 92.9 in Botswana with 6.3 in Lithuania as the median. Worldwide, rape is primarily committed by males. Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by people the victim knows, and male-on-male and female-on-female prison rapes are common and may be the least reported forms of rape. Widespread and systematic rape (e.g., war rape) and sexual slavery can occur during international conflict. These practices are crimes against humanity and war crimes. Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted ethnic group. People who have been raped can be traumatized and develop posttraumatic stress disorder. Serious injuries can result along with the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. A person may face violence or threats from the rapist, and, in some cultures, from the victim's family and relatives. (Web)<br/>Rape is a sexual intercourse carried to on a victim who is usually over powered by his or her violators. This forceful and unlawful penetration may be directed to a victim’s anus, viginal, mouth and this may be done with objects, the perpetrators’ sex organ or body parts like fingers. Once the consent of a victim is not obtained before a sexual intercourse is carried out, rape has can be said to have taken place. It is a crime that is punishable under the law but it appears that patriarchy makes male perpetrators of rape to go almost free. Relevant agencies fight rape to protect the dignity of humans especially helpless girls. <br/>Types of Rape<br/>Acquaintance Rape<br/>    This type of rape occurs among people who are close, for example, co-workers, school mates, family friends and distant family members. Victims of acquaintance rape are often caught unaware because they often trust their violators prior to the attacks.<br/>Gang Rape<br/>    This occurs when a group of people plan to sexually assault their victims perhaps someone who is proving stubborn to them. This type of rape often leaves victims heavily battered or in a near death state.<br/>Juvenile Rape<br/>    This is sexual abuse on children. It is more of incest because children are often left in the hands of their close relatives or neighbors who turn out to be sexual predators.<br/>Prison Rape<br/>    Inmates in prison cells sexually assault one another since it is sometimes difficult to express their sexual urge with the people they need. It is also linked with custodial rape ( in prison custody) where warders violate people under their care ( patients or prisoners).<br/>War Rape<br/>    Soldiers are always guilty of this since victims or prisoners of war are always at their mercies. They use threat and force to sexually assault helpless people caught in war scenes.<br/><br/>Theft Rape<br/>    This is a forceful sexual intercourse that is carried out by armed robbers on their victims. Some bandits derive pleasure in it so they assault their preys after looting them.<br/><br/><br/>Ceremonial/Ritual Rape<br/>    Some deadly rituals or initiations required some superior members to sleep with new in takes. This is done under a terrible condition that victims may not be able to resists therefore it leaves them brutally injured.<br/>Monica Udoette and Joy Nwiyi note that African writers do not turn a blind eye to the issue of wayward behaviour like sexual assault:<br/>Issues relating to sexual behavior and activities in African social circles have not always enjoyed the privilege of being brought to the fore. The social religious and cultural biases of Africans, as it were, seem to have kept these issues “concealed” as much as possible. However (un) acceptable sexual activities and relationship(s) within and outside African society are being interrogated by African writer in recent times. (245)<br/>Udotte and Nwiyi are correct because the issue of rape is one of the trending issues in African literature. It is a serious matter which affects the well-being of every sane society. In a bid to put a stop to it, Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets satirizes all those who celebrate or support sexual assaults. The novel reveals the evil of rape with a view to finding a permanent solution to it. As earlier noted every society has codes of conduct which must be adhered to. It is, however, disheartening that some individuals break such societal codes and norms, as Ogaga A. Obaro says, “Individual deviance is deviant behaviour involving a person acting alone contrary to established customs, mores and laws of the group or society. Thus, the armed robber, the thief, the burglar, the murderer, the rapist, the drug addict, the prostitute and so forth who acts as single individual is an individual deviant” (26-27). Ogaga clearly points out that certain individuals in society find it difficult to abide by laws guiding social conducts hence they do things in their ways, this is an act of deviance which civilized society frowns at. Jonah condemns the abuse of women especially young girls whose sexuality is violated in society that cares less for women’s rights. Rape occurs every minute and it is disturbing that little or nothing is done to discourage this ungodly act especially by those who subscribes to patriarchy. As a moralistic writer, Jonah uses her novel Shrouded Secrets to protest against rape in order to protect the interests of raped victims who die in silence.<br/>     Nawal El Saadawi’s Woman at Point Zero has a similar theme of rape and sexual molestation which is at the front burner of Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets. Just like Omosigho who is sexually assaulted by his uncle, Ibekwe Ezeakolam in a study on Woman at point Zero notes most men derive pleasure in exploiting women. He asserts that “another layer of female oppression comes from men, starting from Firdaus’ father, uncle, husband Bayoumi, and Marzouk the pimp. Firdaus is passed from one abusive guardian to another after the death of her parents. A well-educated uncle repeatedly molests her sexually” and “ persuaded by his wife and taken in by the prospects of a big dowry, the uncle forces her into an early marriage with more-than –sixty-year old sheikh Mahmoud” (76). This bitter experience is echoed in Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets. It is similar to the story of Omoshigo the protagonist and Salamatu, her clinical client, <br/>    Jonah and Saadawi agree that the incident of rape is alarming therefore they project it in their works as evil. Canon Gilbert O. Madubuike asserts that, “ any sexual behaviour therefore, that does not contribute to the welfare of the individual or society can be regarded as risk behaviour. Such behaviours as rape,, watching pornographic films”… (21). Every society must cultivate right behaviors which can promote and protect human dignity. Rape is a terrible sexual behaviour which has ruined many victims. Maduibuike further states that, “sexual risk behaviour has a lot of psychological and physiological implications on the survival of the human race. For example, Chukwuma (2008), assert that many victims of rape (a major type of sexual-risk behavior, suffer a lot of humiliation and even death” (27). This assertion is apt because it captures the experience of characters presented in Jonah’s Shrouded Secrets. Rape has a devastating effects on those who survive it. Jone-Frances Agbu affirms Madubuike’s assertion when she says that “child sexual exploitation involves a breach of trust or an exploitation of vulnerability and frequently both. Sexually exploited children not only face on their developing sense of their sexual identity, but a blow to their construction of the world as a safe enough environment and their developing sense of other as trustworthy” (74). Rape hurts victims beyond what can be described and that is why civil or humanitarian groups fight very hard to halt all sexual-devastating behaviours. From the foregoing, it is evident that no critical work is found to have been written on Shrouded Secrets. This essay therefore examines the scourge to underscore its socio-psychological causes and effects. <br/>1.6 Thesis Statement <br/>In all the incidents of rape in intriguing circumstances in Shrouded Secrets, Lucy Jonah vividly presents the crudity and lasting sociological effects of rape on its victims and consequently demonstrates how the scourge should be tackled in society.   <br/><br/>\n\nRAPE IN LUCY JONAH’S SHROUDED SECRETS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RAPE IN LUCY JONAH’S SHROUDED SECRETS", "id": 208}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>  THE ELEGIAC TRADITION IN NIYI OSUNDARE’S SONGS OF THE SEASON  AND HOPE EGHAGHA’S MAMA DANCES INTO THE NIGHT AND OTHER POEMS.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b><br/>Chapter One<br/>Life and Works of Authors<br/>Purpose of Study<br/>Scope of Study<br/>Methodology<br/>Theoretical Background<br/>Reviews of Criticism <br/>Thesis Statement<br/>Chapter Two: Heroism<br/>2.0 Introduction<br/>2.1 Celebration of Sacrificial Leaders<br/>2.2 Display of Courage in Tragic Moments<br/>2.3 Conclusion<br/>Chapter Three: Expression of Hope<br/>3.0 Introduction<br/>3.1 Assurance of a New Life in Death<br/>3.2 Death Ushers in Eternal Rest<br/>3.3 Conclusion<br/>Chapter Four: The African Concept of Death<br/>4.0 Introduction<br/>4.1 Inevitability of Death<br/>4.2 Death as a Continuation of Existence<br/>4.3 Conclusion<br/>Chapter Five: The Painful Nature of Death<br/>5.0 Introduction<br/>5.1 Death as Harbinger of Grief<br/>5.2 Death as a Disintegrating Force<br/>5.3 Conclusion<br/>Chapter Six<br/>Conclusion<br/>Works Cited<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1 Life and Works of the Poets:<br/>    Niyi Osundare’s Life and Works<br/>    The literary icon, Niyi Osundare was born in 1947 in Ikere-Ekiti, Ekiti State. He enjoyed a rich educational background as he obtained his first degree at the University of Ibadan. He gained his second degree at University of Leeds and his PhD at York University, Canada. In 1997, he became professor of English. Between 1993-1997, Osundare headed the Department of English, University of Ibadan. Since 1997 till date, he teaches at University of New Orleans. Osundare is a well known socio-political crusader who has through his works, sought social justice for his people. Apart from his commitment to achieving a better human society, he has also written many works that promote a harmonious relationship between man and his environment.<br/>     Osundare has the following works to his literary credits: Villages Voices, Songs of the Market place, Songs of the Season, The Word is an Egg, Eye of the Earth, Waiting Laughter, The State Visit, Pages from the Book of the Sun, Tender Moment, Midlife, Early Birds: for Junior Secondary Schools. These works by Osundare are clear expressions of his love for humanity.  What this means is that Osundare’s literary compositions thrive to add values to human existence in a world that is disabled by bad leaders.<br/>    For his prolific writing skill and concern for humanity, Osundare’s works have enjoyed wider readership. Moreover, he has received  numerous awards like Nigerian National Merit Award (NNMA) for academic excellence 2004, Noma Award 1990, Commonwealth Poetry Prize and Association of Nigerian Authors 1986, Kwanza Award, Fonlon/Nichols Prize 1989, African Literature Award 1998, the Spectrum Books Award 2004, Tchicaya U Tamsi Prize for African Poetry 2008 and Nigerian National Order of Merit Award 2014.<br/>     In summary, Osundare has continued to be relevant in all spheres of his life  especially in the literary circle. This informs the selection of his collection Songs of the Season In this Study.<br/>Hope Eghagha’s Life and Works<br/>    Hope Eghagha is a poet, playwright and novelist born in 1959 in Burutu, Mereje in Okpe Delta State. He attended Zik Grammer School, Sapele (1972-76) and Baptist High School, Port Harcourt, River State (1976-1978) after which he went for higher education. He graduated from the Department of Theater Arts, UNIJOS. He obtained his MA and PhD at University of Lagos in 1984 and 1994 respectively. He is a lecturer at University of Lagos and  he has also taught at Ondo State University (1993-4) and Delta State University, Abraka (2004-5). He is better known as a poet. He has four collections: Rhythm of the Last Testament, This Story Must Not Be Told, The Governor’s Lodge and Premonitions and other Dreams. His only novel is entitled Emperors of Salvation and his play is entitled Death, Not a Redeemer.<br/>     Apart from being a writer and a lecturer at University of Lagos, Eghagha was politically conscious. For instance, he served as the commissioner for Higher Education in Delta State between 2009 and 2014. He was held captive by kidnappers and upon his release, he returned to classroom as a lecturer.<br/>     He has earned local and international honours for his legendary  creativity. For instance, the USA government honored him with a fellowship award. He also enjoyed Ford Foundation Grant (2007) and that same year, he was honoured with Pat Utomi Award for Literary Excellence.<br/>1.2 Purpose of Study<br/>    This study investigates the distinctive nature of Niyi Osundare’s elegiac poems in his collection Songs of the Season and those of Hope  Eghagha in his collection, Mama Dances into the Night and other Poems.<br/>1.3 Scope of Study<br/>     This study is limited to Niyi Osundare’s selected elegiac poems in his Song of the Season and Hope Eghagha’s elegiac poems in his Mama Dances into the Night and Other Poems.<br/> 1.4 Methodology<br/>    The method employed in this study is qualitative. A thorough textual analysis of Osundare and Eghagha’s selected poems is carried out with reference to  relevant materials sourced from  literary journals and the internet. A comparative interpretation of their elegiac poems is carried out based on the researcher’s knowledge. <br/>1.5 Theoretical Background<br/>    The general concept of elegy forms the critical background on which this study is based. Different scholars’ perceptions on the elegiac tradition are employed in our efforts to understand Osundare and Eghagha’s elegiac poems.<br/>    Marjorie Boulton defines elegy as “a poem mourning the death of an individual, or occasionally a group of people, or all mankind” (106). The main argument of Boulton is that elegy is a poem that mourns. Elegy reflects on life generally and the painful inevitability of death M. J. Murphy echoes Boulton’s definition when he defines elegy as “a poem of mourning written on the death of a person” (88). Murphy and Boulton agree that an elegy grieves or laments the passing away of an individual.<br/>     M.H. Abrams and Geoffery Harpham argue that:<br/> In Greek and Roman times, “elegy|” denoted any poem written in elegiac meter (alternating hexameter and pentameter lines). The term was also used, however, to refer to the subject matter of change and loss frequently expressed in the elegiac verse form, especially in complaint about love. In accordance with this latter usage, “The Wanderer” “The Seafarer,” and other poems in Old English on the transcience of all worldly things are now called elegies. In Europe and England the word continued to have a variable application through the Renaissance… in the seventeenth century the term elegy began to be limited to its most common present usage. A formal and sustained lament in verse for the death of a particular person, usually ending in a consolation. (77)<br/> Abrams and Harpham try to explore the historical origin of elegy with emphasis on the fact that it is an expression of sorrow and grief on the death of an individual. Their definition also argues that life is a transcient journey which ends with death. Elegies are therefore written as an expression of grief emanating from the sorrowful departure of an individual.<br/>    Elegy is a powerful literary ink in which memories of legends and even ordinary people are preserved. Niyi Osundare in “Adekunle Fajuyi and the Politics of Remembrance” identifies the place of elegy in memory preservation:<br/>Remembrance is action actual. To a great extent, memory approximates the state of being; Remembrance the process of becoming. Memory is the giant eagle at the bottom of the Iroko; Remembrance is the wing which gets it to its coveted place on the tallest branch. If memory is the temple, remembrance is the priest who airs its ardent supplications. Because memory is so silent and remembrance such a rare virtue, we strive to cheat Oblivion with statues, plagues, sculptures, paintings, myths, and tendentious facts. We inscribe eloquent epitaphs on the grave of the silent dead and humour their hubris with defiant elegies. (Web)<br/> In line with Osundare’s argument, elegy is a literary preservative with which memory are kept. That is, elegies do not lament the passing on of human souls alone, they also keep memory alive. The definition of elegy remains peculiar to every community. That is, different people and communities define elegy based on their own cultural orientation. According to The Oxford Handbook of the Elegy, “the elegy remains remarkably ill-defined: sometimes used as a catch-all to dominate texts of a sober or pessimistic tone, sometimes as a marker for textual monumentalizing, and sometimes strictly as a sign of a lament for the dead” (1). The main subject matters of elegy bother on sorrowful loss. This is because elegies are essentially rendered with a pessimistic tone D.A Powell adds that, “the elegiac mode has three kinds of structures: one with a turn form grief to consolation. One with a turn from grief to the refusal of consolation, and one from grief to deeper grief” (40). An elegy therefore expresses a sorrowful message, however, it may ends with resignation to fate or expression of hope in a world to come.<br/>Free Online Encyclopedia defines elegy and makes efforts to differentiate it from “eulogy” This is put thus:<br/> An elegy is a meditative lyric poem that has a very mournful and melancholy tone. It is usually written to mourn the death of a close friend or loved one, but also occasionally mourns humanity as a whole. Although this form of poetry reflects on the notion of death, it is not to be confused with a “eulogy” which is a speech that gives tribute to a person, usually after the person has died. (Web)<br/> Celebration of the dead and the need to preserve their memories make poets compose elegies. As stated in the above quotation, elegy also “mourns humanity as a whole”. In perilous times when people die in great numbers, elegies are composed to celebrate their horrific departure.<br/>     There is a genre of elegy known as pastoral elegy. This type of elegy dwells on rural or rustic life of ordinary people mostly shepherds in country sides (villages). This type of elegy celebrates the pure or simple life rural dwellers led before they die. How these people lived in harmony with nature is also celebrated. A good example of pastoral elegy is Thomas Gray’s “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard.”  Christian or devotional elegy is sometimes associated with pastoral elegy. This is because it largely describes both religious and pastoral or rustic life of people who led a virtuous life while on earth. John Milton’s “Lycida” is a good example of Christian elegy. It focuses on subject matters of spirituality from the notion of Christians and pagans. However, there are elements of pastoral elegy in it. Therefore it can be described as Christian pastoral elegy.<br/>    From the foregoing, elegy can be described as a form of poetry that mourns the passing away of the dead. It reflects their lives and in the case of legends, it dwells on their achievements and contributions to human progress. Memory and elegy also go together. As a matter of fact, elegies try to recall the past in order to project the future. In other words, elegies express futility, hope, frustration or disillusionment as their conclusions. Interpretation of selected Osundare and Eghagha’s elegies are based on series of comments scholars have made on elegies as quoted in this study’s theoretical background.<br/>1.6 Review of Criticism<br/> Niyi Osundare and Hope Eghagha have enjoyed critics’ attentions due to the humanistic nature of their works. In this review, all the critical comments Osundare’s works have generated will be considered. This is to enrich our knowledge of his poetry. Moreover, the few materials on Eghagha’s Mama Dances into the Night and Other Poems are also reviewed.<br/>     Osundare can be rightly referred to as African William Wordsworth because of his love for nature,  man and his environment. In a comparative study on Wordsworth and Osundare, Kola Eke asserts that, “Osundare actually abides by the Wordsworthian  principle reading the portrayal of a low subject” (119). It means that Osundare subscribes to the Wordsworthian tenets guiding poetic composition. Apart from looking at poetry form a nature’s point of view, both poets deploy language in the same way. In the submission of Eke:<br/> The Nigerian poet’s praxis contradicts the poetic theory about the language of poetry, but if one interprets poetic principles such as Wordsworth and Osundare’s in the narrowest terms. Neither Wordsworth nor Osundare were really saying that the language of poetry should in no way differ from the language of prose. They both, however, suggesting that there is a poetic language that does not belong to the educated, and that poetry should not be reduced to mechanical, precious word play. (199)<br/> Eke’s argument centers on Wordsworth and Osundare’s interest in accurate poetic language. A language that projects their works by making it easier for everyone to understand their message. They are of the opinion that poetic language “does not belong only to the educated” (119).<br/>    The love for nature is at the forefront of Osundare’s works. It is worthy of note that he believes in the power of language too. According to Felix N. Ogoanah and Ray N. Chikogu, “ Osundare is considered today a most adventurous poet not only in terms of his peculiar use of sound, imagery and exploration of his native Yoruba cultural essence but also in terms of his deliberate linguistic creations and  the general organic alignment of his entire verbal system” (68). The use of language is important to Osundare as such he employs and deploys masses friendly languages. A language that is mass oriented here means language that can wake slumbering minds and spur the oppressed into action. Ogoanah and Chikogu therefore argue that Osundare’s quests for a poetic “quintessential language” is striking.<br/>     Osundare is also a well known poetic activist. His poetry always arises in defence of nature and the down trodden. Oyeniyi Okunoye in his submission holds that:<br/> Osundare’s celebration of the masses provides him an occasion to satirize the politicians who, in his judgment, constitute the privileged social formation. Songs of the Market Place (1983), Village Voices (1984), and Songs of the Season (1990) present a materialist survey of Nigerian society, amplifying the necessity of liberating the masses whose plight is traced to the apathy, ineptitude and lack of foresight of their leaders. (25)<br/>Okunoye argues that satire against failure of leadership has been the focus of Osundare. As a model of justice who seeks social justice for his people, Osundare quests to expose the hypocrisy of African visionless leaders. In his poetry, he often condemns weakness in African politicians. <br/>    Asomwan S. Adaoboyin is of the opinion that Osundare is dramatic in his poetry. He praises his ability to manipulate different characters’ voices. This he puts thus:<br/>It is observable in Songs of the Season that Osundare also strives to maintain good report with his addressers. He often achieves an informal tone in the many voices, he brings to confront the reader. These voices appear as subject in his ‘songs’ he brings to confront the reader. These voices and these subjects often lay bare their feeling and deep emotions; for example, ‘Song of the Jobless Graduate.’ (SOS 11)<br/>Adaoboyin holds the opinion that Osundare’s style is unique .He composes his poetry beyond the scope of expressing just his emotional feelings. In line with Adaoboyin’s observation, Osundare makes his poems dramatic such that one can hear different voices. Sometimes, his poems achieve their dramatic style through his use of dialogue. For instance, Songs of the Season as rightly pointed out by Adaoboyin has dramatic tone that makes it lively. Osundare is therefore a creative poet who gives dramatic flavour to his poems. <br/>    Olutoyin Jegede in his own submission claims that most of Osundare’s poems rely on Yoruba traditional folklore especially proverbs. He argues that:<br/>There is an exploration of the traditional folklore of the writer’s Yoruba (Ekiti) background. His poetry is given its own artistry that is based on the Yoruba culture of lyricism, musicality, fluidity, vividness and directness in simple images and proverbs use; ideas are developed in the images of the drum… since the formalistic devices of proverbs are integral to oral nuances, Osundare employs them as useful tools .(37)<br/> Jegede’s observation is apt since it points out the beauty of Osundare’s poetry. The beauty of Osundare’s poetry lies in his employment of local contents (imageries and proverbs) based on Yoruba oral tradition. His choice of Yoruba oral tradition, that is, proverbs in his poetry makes his works distinctive. Osundare uses proverbs to give metaphoric meaning to his messages. That is, through the use of proverbs, he Satires bad leaders and encourages them to wise up. F. Odughemi opines that Osundare is a class poet singer whose songs have the power to transpose a human’s mind. Odughemi observes that Osundare “belts out his songs as though in a joyful trance. He sweeps you from moonrise to moonset. Imagine yourself by the magic seas of a moonlit night lying on a carpet of songs, floating whimsically in the ‘soft windiness’ of this night of the gods” (Web). Osundare is celebrated for his poetic ability to transform the human souls and minds with his melodious songs. The title of his collection Songs of the Season suggests that the poems are music oriented. This is the position of Odugbemi.<br/>     Among great artists and activist, Osundare is a force to reckon with. With his Marxist oriented works, he speaks for the oppressed and poor in his society. In recognition of this, Nesther N. Alu says that Osundare’s works “address a deluge of themes, which include corruption, poverty, and administrative mismanagement” (62). Unlike poets who solely dwell on personal issues, Osundare satirises societal problems that confront the defenseless. This makes him the “masses” voice. He takes it upon himself to quest for social justice. To support this assertion, Christopher Anyokwu comments that most of Osundare’s poems are “like songs of protest against all forms of injustice and inequality” (5). Truly,  Osundare protests against the heartlessness and vissionlesness of African leaders. Godwin J. Doki argues that most of his themes have their “preoccupation on the poor and down trodden in society” (66). As earlier stated, Osundare identifies with the weak by exposing the leadership problems that cause most societal problems they suffer. Osundare laments just to get help for the masses. His lamentation takes the form of complaint against maladministration and as such Eke argues that Osundare “remains the finest and most deeply felt creations in modern Nigerian elegy” (100). With all sincerity, Osundare’s works lament bad leadership and poverty in his society and  nay, Africa as a whole.<br/>     Eghagha’s Mama Dances into the Night and Other Poems has not attracted much reviews. The available comments found are reviewed in this study. Sunny Awhefeda praises Eghagha’s focus in his elegiac collection. Awhefeda argues that:<br/>The significance of Mama Dances into the Night and Other Poems lies in Eghagha’s ability to reframe the nation’s tortured sojourn through metaphors that are ordinarily not connected with the bare facts of socio-historical and political expediency… It is this indirectness that Eghagha adopts in many of the poems that bear the weight of Nigeria’s socio-political malaise. However, this style runs the danger of obscuring meaning, even as paradoxically, the lexis strives for openness. (99)<br/>Awhefeda praise Eghagha‘s creativity which has been the strength of his poems. A peculiar creativity Eghagha displays in his poetry is indirectness. In most of his satirical works, Eghagha hardly mentions anybody’s names and this shields him from being assaulted. Moreover, it enables him to hit his satirical targets with ease. Chris Anyokwu further argues that:<br/>In Hope Eghagha’s poetry we encounter the Udje secular song-poetry elements writ large as he freely draws upon his indigenous oral sources. He is therefore the satiric persona in his work while his butt is the adversaries, i.e., politicians, church leadership and sundry social types. In fact, much of Eghagha’s poetry can be said to be Jeremiad owing to its accusatory and starkly denunciatory tone. To be certain, 20th – and – 21st century Nigerian (African) poetry looms in satiric achievement. (5)<br/>It is with the kind of tone Anyokwu describes that Eghagha captures his poems under consideration. He decries the bitter treatment he receives as a result of his mother’s death and his personal loss. Sometimes, Eghagha employs a poetic style that enables him to drive home his argument. This view is noted by Chinaka C. Mgbaojirikwe and Okoronkwo Onyebuchi in their submission which states that:<br/> As poet, Eghagha focuses on the social environment and how its structural composition affects various structural units in the society. For the poet, the structure of the society reflects oppression of the majority by the minority. His poetry consequently portrays various forms of social vices such as oppression, exploitation, corruption, injustice, insincerity, apathy, hypocrisy and betrayal, and presents them as driving forces to help the oppressed masses struggle for equitable distribution of resources. The study further demonstrates that this explicational approach facilitates access to the poet's thematic foci which realize the immense constraints of society, and seek to use art as a revolutionary tool to salvage it. Equally, through the treatment of style - language, imagery and symbols, and graphological patterns —insights are got on how the consciousness of the masses is shaped towards revolutionary action against social vices. The study discovers that the style of the poet is soused with the theme of revolutionary impulse which helps to bring out the exquisiteness in the poetry. Ultimately, the research concludes that a study of revolutionary impulse in the poetry of Eghagha could offer a revolutionary understanding and mindset to the poetry of most contemporary Nigerian poets. (Web)<br/>Mgbojirikwe and Onyebuchi believe Eghagha’s style is central to his creativity. Through his style, he is able to project his message effortlessly. This unique ability is the secret of Eghagha’s success as far as his poetry is concerned.<br/>From the available literature review, no work is found that studied the two collections under this literary investigation. The nearest work to our line of investigation is that of Eke which carried out some research on Osundare’s elegies. It is not detailed enough so this study aims to expand it. From the foregoing, this work presents itself researchable<br/>1.7  Thesis Statement<br/>Celebration of heroes, expression of hope and the exploration of African world view on death are central to the elegiac traditions of Hope Eghagha and Niyi Osundare as portrayed in their collections: Mama Dances into the Night and other Poems and Songs of the Season respectively.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE ELEGIAC

WILL<br/>\r\n COME</span></b></p>Abstract<br/>African society has been plagued by patriarchy which subjugates women and their rights as humans. Societal laws and local traditions or customs are constructed in favour of men. Therefore, men lord it over women especially in marriage. Sefi Atta’s Everything Good Will Come and BuchiEmecheta’s Second-class Citizen are feminist texts which explore women’s plights with the view to dismantling patriarchy. This study examines the intellectual, economic and socio- cultural emancipation of women deployed in the texts employed for this study. This study realizes that women who are self- reliant and assertive easily check whatever can limit their and rights freedom in society especially in marriage. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>  Introduction<br/>1.0 Life and Works of the Author    -    -    -    -    -    --    <br/>1.1Scope of Study-    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>Purpose of Study-    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>Methodology-    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>1.4 Theoretical Background    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>1.5 Review of Criticism    -    -    -    -            -    -    -<br/>1.6 Thesis Statement    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTERTWO<br/>INTELLECTUALLIBERATION   -        -               -                  <br/> CHAPTER THREE<br/>ECONOMICEMANCIPATION               -              -                 -         <br/>CHAPTERFOUR<br/>SOCIO-CULTURALEMANCIPATION                        -            -            <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>Conclusion-           -             -                -            -                   -                   -             -<br/>Works Cited    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>CHAPTERONE<br/>1.0 Life and Works of Authors<br/>BuchiEmecheta was born on 21 July 1944, in Lagos, Nigeria.

Relevant scholarly comments on the texts are cited under reviews of criticism. In addition, articles in online and print journals are used to support this study. The literary concept of feminism is employed in the analysis and evaluation of the primary texts.<br/>1.4 Theoretical Background<br/>Estelle Freedmandefinesfeminism as “a belief that although women and men are inherently of equal worth, most societies privilege men as a group. As a result, social movements are necessary to achieve political equality between women and men, with the understanding that gender always intersects with other social hierarchies”(Web). M. H. Abrams, defines it:<br/>as a distinctive and concerted approach to literature, feminist criticism was not inaugurated until late in the 1960s. Behind it, however, lie two centuries of struggle for the recognition of women’s cultural roles and achievements, and for women’s social and political rights, marked by such books as Mary Wollstonecraft’s A Indication of Rights ofWomen (1792), John Stuart Mill’s TheSubjectionofwomen (1869), and the American Margaret Fuller’s WomanintheNineteenthCentury (1845). Much of feminist literary criticism continues in our time to be interrelated with the movement by political feminist for social, legal, and cultural freedom and equality. (93)<br/>Abrams’ definition is apt because it gives detailed information about feminism. It gives a critical insight into the suffering of women and efforts they have made so far. YetundeOlukemiAkorede argues further  that :<br/>Women’s resistance to perceived social, political and economic injustice led to the formation of women’s groups which had the goal of fighting for women. Politically, in the early American society women were not involved in voting and decision-making. They could not be voted in as members of the congress, and, as such had no political position. They could not be voted in as a member of their sex. At the same time in Britain, the bills of right passed by the parliament did not cater for the right of women because they were too political insignificant and voiceless.(10)<br/>For many centuries, many women especially those royal blood suffer discrimination. This gave rise to agitations for women freedom. Feminism means different things to women across the world. Charles E. Bressler comments on types of feminist movement. According to him ,“three somewhat distinct, geographical strains of feminism have emerged. American feminism is essentially textual, stressing repression; British feminism is essentially Marxist, stressing oppression; and French feminism is essentially psychoanalytic, stressing repression. All groups, however, attempt to rescue women from being considered “the Other”(150). This means that the Western culture has a poor representation of women but  in order to protect the place of women in society, feminist movements are encouraged. Those who perceive oppression and repression in patriarchy quest for women freedom. Patriarchy gives men rights which women find unjust. John EbimoboweiYeseibo argues that, “ patriarchy in its widest definition means the manifestation and institutionalization of male dominance over  women and children in the family and the extension of male dominance over women in society in general. It implies that men hold power in all the important institutions of society and that women are deprived of society and women are deprived of access to such power” (139). What this implies is that men suppress women in society and this puts women behind men.<br/>The systems of the world are controlled by men and this has led to different classifications and suppression of women. BarbaraSmith holds that, \"feminism is the political theory and practice to free all women: women of color, working-class women, poor women, physically challenged women, lesbians, old women --as well as white economically privileged heterosexual women. Anything less than this is not feminism, but merely female self-aggrandizement (Wb). Women, regardless of class, colour , race and orientation about life, have the right to enjoy freedom of expression over personal affairs. It is on this note that MillicentGarrettFawcett says that feminism’s goal is to give every woman \"the opportunity of becoming the best that her natural faculties make her capable of \"(Web). This will guarantee women the democratic rights to enjoy a good life in society dominated by men.<br/>          Feminism fights against oppression and suppression of women and this has made it popular among world leading female writers. Emecheta’sSecond Class Citizen and Atta’s  Everything Good Will Come are feminist texts which speak against injustice. The literary theory of feminism is used in this study to explain the concept of emancipation which Atta and Emecheta’s works dwell on.<br/>1.5 Review of Criticism<br/>Sefi Atta’s Everything Good Will Come has enjoyed scholarly comments. AttehOluwaseun Deborah posits that it is “a novel of growth.” As a  novel of growth, it describes the development of a young girl who tries to navigate life from childhood to adulthood. Accordingly, Atteh says that, “it reflects the experiences of a female character and attempts to overcome the constraints placed on females in Nigerian society” (175). Nigerian is a tough society where both the young and old have to overcome many challenges to survive. Femi Morgan equally observes that, “Enitan also finds herself struggling with the concept of religion and morality. The incessant conflicts in her family which further heightened the incessant health failure of her sickle-cell brother, who eventually passed on. Her mother, an escapist seeks succor from marginalization and a broken marriage in a white garment church. (Web). In order to have a balanced growth and development, a child in a bildungsroman like EverythingGoodWillCome must overcome personal, family and societal challenges. Atteh notes that the personality of the novel’s central character is weaved around both family and societal difficulties, “Enitan, the heroine in the novel, springs from a privileged background. She is even sent out of the country for her first degree and returns home as a lawyer. Because of her exposure through her father and through her experiences in the Western World, she learns self-assertion that “young girls do not have to slave in the kitchen any more” (175). Atta draws readers’ attention to a changing world where women are taking their rightful places in society. She presents female characters who challenge aged long societal norms that patriarchy is built on. The central character and heroine of the novel therefore grows from a voiceless dependent child to an assertive independent woman. The U.K magazine Times Literary Supplement writes that the novel is, “a beautifully paced stroll in the shoes of women growing up in a country struggling to find its post independent identity… Everything Good WillCome depicts the struggle women face in a conservative society. This is convincing, more remarkable is what the novel has to say about the need to spark out when all around is falling apart” (9).The fact that African society is tough as depicted in the novel is commented on by BuchiEmecheta. She admires the novel’s style of recounting life in Lagos. This she puts thus, “Everything Good Will Come is like listening to an old friend recounting and bringing up to date and to life the happenings of our beloved city of Lagos. I was sorry when I came to the end. (The novel’s Blurb)..Truly , the 201st Century women have boldly come out to challenge their male dominated society.<br/>    As females quest against patriarchy, gender tensions are created in society. Ayo Kehinde and Joy EbongMbipom argue that Atta writes EverythingGoodWillCome with the view to “projecting the tensions which ensue from the clash between traditionalism and the different faces and phases of modernization in Nigeria. She gives preference to the attempt at subverting stifling policies which affect women’’ (66). As rightly observed by Kehinde and Mbipom , the novel reflects 21st Century women who struggle on the same pedestrian with men in their effort to assert themselves as humans who are not to be seen as extension of men. It is on this note thatEnitan’s mother abandons her matrimonial home in favour of freedom and Sheri does not think twice before breaking the arms of her annoying lover. In his reaction to this development, Olanipekun Sunday Shola argues that modern women do not wish to be seen as object for sexual gratification. His submission is put thus:<br/>In a patriarchal society, women tend to find fulfillment in life only in child-bearing and home making without proper consideration for the empowerment of women politically, economically and socially as seen from the novel Everything Good Will Come through the poem in page 53 whereby the analogical disposition between the “Banana tree” that bears fruit every year with the image of women folk portrays the spirit of feminism as a symbol of sex object and child-bearing. (Web)<br/>From Olanipekun’s comment, it is evident that women have come to an age where they choose when they want to born and when they do not want to. This accounts for the sharp increasement in the use of contraceptives among African women. The various methods of birth control is a challenge to patriarchy which wants women to have as many children as their husbands want. <br/>.   HelonHabila in the epilogue of the novel writes that the novel is “a courageous story about friendship and self discovering. It is a rallying cry to women to speak out in a world that tries to muzzle them” (The novel’s Blurb). According to OlayinwolaAkande, the novel “is a contemporary work that brings back memories of the past. The novel features back-to-back military coups and the deadly Biafran civil war that nearly consumed Nigeria after retraces Nigeria’s political unrest to military regimes that controlled country before the proper crystallization of democracy’’ (14). OdiaOfeimun notes that, “Sefi Atta’s first novel has the nerve to redefine existing traditions of African story telling. It confronts the familiar passions of a city and a country with unusual insights and a lyrical power pointing our literature to truly height” (The novel’s Blurb).          <br/>Emecheta’sSecondClassCitizen according to Abioseh Michael Porter is a novel of development. In his assertion he says that, “it is my view, however, that if Second Class Citizen were read as a novel of personal development (bildungsroman), some of the seeming inconsistencies within the text would be more fully understood. Also, a look at this work as a novel dealing with a young African woman's gradual acquisition of knowledge about herself as a potential artist and about the themes of love, marriage, and the subject of student life overseas”(124). Porter is of the view that the message of the novel can better be appreciated if it is looked at as a bildungsroman. It is traces the personal development of the novel’s heroine and how she overcomes her tough challenges. Upon the heroine’s arrival in a foreign land, she learns to embrace the western culture which favours a woman’s desire to live above the shackles of patriarchy. EnoEkpenyongUmana posits that; <br/>Emecheta’sSecond-Class Citizen, a semi-autobiographical novel addresses issues that militate against women especially in the Igbo traditional society Umana (2010). This is so because in the Igbo society, the female child is insignificant. She is regarded as a second-class human being. Her welfare is not of concern to her parents. Such is the fate of the protagonist, Adah, in Emecheta’sSecond-Class Citizen.”(2)<br/>Being an African with a western orientation, Emecheta writes to satirise all African institutions that suppress women’s freedom. Marriage is one of such institutions that hinders women’s freedom and personal happiness. CharlseC .Fonchingong looks at the treatment of marriage in the novel with emphasis on its effects on women. According to him:<br/>Emecheta sees the motif of marriage as a form of slavery for the woman. In her Secondclass citizen (1974) Francis is presented as a feudal lord who stays at home and feeds faton the labour of her serf wife – Adah. Adah is saddled with a husband who is perpetually unemployed and does not bring home a dime. She assumes the breadwinning role, does housekeeping and looks after the children. At night she is forced to give into Francis’ incessant demands for his “sex rights”. As if these were not enough Francis would beat her up and destroy the hard-earned property.(143)<br/>As illustrated in the novel, Fonchingong studies the depiction of marriage as an exploitative institution which suffocates women. Society allows men to subordinate women and even marginalise them. This has rendered many women worthless as they are often left at the mercy of men. Longjam Bedana1 and SangeetaLaishram contend that the novel centres on migrants’ search for an acceptable home and culture in a hostile land. According to them:<br/>the protagonist’s quest for identity and home in BuchiEmecheta‟s novel Second ClassCitizen [is] born out of the sense of dislocation, sexism and racism. At first Adah rejects the prevailing culture and lifestyle of England. She is socially as well as culturally alienated in the new country. However, she gradually gets adapted to the new culture which gives birth to a new life of a promising writer at the backdrop of sexism as well as racism … Emecheta‟s protagonist after a constant fight against sexism and racism, embraces an identity which allowed her to voice as a writer and welcomes a second home in England which gave freedom from traditional patriarchal oppression and stereotyping of African women. (35)<br/>Upon her arrival in England ,Adah sees the need to fight against matrimonial injustice and this she does at the expense of her marriage. To wear a new social identity, she boldly faces her husband and puts a stop to his oppressive tendency.  Grace O. Olutayo, and ChideraIlechukwu examine the novel from a linguistic point of view. Emecheta’ use of language capture their attention and they sincerely study it with emphasis on its contribution to the message of the text. Olutayo and Ilechukwu argue that:<br/>The lexico-semantic analysis of this work entailed the use of collocates for cohesion, simile and metaphor for comparison, irony for humour, hyperbole for .Emecheta tapped from the wide varieties of English idioms to enrich the narrative. Her sense of humour is reflected in her ironic statements and in her use of simile and metaphor. It was also discovered that words like “second-class”, “sub-standard”, “female child”, “inferior” and “black” are scattered in the text. These words are often contrasted with words like “first-class”, “male” and “white”. The use of these contrasting words echo the central ideas of the novel which are the female child is seen as a second-class human being (degradation of the female), and the blacks in England are seen as second-class citizens (racism). (10)<br/>Emecheta really uses creative words to convey her message. These words are used to capture and describe the social realities of women endure in their quest for identity in every society they find themselves. They conclude that , “the use of language is a significant part of the meaning of the novel as it reveals the setting and themes. The language is straightforward and this makes for a smooth reading of the text. Emecheta‟sSecond-Class Citizen is characterised by figurative, idiomatic and proverbial expressions. Her sense of humour is contagious and this relaxes the reader and aids the enjoyment of the novel” (10). It is obvious that the beauty of the novel lies in Emecheta’s language-use ability. This enables her to paint a beautiful picture of characters who struggle hard to end their disappointment about life especially in a foreign land. <br/> From all the works seen on BuchiEmecheta’sSecondClassCitizen and Sefi Atta’s   Everything Good Will Come, none has discussed the concept of emancipation nor combines the two texts. This essay ventures into a new study with emphasis on women liberation as illustrated in Emecheta’sSecondClassCitizen andSefi Atta’s EverythingGoodWillCome.<br/>1.6 Thesis Statement<br/>           This essay posits that BuchiEmecheta’sSecondClassCitizen and Sefi Atta’s EverythingGoodWillCome depict economic, cultural and intellectual emancipation.<br/><br/>\n\nQUEST FOR WOMEN’S EMANCIPATION IN

WILL<br/>\r\n COME</span></b></p>Abstract<br/>African society has been plagued by patriarchy which subjugates women and their rights as humans. Societal laws and local traditions or customs are constructed in favour of men. Therefore, men lord it over women especially in marriage. Sefi Atta’s Everything Good Will Come and BuchiEmecheta’s Second-class Citizen are feminist texts which explore women’s plights with the view to dismantling patriarchy. This study examines the intellectual, economic and socio- cultural emancipation of women deployed in the texts employed for this study. This study realizes that women who are self- reliant and assertive easily check whatever can limit their and rights freedom in society especially in marriage. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>  Introduction<br/>1.0 Life and Works of the Author    -    -    -    -    -    --    <br/>1.1Scope of Study-    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>Purpose of Study-    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>Methodology-    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>1.4 Theoretical Background    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>1.5 Review of Criticism    -    -    -    -            -    -    -<br/>1.6 Thesis Statement    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTERTWO<br/>INTELLECTUALLIBERATION   -        -               -                  <br/> CHAPTER THREE<br/>ECONOMICEMANCIPATION               -              -                 -         <br/>CHAPTERFOUR<br/>SOCIO-CULTURALEMANCIPATION                        -            -            <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>Conclusion-           -             -                -            -                   -                   -             -<br/>Works Cited    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>CHAPTERONE<br/>1.0 Life and Works of Authors<br/>BuchiEmecheta was born on 21 July 1944, in Lagos, Nigeria.

Relevant scholarly comments on the texts are cited under reviews of criticism. In addition, articles in online and print journals are used to support this study. The literary concept of feminism is employed in the analysis and evaluation of the primary texts.<br/>1.4 Theoretical Background<br/>Estelle Freedmandefinesfeminism as “a belief that although women and men are inherently of equal worth, most societies privilege men as a group. As a result, social movements are necessary to achieve political equality between women and men, with the understanding that gender always intersects with other social hierarchies”(Web). M. H. Abrams, defines it:<br/>as a distinctive and concerted approach to literature, feminist criticism was not inaugurated until late in the 1960s. Behind it, however, lie two centuries of struggle for the recognition of women’s cultural roles and achievements, and for women’s social and political rights, marked by such books as Mary Wollstonecraft’s A Indication of Rights ofWomen (1792), John Stuart Mill’s TheSubjectionofwomen (1869), and the American Margaret Fuller’s WomanintheNineteenthCentury (1845). Much of feminist literary criticism continues in our time to be interrelated with the movement by political feminist for social, legal, and cultural freedom and equality. (93)<br/>Abrams’ definition is apt because it gives detailed information about feminism. It gives a critical insight into the suffering of women and efforts they have made so far. YetundeOlukemiAkorede argues further  that :<br/>Women’s resistance to perceived social, political and economic injustice led to the formation of women’s groups which had the goal of fighting for women. Politically, in the early American society women were not involved in voting and decision-making. They could not be voted in as members of the congress, and, as such had no political position. They could not be voted in as a member of their sex. At the same time in Britain, the bills of right passed by the parliament did not cater for the right of women because they were too political insignificant and voiceless.(10)<br/>For many centuries, many women especially those royal blood suffer discrimination. This gave rise to agitations for women freedom. Feminism means different things to women across the world. Charles E. Bressler comments on types of feminist movement. According to him ,“three somewhat distinct, geographical strains of feminism have emerged. American feminism is essentially textual, stressing repression; British feminism is essentially Marxist, stressing oppression; and French feminism is essentially psychoanalytic, stressing repression. All groups, however, attempt to rescue women from being considered “the Other”(150). This means that the Western culture has a poor representation of women but  in order to protect the place of women in society, feminist movements are encouraged. Those who perceive oppression and repression in patriarchy quest for women freedom. Patriarchy gives men rights which women find unjust. John EbimoboweiYeseibo argues that, “ patriarchy in its widest definition means the manifestation and institutionalization of male dominance over  women and children in the family and the extension of male dominance over women in society in general. It implies that men hold power in all the important institutions of society and that women are deprived of society and women are deprived of access to such power” (139). What this implies is that men suppress women in society and this puts women behind men.<br/>The systems of the world are controlled by men and this has led to different classifications and suppression of women. BarbaraSmith holds that, \"feminism is the political theory and practice to free all women: women of color, working-class women, poor women, physically challenged women, lesbians, old women --as well as white economically privileged heterosexual women. Anything less than this is not feminism, but merely female self-aggrandizement (Wb). Women, regardless of class, colour , race and orientation about life, have the right to enjoy freedom of expression over personal affairs. It is on this note that MillicentGarrettFawcett says that feminism’s goal is to give every woman \"the opportunity of becoming the best that her natural faculties make her capable of \"(Web). This will guarantee women the democratic rights to enjoy a good life in society dominated by men.<br/>          Feminism fights against oppression and suppression of women and this has made it popular among world leading female writers. Emecheta’sSecond Class Citizen and Atta’s  Everything Good Will Come are feminist texts which speak against injustice. The literary theory of feminism is used in this study to explain the concept of emancipation which Atta and Emecheta’s works dwell on.<br/>1.5 Review of Criticism<br/>Sefi Atta’s Everything Good Will Come has enjoyed scholarly comments. AttehOluwaseun Deborah posits that it is “a novel of growth.” As a  novel of growth, it describes the development of a young girl who tries to navigate life from childhood to adulthood. Accordingly, Atteh says that, “it reflects the experiences of a female character and attempts to overcome the constraints placed on females in Nigerian society” (175). Nigerian is a tough society where both the young and old have to overcome many challenges to survive. Femi Morgan equally observes that, “Enitan also finds herself struggling with the concept of religion and morality. The incessant conflicts in her family which further heightened the incessant health failure of her sickle-cell brother, who eventually passed on. Her mother, an escapist seeks succor from marginalization and a broken marriage in a white garment church. (Web). In order to have a balanced growth and development, a child in a bildungsroman like EverythingGoodWillCome must overcome personal, family and societal challenges. Atteh notes that the personality of the novel’s central character is weaved around both family and societal difficulties, “Enitan, the heroine in the novel, springs from a privileged background. She is even sent out of the country for her first degree and returns home as a lawyer. Because of her exposure through her father and through her experiences in the Western World, she learns self-assertion that “young girls do not have to slave in the kitchen any more” (175). Atta draws readers’ attention to a changing world where women are taking their rightful places in society. She presents female characters who challenge aged long societal norms that patriarchy is built on. The central character and heroine of the novel therefore grows from a voiceless dependent child to an assertive independent woman. The U.K magazine Times Literary Supplement writes that the novel is, “a beautifully paced stroll in the shoes of women growing up in a country struggling to find its post independent identity… Everything Good WillCome depicts the struggle women face in a conservative society. This is convincing, more remarkable is what the novel has to say about the need to spark out when all around is falling apart” (9).The fact that African society is tough as depicted in the novel is commented on by BuchiEmecheta. She admires the novel’s style of recounting life in Lagos. This she puts thus, “Everything Good Will Come is like listening to an old friend recounting and bringing up to date and to life the happenings of our beloved city of Lagos. I was sorry when I came to the end. (The novel’s Blurb)..Truly , the 201st Century women have boldly come out to challenge their male dominated society.<br/>    As females quest against patriarchy, gender tensions are created in society. Ayo Kehinde and Joy EbongMbipom argue that Atta writes EverythingGoodWillCome with the view to “projecting the tensions which ensue from the clash between traditionalism and the different faces and phases of modernization in Nigeria. She gives preference to the attempt at subverting stifling policies which affect women’’ (66). As rightly observed by Kehinde and Mbipom , the novel reflects 21st Century women who struggle on the same pedestrian with men in their effort to assert themselves as humans who are not to be seen as extension of men. It is on this note thatEnitan’s mother abandons her matrimonial home in favour of freedom and Sheri does not think twice before breaking the arms of her annoying lover. In his reaction to this development, Olanipekun Sunday Shola argues that modern women do not wish to be seen as object for sexual gratification. His submission is put thus:<br/>In a patriarchal society, women tend to find fulfillment in life only in child-bearing and home making without proper consideration for the empowerment of women politically, economically and socially as seen from the novel Everything Good Will Come through the poem in page 53 whereby the analogical disposition between the “Banana tree” that bears fruit every year with the image of women folk portrays the spirit of feminism as a symbol of sex object and child-bearing. (Web)<br/>From Olanipekun’s comment, it is evident that women have come to an age where they choose when they want to born and when they do not want to. This accounts for the sharp increasement in the use of contraceptives among African women. The various methods of birth control is a challenge to patriarchy which wants women to have as many children as their husbands want. <br/>.   HelonHabila in the epilogue of the novel writes that the novel is “a courageous story about friendship and self discovering. It is a rallying cry to women to speak out in a world that tries to muzzle them” (The novel’s Blurb). According to OlayinwolaAkande, the novel “is a contemporary work that brings back memories of the past. The novel features back-to-back military coups and the deadly Biafran civil war that nearly consumed Nigeria after retraces Nigeria’s political unrest to military regimes that controlled country before the proper crystallization of democracy’’ (14). OdiaOfeimun notes that, “Sefi Atta’s first novel has the nerve to redefine existing traditions of African story telling. It confronts the familiar passions of a city and a country with unusual insights and a lyrical power pointing our literature to truly height” (The novel’s Blurb).          <br/>Emecheta’sSecondClassCitizen according to Abioseh Michael Porter is a novel of development. In his assertion he says that, “it is my view, however, that if Second Class Citizen were read as a novel of personal development (bildungsroman), some of the seeming inconsistencies within the text would be more fully understood. Also, a look at this work as a novel dealing with a young African woman's gradual acquisition of knowledge about herself as a potential artist and about the themes of love, marriage, and the subject of student life overseas”(124). Porter is of the view that the message of the novel can better be appreciated if it is looked at as a bildungsroman. It is traces the personal development of the novel’s heroine and how she overcomes her tough challenges. Upon the heroine’s arrival in a foreign land, she learns to embrace the western culture which favours a woman’s desire to live above the shackles of patriarchy. EnoEkpenyongUmana posits that; <br/>Emecheta’sSecond-Class Citizen, a semi-autobiographical novel addresses issues that militate against women especially in the Igbo traditional society Umana (2010). This is so because in the Igbo society, the female child is insignificant. She is regarded as a second-class human being. Her welfare is not of concern to her parents. Such is the fate of the protagonist, Adah, in Emecheta’sSecond-Class Citizen.”(2)<br/>Being an African with a western orientation, Emecheta writes to satirise all African institutions that suppress women’s freedom. Marriage is one of such institutions that hinders women’s freedom and personal happiness. CharlseC .Fonchingong looks at the treatment of marriage in the novel with emphasis on its effects on women. According to him:<br/>Emecheta sees the motif of marriage as a form of slavery for the woman. In her Secondclass citizen (1974) Francis is presented as a feudal lord who stays at home and feeds faton the labour of her serf wife – Adah. Adah is saddled with a husband who is perpetually unemployed and does not bring home a dime. She assumes the breadwinning role, does housekeeping and looks after the children. At night she is forced to give into Francis’ incessant demands for his “sex rights”. As if these were not enough Francis would beat her up and destroy the hard-earned property.(143)<br/>As illustrated in the novel, Fonchingong studies the depiction of marriage as an exploitative institution which suffocates women. Society allows men to subordinate women and even marginalise them. This has rendered many women worthless as they are often left at the mercy of men. Longjam Bedana1 and SangeetaLaishram contend that the novel centres on migrants’ search for an acceptable home and culture in a hostile land. According to them:<br/>the protagonist’s quest for identity and home in BuchiEmecheta‟s novel Second ClassCitizen [is] born out of the sense of dislocation, sexism and racism. At first Adah rejects the prevailing culture and lifestyle of England. She is socially as well as culturally alienated in the new country. However, she gradually gets adapted to the new culture which gives birth to a new life of a promising writer at the backdrop of sexism as well as racism … Emecheta‟s protagonist after a constant fight against sexism and racism, embraces an identity which allowed her to voice as a writer and welcomes a second home in England which gave freedom from traditional patriarchal oppression and stereotyping of African women. (35)<br/>Upon her arrival in England ,Adah sees the need to fight against matrimonial injustice and this she does at the expense of her marriage. To wear a new social identity, she boldly faces her husband and puts a stop to his oppressive tendency.  Grace O. Olutayo, and ChideraIlechukwu examine the novel from a linguistic point of view. Emecheta’ use of language capture their attention and they sincerely study it with emphasis on its contribution to the message of the text. Olutayo and Ilechukwu argue that:<br/>The lexico-semantic analysis of this work entailed the use of collocates for cohesion, simile and metaphor for comparison, irony for humour, hyperbole for .Emecheta tapped from the wide varieties of English idioms to enrich the narrative. Her sense of humour is reflected in her ironic statements and in her use of simile and metaphor. It was also discovered that words like “second-class”, “sub-standard”, “female child”, “inferior” and “black” are scattered in the text. These words are often contrasted with words like “first-class”, “male” and “white”. The use of these contrasting words echo the central ideas of the novel which are the female child is seen as a second-class human being (degradation of the female), and the blacks in England are seen as second-class citizens (racism). (10)<br/>Emecheta really uses creative words to convey her message. These words are used to capture and describe the social realities of women endure in their quest for identity in every society they find themselves. They conclude that , “the use of language is a significant part of the meaning of the novel as it reveals the setting and themes. The language is straightforward and this makes for a smooth reading of the text. Emecheta‟sSecond-Class Citizen is characterised by figurative, idiomatic and proverbial expressions. Her sense of humour is contagious and this relaxes the reader and aids the enjoyment of the novel” (10). It is obvious that the beauty of the novel lies in Emecheta’s language-use ability. This enables her to paint a beautiful picture of characters who struggle hard to end their disappointment about life especially in a foreign land. <br/> From all the works seen on BuchiEmecheta’sSecondClassCitizen and Sefi Atta’s   Everything Good Will Come, none has discussed the concept of emancipation nor combines the two texts.

He is an avid catholic church man, a very successful businessman and most puzzlingly, he is also a brave and incompatible defender of democracy in Nigeria. <br/>The author of the novel denounces violence and oppression by Over-religious fathers, as the protagonist is empowered in the narrative to come out though her mother’s final act of self annihilation. <br/>LIFE AND WORK OF AUTHOR <br/>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie was born on September 15th, 1977. She is a writer from the Easter part of Nigeria. She has been called “The Most Prominent” of a profession of critically acclaimed young Anglophone authors that is succeeding in attracting a new generation of readers in African literature”. She was born in Enugu, but grew up in Nsukka where the University of Nigeria is situated. Her father a Professor of Statistics and her mother the Registrar of the University of Nigeria made sure she lacked nothing in her growing up age. <br/>Adichie studied Medicine and Pharmacy of the University of Nigeria for a year and half. During this period, she edited the “Compass, a Magazine run by the University’s Catholic Medical Students. At the age of 19, Adichie left Nigeria and moved to the United States for College.

She received a bachelor’s degree from Eastern where she graduates summa cum laude in 2001. <br/>In 2003, she completed a Master’s Degree in creative writing at John Hopkins University. In 2008, she received a Master of Arts in African studies in Yale University. <br/>She has written a number of short stories like “you in America’, that “Harmattan Morning” which won the O. Henry prize for the American embassy. She also won the David T. Wong international short story prize 2002/2003. The book received wide critical acclaim; it was shortlisted for the Orange prizes for fiction (2004) her second novel, “Half of a yellow sun”.

Adichie has delivered several high profile talks and lectures including “the danger of a single story for TED in 2009 and on March 15th, 2012 at the guildhall, London, the “connecting cultures” commonwealth lecture 2012.<br/>PURPOSE OF STUDY <br/>The purpose of this study is to examine how Nigerian novelists portray domestic violence in their works, but in this paper, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus will be the text to examine. <br/>The purpose of this text is also to examine how Purple Hibiscus, is typical of how the Nigerian novel engages itself in issues of ideology, and self assertion. <br/>SCOPE OF STUDY <br/>In Purple Hibiscus Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie tries to communicate ideas and meaning with appealing narrative devices. She also tries to communicate the negative effect of violence and oppression, through religious fanaticism. The novel is divided into four sections, and this will be examined in the course of this work. <br/>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY <br/>The method of getting information for this work in order to do a thorough job, includes information from the primary material while is the novel, Purple Hibiscus by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, library research, such as text books, research papers, internet materials and journals. In other words it is written as opposed to an oral research. <br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS: VIOLENCE AND OPPRESSION <br/>Violence<br/>The Oxford Learner’s Dictionary seventh edition defines violence as “violent behaviour that is indented to hurt or kill somebody”. Violence as presented in Purple Hibiscus ranges from within the family to the larges society. <br/>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie uses her novel Purple Hibiscus to portray domestic violence within the family.  <br/>Oppression <br/>Wikipedia.com, defines oppression as the exercise or authority or power in a burdensome, cruel, or unjust manner. Oppression as presented in is the irrationality of man to his fellow man. <br/>1.6 LITERATURE REVIEW <br/>Quite a number of writers have done numerous works on Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus and the significance of the story. Few of the writers include Bill Broun, Ranti Williams, on a review he titled “fiction”, A Moveable Feast, A Nigerians coming of age with her boisterous relatives yields appetizing results, he says, Americans have no problem eating a big Mac with their hands, but get then to venture into a West African Restaurant, where forming balls of fufu (a think yam porridge) with the fingers is de rigueur, and they will suddenly go Edwardian on you. “What? No Silver? If the breath taking debut of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie does nothing else (and it does considerably more), it shows that Nigerian gastronomy is a mannered and complex as anything in Europe or America. <br/>But Purple Hibiscus is more than a sub-Saharan version of Isak Dinesen’s “Babette’s Feast” with cassava lumps replacing baguettes. In this Maturation tale about the Shelter Kambili Achike, a fifteen-year-old Igbo girl of devastating shyness, the frequent meals help assert a vision of middle class life that impugn postcolonial pessimism and fear about Africa Adichie’s picture of Nigerian domesticity is troubled, to be sure – the story takes place in a time similar to Gen. Sani Abacha’s Junta years (1993-1998) and it shaped fundamentally by political upheavals around it. But so were the characters in Dinesen’s other famous work, out of Africa that quintessential fantasy of 20th century Africa where only whites are granted complex inferior lives. <br/>While the action mostly takes place after a coupled by an Abacha – like monster named Big Oga, the novel’s painstaking tensions more immediately unfold through a “food” problem at home. Kambili and her brother, jaja, have nervously returned after a Palm Sunday mass during which jaja definitely refused to eat communion because the “water”, he claims, gives him bad breath. For their tyrannical father, Eugene, this is a spiritual outrage and a family betrayer. A successful factory owner and politically daring newspaper publisher in the city of Enugu, and a Big Man within his Umunna, or extended family, Engene is generous and hardworking. But he uses Catholicism as a matrix of control over the ignorance and disorder he perceives around him. He finds pliant corroborations in the reactionary parish priest, father Benedict, a British Missionary who re-Latinizes the liturgy and frowns on lively Igbo handclapping in church. Kambilis mother, Beatrice, is a gentle but impotent character who softens but cannot stop Engenes relentless stamping out of “sin” and  imperfection. Part JFK, part citizen Charles Foster Kane, Eugene tells his daughter, “Because God has given you much, he expects much from you”. Indeed, far too much. <br/> Adichie is at her best in giving the traumatized Kambili a playful individual dignity that challenges  the humorless power-mongering of her father, and her country’s dictators. When Engene’s paper criticizes the dictatorship and is forced underground, Kambili refleds: “I knew that publishing underground meant that the newspaper would be published from a secret location. Yet I imagined … the staff in an office beneath the ground, on fluorescent lamp flooding the dark room, the men bent over their desks, writing the truth”. As Adichie later suggests, however, political truth has limitations. In this thinking, she is very much the 21st century daughter of other great Igbo novelist, Chinua Achebe. <br/>When Kambili and Jaja get the chance to visit their monthly Aunt Ifeoma, a University lecturer in the town of Nsukka, they go fearfully, carrying written schedules from their father in their pockets. Aunt Ifeoma takes the ridiculous schedules away, and both young people for the first time taste “a different kind of freedom”. They learn to appreciate the animistic spirit world of their papa-Nnukwu, or grandpa, the humble but infinitely happier meal – making Aunt Ifeoma’s boisterous family, and, through the denim-wearing priest named father Amadi, a more humane Catholicism. As the novels later tragedies hit, Kambili finds herself with an unexpectedly strong new emotional foundation, one based on cooperation, tolerance and female power. <br/>The novels organization is conventional, the prose muscular. One minor shortcoming is Adichie’s tendency to repeat certain imagery or gestures beyond thematic efficacy. The human throat and eyes are mentioned too often, as are Aunt Ifeoma’s and her family’s “Cacles”. Adichie, who was born in 1977, has time to refine her prose. <br/>And be warned: The eating never stops in Purple Hibiscus (the titular blooms are themselves edible, of course). Nearly every page holds something tasty: plates of jollof and coconut rice, botlles of cashew juice, road side vendors hawking bread in hot banana leaves, cow horns full of palm win. In one sense, the story  is long, spectacular meal of several seatings over several days. It enough to drive a hapless American to try cooking that most famous dish of west Afica egusi. Now will someone pass the fufu, please? Reviewed, Bill Broun ,Sunday, January 4, 2004, Bill Broun Lectures in the English Department at Yale University, where he is a resident follow at Timothy Dwight College                                      <br/>According to  Ranti Williams, on what he titled “An Igbo Patriarch”. <br/>Post-Colonial Nigeria has produced a notable tradition of prose writing from which comes Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s first novel, Purple Hibiscus, which tells of a teenager watching her family break down in a county that is doing the same. As in many post – colonial societies, the personal and political are inseparable. Although here the disintegration of the Nigerian State (a military coup takes place earlier in the story) is as nothing compared to the fracturing family at the centre of the novel. The events take place in Igbo land in Eastern Nigeria, and the narrator fifteen – year – old  Kambili, is the obedient, only daughter of a harsh Roman Catholic Patriarch, Eugene, a big man and wealthy local manufacture in the city of Enugu. Engene is the proprietor of a newspaper in which at considerable personal cost, he bravely champions freedom of speech against military tyranny at the same time as he rules his home with the most tyrannical of iron grips. <br/>Adichie builds a complex picture of a man struggling with his own demons, taking out his struggles on those he loves: his wife, Beatrice, son, Jaja, and Kambili herself. It should be hard to sympathize with a man who beats his pregnant wife and who, after deploring the soldiers torture of his editor with lighted cigarettes, pour boiling water over the very feet of his adored daughter as a punishment for coming second on class. And yet Engene  self-made and ultimately self nasing, is the books loneliest  character: his misunderstanding of Christianity has led him to reject the animist beliefs of his own ageing father and to repudiate the old man himself, perversely hating the sinner more than the sin. Kambili writes “her  father at one point: “it was…as if something weighed him down, something he could not throw off”. <br/>The novels picture of modern Nigeria is an authentic one; it depicts a land full of potentials and with an educated middle class, a country in which a coup can suddenly erupt and a local newspaper editor can be killed for what he writers; a place whose inhabitants are aware of their nations flaws and yet are fiercely patriotic, loath to emigrate until things get truly desperate. This the fate of Engenes sister, Ifeoma, a widowed university lecturer, Iter household is the opposite of Engene’s, she allows  her children’s relative freedom of expression and thus introduces Kambili and Jaja to a world beyond their strictly regimented home, with the result that they cannot return without the unraveling of their tightly wound family life. <br/>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s  main strength is dialogue as her characters speak, one hears the voices of modern Nigeria. Her descriptions, however, sometimes lack subtlety  and she has a tendency to overdo the symbolism: objects breaks as the family falls apart; the Purple Hibiscus runs rampant over the tidy garden as the children and their mother test their freedom. The narrative voice mostly convinces as the naïve tone of a sheltered child facing the adult world, although, at times Kambili can sound simply disingenuous. This is particularly true of the treatment of her school girl crush on the impossibly virtuous young catholic  curate, who is the books only unconvincing character. Over all Purple Hibiscus, which has been shortlisted for the commonwealth writers prize, is a compelling tale told well by a confident voice with much potential for the future “According to Norah Vawter”, Purple Hibiscus is the  debut novel of Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is a flavorful, intense story of an unhappy family, and also of Nigeria’s show recovery from colonialism. Kambili lives with her brother and parents in a huge compound in Enugu, Nigeria. A smart fifteen year old who is trying to overcome her shyness, Kambili narrates the story from beginning to end. She is one of those narrators who lets you read between the lines, who doesn’t give away too much, and often seems smarter than the adults. Around the bare bones of the plot, she wraps detail upon detail of domestic life. I could almost taste the moi-moi and cashew juice, could almost see the end and Purple Hibiscus in the flowerbeds. Our yard was wide enough to hold a hundred people dancing atilogu”, Adichie writes, “spacious enough for each dancer to do the usual somersaults and land on the next dander’ shoulder. The compound walls, topped by coiled electric wives, were so high I could not see the cars driving by on our street”. <br/>There is a long tradition in literature of oppressive and angry fathers. Kambili’s father has two sides, at least, each resonates clearly with the reader, making the father a complex and compelling character. A lesser author would have turned him into a simple villain. Adichie does not engine is a successful businessman, a pillar of the community who owns a factory and a newspaper that courageously condemns injustice. He is fiercely religious, devoted to Catholicism, to God and purity. He beats his wife and children ever time they sin or fail to live up to his expectations. Engine does rush them to the hospital on a number of occasions, and its obvious that  he cares for his family. Kambili and her brother Jaja, both teenagers, are almost machine  - like father’s wrath at all costs. Their mother, Beatrice, seems beaten down by the abuse she has taken and watched. She nurses the children’s would and chooses colour for the curtain. <br/>  What makes purple Hibiscus so interesting is the position of the family within the larges picture of Nigeria. This is a story about Nigeria’s recovery from colonialism because Engene was among the first generation to come to to school, children needed to convert to Christianity, so Engene and many of his contemporaries did. He takes the teaching so seriously that he condemns all practice of his native religion, and becomes uptight and self-righteous. Religion is everything. Perfection is the goal. He accepts nothing short of perfection from himself or his family. Every time they slip, he punishes them. Just how much he punishes himself I sup to the4 reader to ascertain. We are left wondering how deep the wounds go, and who we should root for. <br/>Purple Hibiscus begins with a nod to Chinua Achebe, “Things began to fall apart at home when my brother, Jaja, did not go to communion and papa flung his heavy missal across the room and broke the figurines on the etagere. “The novel tracks his family as the chilly, icebound other begins to break down, and something new replaces it. Visiting their aunt and her three children, Kambili and Jaja get a chance to see how a more ordinary, relaxed family functions. They come to know their “heathen grandfather, whom Eugene will not see because he insists on practicing his traditional Igbo religion.  For all its subtle, quiet storytelling, it is an exciting book, with too many climaxes to name. Adichie kept bricking me, making me think I had figured everything out before coming to yet another climatic scene.<br/>When I began reading this book, I thought it was of story of adolescence, of a bright young girl coming of age. I expected more hormones, more rebellion, more Kambili. Instead I find that Kambili is telling a story that is bigger than she is. She could be called a protagonist, but oftentimes her job is to watch, to try to understand, to follow. The narration is her chance to speak, something she rarely does in her life at the beginning. Painfully shy, even around her family, Purple Hibiscus gives Kambili the chance to find her own voice. <br/>The novel deals adeptly with themes of language and silence. It is written in English and peppered with Igbo, the local language that Kambili’s family speaks. The result is a text that seems richer and more layered than it would have otherwise, but there is more to this. Characters speak English is formal settings and Igbo in informal ones. The father rarely speaks Igbo. Sometimes when he is angry he speaks in Igbo; other times he says a very long prayer in English. <br/>Just as the book’s characters speak English in formal settings they also behave differently in public and private. Throughout the book, characters struggle with the task of communication. This is a novel of silence, of things left unsaid. It raises more questions than it answers. Is Kambili a storyteller, and why can she say things in her narrative that she would never say to her family? Why is silence so important to communication? This is no easy book. Early on, I thought it might have a moral or might fit into a box, but Adichie surprised me by showing how complex these characters really are. I would recommend purple hibiscus to anyone who loves a good psychological mystery when it is wrapped up as a literary novel or to anyone who wants to bedrawn into a story by elegant language and rebust plot. This is not a delicate novel. Several times I cringed as I read of the abuse Eugene was inflicting on his children and wife. But it’s not all depressing. Kambili’s cousin, Amaka, listens to Felakuti, is a fierce young feminist and asks tough questions.  Her whole family cackles when they laugh. There are scenes of laughter and warmth, laughter that is often earned as the relief from suffering.<br/>Overall, purple hibiscus is a keeper. It is sharp, passionate, and compelling. It drew me into the narrative like I was opine of the family and kept me interested like I had a personal stake in its conclusion.<br/>Norah Vawter is an intern at all Africa. Com, focusing on the book review page. She received her B.A. from the  College of William and Mary, where she studied English Literature and edited the fiction section of the William and Mary review.<br/>According to Liv Lewitchnik, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s debut novel, purple Hibiscus, describes a Nigerian family living in a country torn between contradictions. Although a military coup unsettles the population streets erupt with riots as soldiers hunt down dissenters the story’s main protagonist, Kambili, lives a protected life in Enugu. <br/>Fifteen year old Kambili, her brother, Jaja, and their mother enjoy luxurious comfort inside a large house. High walls topped with electric wire shut out any disruptions. Materialistic abundance is provided by the father of the family, Eugene. He owns several factories and a democratic newspaper, and is a devote catholic Eugene is driven by religion and freedom. He refuses to be silenced by the threat of military repercussions and prints the truth as violence escalates. Amnesty international even gives him human rights awards for his efforts.<br/>Being such a good citizen, it is surprising to discover  the tyrant inside Eugene. He rules his family with  won fist, forbidding them to speak Igbo in public as he proclaims English is the language of civilized people, punishing them severely for ungodly sins – such as not coming first in class – and forcing the children to follow meticulously planned schedules. Sleeping, eating and praying are measured in minutes alongside study and family time. The intensity grows when family life unfolds, laying bare the sickening behaviour of the fundamentalist father. <br/>Eugene’s rules and the house compound imprison the family – the youngsters are only allowed sparse contact with their grandfather, a non – catholic. Abuse and mental strain flow though the story, but Eugenes crazed influence is balanced against the sincere love his family feel for him. Adichie’s writing is compelling, confident and beautiful although her story narrates quietly – perfectly describing the shy and introverted Kambili. <br/>Low key language explains grim domestic oppression, but blooming words break with a claustrophobic world. Intricate descriptions of Nigerian food, flowers, plants and people make the book an explosion of colours, scents, culture and feelings. <br/>As the novel advances alongside a changing Nigeria, the family structure begins to crack. The threatening outside world seeps inside the thick compound walls. Eugene’s newspaper is forced to go underground. Even the fierce December wind that cloaks the world in red Sahara  sand is menacing, and the family take refuge in their whiter house in Nsukka where Eugenes sister, Ifeoma, and her three children live. <br/>Ifeoma’s liberating, strong character enters the novel with decisive steps, bright lipstic and roaring laughter surprising Kambili and Jaja with charm, warmth and openness. Outspoken and independent, Ifeoma fights against poverty and increasing instability at the university campus where she lectures. <br/>Kambili and Jaja go to stay in Aunty Ifeoma’s house and experience Nigerian everyday life for the first time. In the small flat, several people sleep in the same room, everyone helps with the washing up, the floors are made of cement instead of marble and praying is spiced up with singing.<br/>Slowly Kambili and Jaja open their eyes to another reality, where anyone is allowed to discuss at the dinner table and express their thoughts. Amid poverty and sparse means, make-u9p and football set their minds free. <br/>Adichie’s unrestrained novel is a spellbinding depiction of contrasts between rich and poor, old and new, oppression and freedom. <br/>The 25 year old Nigerian author uses a mature and convincing language, delightfully exploring Kambili’s world against an unsettled Nigerian society – vibrant but dangerous. As with Ifeoma’s rare purple hibiscuses growing in her unruly garden, oozing defiance and beauty, the novel is captivating and should be read by those who want to see, smell and taste a piece of Nigeria.<br/>1.7    THESIS STATEMENT<br/>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus, deeply reflect the violent and oppressive nature of men in the home and the society, the author creates characters, situations and also deploy language and literary devices that brings out most clearly her points.<br/><br/>\n\nANALYZING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN PURPLE HIBISCUS BY CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANALYZING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN PURPLE HIBISCUS BY CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE", "id": 212}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECTS OF LANGUAGE DIVERSITY ON NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This research work focuses on the Effect of Language Diversity on National Development. It adopts descriptive and comparative approaches in analyzing the nature of Language and the policy situation in Nigeria, considering in clear terms the complex ethno linguistics setting. Sequel to the look warm attitudes of both governments over the years, the research therefore evaluates the value of an effective language policy and implementation to the development of nations across the globe.On the foregoing, the research identifies the low level of technology and science development in Nigeria as a product of purposelessness approaches in language policy making and implementation. The study observes that, little or no functional language policy exists in Nigeria even at the age of 50 years of independence.Recourse to this, Nigerian languages ought to be central to national development and should occupy an important place in the development discourse. In line with these and many more, the study recommends that urgent attention and responsibilities ought to be given to language experts (linguists) in making language policies and possible implementation strategies for the country. This research further advocates for a national language system, however, calls for the adoption of respective indigenous languages for vocational training at their given speech communities. The Nigerian Pidgin English has the likely majority of speakers and need to be developed to the status of a national language alongside English. These positions can only be achieved if our central policy maker (government) is sincere with the reality on ground and avoid mere political interest and propaganda.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1       background of the study -      -          <br/>1.2       Statement of the problem       -          <br/>1.3       Hypothesis      -          <br/>1.4       Aims of the Study      -<br/>1.5       Scope and Delimitation of the study <br/>1.6       Significance of the Study       -<br/>1.7       Methodology of the Study    <br/> CHAPTER TWO<br/>LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>2.1       Introduction   <br/>2.2       Meaning of Language<br/>2.3       Characteristics of Language  <br/>2.3.1    Language is a system of speech sound          <br/>2.3.2    It is acquired from childhood            <br/>2.3.3    Language is dynamic <br/>2.3.4    It is conventional        -<br/>2.3.5    it is complex and systematic  <br/>2.4       Multilingualism (Language Diversity)           <br/>2.4.1    Plurality (Origin)        <br/>2.5       Strengths and Weaknesses of Language Diversity   -<br/>2.6       National Development –(Different View)      -<br/>2.7       National Language    <br/>2.8       Theoretical frame Work          -<br/> CHAPTER THREE: DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS <br/>3.0       Introduction   <br/>3.1       Methodology            <br/>3.2       Data Analysis<br/>3.3       Research findings       -<br/>3.4       Strength of findings   <br/>3.5       Weakness of findings.           <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.1       Summary        <br/>4.2       Conclusion     <br/>4.3       Recommendation       <br/>WORK CITED<br/>APPENDIX  <br/> CHAPTER ONE <br/>1.0       BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>Human Beings are social animals and language is an instrument of the society which is acculturated into a given society. Through the instrumentality of language, man identifies and make finding about his environment.<br/>Thus, language, in the hand of man preserves, conserves, transmits and appropriates functions and does so across space and time, thereby enabling him to overcome those physical limitations to human endeavours and achievements.<br/>Armed with his linguistic tool, man appropriates all that others before him have acquired, persuades and convince others to his line of reasoning and action, deceives and dominates others, controls his entire environment and exploits whatever is found therein, and also achieves as much as it is within his capacity.<br/>The problems of man's development and growth become increasingly complex and intricate when the individual is not monolingual and mono-cultural. The failure of any development programme becomes greater and more dismal when the individual has got to operate within a multilingual and multi-cultural community. It is these problems which Nigeria encounters as a result of her multilingual and multi-cultural composition that this research intends to highlight. At the end of the exercise solutions will be proffered in order to help solve the challenges we have as country.<br/> 1.1       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Inspite of all efforts to unite and develop society such as Nigeria politically, economically and socially, the state remains an under developed state. This is due to her multilingual and multicultural nature. Language pluralism has generated a lot of problems in the state. Prominent among them include;<br/>The communication gap between the various people, each sees his own language as important, thus creating an impediment to commerce and industry. A warped sense of nationhood whereby genuine unity becomes difficult due to suspicion as various ethnic groups pursue selfish and sectional interests. Picking a national language that is acceptable to the people therefore, becomes difficult.        <br/> 1.2       HYPOTHESIS<br/>The hypotheses of study are<br/>Language is a hindrance to national unity<br/>(b)        Language is an instrument for National development<br/>(c)        How is language diversity a deciding factor toward national development?<br/>1.3       AIMS OF THE STUDY<br/>The aim of the research is to discover the effect of linguistic plurality in a given multi-ethnic society like Nigeria, particularly in Nasarawa State where I live and the University of Abuja where I school. It  also intends to prove the success or failure of any society. And if language diversity has helped in national growth and development, such as economic, social, political, religious growth, and educational advancement of mankind. The study also hopes to attempt in resolving the issue of “lingua Franca”<br/>1.4       SCOPE AND DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>The scope of the research is on the use of language to achieve national development especially in a multilingual environment which is delimited to the sociolinguistics of language and society.<br/> 1.5       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>The importance of this study is that it will showcase how to promote ethnic harmony among all linguistically and ethnically diverse communities in Nigeria. The study is also significant because it will contribute to many of the existing works in this regard especially for both academic and social utilization respectively. It is also significant because it will provide the picture of the issue in question from the perspective of a university community.<br/> 1.6       METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY<br/>The methodology of the research is empirical in nature, in which the researcher intends to administer questionnaire as well as an observation within the chosen area of the study being University of Abuja, FCT<br/>The respondents to be administered with the questionnaire are selected through single random selection method of one out of every ten respondents in the delimited areas of the research.<br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF LANGUAGE DIVERSITY ON NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECTS OF LANGUAGE DIVERSITY ON NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT", "id": 213}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>GENDER DIFFERENTIALS AND ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE: <br/>A CASE STUDY IN THREE SELECTED SCHOOLS IN EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This study was undertaken to ascertain if there is any significant difference in the level of achievement of gender differentials in secondary schools in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State. in other word, to see whether the type of schools and sex, affects performance of students in West Africa School Certificate (WASC) English Language.

Importance should be attached to the level of performance of boys, girls school and co-educational secondary schools in English language. It is not often realized that the type of secondary school purely on the basis of sex can have a tremendous effect on student’s level of performance in English Language. This is more so, in a society like ours, where English is the language of instruction in schools. The language of trade and an accepted medium of communication in all facets of life.<br/>It is therefore, important to find out whether any relationship exists between secondary schools type, on the basis of sex and students achievement in English Language in West Africa School Certificate Examinations. This study considered schools in Egor Local Government Area.    <br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>It is common knowledge that some girl’s secondary schools are predominantly staffed by female teachers, while some boy’s secondary schools on the other hand are mostly staffed by male teachers. However, research has shown that female teachers pay greater attention to female students, while male teachers pay greater attention to male students in the process of classroom interaction. The findings in the area of mixed secondary schools are not at all clear. The fact that secondary school is purely girls or boys or mixed secondary school could affect student’s performance in English Language.     <br/>DEFINITION OF RESEARCH PROBLEM <br/>Relationship between variables<br/>In a research of this type sex is a variable. Schools were broken down into three main categories. We have girls secondary school, boys secondary schools and co-educational secondary school.<br/>HYPOTHESIS<br/>For the purpose of this study, the following hypothesis will be tested.<br/>There is no significant difference between the level of performance of girls in girl’s secondary school and boys in boys secondary school.<br/>There is no significant difference between the achievement in school certificate English language of boys in boys secondary school and boys in a co-educational secondary schools.<br/>There is no significant difference in the level of achievement of girls secondary schools.  <br/>RELEVANCE OF STUDY <br/>The findings of this study would help schools administrators and educationist plan effectively on how to distribute schools that performed poorly in English language. Since this finding is consistent, other factors should be researched on in order to improve student’s level of performance of mixing staff and also mixing students of both sexes in boys as well as girls secondary schools.<br/>DELIMITATION<br/>This study covers a population of thirteen secondary schools in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State. The schools which have been sitting for the WASC examination for up to four years were chosen. The random sample of three schools was taken using the table of random numbers; there is one male school, one female school and one co-educational or mixed secondary school.<br/>  The study was delimitated to three selected schools in Uselu, Adolor and Iyoba in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State. the scope to be covered include performance in West African Examination Council English on the basis of sex.   <br/>LIMITATION<br/>I encountered a lot of constraints during my course of research into this project work. Some of the things I was limited to during this study included lack of finance, limited time and problem in getting materials on time. The students I gave my questionnaire gave me tough time before they finally agreed to help me out.  <br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>The following terms which might connote different meaning with the design of this study are defined below; <br/>Single-Sex Secondary Schools: These are schools that are either purely girls or purely boy’s schools.<br/>Mixed Secondary Schools: These are schools that are for both boys and girls.<br/>Questionnaires: List of questions to be answered by a group of people to set facts or information about their views.<br/>Limitations: Conditions of being limited circumstances that hinders.<br/>Delimitation: Determine the limits or boundary of research findings.<br/>Random Sample: Selection of students without bias or premeditation.    <br/>Null: When the performance of various groups is of no effect.<br/><br/>\n\nGENDER DIFFERENTIALS AND ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE:  A CASE STUDY IN THREE SELECTED SCHOOLS IN EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " GENDER DIFFERENTIALS AND ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE:  A CASE STUDY IN THREE SELECTED SCHOOLS IN EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE", "id": 214}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE CONTRIBUTION OF LITERATURE IN MODERN AFRICAN SOCIETY <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The contribution of literature in modern African society is very enormous and imperative in view to contemporary African society. With liberation and increase in literacy, since most African nations gained their independence in the recent time, Africa literature has grown drastically in quantity and in recognition, with numerous African works appearing in western academic curricular and on best of its list compiled at the end of the 20th century. Literature has significant roles in civilization of Africans from the renaissance period to this modern African society. Its imperative roles, is encroached to all spheres of life such as culture, music, theatre, traditions and above all, the evolution of present day western education. the modernity of African society is the uniqueness and organization of its literature from days of oral traditions to recent time of reading and writing. In other Africa will have no place in the modern world without its literature, therefore literature has contributed enormously in our present day society. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE          <br/>Introduction<br/>Background of study<br/>CHAPTER TWO <br/>Literature Review<br/>CHAPTER THREE      <br/>Research Methodology<br/>Questionnaires<br/>Scope of research<br/>Limitations of study<br/>Population of study<br/>Validity of instrument<br/> CHAPTER FOUR<br/>Analysis and discussion of findings<br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>Conclusion, Summary<br/>REFERENCES <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>        The term literature is used to describe written, spoken materials. Broadly speaking, literature is used to describe anything from creative writing to more technical or scientific works, but the term is most commonly used to refer to works of the creative imaginations, including works of poetry, drama, fiction, prose and non-fiction (Alfred David, 1997). African literature consists of body of work in different languages and various genres, ranging from oral literature to literature written in colonial languages (French, Portuguese, and English). Oral literatures including stories, drama, riddles, histories, myths, songs, proverbs and other expressions is frequently employed to educate and entertain children. Oral histories, myths and proverbs additionally serve to remind whole communities of their ancestors, heroic deeds, their past and the precedents for their customs and traditions. Essentials to oral literature is a concern for presentation and oratory, folktales tellers use calls response techniques a griot (praise singer) will accompany a narrative with music.<br/>Some of the first African writings to gain attention in the west were the poignant slaves narrative, such as the “interesting narrative of the life and adventures of Olaudah Equiano, the African” (1979) which described vividly the horrors of slavery and the slave trade. As Africans became literate in their languages, they often reacted against colonial repression in their writings. Others looked to their own past for subjects. Thomas Mofolo, for example wrote “Hake” (1931) about Zulu who was a famous military leader, in susuto. Literature in African contemporary is as old as mankind itself since Africans have for ages through this vehicle of literature passed information’s from generation to generation most especially that, involving the preservation of her cultures, tradition, religious and other spheres of life. One will be very right to say that literature in African began as man became conscious of himself and the nature has whole and this has been of enormous contributions to Africans education before and after embracing western education. In contact with the colonial education, literature in Africa has taken a much different dimensions (Gabriel, E., 2010). The western education has not only influenced African literature but also subjected most Africans leaving their literature to adopting European ways of life. Post African independent, many African scholars like Wole Soyinka (first African to win noble prize in literature) has through western education presented the African literature to the world at large noting that Africa has her literature before the advent of the colonial masters.<br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY        <br/>        There are different ways Africans have presented their literatures and they include:<br/>Autobiography: This is the story of a persons life written or told by that person. Bill Peet, an autobiography.<br/>Biography: This is the story of a persons life written by another persons. Eleanor by Babara Cooney<br/>Fable: This is a story that teaches a moral or lesson. It often has animal characters. “The Fortoise and the Hare.<br/>Fantasy: Novels are often set in words much different from our own and usually include magic, sorcery and mythical creatures. “The Harry potter series by J. K. Prowling”.<br/>Folktales: This is a story that has been passed down, usually orally, within a culture. It may be based on superstition and feature supernatural characters. Folktales include fairly tales, tall tales, tricksters and other stories passed down over generations (Hansel, and Gretel).<br/>Legend: it is a story that has been handed down over generations and it is believed to be based on history, though it typically mixes facts and fiction. The hero of a legend is usually a human. “King Arthur and the Roundtable”.<br/>Myth: This is a traditional story that a particular culture of group once accepted as sacred and true. It may center on a good or supernatural being and explain how something came to be such and lightening or music or the world itself.<br/>Science fiction: Stories examine how science and technology affect the world. The book often involves fantasy that may be reality in the future.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE CONTRIBUTION OF LITERATURE IN MODERN AFRICAN SOCIETY <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE CONTRIBUTION OF LITERATURE IN MODERN AFRICAN SOCIETY ", "id": 215}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE PERSPECTIVE OF ORAL LITERATURE AND AFRICAN CULTURE IN BENIN KINGDOM AS PORTRAYED BY DIFFERENT AUTHORS IN SOME SELECTED BOOK  <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This work is on the perspective of oral literature and African culture in Bini Kingdom as portrayed by different authors in some selected books. The western colony hold on the view that African has no literature and they termed it “dark Continent”. This work reveals to us that Africa is rich in oral tradition and the Binis are more of it. The study attempts to explicate more explicitly on oral tradition by reflecting on all multitudinous problems oral tradition has helped to proffer solution to. The work is split into five chapters, chapter one is on knowing oral tradition, chapter two centers on  literature review, the works of earlier Africa orature, chapter three examines the research methodology, chapter four provides answers to the research questions posed in chapter one which guides the study and chapter five presents summary findings and suggestions.  <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE  <br/>Introduction<br/>Background of study<br/>CHAPTER TWO <br/>Literature Review<br/>CHAPTER THREE      <br/>Research Methodology<br/>Questionnaires<br/>Scope of research<br/>Limitations of study<br/>Population of study<br/>Validity of instrument<br/> CHAPTER FOUR       <br/>Analysis and discussion of findings<br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>Conclusion, Summary<br/>REFERENCES <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>Oral literature or folk literature correspond in the sphere of the spoken (oral/word to literature as literature operates in the domain of the written word. It thus forms a generally more fundamental component of culture, but in many ways as one might expect literature to do. The Uganda scholar Piozirima introduced the term oratory in an attempt to avoid an oxymoron, but oral literature remains more common both in academic and popular writing. Africans, Benin in particular, before the advent of literacy had their own forms of culture and societal norms, but there were no forms of formal knowledge of reading and writing that could be used in documenting and transmitting this rich cultural and historical background of the people rather than the use of oral in transmitting and preserving the custom and cultural beliefs of the people from one generation to another. Oral literature is a creative text delivered by the word of mouth. It refers to the heritage of imaginative verbal creations. Stories, folk-beliefs and songs of preliterate societies which have evolved and passed on through the spoken word from one generation to another. It also comprises riddles, pins, tongue-twisters, proverbs, recitation, chants, songs and stories, in short, it represents the verbal aspect of folklore. Often the Benin Oral Poet composes and performs his art vocally, and comes face-to-face with his audience.<br/>Lore is seen in societies with vigorous oral convergence practices to be general term inclusive of both literature and any written literature and any written literature including sophisticated writings, as well potentially, as visual and performance art which many interact with these forms, extend their expression, or offer additional expressive media. Thus even where no phrase in local languages which exactly translates ‘oral literature’ is used, what constitutes oral literature as understood today is already understood to be part of all of the lore media with which a society conducts profound and common cultural affairs among its members orally. Oral literature as a concept after CE 19th century antecedents, was more widely  circulated by Hector Munto Chadwick and Nora Kershaw, Chadwick in their comparative work on the growth of literature (1932-40), in 1960, Albert B. Lord Published the singer of fluidity in both ancient and later text and oral formulaic principles Benin used during composition in performance, particularly by contemporary narratives.<br/>Identification “Edo” is the name that the people of Benin Kingdom give themselves, their language, and their capital city and kingdom. Renowned for their art of brass and  ivory and for their complex political organization. Linguistics affiliation, edo belongs to the edoid cluster of language that is part of kwa language family and the Niger Kardofanian super family. Edo speaking people include not only the edo people but also ishan, the ivbiosakon, the akoko edo and the inem, many contemporary speakers speak English as well as language of neighboring Nigerian groups.<br/>History and Cultural Relations <br/>        The Edo have undoubtedly lived in the same area for many centuries. Channels archaeological investigation (1975), at a site in what is today Benin city. Suggest that large population with degree of political organization may have existed as early as the end of the late eleventh century but was certainly in place by the end of the fifteenth. Oral traditions include reference to an early dynasty of kings called Ogiso (a term that can apply to the dynasty as a whole or to individual rules written that dynasty), which ruled. It was suggested until the twelfth and thirteen century, when oranmiyan dynasty, of Yoruba origin took over the fifteenth and sixteenth century were an age of conquest and cultural flowering. Many of the sculptures for which Benin is famous were created for the monarchs. Ewuare, Ozolua, Esigie Orhohogba, and Ehengbuda. Under the rule of the kings, the empire imposed varying degree of domination over neighboring Yoruba-Igbo and Edo speaking populations and even extended its influence to Badagry and Ouidah (now in the republic of Benin, was called Dahomy until 1976). This expansion was in process when Portuguese explorers arrived in their quarter of  fifteenth century. They were interested in spreading Christianity and developing commerce trade with the Netherlands, France and England followed. Oral traditions  records indicate that power of the kingdom fluctuated over centuries. A dynastic crisis in the seventeenth century led to a civil man lasting from about 1690 to 1920, which disrupted the political and cultural life of the kingdom but peace was restored by kings Akenzuwa I and Eresoyen in the mid-eighteenth century. Benin came into conflict with British,  who viewed the kingdom as an obstacle to their economic and political expansion in the area. In 1987 a British consular official instituting on visiting the city in spite of requests by the king to delay until the completion of an important religious ceremonies. The consular and his party were ambushed, and most of them were killed. The British immediately assembled the “punitive expedition” a  retaliatory force which attacked and caputured Benin City in February of 1897, setting fires throughout the urban area and taking as war booty thousand of brass and ivory sculptures. The reigning king, Ovonramwen, was sent into exile where he died, and the Benin Kingdom was incorporated into the southern province of the Nigerian protectorate. In 1914 the British amalgamated the new country of Nigeria in the same year, they restored the monarchy in Benin allowiung Ovonramwen’s son Eweka II to assume the throne. They instituted a system of native administration (a form of indirect rule) introduced a uniform monetary system and direct taxation, established government schools and built a communications network of roads and railways. Early in the twentieth century., the church missionary society and the society of African Missions arrived in Benin but they had less success there than in other parts of Nigeria, Ngeria gained independence in 1960 and at that time the kingdom became part of the western political boundaries of the territory and its name had changed several times. In  1963 it was separated from the western region and then, in 1976 it  was renamed Bendel State. In 1993 Bendel State was split into two and today the Benin Kingdom is part of Edo State.<br/>        Despite all the political, social, cultural unrest that took place and the invasion of the kingdom by the British who looted the kingdom of its symbols, the people still carry on the various cultural practices of their forefathers some of which includes Izomo naming ceremony, Igue festival, Ekasa dance, Oluko dance, Bini Proverbs and adages etc.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>        This study at a time like this, when people have diverted from their cultural values and have embraced the culture of the western countries, becomes a necessity. In the course of this study, we shall attempt to expatiate more on oral tradition and the various oral literature that were used in transmitting it from one generation to another. This study shall also bring out the contributions of oral tradition and its influence on our political, academic and the social life of the Africans and Benin in particular.<br/>1.3    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>        Since oral literature forms a generally fundamental component of culture, this study becomes useful in terms of promoting the cultural believes of the Bini people which is at its verge of extinction. Ethical revolution which our country needs to remold her citizens could also be achieved through this study. This study is to be found as reading materials to many who have deeper understanding of oral literature. It would help the government through its findings as inputs to her mass literacy campaigns in reducing the cultural and social disputes among Africans and the Binis in particular.<br/>1.4    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The purpose of this study includes;<br/>Examining critical the oral tradition and the historical background of the Edo People.<br/>Identifying the role of oral literature in the development of the society and in Benin in particular.<br/>Examining critically the communities of origin.<br/>Examining the commitment of oral tradition to community cooperation and development. <br/>Examining critically the commitment of oral tradition into solving communal disputes and bringing out the norms in the society.<br/>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>        In order to give direction to the study, some research questions were formulated to which answers would be sought to help give direction to guide the researcher in carrying out the study;<br/>What is oral literature?<br/>What are the treats and resilience of oral tradition?<br/>What are the vital issues in the criticism or oral literature?<br/>What are the speech behaviour in oral tradition?<br/>1.6    LIMITATION OF THE STUDY <br/>        In the course of carrying out this research, some difficulties which hampered a smooth undertaking of the work include;<br/>Identifying and selecting the available text materials within the limited project writing period was not easy.<br/>Materials: Availability of adequate and relevant books.<br/>Epileptic power supply: The inadequate power supply by PHCN limited the smooth undertaking of the research.<br/>1.8    DEFINITION OF TERMS   <br/>Literature: It is all part of an expression, not what is being expressed but the ways and ,manner in which its being expressed.<br/>Oral: what is not written down but it is being said and passed by the words of mouth.<br/>African: A person from Africa especially a black person.<br/>Culture: It is the customs and beliefs, arts, ways of life and social organization of a particular country or group.<br/>Kingdom: A country ruled by a king or queen or an area controlled by a particular person or where a particular thing or idea is important<br/>Perspective: The ability to think about problems and take decision in a reasonable way without exaggerating their importance. <br/>  <br/><br/>\n\nTHE PERSPECTIVE OF ORAL LITERATURE AND AFRICAN CULTURE IN BENIN KINGDOM AS PORTRAYED BY DIFFERENT AUTHORS IN SOME SELECTED BOOK  <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PERSPECTIVE OF ORAL LITERATURE AND AFRICAN CULTURE IN BENIN KINGDOM AS PORTRAYED BY DIFFERENT AUTHORS IN SOME SELECTED BOOK  ", "id": 216}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AFRICAN VALUES TRADITIONAL AND MODERN IN AMA ATA AIDOO’S CHANGES AND ASARE KONADU’S A WOMAN IN HER PRIME<br/> CHAPTER ONE</b><br/> INTRODUCTION<br/> Values<br/>In ethics, value denotes something degree of importance, with the aim of determining what action or life is best to do or live, or at least attempt to describe the value of different actions. It may be described as treating actions themselves as abstract objects, putting value to them. It deals with right conduct and good life, in the sense that a highly, or at least relatively highly, valuable action may be(Adjectivregardedsense),and anasactionethicallyoflow, or   at   least   relatively   low,(Wikipedia)value   may   be   rega Values are important and lasting beliefs or ideals shared by the members of a culture about what are good and desirable. Values have major influences on people‘s behaviours a serve as broad guidelines in all situations. (BusinessDictionary.com)<br/> Tradition<br/>Tradition can be defined as pertinent, lasting beliefs, culture and rituals among a society, passed down from one generation to another imbued with the concrete or abstract qualities or injunctions that are regarded as supernatural from God, gods, goddesses, heroes, legends, humans, animals and plants. They include symbolic representations and activities in events, festivals and rituals comparable with the sacred activities of the –Asaa Traditional Festival of Nkpologue (Ezugu 6).<br/>Traditional Values:<br/>Traditional Values are those physical or abstract qualities possessed by particular elements, events, rituals or phenomena held in high-esteem, respect and obedience by individuals. Such values govern and regulate the physical and psychological behavior of individuals living in a particular culture or a geographical area. <br/> Africans as we know are a resilient people, and over time they have developed value systems and ways of coping with life and maintain their communities and to survive great hardships either in the African continent or in the Diaspora. The traditional life of the clan in most tribes of Africa has, as its core value, protection of the family and perpetuation of the tribe. In his traditional life the African holds certain things to be of great value. It is these values which give him a distinct cultural personality and enable him to make some contributions to world knowledge, history, philosophy and civilization. It is not my task in this study to articulate all the cultural values of the African, but only the dominant ones.<br/> Large Family:<br/>One of the foremost traditional values of the African is having a large family. Children are of supreme value to the African. His primary purpose for marriage is children and to have as many of them as possible. This is the reason why polygamy or the union of one man with several women still holds great attraction for him, and also why the birth rate in Africa is among the highest in the world. The fact is that the African still counts his blessings by the number of children he has, whether they are educated or not, rich or poor, healthy or sick, well-fed or hungry. The African smiles at the sight of his numerous children and is unmoved at the turmoil at his gate as he has a lot of arrows in his quivers.(Seo Ogbonmwan, 2008).<br/>Respect for elders:<br/>Another great value in traditional Africa is one‘s parents, grandparents and relatives. Th associated with wisdom andhonourGod‘sbestowed onblessingstheancestors. T percolate through the old people—one‘s parents, grandparents—asliving an embodiments of wisdom and of the good moral life who are expected sooner or later to join other good ancestors in the land of the   ”•living   dead”–.   Old   age   theref<br/>African. Even the children look forward to old age unlike now when hormones are being taken to remain forever young. (Seo Ogbonmwan, 2008)<br/> Morning Salutation:<br/>As part of the respect for elders, the Benin people of southern Nigeria have a unique way of respecting their elders and identifying their family of origin people say La tose (Edohen of Benin), La emore (Eni of Uzae(Ijare) , La Umogun (Royal blood from Eweka 1) La Ogiesan (Ezomo of Benin) of which there are 56 of them in total. These salutations are in electronic from at ( www.edoglobalorganization.org).<br/>Worship of Ancestor:<br/> ”•Igba- A Evo”–day when special homage is paid to all sacrificing to the dead priests and elders of the clan in commemoration of their past roles as keepers of the conscience of the isclanday,Ahor, when t everyone whose father (Nna) is dead, sacrifices to him to enlist his help and protection. (Ezugu 12-13).<br/> The worship of our ancestors is the basis for the honour and respect accorded to old people in the traditional Africa culture is their closeness to the ancestors, for in his, ontological conceptual scheme the African places his old relatives on his great hierarchy of beings.<br/> It must be noted that in the African universe the living and the dead interact with one another. Life goes on beyond the grave for the African and is a continuous action and interaction with dead relatives. <br/> These unseen ancestors called ”•the living dea invited to partake though spiritually in the family meals. The ancestors are not just ghosts, nor<br/>are they simply dead heroes, but are felt to be still present watching over the household, directly concerned in all the affairs of the family and property, giving abundant harvests and fertility and warding off enemies at the village gate.<br/>Extended Family Unit:<br/>Another important traditional value of the modern African is love for, and practice of, the extended family system.<br/>This extended family system is widely odypractic is linked with all the other members, living or dead, through a complex network of spiritual relationship into a kind of mystical body”– c values,-with-”•beingothers”– or ”•being equallyrootedimportantinexistentialkinship characteristic of the African. He is never isolated since several persons are assimilated into one<br/> parental role: his father‘s brother are assimilated b sisters into the role of mother, his patri-lateral uncle‘s daughters int is an individual to the extent that he is a member of a family, aa clan or community. (Seo Ogbonmwan, 2008).<br/> Sacredness of Life:<br/>The African does not like or nurture violence per se. this is because shedding of blood is sacrilegious. In Achebe‘sThingsFallApart, Okonkwo goes into exile with his family, for seven<br/>years to atone, for inadvertently killing a clansman- a crime against the earth goddess. In Africa, people are never killed unless it is an act of war. In the past were those whose continued existence as a threat to the life of others and to the peace of the community were usually sold into slavery.<br/>Traditional African Religion<br/>To the African, religion is of indispensable truly permeates his total life, there is for world order. In this important way also, the African exhibits a cultural personality distinct from<br/>that of western man, for instance, who easily makes a radical distinction between the secular and the religious, natural and the supernatural, this world and the next. Apart from ancestral things that are awesome or humans that have been inspiring or transcendental like the sun, the moon, the river, the earth, etc.<br/> Communal Work<br/>Preparation for Onwa-Asaa festival (Ezugu 5). The African values communal work as an opportunity to share his skills and give his best to his age group and the community. In the preparation of the bush for farming, the age group members arrange a date to assist Mr. A and the following day assist Mr. B in bush clearing, bush burning, bush gathering, planting, pruning and harvesting without money changing hands. This practice will hardly disappear in tradition African communities.<br/>Modernity<br/>  This refers to past-traditional, past-medieval historical period, one marked by the move from Feudalism (Or Agrarianism) toward Capitalism, Industrialization, Secularization,<br/><br/>\n\nAFRICAN VALUES TRADITIONAL AND MODERN IN AMA ATA AIDOO'S CHANGES AND ASARE KONADU'S A WOMAN IN HER PRIME<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AFRICAN VALUES TRADITIONAL AND MODERN IN AMA ATA AIDOO'S CHANGES AND ASARE KONADU'S A WOMAN IN HER PRIME", "id": 217}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\"> \n                      <b>  CORRUPTION AND VICTIMIZATION IN ISIDORE OKPEWHOTIDES AND ANTHONY ABAGHA’S CHILDREN OF OLOIBIRI<br/>                                                                                               ABSTRACT</b><br/> This project   is   on   Corruption   and  Tides and Anthony Ndubuisi Children of Oloibiri Abagha’s.

In economy, corruption is payment for services, or materials which the recipient is not entitled to under the law. In government, it is when an elected representative makes decisions that are influenced by vested interest rather than legitimate or established government or party regulations.<br/> In life there are political, moral and systemic corruption or abuse of power. Moral or political corruption involves the abuse of public power, office or resources by elected government officials for personal gains, by extortion, embezzlement, soliciting or offering bribes or other forms of inducement. Official corruption is a specific form of a misconduct designed to obtain undue benefits, personal gains or career advancements. Police Officer, for example, sometimes flout the police code of conduct in order to secure conviction of suspects through the use of falsified evidence.<br/>Systemic corruption is the complete subversion of a political or economic system –which is primarily due to a weakness of an organization or process. It can be contrasted with individuals, officials or agents who act corruptly within the system. Lack of transparency, low pay, injustice, greediness, exploitation and poverty are the factors that encourage corruption.<br/>   Corruption poses a serious development challenge; it undermines democracy and good government by flouting or even subverting formal processes. Corruption in election and in legislative processes reduces accountability and distorts representation in policy making. Corruption in the judiciary compromises the rule of law and corruption in the public administration results in the inefficient provision of services. It violates basic principles of the country regarding the centrality of civic virtue. Corruption facilitates environmental destruction. There is also industrial corruption; this occurs when bribe is pride by a supplier to an industry or a manufacturer in order to sell low quality goods at the price of good quality products. Corruption is a harmful force that hinders government and represses individual in many countries throughout the world. It is generally a word used to qualify the existence of common social ills that affect the entire aspects of our society.<br/> Victimization is the process of being victimized, becoming a victim or being unfairly punished. Victimization means making someone a group of people to suffer unfairly because you do not like them, their opinions or something that they have done. The trauma of victimization is a direct reaction to the aftermath of unfair punishment. Victims suffer tremendous amount of physical and psychological trauma. The physical injury suffered by victim may be as apparent as cuts, bruises or broken arms and legs. It is common for victims to be fatigued, unable to sleep or have increased or decreased appetite.Many victims believe that the stress caused by victimization endangers or exposes them to physical or psychological problems later in life.<br/>In our society, people are victimized because of or for many reasons. In the ancient days and still in some places women are being victimized after their husbands' death and when they are unable to give birth to children. Women are often socially and psychologically victimized in the absence of their husbands and children. Men who are impotent or childless suffer victimization by not allowing them to comfortably air their opinion in their fellowsocialmen’sgathering.<br/> When one is denied of his rights and possessions and is maltreated for no justifiable reasons, he is being victimized. Such a person often tries to avoid society and especially the company of his victimizers or those opposed to his way of life.<br/> STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/> Nations, Organizations, Institutions and individuals especially those mentioned in the novels understudy participate in or experience  <br/><br/>\n\nCORRUPTION AND VICTIMIZATION IN ISIDORE OKPEWHOTIDES AND ANTHONY ABAGHA'S CHILDREN OF OLOIBIRI<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CORRUPTION AND VICTIMIZATION IN ISIDORE OKPEWHOTIDES AND ANTHONY ABAGHA'S CHILDREN OF OLOIBIRI", "id": 218}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>IN-PERFORMANCE CREATIVITY IN IJOR DANCE OF YALA IN YALA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF CROSS-RIVER STATE<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>1.0              INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND TO STUDY<br/> In-Performance is an art of freshness and uniqueness of performance each time a group enacts the same performance (dance).  The need for this study is to give an insight into the creativity which is displayed when Ijor dance is performed.<br/> The Yala people are known for their rich cultural heritage and the various social activities which are a symbol of civilization.  The Ijor dance is a form of Oral literature common among the Yala folks.<br/> Africans have been seen by Europeans as very primitive and without written or oral literature.  These assumptions emanated from the fact that the Europeans were not familiar with African ways of life.  Oral literature was developed by African scholars to project the African society.  In respect to this, this project is aimed at projecting the in-performance creativity as portrayed in Ijor dance as a form of oral literature.<br/> The project is important in that it intends to tell the world that Africans had their own literature which was oral in nature before the coming of the Europeans to Africa.<br/>1.1     HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF YALA<br/> The Yala people are members of the largest Idoma families in Idoma (Benue State) Alago (Nassarawa State) and Ette (Enugu State) who in the course of migration between 1700-1800 have settled to north Cross-River State with outlying families in Ikom and Obubra at the North and South Bank of the Cross-River, some miles from their Yala Homeland.  It was discovered by Ochumode when he met some people called the Igbadus who were the original inhabitants of the land.  In discovering a salt pond there, Ochumode decided to settle and make that his home.  Later, there was a conflict between him and the Igbadus (still alive and spread to different communities in Yala today).  He defeated them and took over the lands.  This was confirmed from an interview with Mr. D.J. Ogar and was confirmed from an interview with Mrs. Oman Odaji on April 16, 2011.  They hold that the major   Yala clans are eight in number – Okpoma, Itega-Ekpudu, Olachor, Okpinya, Ogajah, Itega and Ipila respectively.<br/> Geographically, the Yala Community and its inhabitants occupy part of the North Western part in the North by Tiv in Benue State, in North-West by Abakaliki, in the North-East by Bekwarra and in the South by Ogoja.   According to Francis Afufu in the “Evolution of Yala Society”.  Yala Streches from Alebo to Oloko in either sides of Abakaliki – Tiv road with a distance of 67km.  The population of the people of Yala is 210, 843 comprising 107,310 males and 103,533 female, according to the 2006 National Census conducted (National population commission, Federal Republic of Nigeria Official Gazette of 15th May 2007).  As a matter of fact, The Yala population is steadily on the increase, perhaps, just like the population of most people in the world.  Yala has a tropical climate and the vegetation is mostly Savannah Vegetation.  It witnesses rainfall between April and October annually and there is dry season between November and March.  During this dry season, there is a mixture of Harmattan and intense heat. <br/> 1.2    SOCIO-CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES<br/> We try to understand the people because of the social behavior.  Whenever we try to understand the way of life of a people, we give more attention to the norms and aesthetics that form the world view of the people.  The most relevant part of socio-cultural activity of Yala is the Festivity (New Yam Festival) celebrated every 30th August, which is once in a year.  The actual harvest starts in August.  A lot of respect is accorded to Agriculture by the Yala people in their socio-cultural setting.<br/>On the other hand, their religion, according to Idu Onah, in an interview, expresses an aspect of their philosophy and stresses their link with Idomas.  He said that they believe in God and gods; some are Christians and some are not they make their sacrifices and divination at shrine worshipping of river god and fertility god due to Western education and Christian religion, many are converting to Christianity and abandoning the old form of worship.  Other socio-cultural activities are: naming ceremonies, child naming ceremonies, circumcision rites, dances like the Ijor dance (The major aspect of study) wohi, e.t.c.  These are practiced in yala traditional costumes of men include wrapper and singlets known as “Ihiobu” and Sandals.  Women wear wrapper, traditional tops decorated themselves with beads, plait their hair with thread.<br/> Economically, Yala people are known for the richness in primary production.  This include Traditional salt, farming, keeping of domestic animals, carving, weaving, earth work, black smiting, gari industry, oil palm production.  Garri is most produced in Okpoma-Yala, earth work in igede (Along Benue state).  Hence, with respect to all being mentioned I condlude that Yala is economically developed.<br/>In political system, Yala is one of the 18 local government means of Cross River State with its head quarters at Okpoma.  It was created on August – 27, 1991 by general Ibrahim Babangida -  The first military president of the federal republic of Nigeria.  Yala, Ukelle, Yache and Igede Igabu people.<br/>nder the Yala traditional system of government, separation of power is not very strict.  The main government body therefore is the paramount ruler setting with his council of elders/advisers.  Various categories of<br/><br/>\n\nIN-PERFORMANCE CREATIVITY IN IJOR DANCE OF YALA IN YALA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF CROSS-RIVER STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IN-PERFORMANCE CREATIVITY IN IJOR DANCE OF YALA IN YALA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF CROSS-RIVER STATE", "id": 219}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>POLITICAL CORRUPTION AND SYMBOLISM IN ADICHIE CHIMAMANDA NGOZI’S HALF OF A YELLOW SUN AND OKEY NDIBE’S ARROWS OF RAIN<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/> This project work is on political corruption and symbolism.

Misuse of government power for other purposes such as repression of political opponents and general police brutality is considered political corruption. Most economic political and social problems in under developed societies like Nigeria emanate from corruption. Some of these problems include lack of accountability, diversion of public resources to private ownership, different types of discriminations, ethnicity. Lack of competence, inefficiency etc.<br/> There are many causes of political corruption such as ineffective political processes, ineffective political financing, and poverty. Ethnic and religious difference.<br/> A lot of secrecy still pervades government document and this underlies the need for the passage of the freedom of information bill<br/> presently before Nigeria's,alsolaw publicNationa participation in Government to mention a few.The pervasive corrupt practices have been blamed on the colonial masters. According to this view, the na restricted any early influences in an ethical revolution.<br/> Throughout the colonial period most Nigerians were struck in Ignorance and poverty.<br/> The level of corruption raised serious alarm that attracted the concern of both Nigerians and international community which rated Nigeria as one of the most corrupt countries.<br/> Although, the government embarked upon anti-corruption measures but were not sincerely and properly implemented such that the expected objective and goal were not achieved. The problem was rather aggravated. Since        then,  corruption  has  continued  to  militate  against  national development. In Nigeria corruption is a problem that has to be rooted out.<br/> Owusi (2002), however in his book, The Root Causes of Corruption<br/>in West Africa, was of the view that;<br/> Corruption is made up of opportunist manipulation or branches of existing laws and regulation for advantages.<br/>He emphasized that;<br/> Our inordinate desire for wealth, power prestige and high status and its desirous consumption of scarce, expensive and prestigious import commodities is no doubt one of the roads to corruption in the society”.<br/>Over the years, the country has seen its wealth withered with little to show in living conditions of the average people.<br/>As with many other African nations, Nigeria was an artificial structure initiated by former colonial powers which had neglected to consider religious linguistic and ethnic differences.<br/> The causes of Nigeria Civil War were diverse although, in his memoir, journalist Alex Mitchell blames involvement of the British, Dutch, French and Italian oil companies whose battles for the rich Nigerian oil fields started the Civil War and kept it going.<br/> Nigerian's political problems also the British took over power, administered and abandoned government and people of Nigeria. The British administrators did not make effort to weld the country together and unite the heterogenous group of people. Though many technologies we have today are due to their enlightenment.<br/> Northern leaders however, fear that independence would mean political and economic domination by the more westernized elites in the south, preferred the perpetuation of British rule. As a condition for accepting independence, they demanded that the country continue to be divided into three regions with the North having a clear majority.On  January 15,  1966,  major  Kaduna  Nzeogwu  and  other  junior<br/> Army officers (mostly   majors   and   captains)   at generally speculated that the coup had been initiated by the Igbo and for their own primary benefit, because of the ethnicity of those that were killed. The two major political leaders of the North, the Prime Minister Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and the Premier of the Northern region, Sir Ahmadu Bello was executed by major Nzeogwu. Also murdered was Sir Ahmadu Bello's wife.

Man lives in a hard and harsh environment where he struggles, toils and labours from day to day in order to survive. Every living thing on earth struggles for survival, both plants and animals. Plants struggle, searching for sunlight to survive. Even lower animals with low mentality struggle for survival. Human beings are not left out. A baby that is still in the womb struggles for food and searches for a way out during labour, to show that struggles of human beings start right from the womb.There are many types of struggles namely, political struggle, economic struggle, family struggle and so on. But all these struggles lead to one thing which is survival.The seventh edition of Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary defines struggle as “to try very hard to do there are a lot of problems”, while explaining s continuing to live or exist, often despite difficulty or dangers or something that       has   continued   to   exist   from   an the Webster’sentersDictionastreuggleygreateffort to aslabor hard;“to us to strive; to contend forcibly; as Whereas all the above definitions are apt, we choose to align with an online posted material which adds to for food,   shelter,   clothing,   transport hand with success.<br/> Davil Salti, a Palestinian who lives in the Middle East says:<br/>The one who does not know the struggle of life is either an immature soul or a soul who has risen above the life of this world. The object of human being in this world is to attain to perfection of humanity, and therefore, it is necessary that one should go through what we call the struggle of life.<br/>Because life means a con success, failure, happiness or unhappiness mostly depends upon one��s knowl Whatever be one��s occupat one��s knowledge,fonelackstheknowledgei of<br/>the battle of life, one lack the most important knowledge of all (www.goggles.com).<br/> As soon as man loses his courage to go through the struggle of life, the burden of the whole world falls on his head.   But he who goes on struggling through life, he alone makes his way.  One must study the nature of life; one must understand the psychology of this struggle.  In order to understand this struggle, one must observe that there are three sides to it:<br/>struggle with oneself, struggle with others and struggle with circumstances. One person may be capable of struggling with himself, but is not sufficient; another is able to struggle with other, but even that is not enough. A third person may answer the demand of circumstance but that is not enough either. What is needed is that the three should be studied and learnt, and one must be able to manage the struggle in all three directions. The one who struggles with himself first s the wisest, for he has struggle with himself, which is the most difficult struggle. The other struggles will become easy for him.What is the nature of the struggle with oneself?  It has three aspects; the first is to make one��s thought, one��s own ideal,sametime givewhileexpression toatall thetheimpulses  and desires which belong to one nature being. The next aspect of the struggle with oneself is to fit in with others, with their various ideas and demands. For this, a man has to make himself as narrow or as wide as the place that ask him to fill, which is a delicate matter, difficult for all to comprehend and practise. And the third aspect of struggle with oneself is to give accommodation to others in one�� small as the demand may be.<br/>When we consider the struggle with others, there are also three things to think about of which the first is to control and govern people and activities which happen to be our duty, our responsibility. Another aspect is how to allow ourselves to be used by others in various situations in life; to know to what extent one should allow others to make use of our time, our energy, our work or our patience and where to draw the line. And the third aspect is to fit in with the standards and conceptions of different personalities who are at various stages of evolution.<br/> THE CONCEPT OF THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST <br/>This is a phrase originating in evolutionary theory as an alternative description of natural selection. The phrase is today commonly used in contexts that are incompatible with the original meaning as intended by its first two proponents, the British polymath Philosopher, Herbert Spencer (who coined the term) and Charles Darwin. Herbert Spencer first used the<br/>phrase “survivalt”afterof thereadingfittesOntheOriginCharles of Species. In his Principle of Biology (1864), he draws parallels between his own economic theories and Darwi survival of the fittest which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called natural selection or the preservation of favored race in the In Amanda Ripley��sTheUnthinkable Whobook,Survives When Disaster Strike –and Why? Is outstanding account of real life scenario of<br/>people��s struggle to survive diffe disasters. It also provides psychological reason why they act the way they<br/>do in this situation. The author discusses that during any type of disaster, a person travels through three phases: denial, deliberation and decisive moment. Reality is full of unforeseen events. The end results of these unforeseen events depend on the choice the person makes during the three phases the disaster occurred.<br/>Tess Penniston outlines three survival concepts he thinks could save<br/> life on hisReadywebNutrition”page(May“ 2010) as f responsibility for your own survival, second, sorely relying on someone else to save you is foolish and naïve, and third, train yourself to act without fear.<br/> Statement of Problem:<br/> At the moment, there exist innumerable literary assessment by scholars, especially the literary critics, on the creative works by African writers. The   volumes   of series“Africanandother   Liavailable critical works attest to this. Many books from the stable of many renowned creative writers have been given some levels of attention by critics. Nevertheless, much has not been done, at project level on themes of Binwell Sinyangwe��sACowrie of Hope. This informs the desire to work on this project, hence the theme of struggle and survival in Binwell<br/>Sinyangwe��sACowrieofHope and   BessieTheCardinalsHead��s.<br/>Purpose of Study:<br/> The main objective of this project work is to take a critical look at themes of struggle and survival in our primary texts namely, Binwell <br/>Sinyangwe��sACowrieofHope and BessieTheCardinalsHead��s.Struggle for survival is what the organism goes through in order to survive in his chosen environment. This project is subjected to critical examination of how the characters struggle to wriggle themselves out of the harsh realities life bestowed on them.<br/> Significance of Study:<br/> The problem of struggle for survival is as old as the human race. The issue presents myriad of questions such as: Are we having pity against ourselves? Why must man struggle in order to survive? Why must there be much suffering and injustice? Many erudite scholars have dealt with these questions over the years. Different view and debates on the subject have tried often to offer a reasonable solution to the problems.<br/>Apart from adding to the already existing literature, this work through its illuminating insight is very significant especially in our contemporary time, where there is quest for breakthrough. It will serve as a veritable source of material for future researchers. It is hoped that it will continue to give a critical evaluation for better understanding of the nature of struggle and survival, especially as articulated in the two novels explored here. <br/>Scope of Study:<br/>The problem of struggle and survival is very complex. Its complexity is to the extent that a single researcher cannot be exhaustive. It is, however noteworthy that while acknowledging that there are other evaluations and appraisal of problem by other authors which can help in understanding and solving the problems of struggle and survival as it were, we shall limit our analysis and critical evaluation in this research work to the two novels, A Cowrie of Hope and The Cardinals by Binwell Sinyangwe and Bessie Head respectively.<br/>Research Methodology:<br/> The basic sources of information for this project are the novels, A Cowrie of Hope by Binwell Sinyangwe and The Cardinals by Bessie Head. Secondary materials are from the internet, library and journal articles. <br/><br/>\n\nSTRUGGLE AND SURVIVAL IN A COWRIE OF HOPE BY BINWELL SINYANGWE AND THE CARDINALS BY BESSIE HEAD<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STRUGGLE AND SURVIVAL IN A COWRIE OF HOPE BY BINWELL SINYANGWE AND THE CARDINALS BY BESSIE HEAD", "id": 221}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE BLUEST EYE BY TONI MORRISONAND KAINE AGARYS YELLOW YELLOW<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The research work reviews the historical encounter between the whites and Africans and argues that the challenges or problems evident in the black society at present are as a result of the white m also looks into the social values and system of meaning that promotes male dominance and demeans the woman.<br/>    TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/> 1.1    Introduction<br/>  1.2    Statement of problem<br/> 1.3      Objective of study<br/>  1.4          Scope   of   study<br/>  1.5    Research Method<br/>  CHAPTER TWO<br/> 2.1    Literature Review<br/> CHAPTER THREE<br/> 3.1          The Bluest Eye <br/>  3.2    The Society and the Girl child<br/>  3.3    Characterization in The Bluest Eye<br/> CHAPTER FOUR<br/> 4.1          Yellow Yellow<br/> 4.2          The   society   and   the   Girl   Child<br/> 4.3      Characterization in Yellow Yellow<br/> CHAPTER FIVE<br/> 5.1          Comparative   analysisTheBluestbetweenEyeand   Morriso  Agary��sYellowYellow<br/>  5.2    Conclusion<br/> WORKS CITED<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>  1.1          INTRODUCTION <br/>According  to  Cambridge  dictionary,  society  is  defined  as  a  particular community of people who share the same customs, law etc. It is also defined as the state of being with other people. (1129).<br/> A girl child is described as a female child between infancy and early adulthood. During this period of the development of the girl child, she is under the custody and supervision of adults who may be her parents or guardians and siblings who are older and more mature than she is. The girl child is easily influenced by her experiences as she develops. She models her behaviour during this development process though observations and imitations of those she depends on, and her physical, mental and emotional development start and reach their peak within this stage.<br/>In attempting to establish the relationship between the society and the girl child, we ask certain pertinent questions relating to how she child is received and related with in her contemporary society. What are the struggles, challenges and oppression faced by the girl child? What are the factors that foist on the girl child such challenges and oppression?<br/> From the family circle to the public sphere, the girl child has suffered much hardship and has been greatly dehumanized. This is due to the fact that she is<br/>regarded as inferior to her brother. She is devalued and as Buchi Emecheta portrays her, she is a second class citizen in a society ruled by male chauvinism. In especially most African societies, the girl child has been consigned to an inferior status for which she constantly wears a daunted image. This inferiority is as a result of the patriarchal ideology in the society which bestows undue self importance on the male child. The result of this is that, men do everything to undermine the women in order to arbitrarily institute value and ideologies in the society. The African society and the diaspora is a society with a tradition that bestows importance to the male folk, neglecting the female folks. This patriarchal ideology has influenced the way the girl characters are projected by male writers in their literary texts. In most literary works, female characters always wear one of these images: prostitute, girlfriend, courtesans, and workers and are evident in<br/> these novels: Clara   is   Obi��s   loverNo longinat EaseChinua:ElsieA   Ache<br/> Man of the People by Achebe is Odili��s girlfriend girlfriend; and HalfalsoofYellowinSunChimamanda��s,weseeOlamaas<br/> Odenigbo��s lover.maleThesecharacterimags ofcreditfe assertion.<br/>  The female character in African f luster human being, the quiet member of a household only to bear children, unfulfilled if she does not, and handicapped if she bears only daughtersility… andDoc complete submission of will is demanded and enacted from her. (Chukwumma 1990; 131)<br/>They construct the girl character as a passive and inconsequential object. The male writers communicated a picture of the girl child as one whose destiny is subject to the whims of her male folk.Our primary source will be used in carrying out this research. Attention will be paid to the womanist tenet that throws some light in the oppression of the girl child as portrayed in African literature. Womanism is referred to as the concept of feminism. Coined by Alice walker, it is meant to account for the<br/> survival of the black people. (Walker 1984;89) Womanism upholds respect for the family units by Africans both in the continent and in the diaspora. Womanism is communal in its orientation and goes beyond the husband and wife context. This ideology of womanism caused Africans and African-Americans to present the struggle of the black woman in her society. This is presented through the text of Toni Morrison and KaineAgary: The Bluest Eye and Yellow Yellow respectively.<br/> Writers are mostly influenced by their environment and circumstance in history which helped to shape their society. We should agree that Toni Morrison and KaineAgary portray their society through their work.

This work is divided into five chapters; chapter one comprises of the introduction, statement of problems, purpose of the study, scope of the study, the significance of the study and research methodology. Chapter two deals with an overview of some other African writers and their works. Chapter three is the concept of neo-colonialism in Joy Chinwokwu’s Cloud at Sunrise. Chapter four is the analysis of the concept of neo-colonalism in Joy Chinwokwu’s After Midnight. Chapter five summarizes and concludes the work.<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Using the dual perspectives of post-colonial and neo-colonial studies, this paper portions the traumatizing impact of the neo-colonialist leadership on Africa and Africa’s creative writers, as a strand of the continent’s intellectual class striving for genuine independence. It shows the African writer as frequents site for the classless in the struggle by post-colonialist Africans, to wrest true independence from the grip of neo-colonialist leadership. It further traces this rift to the realities of Western capitalism’s predatory dominations of Africa, which began with the brutalizing commodification of Africans as slaves, was followed by the arbitrary creation of unworkable states, and now has reincarnated in neo-colonialism’s garb, and submits that the true and lasting peace and harmony can be achieved by the human race, only if Western capitalism and advances in science and technology are aligned with the pre-industrial, pre-capitalist and pre-racialist human values.<br/> The Concept of Neo-Colonialism- Definition of Terms <br/>Concept <br/>The term, “Concept” is traced back to 1550 – 1560, derived from a Latin word, conceptum, meaning something conceived. But what is today termed “Concepts” is used in mainstream cognitive science and philosophy of mind. It is an abstract idea or a mental symbol, sometimes defined as a unit of knowledge, built from other units which act as a concept’s characterizes.<br/> It can also be defined as a general idea derived or inferred from specific instances or occurrences something formed in the mind, a thought or notion.<br/>Neo-Colonialism <br/>Neo-Colonialism is a term which is commonly used in a variety of academic literature, dealing with the history of the capitalist system, its expansion and contemporary world affairs.<br/> The term is originally derived from a contrast made by V.I. Lenin in a pamphlet entitled “Imperialism”, which was originally published in 1939. His contrast was between direct political domination through force of arms and “domination by extra political means”. Early colonialism characterized the period from the beginnings of the age of European exploration and expansion to the gaining of granting independence to former colonies. It essentially involved the imposition of centralized political rule upon non-western peoples, using various means of direct political compulsion.<br/> Neocolonialism refers to the continued domination of former colonies using extra political or commercial means. In other words, though is a continuation of the same process of exploitation and assimilation, it operates not through the application of military might or legislative power, but through economic compulsion.<br/> On the other hand, neocolonialism (which means new colonialism), does not only rely on the continued domination of former colonies, it is also within the colonies. This is to say that, some Africans (precisely high officials) impose or enforce powers over their fellow Africans, by controlling the political and economic sector of the country.<br/> Critics adherent to neo-colonialism contend that multi-national corporations continue to exploit the resources of post-colonial states, and that this economic control inherent to neocolonialism is akin to the classical, European colonialism practiced from the 16th to the 20th centuries. In this sense, neo-colonialism implies a form of contemporary economic imperialism, that powerful nations behave like colonial powers of imperialism, and that this behaviour is likened to colonialism in a post colonial world.<br/>The term Neocolonialism first saw widespread use, particularly in reference to Africa, soon after the process of -decolonization, which followed a struggle by many national independence movements in the colonies. Upon gaining independence, some national leaders and opposition groups argued that their countries were being subjected to a new form of colonialism, waged by the former colonial powers and other developed nations, and even amongst the dictatorial leaders in the colonies. Kwame Nkrumah, who in 1957 became leader of newly independent Ghana, was one of the most notable figures to use the term. A classical definition of neo-colonialism is given in his, Neo-Colonialism, the Last Stage of Imperialism. In the book, Nkrumah says; “the neo-colonialism of today represents imperialism in its final and perhaps its most dangerous stage”. He goes further to say that development of the less developed parts of the world and investment under neo-colonialism increases rather than decreasing the gap between the rich and the poor countries of the world. The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed countries operating in less developed countries, it is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries, being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.<br/>Nkrumah’s work is self-defined as an extension of Lenin’s imperialism; The Last Stage of Capitalism (1916), in which Lenin argues that “19th century imperialism is predicated upon the needs of the capitalist system”. Neo-colonialism like colonialism is an attempt to export the social conflicts of the capitalist countries. Che Guevara, Maxist Revolutionary, 1961; says,<br/>We politely referred to as ‘underdeveloped’ in truth are colonial, semi-colonial or dependent countries. We are countries whose economics have been distorted by imperialism, which has abnormally developed those branches of industry or agriculture needed to complement its complex economy. ‘Underdevelopment’ or distorted development, brings a dangerous specialization in raw materials, inherent in which is the threat for all our peoples. We the ‘underdeveloped’ are also those with the single crop, the single product, the single market. A single product whose uncertain sale depends on a single market imposing and fixing condition. That is the great formular for imperialist economic domination. (41)<br/>Statement of the Problem<br/>For many Africans, the formal end of colonial rule did not produce an end to social injustice and drastic economic imbalance. The contention is that colonizers have aimed to control their colonized through indirect means; that in lieu of direct military political control, neocolonialist powers employ economic, financial and trade policies to dominate less powerful countries. They contain a continuing presence in the economies, especially where it concerns raw materials of former colonies.<br/> In this context, Joy Chininwokwu’s novels are dominated by a desire to spell out what has been going on in her society, as regards to neocolonialism. Joy Chinwokwu, as well as other African writers yield to a critical examination of post-colonial African societies, seeking neither to embellish nor to discredit them, but to simply depict a reality.<br/> Purpose of the Study<br/>The main purpose of this study is to find out;<br/>-             To what extent the African writers, especially Joy Chinwokwu, have highlighted the problems faced by Africans in line with the neocolonial powers;<br/>-             To what extent these writers contributed in spelling out the concepts of neocolonialism and its negative impact on Africans;<br/>-             To what extent have these writers tried to change the impression of Africans towards neocolonialism, and how it can be resolved, by the way they reconstruct experiences in their work.<br/> Scope of the Study<br/>The researcher will focus on the concept of neocolonialism, as depicted in Joy Chinwokwu’s novels, and the roles played by each character as regards to neocolonialism. The project will shed light on the societal influence as shown in the two novels being examined.<br/> Significance of the Study<br/>The society is going to gain from this study. The pre-occupation of this project is to examine the concept of neo-colonialism, and in this regard, a critical examination of the sociology of neo-colonialism in Africa will be analyzed.<br/>The society will be enlightened on the negative aspects and impacts of some of the policies imposed on them by the neo-colonialists, all in the name of development. More so, to seek for a total independence, not only from the external neo-colonialist, but also from the internal.<br/>Research Methodology<br/>The primary sources of data for this project are, Joy Chinwokwu’s Clouds at Sunrise and After Midnight.

The articles perform several important functions and aid greatly in the art of communication. Despite this indisputable importance of the English articles, Nigerian newspapers misuse them to a great degree. It is a fact that newspapers are extremely useful learning tools to students and the general public. However, Nigerian newspapers fail to live up to the high standard expected of them. In spite of this aberration, studies on the misuse of the English articles by Nigerian newspapers have been particularly rare. The aim of this is to assess the misuse of the English articles by Nigerian newspapers. The study attempts to answer research questions such as: In what manner do the print media deviate from established grammatical uses of articles?To what extent are the articles misused?To what extent does the misuse of the English articles inhibit effective communication in Nigerian newspapers?To what degree does the misuse of the English articles disconnect the relationship between nouns and articles? What are the reasons for the wrong use of the English articles by newspapers in Nigeria?In order to answer these questions, the researcher carried out an in-depth library research. The population for the study is all Nigerian newspapers, and the researcher selected a total of six editions from threenational newspapers: two of each. The data analysis showed that errors in the misuse of the English articles are prevalent in Nigerian newspapers, and these errors hamper effective communication. These findings suggest the necessity of employing better writers and editors on the part of the newspaper houses. The study concludes with suggestions for further research.<br/> Table of Contents<br/> CHAPTER ONE: Introduction                                   <br/>1.1    Background to the Study    -                         <br/>1.2    Statement of the Problem    -                         <br/>1.3    Purpose of the Study    -    -                         <br/>1.4    Scope and Limitations of the Study                         <br/>1.5    Significance of the Study                              <br/>1.6    Research Questions    -                              <br/>CHAPTER TWO: Review of Relevant Literature                    <br/>2.1    Conceptual Framework    -                              <br/>2.1.1The English Articles    -                              <br/>2.1.1.1 Uses of the Definite Article                              <br/>2.1.1.2 Uses of the Indefinite Articles                         <br/>2.1.1.3 The Zero Article -    -    -                         <br/>2.1.1.4 The Stylistic Functions of the English Articles               <br/>2.1.1.5 The Role of Semantic Features in the Acquisition          <br/>     of the English Articles                                   <br/>2.1.2 A Brief History of English in Nigeria                         <br/>2.1.3 Writing and Newspapers in Nigeria                         <br/>2.2    Theoretical Framework    -    -                         <br/>2.3    Empirical Studies -    -    -                         <br/>CHAPTER THREE: Methodology                                   <br/>3.1    Research Design                                             <br/>3.2    Area of study                                             <br/>3.3    Population    -                                             <br/>3.4    Sample    -                                             <br/>3.5    Data Collection    -                                        <br/>3.6    Method of Data Analysis                                        <br/>CHAPTER FOUR: Data Presentation and Analysis                    <br/>4.1    Data Presentation                                             <br/>4.2    Data Analysis                                                  <br/>CHAPTER FIVE: Discussion of Results and Conclusion                    <br/>5.1    Discussion of Results                                        <br/>5.2    Summary                                                  <br/>5.3    Recommendations                                             <br/>5.4    Conclusion                                                  <br/>5.5    Suggestions for Further Studies                              <br/>Works Cited                                                  <br/>Appendix   -                                                  <br/> INTRODUCTION<br/> 1.1 Background to the Study<br/> English is accepted as the official language, a second language (L2) as well as a restricted lingua franca in Nigeria. English in Nigeria is not acquired in a native speaker environment so learners undergo more difficulties than native speakers do in acquiring the language. Mother tongue interference alongside a learner’s socio-cultural background contributes immensely to the difficulties encountered in learning the language.<br/>The English language is not a native Nigerian language. It is a legacy of British colonisation. The language was introduced by British administrators and missionaries. English was adopted as the official language of Nigeria during the period of colonisation. However, it must be noted that English existed in Nigeria in one form or the other even before Nigeria officially became a British colony. Activities like slave trade, coastal trade, and the abolition of slave trade led to the implantation of the English language in Nigeria. Freed slaves that had learnt the language to an extent served as interpreters, messengers and clerks and even introduced the language to members of their family. According to Dadzie and Awonusi, “some of these Nigerians, particularly the Yorubas locally known as Akus in SierraLeone, returned to their villages where they were known as saros and Krios, and freely used the English language in their new settlements”(53).The English language is the only language that has been generally accepted officially in Nigeria today.It has really broken language barriers between interactants from various ethnic and linguistic groups. As the official language in Nigeria, the English language is the language of the media, education, politics, et cetera.It is the commonest used language in the Nigerian media i.e. both the print and electronic media and it has been nativized, naturalized and domesticated to suit our socio-cultural context.<br/> Over the years, English has garnered a silent hostility by Nigerians because it was never freely adopted as the official language. The circumstances surrounding its imposition are well known. The long-term deleterious effects of this national attitude are only beginning to show on the linguistic horizon.<br/>According to Ikkideh:<br/> English is not taken half as seriously as it was twenty years ago…in vain, we blame poor teachers of English, lazy students, inadequate, textbooks and educated, the grammatical use of the language is today the exception rather than the rule. (qtd. in Unoh 16) Because English is in most cases learnt rather than acquiredin Nigeria, there are instances of L1 interference in the English of the majority of Nigerians. For example, in written communication, even though certain wordscan be omitted from a sentence i.e. ellipsis, words that are necessary for the effective communication of clear meaningsare never omitted in Standard English. One such class of words that should never be omitted in Standard English is the article. The word “article” is derived from the Latin word “articulus” which means “joint”. Articles are classified as grammatical words and they refer to determiners which play the primary role of differentiating the uses of nouns. Articles belong to a small group of important little elements but they exert a great deal of influence in the contexts where they are used.As a matter of fact, the classification and syntactic function of a word or expression can change with the misuse of an article.Articles are placed before nouns, and they determine whether the nouns referred toare specific in nature or general, among other things.<br/> Where an article is wrongly used, the resultant construction is inevitably erroneous. Second language learners of English in Nigeria demonstrate language transfer errors within the English language article system. This is especially evident where the native languages of these learners lack articles. According to Eyisi:<br/> The major error in the use of determiners is mainly with the omission of the definite or indefinite article where it is obligatorily needed. This omission is, no doubt, a result of interference of our mother tongues since most Nigerian Languages do not possess any separate morpheme for the article. (2)<br/>This misuse of the English article is manifest even in the pages of national newspapers in Nigeria. There are several instances of erroneous constructions in Nigerian newspapers that can be traced back to the misuse of articles.<br/>1.2Statement of the Problem<br/>Newspapers are extremely useful learning tools to students and the general public. People that read newspapers have a better awareness of the world around them because they are better informed of the current issues happening around the world.Newspapers are continuous sources of information and education for those who read them, and so, their sentence structures have to be as lucid as possible. Unfortunately, this is not the case in Nigeria.Thepages of many Nigerian newspapers are replete with various types of errors, prominent among which is the misuse of articles in sentence structures. Every newspaper needs to uphold avery high standard before their varied reading public, as newspapers and journalists are taken to be models of linguistic excellence. Newspapersin Nigeria use the English language in ways that suit them, not minding whether their language usecontain structures that contravene grammaticality. If articles are wrongly used, the connection between the noun and the article which defines the meaning of the noun is lost. Generally, these deviations (omissions of English articles) affect comprehension of the whole text. This causes a considerable degree of confusion for speakers and second language learners of the English language.<br/>There have been some studies that attempt to depict the poor standard of English in Nigerian newspapers. However, relatively few studies, if any, have fully focused on the misuse of the English articles in Nigerian newspapers. Also, little has been said about how these errors affect comprehension. These lacunae in knowledge inspired the researcher to carry out this research in order to supplement the knowledge currently available in this field.<br/> 1.3 Purpose of the study<br/> Considering the huge importanceof the English language both locally and internationally, an urgent need for attention to be paid to the misuse of<br/>the English articles in Nigerian newspaper arises. English is an asset in most facets of life and therefore, a functionally correct knowledge of the language is needed.<br/>The aim of this research is to highlight the alarminglyincreasing occurrence and frequency of the misuseof the English articles in our newspaper today.<br/> 1.4 The Scope and Limitations of the Study<br/>This study is delimited to the various forms in which the English articles are misused in Nigerian newspapers. Other forms of errors found in Nigerian newspapers are not investigated here. The scope of this study involves exploring the misuse of the English articles in selected Nigerian newspapers. For the purpose of this study, the research will focus on only three widely read newspapers – The Sun, The VanguardandThe Independent.<br/> 1.5Significance of the Study<br/> This research sets out to help users of the English language in various capacities to improve their performances in their use of articles, promote efficiency in the grammar of English, encourage a mastery of the use of<br/>English articles, and spring up a general improvement in the proper use of articles. This research makes explicit, those areas where newspaper practitioners deviate from acceptable usage of articles, gives reasons for the aberrations, and also suggests ways of avoiding the errors. This research work will benefit both newspaper readers and journalists by clearly laying out the problems of the wrong use of articles.<br/> 1.6 Research Questions<br/>The following questions were addressed in the study.<br/> 1.      In what manner do the print media deviate from established grammatical uses of articles?<br/> 2.      To what extent are the articles misused?<br/> 3.      To what extent does the misuse of the English articles inhibit effective communication in Nigerian newspapers?<br/> 4.      To what degree does the misuse of the English articles disconnect the relationship between nouns and articles?<br/> 5.      What are the reasons for the wrong use of the English articles by newspapers in Nigeria?<br/> <br/><br/>\n\nTHE MISUSE OF THE ENGLISH ARTICLES IN SELECTED NIGERIAN NEWSPAPERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE MISUSE OF THE ENGLISH ARTICLES IN SELECTED NIGERIAN NEWSPAPERS", "id": 224}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE ROLE OF INDIGENOUS LITERARY TRADITION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF IGALA COMMUNITY<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The researcher tries to show the roles of indigenous literary tradition in the development of Igala Community. This research work shows that indigenous literary tradition contributed greatly to the development of Agriculture, promotion of social relationship and political growth and in the maintenance of good health in Igala Community. The work is divided into five chapters: chapter one treats the background of the study, statements of problems, purpose of study, significance of study, scope of study, Geographical, location, economic and social importance. Chapter two is literature review. Chapter three shows the role of festivals and ceremonies in the development of Igala community. Chapter four also shows the role of myths, legend and folktales in the development of Igala community. Chapter five covers conclusion and recommendation.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>Community development has been viewed from various perspectives. Mainly in relation to increase in capacity and skills, greater freedom, creativity of individual members, self discipline, economic growth and overall well being of the community. In Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart, a man’s wealth is known or derived from the number of tittles he could acquire, the number of barns he could stuck with farm produce that will last from one planting season to another.<br/>            Indigenous literary tradition means the type of cultural beliefs, customs and superstitions that guide the day to day activities of a people. It is mainly centered on the ways of rural people in the third world countries especially the poorer rural people. Some communities are capable of utilizing the indigenous literary traditional practice in production of wealth in abundance while others depend solely on those wealth produced by their neighboring communities.<br/>            In view of this facts therefore, the extent to which indigenous literary tradition can contribute in the roles within the Igala community has not been determined with certainty. There may be widespread speculations of the roles to community development, the exact role to this rural community has not been explored especially as it cannot be said that indigenous literary traditional development of one community is synonymous with the development of another community. Since the role of indigenous tradition in community development varies across communities, research findings from one community cannot be generalized to other communities, like Igala community. In consideration of these facts therefore, there is need to explore the role of indigenous literary tradition in the development of Igala community.<br/> STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The current poor rate of development in Igala community coupled with depressed programmes or activities at the community level is an issue of great concern. In the past few years, emphasis has been shifted to modern technological education as an instrument for community growth.<br/>            The rate of regression in major development and activities in Igala community raise doubts as to whether the modern educational practices is in any way contributing to the development of the community. There has been the notion among the elites that the high rate of regression in the community development activities is directly related to the abandonment of indigenous literary tradition and practices at the community level. Although this speculation is widely held by majority of people in the community, it cannot be stated with certainty that the role of indigenous literary tradition in community development is this or that since an intensive research has not been made to this effect. As such the role of indigenous literary tradition in the development of Igala community is not yet known.<br/>            This research is, therefore faced with the problem of establishing validly the role of indigenous literary tradition in the development of Igala community.<br/>  OBJECTIVES AND AIM OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose and aim of this research is:<br/>            To isolate the role of indigenous literary tradition in the development of agriculture in Igala community<br/>            To explore the role of indigenous literary tradition in promoting social relationship and to encourage the use of folklores to stable political structures in Igala community.<br/>            To explore the roles of indigenous literary traditional practices in maintenance of good health conditions at the community level.<br/> SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is to ascertain the roles of indigenous literary tradition in development of Igala community. The result of the study will inform the community on the extent to which indigenous literary tradition has contributed to the development of the community and agriculture in the community level. The result of the research will be of good help in re-directing the policy makers on the need to emphasize indigenous literary tradition in all communities so that the entire community can reap the numerous benefits.<br/>            The research will also expose the extent to which indigenous literary tradition can promote social relationship and stable political structures in the community. As such the study also will assist in informing the government on the need to introduce indigenous literary traditional and educational practices into the modern school curriculum. This study will also reveal the roles of indigenous literary tradition in maintenance of good health and management of epidemic. The study will help both the government and health ministries on the need to either encourage or discourage such tradition. The result will, having revealed the roles of indigenous literary tradition on health practices, serve to emphasize the need for the government to offer financial assistance to indigenous literary traditional programmes and activities in Igala Community.<br/> SCOPE OF THE STUDY          <br/>This study is limited to the Igala Community of Kogi State. The study was also limited to the role of indigenous literary tradition in the development of Igala Community in relation to the following domain of development<br/>1.                  Development in Agriculture<br/>2.                  Social and political development and<br/>3.                  Health development<br/> GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF IGALA COMMUNITY <br/>Igala Community is located in the eastern part of Kogi State. It shares boundaries with Benue State towards the north, Enugu State towards the east while the rivers, Niger and Benue distributaries separates it from Edo and Delta States towards the south downwards flow to the Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of about 2.5 million by the 1993 population census of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The community is ruled by nine notable beaded chiefs with the overall traditional ruler called the Attah of Igala, the community is made up of 18 villages with beaded chiefs with titles “Eje” and “Onu”.<br/>ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE <br/>A conspicuous feature of the northern part of Igala is the Udi Plateau. Udi is a town in the eastern part of Nigeria. This Plateau extends to the heart of Igala land, Coal was found on the plateau in 1967, Okaba local mines were opened. And in the southern most part of Igala land always the eastern bank of Niger lies a low land the Niger-Anambra lowland in which the Ibaji local government is found, this area is flooded annually. Hence the millions of tons of silt brought by the Niger and Anambra rivers enrich Ibaji soil, thus making it the most fertile soil in the Area and large quantities of fish are found in the ponds. The latter play a very important role in the social and economic life of the inhabitants of the community.<br/>SOCIAL IMPORTANCE <br/>            Igala is also fortunate in having a natural high ways of communication and commerce, the river Niger-Benue and to a certain extent the Anambra. These rivers played a very important part in the early exportation and trade in the area. In the whole of Igala land the only bridge across the Niger is one for motor, one for railway line, goods and merchandise are usually ferried from Lokoja to Shinteku while the service of speed boats are at Idah as meeting point of routes as trade centers and historical or cultural centers.<br/>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>The main sources of information for this Project research are;<br/>The Igala people of Nigeria by Mohammed Omaye Atojoko, Home Land Memories by Sampson Odidi and Nigerian Children’s Literature in English by Osaze Fayose.

(1129).<br/> A girl child is described as a female child between infancy and early adulthood. During this period of the development of the girl child, she is under the custody and supervision of adults who may be her parents or guardians and siblings who are older and more mature than she is. The girl child is easily influenced by her experiences as she develops. She models her behaviour during this development process though observations and imitations of those she depends on, and her physical, mental and emotional development start and reach their peak within this stage.<br/> In attempting to establish the relationship between the society and the girl child, we ask certain pertinent questions relating to how she child is received and related with in her contemporary society. What are the struggles, challenges and oppression faced by the girl child? What are the factors that foist on the girl child such challenges and oppression?<br/> From the family circle to the public sphere, the girl child has suffered much hardship and has been greatly dehumanized. This is due to the fact that she is regarded as inferior to her brother. She is devalued and as Buchi Emecheta portrays her, she is a second class citizen in a society ruled by male chauvinism. In especially most African societies, the girl child has been consigned to an inferior status for which she constantly wears a daunted image. This inferiority is as a result of the patriarchal ideology in the society which bestows undue self importance on the male child. The result of this is that, men do everything to undermine the women in order to arbitrarily institute value and ideologies in the society. The African society and the diaspora is a society with a tradition that bestows importance to the male folk, neglecting the female folks. This patriarchal ideology has influenced the way the girl characters are projected by male writers in their literary texts. In most literary works, female characters always wear one of these images: prostitute, girlfriend, courtesans, and workers and are evident in these novels: Clara   is   Obi��s   loverNo longinat EaseChinua:ElsieA   Ache Man of the People by Achebe is Odili��s girlfriend girlfriend; and HalfalsoofYellowinSunChimamanda��s,weseeOlamaas <br/>Odenigbo��s lover.maleThesecharacterimags ofcreditfe assertion.<br/> The female character in African f luster human being, the quiet member of a household only to bear children, unfulfilled if she does not, and handicapped if she bears only daughtersility… andDoc complete submission of will is demanded and enacted from her. (Chukwumma 1990; 131)<br/> They construct the girl character as a passive and inconsequential object. The male writers communicated a picture of the girl child as one whose destiny is subject to the whims of her male folk.<br/> Our primary source will be used in carrying out this research. Attention will be paid to the womanist tenet that throws some light in the oppression of the girl child as portrayed in African literature. Womanism is referred to as the concept of feminism. Coined by Alice walker, it is meant to account for the<br/> survival of the black people. (Walker 1984;89) Womanism upholds respect for the family units by Africans both in the continent and in the diaspora. Womanism is communal in its orientation and goes beyond the husband and wife context. This ideology of womanism caused Africans and African-Americans to present the struggle of the black woman in her society. This is presented through the text of Toni Morrison and KaineAgary: The Bluest Eye and Yellow Yellow respectively.<br/> Writers are mostly influenced by their environment and circumstance in history which helped to shape their society. We should agree that Toni Morrison and KaineAgary portray their society through their work. With reference to<br/> Morrison��sTheBluestEye and KaineAgary��s   Yellow,itwillYellowbejustto<br/>  state that the oppression and hardship faced by the girl child is as a result of the dreadful and traumatizing encounter between Africans and the white racists. It is believed that the encounter between the whites and Africans has left Africans in the continent and the diaspora with disconcerting problems. These issues are as a result of the dreadful means in which the encounter occurred: Slavery, colonialism. A short detailed review on the historical background of both authors will be the peg to tie the goat as Achebe would put it. Toni Morrison is the pre-eminent<br/> African-American female writer, while KaineAgary is one of contemporary writers.<br/> Toni Morrison: Biography and Historical Background<br/> Toni Morrison was born Chloe Anthony Wofford in Lorain, Ohio in 1931. Her father, George Wofford, was a shipyard wielder and her mother, Ramah Willis Wofford, raised the family. Her family migration from the south &amp; North is much like the migration of the Breedloves in The Bluest Eye. Morrison was the second of four children. She grew up listening to folktale in her family and community: tales of slave times, emancipation tales dealing with racism of the white majority and tales of supernatural elements. Morrison married a Jamaican architect, Harold Morrison.<br/> The setting of The Bluest Eye is Lorain, Ohio in 1941, and the rural south in the early 20th century. The novel begins after the great depression. Economic security was of importance for African-Americans, who have fewer opportunities than the majority of their white counterparts. ( www.cliffnotes.com).<br/> In the early 19th century, after the abolition of slavery, the blacks suffered great dehumanization. They were then the descendants of Africans captured and bundled into America as slaves. These captured slaves were forced to till the plantation of the white land owners. They farmed and produced crops such as sugar, cotton, indigo, and other tropical products. After the abolition of slavery, they were given the rural region of the society.

Chapter two is the literature review which includes the various works of writers and comments which are related to the topic of my writing. Chapter three explores Niger delta problems using Kaine Agary’s Yellow Yellow. Chapter four also talks about Niger Delta problems using Tanure Ojaide’s The Activist.  Finally, chapter five summarizes, concludes and gives recommendation to this research work.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>            The exploration of oil in Nigeria started in 1937 and was pioneered by the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria limited which then based in Warri.  In the course of the exploration for oil, the first explored well was drilled in 1951 at Ihuo north east of Owerri where no oil was discovered in commercial quantity at Oloibiri in the then Rivers State presently in Bayelsa by Shell.  Consequently, there was pipe line connections between Ololbiri and Port Harcourt which enabled the first Cargo of Crude oil to leave Niger Delta on 17th February, 1958 when production stood at 6,000 barrels per –day.  The implication of this is that by 1970 the oil industry became responsible for about 95% of the nations foreign exchange earnings of which Shell was the major contributor.<br/>            The Niger Delta region the producer of these natural and mineral resources encompasses the swampy terrain of coastal area of the South – South compelled with some parts of the South – West and South - East which comprises the following states Abia, Akwa-Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross Rivers, Delta, Edo, Imo, Ondo and Rivers as states in Niger Delta.<br/>According to record, creation of Nigeria Delta States, was by colonial masters set in motion the constitutional and legal framework for the future betterment of the Niger Delta.  As a follow-up, Henry Willink commission (1957 – 1958) made some recommendation at pg 94 paragraph 27 of its report for the proper development of the Niger Delta region having seen the possibility of how this fertile area endowed by God with rich mineral and agricultural resources could be sapped, exploited, by the actions of man without development.  This led to the establishment of Niger Delta Development Board (NDDB) in 1960 with a view on embarking on the physical development of the area as an equitable recompense for it’s majority oil reserve which feeds the entire nation.<br/>            After the assumption of office in 1999 by the then president Olusegun Obasanjo, he asserted that the neglect of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) was established in the year 2000.  The high hope and security was castrated because it did not leave up to the expectations in terms of developing the Niger Delta Physically and in empowering the people of this area in all it’s ramification.  The principle of derivation which started with 50% in 1960 and 1963 constitution was drastically slashed callously to 13% under the 1999 constitution.<br/>In many communities in Niger Delta, there is a wide spread of feeling that much has not changed with the new democratic government regarding state repression, as the military invasion of the village in Ijaw town of Odi in November 1999 and Ogoni, also other areas like Warri. <br/>The Niger Delta Crisis could be traced through in 1990’s then the Nigeria’s military rulers embarked on a policy of pacifying the Niger Delta the oil rich region populated by many ethnic minorities for social economic and cultural rights in a country where years of practicing power is in favour of majority ethnic groups.  Notwithstanding that the bulk of the country’s wealth comes from petroleum extracted from the Niger Delta.  In addition to that, the petroleum industries profoundly undermine the source of their livelihood, and the ethnic minorities are being ignored. This makes the people look elsewhere or seek violence as the road to salvation.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS   <br/>            The issue of Niger Delta has continued to be on the front burner of writers including critics for some time now.  But people have not actually taken enough time to look at the issue of “style being the man”.  As a result the style and techniques of our chosen writers here in these two novels have not been critically examined.  This research sets out to bridge the gap.  In Tanure Ojaide’s<br/>The Activist shows how the manner of thinking of the people have been blurred with the idea that if they steal to survive, it is not a crime because their leaders are also thieves who loot the national treasury.  Pere says, “Those who take our wealth must pay dearly for it” (82).<br/>Due to the situation in the Niger Delta, he decides to go into bunkering business, which he saw as a means of making money to provide for him and his family since the oil company did not provide jobs for the people.<br/>            This people now treat the inhabitants of the area where the companies are located like criminals without dignity.  According to Kimse Okoko and Nna Johnson (1979), they cited the controversy over revenue allocation within the context of National question.  They said “the revenue allocation process in Nigeria have usually been made to favour the majority ethnic group”.  The oil producing communities have always been cheated.<br/>The prevailing system only serves to siphon their oil resources to the domain of the majority ethnic groups and that the plight of the oil producing areas is as a reflection of their political domination and economic marginalization by the major ethnic groups in Nigeria.<br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY            <br/>            The purpose of this research is to analyse, evaluate and explore the issue of writer’s attitude to his subject.   In other words, what is his point of view and perception of the activities going on in the Niger Delta.  This exploration is seen through his handling of themes and literary devices otherwise known as style or technique.<br/>            Many Nigerians are ignorant of the issues in Niger Delta.  What most people, both inside and outside Nigeria knew was based on media propaganda, which only highlighted the youth violence which made every body talk about Niger Deltans as recalcitrant militants forgetting the situation they put the people into.  In Yellow Yellow, Zilayefa Says,<br/>During my second to last year in secondary school,<br/>one of the crude oil pipes that ran through my village<br/>broke and spilled over several hectares of land, my<br/>mother’s farm included…. And so it was that, in<br/>a single day, my mother lost her main source of<br/>sustenance.  However, I think she had lost that<br/>land a long time ago, because each season yielded<br/> less than season the before (4)<br/>This quotation explains the sufferings and poverty that await Zilayefa because their only source of sustenance which is the land for farming has been polluted and covered with crude oil.<br/> SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>            This research report, the writer and the Niger Delta:  A study of Kaine Agary’s Yellow Yellow and Tanure Ojaide’s The Activist are works that ridicules and satarises the leaders of the community and the military government whom are regarded as the majority.  They did not say anything even when such matters on how their land has been polluted by the oil companies are being brought to them.  They refused to do anything because they have received ransoms form the whites who work in the oil companies just to keep them quiet.<br/>            Due to the environmental degradation, the people in the Niger Delta were affected with sufferings.  Their farm lands and water which was their basic means of livelihood were destroyed with oil and brought them into a situation where they could not feed or even work.<br/>The women become idle without jobs to keep them busy, some even went on prostitution, selling their bodies to the white men who work in the oil companies just to better their lives and feed their families.<br/>These works shows the significance of advocating for a change in the society through changing the leadership patterns and also advocating for a change in the Niger Delta through changing the leadership patterns and also encourage young writers to put into writing the effect of such government on the economy and the poor masses.  It tends to encourage the youths to fight for their rights no matter the situation they are passing through.<br/>            This can be done or achieved through forums with the people as away of enlightening them on the issues and problems the oil companies has cause them.<br/>            In The Activist by Tanure Ojaide, Omagbemi joins the Activist in his fight against the Bell oil and had so many forums with the students in a way of enlightening them on the issues and problems the oil companies has caused them.  Also, Ebi and some other women forms an organization called women of the Niger Delta forum, their aim is to look for ways to talk to the officials of Bell Oil Company.<br/> ,SCOPE OF THE STUDY           <br/>            This project is restricted to the study of the writer and the Niger Delta using Kaine Agary’s Yellow Yellow and Tanure Ojaide’s The Activist as primary materials.  Other relevant related works of some other Nigerian or African prose writers are used only as commentaries or references on Niger Delta.<br/> RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>            The main source of this research is work is textual analysis of Kaine Agary’s Yellow Yellow and Tanure Ojaide’s The Activist.  The Secondary materials are form textbooks, journals, Internet information.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE WRITER AND THE NIGER DELTA: A STUDY OF KAINE AGARY�S YELLOW YELLOW AND TANURE OJAIDE�S THE ACTIVIST<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE WRITER AND THE NIGER DELTA: A STUDY OF KAINE AGARY�S YELLOW YELLOW AND TANURE OJAIDE�S THE ACTIVIST", "id": 227}]
