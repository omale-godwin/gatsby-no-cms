(1995), The purpose of this article is to analysze the impact of a landlord and tenant ordinance (LTTO) on property values, using time series data for the city of Evanston, Illinois, where the ordinance has been enacted since 1975. The empirical data analysis, which includes a trend analysis of heroin price indices for both rental and owner-occupied property has shown that L.T.O is not likely to significantly affect HOUSING VALUES. Those remedies provided in the landlord and tenant ordinance are not likely to be radical departures from the current practices such as housing / building code, and can therefore not be expected to affect housing values substantly.</p> <p>          This research was supported by a grant from the office if Real Estate Research at the university of Illinois. We acknowledge helpful comments from professor peter colwell, and the good research assistance of Theresa Cherniak and Michael Duncan.</p> <p>          Acting in landlord and tenant malters for commercial owners or occupiers requires knowledge of legislation (such as the landlord and tenant Act 1954) and case law as well as and understanding other commercial property.</p> <p>JH Walter has a rich supply of comparable evidence on which to draw to establish a verifiable basis for rent review or lease renewal backed by the experience of our surveyors whi are also active agents in the market place. Brought together with technical and legal data, this make us well placed to negotiate the best deal for our clients whatever the market conditions while giving realistic advice about the possible outcome of dispute resolution.</p> <p>          Restructuring of lease can prove an attractive proposition for both landlord and tenant. We offer advice to ensure that clients pay and receive compensation at appropriate levels to reflect changing rental income, lease term and capital value. At lease expiry, both owners and occupiers seek our support in dilapidations claims. (Dilapidation: the extent to which the property falls short of the repairing obligations of lease). We negotiate claims including guidance on the distinction between repair and improvement and the limit of tenant liability on claims where diminution in value (Lost Value) is less than the cost of repair. We advised in rent review of a prominent shop in an unusual retail pitch but one attractive to specialist retailers. Gathering evidence form nearby lettings and other reviews, we helped our client understanding the opportunities and argument possible including adjustments for location, return frontage, unusual layout and repairing obligation beyond matters of value, we gave guidance on required notices and issues of timing in connection with other rights and obligations in the lease.</p> <p><strong>HISTORY</strong></p> <p>The landlord and tenant relationship is defined by existence of a leasehold estate.</p> <p>i      Traditionally, the only, obligation of the landlord in the united states was to grant the estate to the tenant.</p> <p>ii     Although in England and Wales, it has been clear since 1829 that a landlord must put a tenant into possession.</p> <p>iii    Modern landlord – tenant law includes a number of other rights and duties have been codified in the uniform presidential landlord and tenant Act.</p> <p><strong>1.2            </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>1)      An essential ingredient in the achievement of the objective of landlord and tenant in entering into contract is cordial relationship although the interest of the parties are not mutually exclusive, conflict in the relationship can prevent landlord from earning a fair returns on his investment in the property just as the desire of the tenant to derive maximum utility from occupation will also suffer defeat, the society will be worse of it.</p> <p>2)      Therefore to give opportunity to all ranks of interests associate with the particular property to be exercised without friction the lease sets landlord and tenant.</p> <p>3)      The landlord nor the tenant meets his obligations under the lease because with the steady fall in the real value of his income the tenant finds it difficult to pay his rent promptly or sufficiently of utility bills.

This research study aimed at appraising users' satisfaction level on facilities management services provided in typical condominium apartments in Lagos State with a case study of Egerton Place Estate at Lekki, Lagos State. The research study identified some research questions which answers were provided for subsequently.  Some of the research questions asked are: What are the service quality dimensions in managing condominium apartments? Are the residents satisfied or dissatisfied with the services? These questions were answered with the aid of a structured questionnaire in which out of the fifty eight residents administered to, forty of the questionnaires were retrieved and used for the analysis thereafter. The analysis was done using software called SPSS for the frequency distribution and a SERVQUAL Model for the ranking of the indicators listed in the sample questionnaire and ranked according to their mean item score respectively. Findings show that majority of the respondents expected more but their perceptions were moderate and also majority of the respondents are willing to spread the word-of-mouth about the Estate to prospective customers and will recommend the Estate Developer Company to their friends and others. The research therefore recommends that: improvement should be standardised in the services provided to meet with the world standard of facilities/services provision and facilities management service providers should always identify the most expected service(s) and understand the psyche of the users in order to meet their required satisfaction rather than devoting resources to least expected facilities or services.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p><p> INTRODUCTION 1.1       Background to the Study </p> <p>Increased urbanisationin Lagos has brought the challenge of inadequate housing schemes for home buyers. Government at various levels have not been able to do much in providing accommodation for the growing population.  Aside from shortfalls in supply, the housing conditions of public housing complexes are not of good quality. A lot of problems jeopardize the well-being and quality of life of residents (Ocholi, 1992 cited in Ukoha &amp; Beamish, 1996; David Jiboye, 2012; Rahman, 2014; E. Eyiah-Botwe, 2015). According to Ocholi, (1992), some of these problems include degeneration of the health of the inhabitants due to overcrowding and trash that litters the environment, transportation shortages and poor neighbourhood facilities which include lack of designed playgrounds for children, multipurpose hall, parking areas, safety facilities for the disabled.</p> <p>Torbical and Stroh (2001) research suggested that service is the most important component in determining overall satisfaction. However, previous research have shown how residents of public housinghave expressed dissatisfaction with their housing stock, being low quality housing that do not adequately match their needs, owing to lack of basic features such as good roads, schools, refuse disposal systems, security system, waste disposal, portable water, stable electricity, children playgrounds, community halls, car parks, facilities for the disables, fire escape route, fire prevention and fighting devices, adequate facilities management services, management response to repairs, and handling of residents’ complaints (Salleh et al 2011; David Jiboye, 2012; E. Eyiah-Botwe, 2015).</p> <p>Buying a house is an important event in a person's life. House Buyers Association of Malaysia (HBA), (2002) referred to it as the single and biggest capital investment in one's lifetime. Housing has progressed from its early inception of being a basic shelter towards a portrayer of personal success and aspiration. It now involves activities that generate economic benefits and improve quality of life. Housing should provide residents with safety, comfort, privacy, good health, quality services and value for money (Manuel Jose &amp; Pedro Simoes, 2003; Nor'Aini, 2007 cited in Mustafa &amp; Ghazali, 2012).</p> <p>The foregoing trend have resulted in the surge of private real estate developers, who, having noticed this gap have emerged and going into micro-scale urban planning called gated communities which most times comprise housing types in forms of condominium apartments (Danquah and Afram, 2014). These condominium apartments are in high demand in Lagos, Nigeria, due to population which is growing exponentially, scarcity of land, and because public housing schemes, aside from being insufficient, do not meet the expectations of home buyers in terms of facilities management services.</p> <p>For about two decades now, real estate developers have shifted their focus in housing provision from the low income earners to the middle and upper-middle income dwellers due to the ever-increasing demand for these types of housing (Danquah and Afram, 2014).</p> <p>According to the African Development Bank Market Brief report of 2011, the middle class is a neglected cross-section of the society who account for 34.5million people or 26.8% of the population. This has positive implications for housing development types which is acceptable by this class of home buyers.</p> <p>Studies have shown that good housing have contributed to overall housing satisfaction especially in private gated community schemes. Nevertheless, there is high competition among developers to take over the market. They invest on different dimensions of service quality and costs in order to satisfy customers and obtain a good share of the market (Grubor et al., n.d.; Senaratne et al., 2006; Zadkarim et al., 2011).</p> <p>Despite the competition, top companies like ‘Aircom Nigeria Limited’ expect to perform well in the next two to three years due to high unbilled sales. As at 2012, the company had successfully completed and delivered to various buyer groups several condominium apartments units in the following estates: Northern Foreshore Estate, Friends Colony Estate, Napier Garden Estate, Egerton Place Estate, Bourdillon Court Estate, Milverton Court Estate (AirCom Nigeria Limited/About Us, 2015).</p> <p>In a competitive market as witnessed among private real estate developers in Nigeria, most especially in Lagos, certain factors are responsible for the choice homebuyers make when purchasing condominium apartments. These factors lead to customer satisfaction and can help to increase customer loyalty. Such earned loyalty will make existing customers to advocate for a property developer by engaging prospective buyers in positive word of mouth, help to increase their market share and hence stay ahead of competition. In order to achieve this feat, a real estate developer must provide superior service quality and ensure that existing customers are satisfied because various research have shown that providing superior quality and keeping customers satisfied are rapidly becoming the ways for companies to stand out among competitors (Parasuraman et al., 1985; Zeljko M.Torbica and Robert C. Stroh., 2001). It is against this backdrop that this aimed aimed at appraising users’ satisfaction level with the facilities management services provided by Aircom Nigeria Limited in one of its highly admired condominium apartments in the Lekki suburb of Lagos - The Egerton Place Estate.</p> <p> 1.2       Statement of the Problem </p> <p>Increased urbanisation and population growth has led to shortfall in supply of public housing. Aside from shortfalls in supply, the conditions of public housing complexes are not of good quality. A lot of problems jeopardize the well-being and quality of life of residents (Ocholi, 1992, cited in Ukoha and Beamish, 1997). Some of these problems include degeneration of the health of the inhabitants due to overcrowding and trash that litter the environment, transportation shortages and poor neighbourhood facilities which include lack of designed playgrounds for children, multipurpose hall, parking areas, safety equipment and facilities for the disabled.</p> <p>To overcome these problems and provide acceptable condominium housing types for the people, it is important to look into how successful private real estate development companies have addressed the issues with particular regards to the management of their facilities and property assets, which have make them successful and increased the demands for their housing stocks.</p> <p> 1.3       Research Questions </p> <p>The research is thus aimed at providing answers to the following research questions:</p> <p>        i.            How did the facilities management team perform with regard to users' expectations and perceptions of services across the different SERVQUAL Dimensions</p> <p>      ii.            What are the facilities management team’s areas of strengths and weaknesses</p> <p>    iii.            What will be the behavioural intentions of users from their experience of facilities management services in the estate of the case study</p><p> 1.4      Aim of the Study </p> <p>The aim of the study is to identify and appraise the levels of what constitute residents' satisfaction with regard to provision of facilities management services in the study area (Egerton Place Estate, Lekki, Lagos).</p><p> 1.5      Objectives of the Study </p> <p>        i.            Evaluate facilities management team's performance with regard to users' expectations and perceptions of service across the different SERVQUAL Dimensions</p> <p>      ii.            Determine facilities management team's areas of strengths and weaknesses</p> <p>    iii.            Determine users' behavioural intention from their experience of facilities management services in the case study estate</p><p> 1.6      Purpose of the Study </p> <p>Studies have been conducted on user satisfaction of residential estates (Parasuraman et al., 1985; Ukoha &amp; Beamish, 1997; Zeljko M.Torbica and Robert C. Stroh., 2001; Daramola, 2006; Aribigbola, 2008; David, 2010, Mohammad, Gambo, &amp; Omirin, 2012). Nevertheless, there are no information as to how these residential satisfaction and/or dissatisfaction data would be useful to real estate developers as feedback on existing projects and feedforward to further improve on future designs. This creates a gap as it becomes problems for many developers who would have found such information useful in helping them maintain residential user satisfaction, stay ahead of competition and ultimately help maintain the company's bottom line. Therefore this study sought to look into how real estate developers can use service quality dimensions of SERVQUAL model to test their facilities management services, detect their strengths and consolidate on them, and also detect their weaknesses and improve on them. By so doing, they will achieve high residential satisfaction, increase customer loyalty, achieve positive word of mouth from residents and increase company’s market share.</p><p> 1.7     Significance of the Study </p> <p>This study will benefit three participants consisting of the Facilities Managers, the Real Estate Developers, and the Home Buyers. The study will reflect how the facilities management services are rated by users who are the beneficiaries. This will enable them improve on service provision since it is key to continuously satisfying condominium users. The real estate developers will use the data as feedback to improve on present service provision and as feedforward into future designs and construction in order to ultimately increase demand for their housing stock and preserve their reputation in the industry. The homebuyers would be happy to have invested in a home of choice and realised value for money in terms of home acquisition and top class services that come with it. This will consequently create a 'win - win' situation for all concerned parties.</p><p> 1.8      Scope of the Study </p> <p>The scope of the study is limited to the real estate development sector within the south-western geo-political zone of Nigeria; in particular the Lekki sub-urb of Lagos State. It should have been ideal to extend the research to other states in Nigeria, however, the study restricted the scope to the south-western geo-political zone of Nigeria because a study of the entire country would make conclusions unnecessarily wide, varied and incapable of clear interpretation. More so, factors that operate in the real estate development sector in Nigeria is not the same thing across the various regions of the country. Thus, a study restricted to the south-western geo-political zone of Nigeria. This selection of this geo-political zone will allow the researcher to form definite conclusions, amenable to clear interpretations and create a platform for further research that can be extended to other parts of the country.</p> <p>It would have been ideal to extend the concept of facilities management to all sectors of the economy, however, this would be cumbersome and unrealistic due to the varying sizes of other sectors, couple with their differing problems and standards. This would merely result in over-generalised and unrealistic results which may not be acceptable by scholars, industries and stakeholders. A study devoted to the real estate sector on the other hand, would afford the researcher a more concentrated study in an industry considered as one of the most lucrative in Nigeria.</p> <p>Also, the time frame allowed for the research as well as associated logistics in covering the whole country make it imperative that the research be limited to the south-western geo-political zone of Nigeria.</p> <p>Lastly, there are many residential estates, private and public in Nigeria. It is not possible in the face of various limitations to cover all the estates. Therefore this research is focused on a privately owned and managed residential estate in the Lekki sub-urb of Lagos State in the south-west geo-political zone of Nigeria.</p> <p>This study is an exploratory survey research trying to measure quality management in residential estate within Nigeria. In this context, the research relied extensively on research questions in the form of questionnaire in achieving its aim and objectives.</p> <p> 1.9      Limitations of the Study </p> <p>It is worthy of note that the criterion of residential satisfaction is not without its limitations (Francescato 2002). This must be kept in mind when interpreting the results of this research, but do not invalidate the utility of its criterion.</p> <p>Due to the constraint of time for this research, the author has done study in a specific location. However, no urban location can be representative of all cities in the country. Geographical limitation as introduced above may inevitably introduce limited bias into the survey, which could limit the application of the results to geographically dissimilar areas. Nevertheless, it is anticipated that the results could at least form the framework for future research of other far away locations in the country.</p> <p>Also as highlighted by Asika, (1991), there are various barriers to the collection and exchange of information due to fear of commercial confidentiality. This is even more pronounced if the source of the information is privately owned. That was the author’s experience in the case study location.</p> <p>Limiting the research work to real estate sector is another major drawback of this work in that it hampers the application of its findings to other sectors of the economy without caution.</p> <p>Lastly, future research should examine factors related to the limitations of the current study. More rigorous and detailed testing of measurement scales in Nigeria would further our knowledge of cross-cultural measurement issues. It is possible that some scales developed in Western culture (e.g. service quality measure) may not be suitable for the Nigerian culture.</p> <p> 1.10     Study Area </p> <p>Egerton Place Estate emerged as a residential location in 2013. It is one of the private residential estates facilitated by Aircom Nigeria Limited after its acquisition of 62 hectares of land in Lekki Lagos, in its bid to be a major player in the real estate development industry in Nigeria. It is situated off the Akanni Ajiran Street, Lekki, approximately on Latitude: 6.44861 and Longitude: 3.51555.</p> <p>The entire mass of land of 62 hectares which was acquired by the developer company (Aircom Nigeria Limited) also accommodates a number of luxury privately developed estates by the same company. Notable among them are: Northern Foreshore Estate – A three phase project with several housing units, Friends Colony Estate, Napier Garden Estate, Bourdillon Court Estate and Milverton Court Estate. Development within these estates include block of flats, terrace houses, duplexes and detached houses.</p> <p>An important factor peculiar to Egerton Place Estate is the provision of 24 hours electricity as residents are not permitted to bring in electricity generators into the estate. Going by local standards, condition of infrastructure and management services in the estate can be said to be excellent, with coordinated type of developments, well laid out neighbourhood and provision of services which include security, utilities, sewage, waste disposal, treated water supply and so on.</p> <p>Unlike some other private estates in the Lekki and Victoria Island axis of Lagos, Egerton Place Estate is not prone to any flooding and it is not being affected by rising water levels whenever it rains because it has a well designed and built storm water drainage system which channels water away to the lagoon. This has made it to retain very good road and drainage systems which form part of the visual appeal to any visitor to the estate.</p> <p>Also the estate has maintained a very serene nature devoid of traffic and any noise pollution because incidents of commercial activities and running of electricity generator are not permitted within the estate. This has made the estate a choice one for residents looking for well managed privately owned estate in Lagos, Nigeria.</p><p> 1.11     Definition of Terms </p> <p><strong>Behavioural Intention</strong></p> <p>\"It is defined as a person's perceived likelihood or \"subjective probability that he or she will engage in a given behaviour\" (Committee on Communication for Behaviour Change in the 21st Century, 2002, p. 31)\"</p> <p>With regard to this study, Behavioural Intention is the kind of attitude a customer will exhibit after their experience of a service. This could be favourable, if they had a good experience with the service or it could be unfavourable, if the service experienced did not meet their expectations.</p> <p><strong>Condominium Apartments</strong></p> <p>Condominiums are most often thought of as apartments in high-rise and higher density residential buildings. However, the Canadian Condominium Buyer's Guide defines condominium as: \"a form of real property ownership that has two distinct parts: you own your condominium apartment to which you get a title, and you also jointly own common property with the other apartments owners in your complex\" (Mortgage &amp; Corporation, 2013).</p> <p>Each condominium type has its own unique features, challenges and opportunities. However, something that is common with condominiums is that they house individual property owners sharing decisions which bother on management, operations and maintenance and shared services (Facilities Management Victoria Pty Ltd, 2012).</p> <p>Therefore condominium apartments as used in this study refer to the property where an individual owns an apartment and also jointly owns common property with the other apartments’ owners within a building. Such common property that is jointly owned include: swimming pool, gym, crèche, recreational facilities and other common areas.</p> <p>Condominium apartments could come in the form of:</p> <p>·    low-rise residential buildings (fewer than four storeys);</p> <p>·    townhouse or row house complexes;</p> <p>·    stacked townhouses;</p> <p>·    duplexes (one unit over another) or a side-by-side;</p> <p>·</p>                                                         \n\nAPPRAISING USERS’ SATISFACTION LEVEL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT SERVICES IN CONDOMINIUM APARTMENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " APPRAISING USERS’ SATISFACTION LEVEL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT SERVICES IN CONDOMINIUM APARTMENTS", "id": 2}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>RATING ADMINISTRATION IN NIGERIA</p> <div><p><em>(A CASE STUDY OF NNOBI IN IDEMILI SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA IN ANAMBRA STATE)</em></p><p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p><p>            Property rating in Nigeria is a major contribution of knowledge in the area of rating administration in Nigeria has not been accorded the priority it deserves as an important item of re  venue for local government authorities which rely mainly on funds from the federation account.</p><p>            In developed countries of the world, local government authorities depend to a large extent on the revenue from property rating to finance their programmers.</p><p>            Because most local governments are cash strapped and indigent.

By and large, the rural settlement experienced rapid population growth and since it was at the outskirt of Enugu central, it was not subjected to building regulations and codes, hence houses constructed of handy materials sprang up all over the settlement. Thus the area was crowded with poor housing structures most disorderly located. The settlement has grown and developed in an unplanned manner resulting in the decline of property values and social status of the estate environment. While the dwellers show no indifference to the poor conditions of the urban environment, the city government agencies responsible for planning and managing the urban environment and regulating urban life displayed a mark of ineffectiveness in the discharge of their duties.</p> <p>This condition consequently brought a spontaneous development of sub-standard dwelling, deriod of essential amenities, estate roads, drainage, ventilation, recreational facilities, refuse disposal facilities etc. lack of all these eventually both the available infrastructures and building consign obsolescence and subsequently the slum. Due to this burning issue of slum, the researcher is set to evaluate the effect on property values at Aguowa, its states of evaluation in the study area taking note of both its immediate and remote causes. In other to established and the effect of this slum on property values the researches reduces the population of study which is it properties in the two 92) residential neighbourhoods of Aguowa (namely Trans – Ekulu and Federal Housing Estate).</p> <p>            Stratified random sampling method was used to collect data for the study.</p> <p><strong>1.1       BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Aguowa area is the native home land of the Nike people. The land is the freehold property of the people, as a result of this, some families were able to lease or sell land to non indigenous when the expansion of the Enugu urban centre aught up with the area sometime in 1955. Some of the none indigenes erected houses while others employed the services of licensed surveyors to demarcate the portion of their land in anticipation of erecting structures which would comply with the building bye laws as approve by the municipal council.</p> <p>            Unfortunately, the native authority could not control development in this area, until Enugu was declared as planning area, on 14th September, 1958. Even with the declaration, development continued haphazardly in total disregard of town planning regulation. Uncontrolled development within the area and increases urban population in Enugu led to the blighting of the neighbourhood.</p> <p>            The environmental conditions are considered very poor and dangerous to health. This is partly due to the public attitude towards waste disposal and to the inefficiency and ineffectiveness.           </p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>“Aguowe Jungle” is characterized by slum condition like blighted structure, over crowding, high occupancy ratio mostly by low income group, under supply of public amenities, bade roads etc. This observation made the researcher interested in trying to examine the effect of this condition (slum) on property values and hence the research work.</p> <p><strong>1.3              </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY     </strong></p> <p>The objective of this study is as follows: -</p> <p>a.                   To identify the causes of slum in the study area as well as the indicator of slum environment.</p> <p><strong>b.                  </strong>To find out whether the property value including rental and captial values of landed properties are low or high in Aguowa as a result of slum condition.</p> <p><strong>c.                   </strong>To establish whether the slum has a negative or positive effect on property value in the study area.</p> <p><strong>d.                  </strong>To establish whether slum environment makes investment in real estate and property market transactions, a viable venture.  </p> <p><strong>e.                   </strong>To recommend the best strategy towards eradicating the slum of Aguowa area and hence create a suitable environment that will enhance the property value in the area.  </p> <p><strong>1.4              </strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>To investigate the research problem earlier stated and to rightly address the focus of this study more objectively, certain questions have been raised. It is believed that obtaining the right answers to these questions have been raised. It is believed that obtaining the right ensures to these questions will led to the achievement of the objectives of the study. The questions are as follows:</p> <p>1)         Is there any significant manifestation of slum in the study area when compared with other surrounding layouts. </p> <p>2).        Does slum have any significant impact (positive or negative) on property values in Aguowa.</p> <p>3).        If positive urban planning strategy is applied to the slum area, will thee be any significant effect on real estate values within the slum area/</p> <p> <strong>1.5      THEATRICAL FOUNDATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>            This work is based on the theory of the highest and best use of land. This is meant to mean the optimum use of land and land resources (Baco 1932). This is the use of land in such a manners a manner as to provide and optimum return to their owners, or to society. Aguowe area  is not being put to its highest and best use and that calls for he significance of this study.</p> <p><strong>1.6       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study identifies the types of slum in the study area and elsewhere and has clearly portaged the need for an urban planning policy and also a determined resolve to clear a slum environment so as to enjoy the benefits of real estate environment through the enhanced property values.   </p> <p>The study will also be of very relevance to the practicing estate surveyors and the banking institutions who might need real estate as collateral for providing credit facilities for the conditions of the properties and neghbourhoods when carrying out mortgage and insurance valuations as well as other valuation purposes. Of course a property located in a slum environment will not make for a good collaterals for a bank loan because of low returns.

A possible explanation of their reluctance is that a large expenditure of effort is required before even quite manor contribution can be established. This study will therefore seek to identify and analyze the various ways or methods through which the government, private develops and individual finance the development of real estate in Nigeria in order to bring house ownership within the reach of the people. These ways or methods will be critically appraised in order to determine their short comings and recommendation will be advanced in order to eliminate the short comings and make the method more feasible and viable, do away with non feasible and unprofitable methods and to suggest new methods of achieving the descried goal.</p> <p><strong>1.1       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>As we all know Ebeano Estate, which is located in the northern zone of New Haven Enugu some years back had mainly consisted of detached houses during the military regime. Government workers and officers were very few and he value of property development was not appreciated. Obviously, the residents of Ebeano Housing Estate had not been informed of he need for and essence of real Estate developments.</p> <p>However, with the coming of democracy the population of government workers or civil servants increased more government offices were opened and the inhabitants Enugu began to see and appreciate the value of Estate development. There were more and more civil servants with low income and Asaba became both a commercial and an administrative centre.</p> <p>During the military regimes, one would realize that there was not a genuine effort towards real estate finance it could not be said of Onitsha in Anambra state and Warri as they are much renowned commercial cities. During this period he effort made by government in real estate finance had not gone beyond building office apartment for its workers and perhaps the building of residences for members of staff or the particular ministry concerned with the above one could simply say that the inhabitants of real estate finance and when any effort was made in that regard they had to resort to borrowing since they had never been business included.</p> <p><strong>1.2              </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Real Estate Development is a fundamental and essential feature in the urban environment. Adequate provision of real estate development has a great deal of positive impact on both the economic and social life of urban citizens. Its adequacy has the reverse effect.</p> <p>The shortage of real estate development is one of ht major problem facing the urban centres especially in the developing countries. This could be attributed to scarcity of finance for real project development. Real estate development involves large amount of money. It is usually not within the capability of most urban dwellers particularly the medium and low-income groups. The rate of real estate development constriction often lends to be small and generally depend on financial resources.</p> <p>This situation of financial security is made worse by the rigid attitude of financial institutions towards lending for real estate development. Their system of granting loan makes it very difficult for the medium and low-income groups to benefit from the available facilities. The bulk of the mortgage loans go to the upper class.    </p> <p><strong>1.3              </strong><strong>OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is aimed at identifying and anglicizing the various ways of methods through which the government of Enugu state finance real estate in Enugu. Ebeano to be prescribe in order to bring housing ownership within the reach of the common man. These ways will be critically appraised to determine their shortcoming and recommendation will be advanced to eliminate the shortcomings.</p> <p><strong>1.4              </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>A study on real estate development financing of Ebeano is very important for planning purposed. The appraisal of real Estate development finance is valuable and could be utilized to achieve certain academic objectives. It can enlighten government, students, and researcher on the importance of real property development financing.</p> <p>The general result obtained from this study is expected to broaden the awareness of the public on current sources of real Estate development financer in Enugu metropolis. </p> <p><strong>1.5              </strong><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><em>The Corporation</em><strong>: </strong>This referees to the Enugu state housing, development corporation.

It is the change of ownership or transfer of occupation, which may or may not be accompanied by monitory considerations.</p> <p><strong>1.6              </strong><strong>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>After fully analyzing the nature of this study much diligence was exercised in the collection of all relevant data and information from the Estate surveyor and value and Ebeano housing estate Enugu and also in the liberty. A huge proportion of the information concerning this study was collected through oral personal interviews with all persons and authorities of relevance in the corporation.   </p> </div>\n\nFINANCING OF REAL ESTATE IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FINANCING OF REAL ESTATE IN NIGERIA", "id": 5}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE CAUSE OF ABANDONED PUBLIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN THE FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY ABUJA</strong></p> <div> <p><strong>CASE STUDY FCDA</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The continues abandoning of public projects at various levels of development all over the country is of great concern not only to the governments themselves but more to civil servants who are too inadequately accommodated.</p> <p>In this research work efforts have been made to identify, analyzed and discuss the basic causes of abandonment federal capital development Authority (FCDA) projects.</p> <p>Chapter one serves as an introduction which outlines the background of the study, statement to the problems, aims / objectives of the study, research questions, significance of the study, scope of and limitations of the study plus overview of the study of the federal capital territory (FCT) Abuja.</p> <p>Chapter two serves as literature reviews definition of special terms and also into introduces the reader to some housing policies in Nigeria.</p> <p>The third chapter serves as research methodology where all the sources and method of data collection used in this work are explained.</p> <p>Chapter four is the core of the research work where data collection from the filed are presented and analyzed.</p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0       Introduction</p> <p>1.1       Background of the Study</p> <p>1.2       Statement of the Problem</p> <p>1.3       Aims / Objectives of the Study</p> <p>1.4       Research Questions</p> <p>1.5       Significance of the Study</p> <p>1.6       Scope and limitations of the study</p> <p>1.7       Overview of the study</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>2.0       Literature Review</p> <p>2.1       Abandonment</p> <p>2.2       Development</p> <p>2.3       Development Process in Building Industry</p> <p>2.4       Project</p> <p>2.5       Public Sector Involvement in Housing Development</p> <p>2.6       Types of Public Property</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>3.0       Methodology</p> <p>3.1       Data Primary Sources</p> <p>3.2       Secondary Data</p> <p>3.3       Limitations</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>4.0       Data Analysis</p> <p>4.1              Respondents Views on Causes Abandonment</p> <p>4.2              Respondents Views on the Effect of Abandonment</p> <p>4.3       Respondents Views on the Possible Solution Abandonment</p> <p>4.4       Discussion the Findings</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p>5.0       Summary Recommendations and Conclusion</p> <p>5.1       Summary</p> <p>5.2       Recommendation</p> <p>5.3       Conclusion</p> <p>5.4       References</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0        INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Only little portion of government projects are executed by direct labour, while most of the development projects are awarded to contractions.</p> <p>Public structures have been known to be abandoned in the cause of construction or left to dilapidate after being practically completed.</p> <p>      Incidents of abandoned projects are rampant all over the country e.g. from Enugu to ILorin, port Harcourt to sokoto and Lagos to Maidugwi. Projects of high capital cost. Such as residential buildings, office buildings and even road constructions.</p> <p>1.1       HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE FEDERAL CAPITAL TARRITORY VIZ – AVIZ FEDERAL CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY ABUJA (FCDA)</p> <p>            The federal capital territory Abuja was created in 1976 by Decree No6 of that year which was established the federal capital development agency responsible for the design, construction and administration of the territory.</p> <p>            The decree also vested ownership and control for all land in the territory in the federal government of Nigeria. The territory which is located at the centre of the country covers an areas of 8000sqkm.</p> <p>            It is therefore more than twice the land area of Lagos state (93535sq.km) about two-thirds the size of Imo state (13032sq. km).</p> <p>            The federal capital territory itself is designed to cover an area of 256sq. Km or 3% of the total land area of the territory and at full development the city is expected to have a total population of 3.2 million.</p> <p>            In the FCT the duration of sunshine range from 6-8 hours per day in the south and 8-10 hours per day in the North from January to April / may. There is however a steep drop to a mean of about 4 hours per day in the month of July / August largely due to increase in cloud cover it starts again in the month of September.</p> <p>            Abuja, a virgin land with virtually no amenities of any sort before 1976 even where the pioneer civil servants would stay became a test case. Therefore Civil Servants had to stay in scattered level hotels in Suleja for residential accommodation and a borrowed Niger State Housing Estate had to be used as the Head Quarters of the FCDA.</p> <p>            The only road from Suleja to the Linther land of the territory was a colonial narrow tarred road.</p> <p>            FCDA is a parastatals under the Ministry for the Federal Capital Territory (MFCT) responsible for the physical development f the territory.</p> <p>            Under FCDA is the Development of Public Building and Engineering. The development of Public Building is in charges of designing and supervising f buildings while the Engineering Development, takes charge of road, dams and Electrical Services and bridges.</p> <p>            Most projects are executed through contractors while little is done by direct labour.</p> <p>1.2              STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEMS</p> <p>            It has been observed that inspite f the effort put by government to brings to actualization the conception of its projects, public projects are still massively abandoned at different stages of construction.</p> <p>            What are the factors responsible for the abandonment of public projects?</p> <p>            This study is therefore geared towards examining the factors that cause abandonment of public sector development especially FCDA projects.</p> <p>1.3              AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</p> <p>            The aims of this project are to examine the causes and effect f abandoned Public Development Projects in the Federal Capital Territory Abuja.</p> <p>            The above aim was drafted with the following objectives in mind.</p> <p>(i)                 To establish and identify the cause of Abandoned public developmeent project in the Federal Capitals Territory Abuja.</p> <p>(ii)               To investigate the effect of the abandoned public development projects on the livs of the citizens.</p> <p>(iii)             To investigate its effects also on the environment.</p> <p>(iv)             To suggest possible solution to causes of abandonment of public development projects in the Federal Capital Territory Abuja.</p> <p>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>(i)                 What are the possible causes of abandonment of Federal Capital Development Authority Project?</p> <p>(ii)               What are the possible effect of abandonment of such projects?</p> <p>(iii)             How can abandonment of public development projects be minimized in the Federal Capital Territory Abuja</p> <p>(iv)             What are the possible solutions to abandonment of public development projects in the Federal Capital Territory Abuja.</p> <p>1.5       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>(i)                 It will assist public sector development to avoid abandonment projects.</p> <p>(ii)               It will assist researches on similar topics.</p> <p>(iii)             It will educate the public on abandonment of projects and brief historical background of the FCT.</p> <p>1.6       OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY</p> <p>            The aim of the project is to examine the causes and effect of abandoned public development project in the Federal Capital Territory Abuja. Some of the causes which include inadequate funding or Bankcrupcy, lack of payment, high interest rate, inflation, improper planning, political reasons, delay in payment, corruption, bureacracy and back of special materials having its effect on lowering of living standard of the populace and as well making the environment look ugly among other effects. The chapter two made a reviews of related and relevant literature.</p> <p>            In the chapter three which is the methodology, both primary and secondary sources of data where used the percentage method. In chapter four the data acquired were presented on tables were analysed accordingly.</p> </div>\n\nTHE CAUSE OF ABANDONED PUBLIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN ABUJA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE CAUSE OF ABANDONED PUBLIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN ABUJA", "id": 6}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT IN OGBETE MAIN MARKET, ENUGU</strong></p> <div> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>            It is always known that cleanliness is next to godliness and health is wealth Good health is achieved if there is good management of the environment.</p> <p>            The need for a good management of the environment cannot be over emphasized since there is a continuing environmental decay as a result of increased urbanization.</p> <p>            Pollution is a major problem of urbanization of which most of the causes have been identified as industrial combustion, solid waste generation, oil spillage disposal etc. since these causes are inevitable; there is need for a good control of them.

This phenomenon is predicted on her over increasing population complied with sophistication in taste and demand for domestic and industrial goods by her urban population. The uncontrolled generation and disposal of these wastes have deteriorated our otherwise conducive urban environment. Virtually all cities in Nigeria are characterized by helps or mounting of solid wastes. The health implications of this development on our urban streams, health and socio-economic development leave much to be desired.</p> <p>The realization of good health, hygiene and sustainable development in any society is practically impossible when pollution by way of solid wastes impact strongly on hers socio – economic, cultural and environmental settings.</p> <p>Policy markers, leaders of though and political office holders are daily confronted with endemic problems of what to do with mounting heaps of solid wastes in our urban environment. Many choice properties by virtue of their proximity to dump sites have deteriorated significantly and this has serious negative effect on their rental and capital values.</p> <p>The present scenario depicts a state hopeless as virtually all Agencies of government entrusted with managing the wastes especially ENSEPA seems to be at cross road on what to do.      </p> <p><strong>1.1       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>Solid waste management is a very difficult task, as we all know. It creates a lot of problems to people which include:- drainage blockage (flooding), traffic jam, health hazard and unsightly environment.</p> <p>In addition, environmental pollution in urban centers due to solid wastes is a matter of serious concern to the international community, for pollution in any form interferes with our good chain, health, comfort, amenities, properties values and living standards.</p> <p>Today, all businesses are affected by both environmental changes and government effort towards controlling these changes.</p> <p><strong>1.2       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY     </strong></p> <p>The main purpose of this study is to access solid waste situation in the citizen of Nigeria, more especially in Ogbete main market Enugu. More over the research aims at finding out what should be done in order to reduce the health hazards and of the increasing menace of solid wastes in our market and cities.    </p> <p><strong>1.3       BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Urbanization, which is the purpose of people’s aggregation in cities, has witnessed tremendous increase in recent times. Most cities now in Nigeria have grown to full-scale urban status. The implications of urbanization is manifested in the areas of unemployment, inadequate social amenities due to undue pressures on the available ones by teaming population, increase in crime wave, sophistication and changes in demand and taste complied with high consumption on industrial and domestic goods leading to large volumes of solid wastes.</p> <p>The presence of the solid wastes in our city environment without effective waste collection and disposal machinery has left most of these cities in solided state and their implications on the health of urban. It leaves much to be desired hence the need for this study.</p> <p><strong>1.4       THEORETICAL FOUNDATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is based ion W. Wilkie, Jodan’s Topical hygiene and sanitation theory, which state “that the collection and disposal of refuse and waste matter is any integral part of effective sanitation exercise.</p> <p>From the above view and theory, any effective waste management packaged for proper address of our solid waste hydra headed problems benefit all individual main market.</p> <p><strong>1.5              </strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>The following research questions wee formulated to guide the study. These include:</p> <p>1.                  How do you dispose your solid waste?</p> <p>2.                  Are there any waste bins in your shops?</p> <p>3.                  How often is waste evacuated from your day?</p> <p>4.                  Do you sort your waste before disposal?</p> <p>5.                  Are there sufficient equipment and manpower?</p> <p>6.                  Are the storage, collection and transportation in Ogbete main market dumps from individual shops? </p> <p>7.                  How far are waste dumps from individual shops?</p> <p><strong>1.6              </strong><strong>SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is therefore restricted to solid waste management in Ogbete main market. The scope of study is created into two sections:- </p> <p>a.                   Delimitation</p> <p>b.                  Limitation</p> <p><strong>1.7       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>1.                  The major significance of this study is that it will help in no small measure to maintain efficient and effective waste management system of the study area.</p> <p>2.                  Furthermore, it will help in improving the environmental condition of Ogbete main market.</p> <p>3.                  The findings of this study will also form the basis for further investigations in this study area.</p> <p>4.                  Finally, it will help in the prevention, reduction and control of the disease associated with solid wastes and food poisoning.</p> <p><strong>1.8       OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>For effective coverage of this research it is divide into five (5) chapters made up as follows:</p> <p>Chapter one deals with the statement of the problem, purpose of the study, background and need for the study, the theoretical foundation of the study, research question, scope of study, significance of the study and overview of the study.</p> <p>Chapter two is the literature review. This chapter deals with the view of relevant literature by authorities in environmental and solid waste management.</p> <p>Chapter three is the research design and methodology, which gives the step-by-step procedure adopted in carrying out the study.</p> <p>Chapter five is the finding, recommendation and conclusion of the study.</p> </div>\n\nSOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT IN OGBETE MAIN MARKET,

<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION AGENCY</strong></p> <p>Commercial activities have been on the increase in Nigeria in the past few years.  This is also reflected in the fact that there has been an increase in real estate activities.  The real agency business has therefore in the recent past become a business for all comers market women, housewives, mechanics, taxi drivers, lawyers, doctors, engineers, and in a case I know of, even a battery charger have all cashed in on this burgeoning business.  The reason is not far fetched.</p> <p>The aim of this rather limited.  This is to examine the practice of real estate agency in Nigeria to determine whether only estate surveyors and valuers can engage in such business.  The main question this paper is trying to answer is do estate surveyors have an exclusive right to engage in the acquisition and disposition of interests in real estate? Is there any law granting estate surveyors and valuers such a right? What role should legal practitioner play in the acquisition and disposition of interests in land?  Real estate to a lawyer simply means an interest in land and so the lawyer talks about real property, as distinct from personal property.  Real property or realty, simply means, immoveable property (natural fixed). </p> <p>Actually, agents are used in this field of real estate.  An agent can be defined as a person who act or perform on the behalf of another person known as the principal”.  An agency is a relationship between two persons by their agreement, while one person (the agent) acts on behalf of another, the principal.  An agency is a relationship of another, the principal.  An agency is a relationship between in which someone (the estate agent) acts on behalf of another person (the principal) who seeks to acquire or dispose an interest in the property.</p> <p>Generally speaking though, agency work consists of work done in the course of business, pursuant to instructions received from another person who wishes to dispose of or acquire an interest in landed property.</p> </div>\n\nAGENCY PRACTICE IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AGENCY PRACTICE IN NIGERIA", "id": 8}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>HOUSING CONDITIONS AND OCCUPANCY RATION IN OKPOKO URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING</strong></p> <p><strong>CASE STUDY ENUGU STATE UNIVERSITY</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0       </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Urban renewal evolved more or as a result of the Industrial Revolution which led to urban decay.  The nature of such decay can be attributed to many factors which can be classified under human, economic and social factors. This phenomenon of decay is manifested more on the structures and is characterized by acute shortages with demand always more than supply.  These result to cover crowding and rapid increase in rent levels. As a result of this, the urban poor who cannot afford the rent of decent structure is forced to live in shanty structures, thus the development of slum.</p> <p>        Other social factors which triggers urban decay includes poor sanitary conditions, congestion and the general inadequacies of social services like water and electricity supplies recreational centres, health centres and so on.  According to Okeke D-C 2002, available facilities deteriorate fast and decay sets in due to over use, poor usage performance, lack of maintenance etc.</p> <p>        Urban renewal scheme have continued to make massive impact in the improvement of urban slum in may parts of the World   (Anota, 1982). Urban renewal in its broadcast meaning is a form of reciperating change in the physical city by which the wornout or out modeled structures and facilities in an area are replaced in response to pressure of economic and social change.  Agreeing to this, Chapin 1965 therefore sees urban renewal as a process that has been going on as long as cities have existed.</p> <p>        Urban Renewal strategies include that comprehensive clearance/ redevelopment, the rehabilitation and the conservation approach.  They can be used singly or in combination of one or two considering some criteria.</p> <p><strong>1.2       </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>The truth is that there is no town that has not its own share of problems.  In Nigerian, towns and cities are characterized by many problems. In Anambra State in general and Okpoko layout in Particular, one seems not notice that environmental degradation is the order to living.  The area is characterized by poor quality housing unmaintained streets, poor drainage systems and the absence or lack of public services and facilities.</p> <p>        One of the major problems facing this community is the problem of poor road network. As a result of road network problem is the non mechanized road where passengers as well because of numerous pot holes.  Such factors and its combination results to high rate of transportation and constant hold ups. The present administration in Anambra State is really doing something about this problem.</p> <p>        Another major problem facing Okpoko is lack basic infrastructural facilities and social utilities.  For example, open space which is a major facility in an urban area is not provided, the few place that were mapped out for an open space is used as a refuse dump.</p> <p>        Presently, the Anambra environmental Protection Agency (ANSEPA) is working so hard to make Anambra State as a whole, clean.</p> <p>        Another major problem of the study area that will be death with is housing, condition. Housing conditions will be groped into Good, fair and poor housing conditions according to some criteria.</p> <p><strong>1.2    RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <ol><li>What is the general conditions of building in the study area?</li> <li>What is the population structure and characteristics of Okpoko?</li> <li>What is the general conditions of infrastructural facilities and social services in the study area?</li> <li>What ratio of car ownerships are there in the area?</li> <li>What is the income level educational level of Okpoko inhabitants?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.3    AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to examine the general living conditions as well as assessing the basic conditions social services and infrastructural facilities of Okpoko with a view of making appropriate propovals of renewal strategies/ programmes that will provide decent living condition for the people.</p> <p>        The objectives of the study includes:</p> <ol><li>To address the problems of shortage of houses in Okpoko through renewal strategies by providing more housing units for the inhabitants of the study area.</li> <li>To examine the environmental conditions, conditions improving them through renewal strategies.</li> <li>To examine the populations structure of Okpoko inhabitants.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.3       </strong><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>This is drawn in relation to the objectives.  Thus:</p> <p><strong>H0:    </strong>There is no significance relationship between the population of Okpoko residents and the general conditions of the basic social services and facilities.</p> <p><strong>HI:    </strong>There is a significant relationship between the population of Okpoko residents and the general condition of the basic social services and facilities in Okpoko.</p> <p><strong>1.5    KEY VARIABLES</strong></p> <p>In testing the above hypothesis, the dependent variable “Y” which is the condition of the basic social services and facilities depends on the independent variable “X” which is the population characteristics of the study are.</p> <p><strong>1.6       </strong><strong>JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY </strong> </p> <p>From the planning point of view, the study is of great significance because it identifies the causes of urban decay and make proposal for its elimination or alleviation.  The study area, Okpoko to the precise is faced with the problems of overcrowding, over use of existing social services and community facilities, obsolent and sub-standard buildings.  Thus, the justification of this study is the propose a compressive approach for the alleviation of slum and the creation of an environment that is void of pollution, untidiness and eyesore.</p> <p><strong>1.6       </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong> </p> <p>A study on urban Renewal for Onitsha with a particular reference to Okpoko in Ogbanu local Government Area, Anambra State is of immense importance for planning purposes, academic purposes, and developmental purposes.  Such research as this can enlighten the government, students, lecturer, and researchers on what could be obtained in Okpoko.</p> <p>        Such result can be information as well as education not just for the government but also for urban and regional planner who may apply the lesion and finding on their planning programme.</p> <p><strong>1.7       </strong><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>For the purpose of this project and the time framework, this dissertation will be based on the housing conditions, transportation network, basic social services and infrastructural facilities obtainable in Okpoko.</p> <p><strong>1.8       </strong><strong>OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS</strong></p> <p>The most research work, a lot of terminologies and / or professional jargons are often used to achieve comprehensive understanding of the work.</p> <p>Definition of terms in this sense becomes imperative more so when one considers the fact that the readers on such works might have their professional orientation in their disciplines. Such terms therefore, requires special definitions to give a clear cut meaning with regards to the context in which they are applied.</p> <p>        In this work, the terms “urban’, Urban renewal’ ‘strategy” , ‘upgrading”, ‘blight”, “slum’ , neighbourhood” conveys specific meanings.  These are stated here under to avoid confusion while going through the work.</p> <p><strong>URBAN</strong></p> <p>Though, there is no agreement among experts as the most appropriate definition of what constitutes an urban area.  However, a more summarized definition of the term which suites out purpose here is that given by Mabogunje (1963), Using population index as a base, he definition an “urban” as any compact settlement with a population of 20,000 or more, which in addition will have to posses those other attributes of urban area such as large densely built up area, heterogeneity of population, specialization of economic activities and large portion of population in  non agricultural pursuits, sophisticated way of life much dives from rural norms and independent government within a large policy.</p> <p><strong>URBAN RENEWAL</strong></p> <p>        The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English defined “renewal as to given new life and freshness.  The Chambers 20th Century Dictionary sees renewal as a process of renovating, transforming to new life, reviving, beginning again, making again, restoring, regenerating etc</p> <p>        Synthesizing the two terms, “urban” and “renewal” urban renewal has therefore been described as a deliberate effort to change the environment through planned large scale of existing areas to meet present and future requirements for urban living and working (Grebler, 1965).</p> <p><strong>STRATEGY</strong></p> <p>The term “strategy’ as used here is a denoted plan of action for solving planning problems in our urban areas.</p> <p><strong>URGRADING</strong></p> <p>        This is used in this work to mean raising the status, quality, value etc of the living conditions of the urban or city.</p> <p><strong>BLIGHT</strong></p> <p>        The work ‘blight” is a term used to denote the deteriorating conations which have been renewed.  It is specifically referred to the deterioration of a dwelling unit below acceptable standard.</p> <p><strong>SLUM</strong></p> <p>According to the United States Housing Act of 1937, slum in defined as a an area where dwellings, predominate which by reason of dilapidation overcrowding, faulty, arrangement  or design, lack of ventilation, poor sanitation conditions, or any combinations of these factors is detrimental to the safety, health, welfare or morals of the people.</p> <p><strong>NEIGHBOURHOOD</strong></p> <p>Neighbourhood here implies a residential layout within an urban setting in which the resident have common and convenient access to a number of public services and facilities such as schools, plarygroudns, shopping centre etc. The development layout of this idea was first put forward by Clearance Perry (1910) which he explained in detail in one of his works.  “a neighbourhood is a primary school district.</p>\n\nHOUSING CONDITIONS AND OCCUPANCY RATION IN OKPOKO URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " HOUSING CONDITIONS AND OCCUPANCY RATION IN OKPOKO URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING", "id": 9}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE EFFECT OF COMMERCIAL LAND USE ON AND VALUE</strong></p> <div> <strong>A CASE STUDY OF OGUI URBAN</strong> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>            Land use can be described as a way, manner or older in which land is used by people in an area for different purposes.

As a result, investors tend to exploit commercial land around these areas, which include, ………… artisan, Edinburgh, independence layout new layout, onu-Asata, Obiagu etc. The unique attract a lot of investors who in turn refuse to abide to the enforced planning laws by the central authority.     </p> <p>In offer words, value in basic economics is detained as the utility or satisfaction which a good or seminar offers for the purpose of this write piece, value mean the worth of an interest in a land or building.</p> <p>Land use in Enugu was proposed earlier when Enugu was under Anambra state and the use of commercial lands by investors was properly monitored and up till date it is still being monitored but not effective like it used to be in the case investors who migrated into others areas that were not commercial proposed areas tailed to accept the fact that those areas were not purposively commercial proposed areas but were to support commercial activities. This therefore became a treat to the individuals residing in those areas. Ogui urban is a typical example of these areas. This work is to demonstrate the effects of commercial land use on land value, and I intend to sow this in this work piece.      </p> <p><strong>1.1       HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</strong></p> <p>            Ogui urban is located in the capital city of Enugu state. She deviated from the Affar and got her first paramount Chief in the person of late Chief Augustine Nnamanni who died on the 30th day of October 1993. Ogui did have any chief until 2002 the chief was sworn in he was Chief Oko Michael Mmaduekwe.</p> <p>            Ogui became or got her autonomous community on the 12th day of July 2003. Her culture in enriched with different dances and masquerade. Ogui urban is made up of five villages they include Umuokokwette, Umuabu, Onuatu Onu Asala and Onyke with two local government the Enugu North and the Enugu Central North.</p> <p>            She shares a common boarder with her brother Abakpa Nike along the presidential road while the original Ogui dweller reside at Umunevo village. Now a town that accommodate a lot of investors and visitor and student.       </p> <p><strong>1.2       GEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>            For a long time now; it has been recorded that investors face the problem of investing blinding without knowing the effect on the land value.</p> <p>            They do not know the effect of commercializing a land set out for federal values. As such most investors abuse the constitutional provision for land value and in time to come they will be victimized by the execution of government plan on an exploited land.</p> <p>            The level of indiscriminate dumping of refuse that brings about environmental bleeder, the congestion of planned building by investors allowing space for the major road and eating into part of the pedestrian path.</p> <p>            The increase in the movement of investors accommodates the vandalization of electrical cables, blocking of drainages with refuses.     </p> <p><strong>1.3              </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research is to make the government the land use allocation authority and the private investor, realize the effect of commercial land use on land value in Ogui urban.</p> <p><strong>1.4              </strong><strong>SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The development of Ogui Nike was divided into two stages “urban Ogui and Rural”</p> <p>Ogui at the moment rural – Ogui has suffered trickling development while the urban Ogui has been effectively development.</p> <p>The urban Ogui include the control business district (Atesian, Ogbetle) this scope in focused mainly on the effect of commercial land use. </p> <p><strong>1.5              </strong><strong>LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work is limited to some extent by the inconsistency of records as the urban and regional planning authority of Ogui. Some of the officials were not always available to provide or give out the necessary map diagram. It was also limited to some extent by inadequacy of finance.   </p> <p> <strong>SOURCES OF DATA</strong></p> <p>Data used for this study were obtained from both primary and secondary source primary data were obtained by filed survey while the secondary data were procured from previous relevant literatures, textbooks, published and unpublished journals and very good students from Ogui – urban who gave the researcher the historical background of the study area. Also maps were gotten from the town-planning officer</p> </div>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF COMMERCIAL LAND USE ON AND VALUE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF COMMERCIAL LAND USE ON AND VALUE", "id": 10}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>A CRITICAL EXAMINATION ON LAND USE AND ALLOCATION PROCEDURE</strong></p> <div><p><strong>(A CASE STUDY OF OWERRI)</strong></p><p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p><p>        The aim of this project is to examine and evaluate the physical, social and economic effects of the present location of land use activities the Owerri Urban and recommend solution to the problems identified.

This growth has been accompanied with an ever increasing physical social and the technological changes as well as complex Urban Pattern of development.</p><p>This fast development with its attendant sprawling effects on the original settlement and town out skirted always cause some land use congestion. Personal and political pressures etc. within and around the area involved.</p><p>In 1976, Owerri became the capital of the then creates Imo State. Almost immediately,  the original settlement which were more or less residential / agricultural areas became engulfed with the fast sprawling development in Owerri.</p><p>However the morphology of these land activities in the area was observed not be the function of only the original settlement patten, but also a function of the government policies so in relation to the development of the area. These policies so in relation to the development of the area. These policies and their subsequent implementation in no small measure, contributed to the Owerri Urban with their resultant effects on the indigenous other inhabitants of the area, as the existing facilities in the area.</p><p>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p><p>The main problem of this study was to examine and evaluate the physical, social and economic effect of land use activities in its present location in Owerri Urban and recommend solution to the problems identified, because there has been series of criticism against the manner by which land was allocated to people in Owerri Urban</p><p>1.3    AIM AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</p><p>This research work aimed towards recognizing the existing land use situation in Owerri Urban and thus high lighting the implications and results of previous development programmes and their implications. This will then severs as basis for formulating a more functional and efficient planning programmes for the area.</p><p>THE OBJECTIVES ARE</p><p>1.     To evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the allocation procedures.</p><p>2.     To identified the achievements and shortcoming of the procedure.</p><p>2.     To suggest possible means of implementing better land used and allocation procedure.</p><p>1.4       POSSIBLE RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</p><p>The postulation of this study was that conflicts of interest often arise between political planners and the physical planners in the planning and executive of land use activities therefore and allocation procedure in Owerri is defective.</p><p>1.5    RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY</p><p>In this study, case study research method was to be used. Important information were get through the use of primary and secondary sources like interviews questionnaires observation, journals and books on related topic. These will be distributed to Estate surveyors, lawyers, town planners, civil servants and residents of government layout. Data collected will be analyzed statistically with percentage and chi – square..</p><p>1.7    SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</p><p>The significance of study was to serve as a guide to land experts v12 Estate surveyors, lawyers etc. on the land for efficient utilization of the available land in Owerri urban.

A property manger gets involved with managerial problem solving and decision making. He also performs several activities and tasks involving planning, organising, directing and controlling with respect to the portfolio of real estate assets being managed on behalf of his clients.</p><p>This is important since one of the features of real property that distinguishes it from other investment media is its requirement to be managed.</p><p>Because of the increasing pace of technological development or innovations resulting particularly in the construction of high rise and high technological structures in our cities, there is need for a trained manager who is able to cope effectively and efficiently with management problems arising from the latter.</p><p>Multi – tenanted properties such as office blocks and residential houses present the greatest management challenge to the surveyor.</p><p>The author’s experience of non-challant attitude of a good number of property investors regarding the management of the property prompted the choice of this topic</p><p><strong>1.2       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY </strong></p><p>The study will examine the problems of property management, and proffer solutions towards rectifying these problems</p><p><strong>1.3       SCOPE</strong></p><p>This project will be limited to a few selected property in Abuja metropole, which includes.</p><p>1.                  Shelter House</p><p>2.                  Alaji M.D. shitus property on Plot 801 Malumfashi Close Area 11, Gariki Abuja</p><p>3.                  C.O.C.

This return, which may not always be financial may also be in the form of social benefit, status, prestige, political strength etc.</p><p>John P. Macey and  Charles Baker defined property management as the application of skill in caring for property. Its surrounding and amenities, and in developing a sound relationship between tenants themselves, in order that the Estate, as well as t he individual house may give the fullest value to both the land lord and the tenants, from the land lords point of view it is desirable that the property should be efficiently and economically maintained and managed as much as possible, while from the tenants point of view, the house should provide a home, the focal point of full and happy life for the family.</p><p><strong>1.6       PROPERTY MANAGEMENT APPROACH</strong></p><p>There are two types of property management approaches used in this study.</p><p>(i)                 Active management approach</p><p>(ii)               Passive management approach</p><p><strong>Active management approach:</strong> This type of management encompasses both long term and short time strategies. This involves constant attempt by the property manager is involved in all issues concerning improvement maintenance, repairs, conversion, extension, of e property etc. The advantage of this system of management is that it enables the property manager to be aware of all problems concerning the property. Since his attention is required at any time matters regarding the property comes up. This provides him with an opportunity to asses the state of the property and determine all necessary actions needed t obtain maximum return.</p><p>            It also makes it possible for the manger to detect defects, and remedy them at an early stage to prevent it from degenerating into a more complex one, there by prolonging the life of the property.<br/><strong>Passive Management Approach</strong></p><p>            This is a system of management where the manager takes little or no part in the management of the property.</p><p>            This approach has a disadvantage especially in a situation where the tenant exhibits a non – chalalant attitude towards the maintenance of he property, the property manager may also loose grip of what goes on in the property and may discover the damage done to the property when it is already later and require more funds to undertake repairs.</p></div>\n\nPROBLEMS OF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND SOLUTIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS OF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND SOLUTIONS", "id": 12}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>THE PROBLEM OF SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT IN ENUGU METROPOLIS</p> <div><strong>Abstract</strong><p>This research work is aim at examining the practices and problems solid waste management with particular reference to IMT Campus III.</p><p>The research choose the random sampling Technique based on the population concentration from three (3) location within  the study area.</p><p>The data obtained were analysed using percentage statistics method.

During the 1st century with industrial revolution rapid population growth in the develop world and the volume of waste produce was relatively small. Today in developing nations, like, Nigeria, solid waste accumulate in every city causing serious health and environmental hazard.</p><p>The practice of dumping waste on streets, roads, streets and unapproved sites lead to breeding to rats, flies and out break of plagues as well as ecological impacts, such as water and air pollution. This is because the capacity of nature to dilute, disperse or absorb or dispose of its unwanted residues in the atmosphere, water way and land is limited. It is against this background that the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA) was established in 1988 manage and protect the environment. The decree establishing the agency also provided for the establishment of State Environment Protection Agencies (SEPA) in all the States of Federation.</p><p>However, the prevailing economic condition in the country coupled with negative attitude of the citizens made it difficult for proper solid waste management and environmental protection solid waste consists of biodegradable (that is substance that can be broken down by bacteria) and non biodegradable (that is substance that cannot be broken by bacteria) materials and these are usually deposited at refuse dumps and other unapproved sites. They pile up in heaps blocking road and drainage, road, network thereby consisting environmental hazards. The inhabitants of the neighborhood sometimes set the heaps of refuse ablaze in an attempt to reduce the size. This practice further deteriorate the environment since people are exposed to danger of air pollution.</p><p><strong>1.2              </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong></p>Changes in Technology brings about changes in the consumption habit of the citizenry and therefore the composition of waste materials.<p>Thus a lot of non-biodegradable waste (that is substance that cannot be broken by bacteria) are generated and since non-biodegradable are not easily absorbed or diluted naturally such waste accumulate in heaps along major streets. The stinking odour and blackish liquid effluence emanating from such heaps especially during the rainy season constitute environmental hazards and degrade the aesthetic values of our environment.</p><p>They as well encourage breeding of mosquitoes and communicable diseases. Therefore the rate of generation of solid waste is not matched with the rate of evacuation as a result of problems ranging from lack of funds and professional experience staffs of bureaucracy and redtapism.</p><p><strong>1.3              </strong><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p>The purpose of this study is to<p>(i)                 To determine the composition of solid waste in campus III</p><p>(ii)               To examine the different management strategies being adopted in solid waste management by the institution as well as ENSEPA.

An individual can satisfy this need by either occupying his own (owner’s occupier) property or renting another persons property. In our traditional society, the need for shelter is mainly met through the first alternative, that is owner occupation. With the emergency of urban centres, the situation has changed. Many people are no longer about to own property because of the difficulty in the acquisition of land and the high cost of building construction. Therefore, they are left with the alternative of renting other people’s properties in order to satisfy their need for shelter. Consequently two classes of urban resident have emerged, the landlord and the tenant under this arrangement the tenant pays to the landlord a certain amount of money in consideration for his use of the landlord’s house. This amount is popularly known as rent.</p><p>During the civil war the Nigeria that is 1966 to 1970 many landed properties in the urban areas of the former Eastern Region of Nigeria, including Enugu, were destroyed. Consequently, there was a sharp decline in the supply of landed properties after the war. Furthermore, the post – civil war period witnessed an unprecedented number of the rural population trooping into the urban centres due to the conspicuous prosperity brought about in the urban area by the oil boom. This resulted to high demand for the existing limited supply of landed properties. Consequent upon these, rent for landed properties increased considerably.</p><p>This trend has continued with the effect that “the average worker is paying between 30% to 40% of his salary as rent ” (Oshadiya, 1985). Thus the increase in rents on the properties has led to the variation of rent on properties.</p><p>In urban area due to location advantage (for example prime location) which some properties offer above others for commercial and residential uses, rent tend to very on account of the type of use which a property can offer.</p><p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p><p>Location of economic properties has been a difficult concept to understand. Although the primary objective of commercial properties is the derivation of financial gains, while that of residential properties is for habitation, shelter and comfort, the demand for land is a refection of the profitability or utility derivable from it use. The greater the benefit to be obtained from a particular use, the higher the rent that the user will be willing to pay for it.</p><p>There appear to be wide ranging differences in the levels of rent passing on residential and commercial properties in Enugu and Nigeria generally.</p><p>This research is seeking among other things to find out the causes of rental variation in commercial and residential properties in Nigeria, Ogui New Layout as a case study.</p><p><strong>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p><p>The main purpose of this research is to examine the reasons for rental variation in commercial and residential properties with a view to provide tool to be used in catching issues related to rent on these properties in Enugu and Nigeria generally.</p><p>In order to achieve the standard goals, the following objective are to be undertaken;</p><p>i)                    To identify the current level of rents for commercial and residential properties in the study area.</p><p>ii)                  To ascertain and examine the factors influencing the rents being commanded by these properties.</p><p>iii)                To specify the implications of rental variation on decisions to acquire those properties.</p><p>iv)                To determine the trend in rental values for residential and commercial properties in the study area.</p><p><strong>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p><p>The finding of this study will be of benefit to the following;</p><p>Firstly, tenants who are charged rents based on different reasons, especially when the properties are of the same nature (physically). This will again enable the investors not only to understand how occupier thinks, but also why and the things they consider before acquiring properties for certain uses. For example residential and commercial use.</p><p>Secondly, the generality of the public can now understand the reason why the rents being commanded by these properties have to differ.</p><p>Lastly, this research work will help to determine the factors influencing, commercial and residential properties which is an essential pre-requisite to successful development as well as stimulating interest in the students to carryout out further research on the topic.</p><p><strong>1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p><p>The study covers a period of three years (2002 to 2004) and it is restricted to selected properties (Residential and commercial) comprising blocks of flat and tenements in Ogui New Layout, Enugu</p></div>\n\nA COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF RENTAL VARIATION IN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF RENTAL VARIATION IN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES IN NIGERIA", "id": 14}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>MANAGEMENT OF COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <div><p><strong>(A CASE STUDY AT AWKA METROPOLIS)</strong></p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong><p>            In this recent times there has been inflationary trend in the Nigerian economy this has also effected different sectors of the economy including the financial affairs as long as one registers he becomes a management of commercial properties.

The demise of same commercial properties in Nigeria did not discourage further investment in the development of commercial properties in Nigerian. Obviously the “big” names served the need of the whole of Awka metropolis when few investors considered the development of commercial properties (shopping complexes) as a worthwhile problem and the idea of a Central Business District was accorded a high respect.</p><p>Recently the management is not an easy idea to conceive for real estate especially with such development  are in use by  the  owners.

This payment is on the increase n modern times due to several factors which includes increase in the price of goods, inflation and greed on the part of landlords. Similarly, the collection of rent is limited by a lot of problems which often results to rifts between landlords and tenants.

These measures have come in form of rent control edicts and recovery of premises edicts, as well as the setting up of rent tribunals. These laws have been adopted by various states of the federation, and modified to address the problems of rent collection peculiar to their state. States such as Cross-River, Kwara, Anambra and Lagos State have done this. These laws will be reviewed in this study, in order to arrive at a better understanding of how these laws canbe used to address the problems of rent collection in residential properties in Enugu metropolis.</p><p>Three neighbourhoods have been selected for this study. They include: new Haven, Obiagu and Achara Layout all in Enugu metropolis.   </p><p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p><p><strong>1.0                                   INTRODUCTION</strong></p><p><strong>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY   </strong></p><p>        Housing is one of the most basic needs of man second to food and followed by clothing. As man continues to undergone changes from one stage to another, the need for decent housing keeps arising. Increasing human population and advancing technology have increased the need for housing. This need overtime have been addressed through the provision of residential property by developers who in turn collect rent from the tenants. Increasing demand for housing which keeps rising above the available supply has given rise to hike  in rental price of housing, especially residential housing.</p><p>        Housing as a basic need is being provided by the public and the private sector. The private sector which is a major provider of housing do so at exorbitant prices and employs various methods in collecting rents. However, the process of rent collection in residential properties is marked by problems which often lead landlords to take extreme measures to ensure that rent is collected. Sometimes too, landlords and tenants do engage in long legal battles which often times linger  on over a long period of time.</p><p>        Measures to address the problems of rent collection have been adopted by the public and private developers. The government have enacted rent control edicts and rent tribunals to help to ensure that rent collection issues are properly handled with minimal disagreements.</p><p>        Rent collection is a method of residential property management for both the public and private providers of housing. It involves the collection of an agreed sum of money after a specified period of time which could be monthly, annually or bie-annually as the case may be. Rents collected on residential property are used to manage the property and rehabilitate the property if necessary. This helps to increase the life span of the property. Rent to be collected on a property is usually subject to increment after an agreed period of time in order to accommodate inflation.</p><p>        Rent collection in Nigeria as well as in Enugu metropolis is the principal duty of the provider of the housing. However, this duty most times is delegated to other parties who collect rent on behalf of the owner. Such delegation is usually made to Estate Agents, caretakers or any other representative who engage in contractual agreements on behalf of the landlord both for rent collection and admittance of new tenants. Estate Agents when acting on behalf of landlords charge monthly or yearly fees for their services. These fees are added tot eh rent payable by the tenant, further increasing it.</p><p>        The government as a provider of housing have made several attempts to address the issue of rent collection in Nigeria. Laws such as the rent control and recovery of premises edict and other similar laws found in various states are some of the measures taken by the government. The rent control edict has been adopted by various states of the federation to reflect their peculiarities. These laws cover areas such as fixing of rent, mode of collection and increment.</p><p>        Rent collection on government owned residential property has lesser problems than that of private individuals. This is often the case because tenants perceive the government as having the power and right to eject them from their houses more than private individuals. Therefore, they easily comply with the payment of rent without delay whether the price is high or not. The mode of collecting rent from tenants by the government which is usually through government agencies also help to reduce the problems of rent collection  on government owned residential property.</p><p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM</strong></p><p>        The process of rent collection on residential property has a lot of challenges. One of such challenges is delay in the payment of rent. Some tenants fail to meet u ewitht he agreed dealine for payment. This could be asa result of delay in the payment of wages by their employers, increase in rental price, the effects of inflation, among other factors. Delay in the payment of rent often results to the tenant being penalized by paying extra on the agreed rent. It could also lead to legal battles between the landlord and the tenant, which may lead to the forceful eviction of the tenant.</p><p>        Another challenge of rent collection is in the area of regular increment. This condition may arise when the interval for rent increment is not specified in the ‘Tenancy Agreement’. This leaves the tenants at the mercy of shylock landlords who increase rent at will. Similarly, when property owners delegate their rights as landlords to agents who act on their behalf, these agents charge service fees which are added to the rent price. This is usually perceived as rent increment by tenants. In addition, most landlords do not give enough time  or even formal notice of increment to tenants. These problems leads to delay in payment or even refusal to pay.</p><p>        A third challenge is the absence of any signed document of agreement between landlords and tenants. Such a document which should contain details on the amount to be paid, when to pay, and whom to pay to, when absent can result to problem when rent collection is due. The absence of a ‘Tenancy Agreement’ may bring disagreements between the landlord and the tenants on whether rent should be paid annually or monthly as the case may be. </p><p>        Rent collection becomes problematic when the property in question belongs to  a family and the members are having disputes as to who rent should be paid to. In addition, when the landlord and the tenant are engaged in legal battle, the tenant may likely decline from paying rent until the matter is determined. To achieve this, the tenant may device a means of making the case to linger, during which rent is forfeited.</p><p>        Other problems of rent collection arise from continuous inflation and increase in the cost of raw materials which in turn increases the cost of rent.</p><p><strong>1.3    AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p><p>        The aim of this study is “To evaluate the problems of Rent collection as an aspect of residential property management in Enugu”, with a view to making recommendations on how to address these problems;</p><p>        The following objectives will help in achieving the aim of the study:</p><p>1)   To determine the methods of rent collection by residential property owners in Enugu metropolis.</p><p>2)   To determine the contribution of the government in rent collection.</p><p>3)   To identify the problems of rent collection in residential properties in Enugu metropolis.</p><p>4)   To make recommendations on possible ways to solve the identified problems of rent collection in Enugu metropolis.</p><p><strong>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p><p>        The following research questions will be answered during the study:</p><p>1.   What are the methods of rent collection in residential properties in Enugu?</p><p>2.   In what way has the government contributed to rend collection in Enugu?</p><p>3.   What are the problems of residential property rent collection in Enugu?</p><p>4.   How can the problems of residential property rent collection in Enugu be solved?</p><p><strong>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p><p>        This study on the evaluation of the problems of rent collection in Enugu metropolis is especially significant considering the rising wave of tenancy cases in law courts. This study will help to reduce tenancy cases by identifying the problems of rent collection and proffering solutions to address these problems. By reducing the number of rent-related suits in court, the burden on the courts will be reduced and enough time devoted to other more important cases.</p><p>        The significance of this study can also be found in the area of reduction in forceful eviction of tenants. This will result from a better understanding between landlords and tenants. Furthermore, since rent collection is an important aspect of property management, this study will enable property owners to assess the best possible way of collecting rent. This will help to save time spent on litigations and as well save resources which are scarce.    </p><p><strong>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p><p>        The scope of this study covers the problems of rent collection as an aspect of property management in Enugu. However, emphasis will be placed on residential properties in Enugu metropolis alone. This is because rent collection covers a wide range of property types, and delving into these will make the study too broad. Also, the study will cover the methods of rent collection in residential properties in Enugu. Doing so will help in identifying the problems inherent in them.</p><p>        Furthermore, this study covers the contribution of the government to rent collection in form of the various edicts, bye-laws and acts. Attempts will be made to figure out areas where these contributions by the government to rent collection can be employed to solve the problems of rent collection in Enugu metropolis. Finally, recommendations on how to solve the problems of rent collection in Enugu metropolis will be made based on the findings of the study.</p><p><strong>1.8    OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY</strong></p><p>        This study deals with an evaluation of the probes of rent collection as an aspect of residential property management in Enugu metropolis. In other words, attempts will be made to  identify the problems of rent collection as it affects residential property. During the study, the methods employed by landlords in the collection of rent for residential property will be aanlysed with a view to determining the effectiveness of thee method. To achieve this, the researcher will interview selected landlords, tenants and agents.</p><p>        Furthermore, this study will evaluate the contribution of the government to  rent collection by looking at the various rent control edicts and other laws on rent control. The main aim of the study is to evaluate the problems of rent collection as an aspect of property management in Enugu metropolis. Objectives such as; determining the methods of rent collection in residential property, determining the contribution of the government to rent collection, identifying the problems of rent collection were drafted to help in achieving the aim.</p><p>        Finally, this study is presented in five chapters. Chapter one contains the background of the study,  chapter two has the literature review and chapter three contains research methodology. Chapter four deals with data presentation and analysis, while chapter five covers the recommendations and conclusion.</p></div>\n\nEVAULATING THE PROBLEM OF RENT COLLECTION AS AN ASPECT OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY COLLECTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EVAULATING THE PROBLEM OF RENT COLLECTION AS AN ASPECT OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY COLLECTION", "id": 16}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><b>COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF RENTAL VARIATION IN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES IN NIGERIA</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The study of rental variation of real estate investment, whether residential or commercial, is very important at this time when emphasis is on investment performance analysis in many parts of the world. This is even more important in Nigeria where only few studies have been carried out on the rental variation in residential and commercial property achieved by property investment. Moreover the impact of the ongoing changes in the global and local economy on the value of real estate investment is serving to highlight the need for its careful consideration in the investment decision making process (Palmquist, 1980).</p> <p>Since 1990s, the demand for commercial outlets has risen astronomically in most urban centers in the country. This is as a result of the economic recession which compelled the unemployed and public servants to explore trading activities in addition to their normal jobs. The investors’ reaction to this development has been to increase the number of commercial outlets at the expense of residential property developments. Therefore in many towns and cities of Nigeria, open spaces within the vicinity of public institutions have been irrationally developed to accommodate shops and other retail outlets. The situation is further compounded with the perceived notion among Nigerian property investors that commercial property performs better than residential property investment (Smith, 1986). However, the investors can no longer base their decision on intuitive grasp of the market which Ajayi and Fabiyi (1984) considered inadequate for success in property ventures.</p> <p>The central theme of this study therefore is to examine the rental variation of residential and commercial property investments in the study area. This will provide for better investment decision and risk management for real estate investors in Nigeria.</p> <p>Commercial properties are properties generally occupied for the purpose of carrying on a trade or profession in the expectation of realizing profit. They comprise mainly of shops, offices, showroom among others and they command the highest rent out of the other types of properties uses. Rent provides the basis of value for landed property and the trends in Land values are of significance in the prediction and determination of income from real property. Also, the income realizable from real estate is required in evaluating the viability of projects. A number of factors combine together in determining changes which property values undergo which are of great concern to the Estate managers and valuer.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The issue of fair valuation of residential and commercial real estate properties has been a major challenge in Nigeria. Indeed, not much has been done in the area of valuing residential housing units and commercial/business complex in the economy.</p> <p>Nevertheless, in recent times, the literature on real estate has seen a number of techniques and models developed in a bid to achieve efficient valuation of residential houses. The use of artificial neural networks has been the most popular and recent in this regards. In the advanced economies, the use of artificial neural networks is now predominant in several fields including tax assessment, medical diagnosis, bank risk analysis, stock analysis &amp; control, traffic control, and real estate valuation etc (Moral - Esperanza, 2004).</p> <p>In Nigeria, unlike in many other economies, the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in actual valuation of housing units has not been done (Eriki &amp; Udegbunam, 2008). It is against this background, that this study examines the fairness or otherwise, of the price fixing mechanism for residential and commercial properties in Nigeria. </p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the rental variation in residential and commercial properties in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To analyze the factors that influences the value of residential and commercial properties in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.  To determine the reasons for rental variation in residential and commercial properties in Nigeria.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What is the rental variation in residential and commercial properties in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.  What are the factors that influence the value of residential and commercial properties in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  What are the reasons for rental variation in residential and commercial properties in Nigeria?</p> <p><b>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>HO: There is no variation in the rental value of residential and commercial properties in Nigeria.</p> <p>HA: There is variation in the rental value of residential and commercial properties in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study</p> <p>1.  The findings from this study will enlighten the general public on the current value of residential and commercial properties in Nigeria.

Therefore, the significance that the incessant abandonment of residential buildings and projects would bring several effects on real properties and its values and the economy cannot be overemphasized since some of the abandoned buildings and development projects provide the basic services that should enhance the real properties developed. </p> <p>Abandoned residential building is a building whose occupant has moved out basically due to poor maintenance and infrastructure, security, dilapidation, natural disaster which has made the building not to be habitable. The abandonment of residential properties and development projects is the act of isolating the building or discontinuing any activities or maintenance works on such development project within a time frame of the contract agreement and with no intention of returning back to the development (Spelman, 1993). Similarly, O’Flaherty (1993) while reflecting on property development projects suggest that it is when an owner or developer is ceasing to provide the required maintenance management to a developed property. </p> <p>However, real property development and maintenance being a capital intensive undertaking should be critically analyzed to ascertain its feasibility and viability before embarking on it. But, on several occasions and as it had been observed, governments, contractors and agencies have abandoned old buildings and development projects mid-way into construction and completion. </p> <p>The causes and effects of these residential building abandonments are not just peculiar to a particular reason rather cut across several reasons (Ayodele and Alabi, 2011), and as well as creating a total dwindling effects on the values of developed properties located close and within the vicinity. Most of this abandoned residential building usually turned into hideout for criminals.</p> <p>Although, the location of the abandoned property and demand is equally important but accessibility and the availabilities of the infrastructures in the real property location and in the surrounding built environment should be of much more significant determinants in this study context. Values in itself are not intrinsic (Schram, 2012) rather depends on the benefits derivable from that property. </p> <p>While this remained the case for real properties, it is essential for any real property to have sustained improved values, and this is assumed to be influenced by the availability of the earlier mentioned infrastructures in the real property location. So, if the needed infrastructures are imperious in determining the property values. Benin City is the State Capital of Edo State, Nigeria is characterized with lots of abandoned residential building due to urbanization, poor infrastructures and roads. Residents of Benin City living in erosion prone areas have to pack out of their houses because of flooding and fear of reptiles. Some school buildings have been abandoned due to neglect by successive government which has turned into hideout for criminals and cultists.</p> <p></p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The causes and effects of abandonment of residential property has been a subject of concern for experts in real estate. Therefore, the study purpose is to investigate the causes and effects of abandoned residential property on real property and its values. The cogent of this study is on the premise that the expected real properties and its values in Nigeria are suspected to be dwindling as a result of incessant abandonment of residential properties. But, by exploring this context should help establish and recognize the causes and effects of abandonments of buildings by citizens, governments, policy/decision makers, educationalist and practitioners. This, through eradication of these causes should expect to eliminate these identified effects and sustain real properties and its values in the economy.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To identify the causes of abandonment of residential properties in Benin City.</p> <p>2.  To examine the effects of abandonment of residential properties in Benin City.</p> <p>3.  To identify the solutions to issues of abandoned residential properties in Benin City.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What are the causes of abandonment of residential properties in Benin City?</p> <p>2.  What are the effects of abandonment of residential properties in Benin City?</p> <p>3.  What are the solutions to issues of abandoned residential properties in Benin City?</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  The results of this study will educate the general public on the causes and effect of abandonment of residential building in Nigeria with a view of reducing the issues of building abandonment in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  The outcome of this study will guide the government and policy makers on ways to make and implement policies that will reduce the rate of residential building abandonment in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on the causes and effect of abandoned residential properties in Benin City will cover all the cases on abandoned residential buildings in Benin City carefully examining the causes.

The market which is currently valued at approximately N6.5 Trillion is estimated to grow at an average of 10% over the next few years. The major growth drivers in the sector have been credited to: an increased inflow of foreign investment (especially from South Africa, MEA and the United States); increased institutional investment from local companies including PFAs and Mutual Funds; the growing population of High Net worth Individuals; and the targeted intervention of the Federal Government in the housing finance sector. This however indicates that a lot of stakeholders and investor are confident about the structure of the Nigeria real estate sector even with the dwindling economy of the nation (Olotuah, 2000).</p> <p>Real estate investing involves the purchase, ownership, management, rental and/or sale of real estate for profit. Improvement of realty property as part of a real estate investment strategy is generally considered to be a sub-specialty of real estate investing called real estate development. Real estate is an asset form with limited liquidity relative to other investments, it is also capital intensive (although capital may be gained through mortgage leverage) and is highly cash flow dependent (Agbola, 1998). If these factors are not well understood and managed by the investor, real estate becomes a risky investment. The primary cause of investment failure for real estate is that the investor goes into negative cash flow for a period of time that is not sustainable, often forcing them to resell the property at a loss or go into insolvency. A similar practice known as flipping is another reason for failure as the nature of the investment is often associated with short term profit with less effort.</p> <p>The success of any investment activity rests heavily on the availability of adequate finance in real estate investment which more often than not is beyond individual investors’ current financial resources. This financial insufficiency naturally turns investors to financial institution for possible credit advancement. Mbanefo (2002) observed that the importance of banks in our economy lies in their monopoly  of the resources to provide loans for industrial and commercial developments. The provision of this loan however, carries the risk of default in repayment hence the need to take adequate, reliable and appropriate security for the purpose of insulating default risk associated with credit transactions in banks.</p> <p>Real estate continues to be in high demand indicative of investor’s confidence since it meets the need of the public consumer. A hotel, commercial office, residential estate or retail park will continue to perform well, whether on the basis of sales or rents as long as the product meets the needs of the consumer on the basis of location, price and quality. We are beginning to see the green shoots of recovery in investor confidence across the Nigerian real estate sector. This is evident in the number of hospitality &amp; leisure, residential, retail and commercial office transactions either in the early stages of development or in the planning. </p> <p>Real estate markets in most countries are not as organized or efficient as markets for other, more liquid investment instruments. Individual properties are unique to themselves and not directly interchangeable, which presents a major challenge to an investor seeking to evaluate prices and investment opportunities. For this reason, locating properties in which to invest can involve substantial work and competition among investors to purchase individual properties may be highly variable depending on knowledge of availability. Information asymmetries are commonplace in real estate markets. This increases transactional risk, but also provides many opportunities for investors to obtain properties at bargain prices. Real estate entrepreneurs typically use a variety of appraisal techniques to determine the value of properties prior to purchase to boosting investor’s confidence (Agbola, 1998).</p> <p>Investor’s confidence in real estate is determined by an investment rating of a real estate property which is the measures of the property’s risk-adjusted returns, relative to a completely risk-free asset. Mathematically, a property’s investment rating is the return a risk-free asset would have to yield to be termed as good an investment as the property whose rating is being calculated. The underlying drivers for property ratings are the dividends (net operating income) and capital gains over a certain holding period, and their associated risks or variances. A property’s investment rating is then a transformation of the risk-adjusted averaged return to a single number that conveys the property’s long-term potential to yield profits.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The Real Estate sector offers a great potential source of growth for Nigeria. Until now, the understanding of its composition and growth has been somewhat limited to its required use in Nigerian national accounts without considering the role of investor. Currently, Nigeria is in the midst of a housing boom, primarily due to the great demand created by a rising population. Nigeria’s housing deficit is estimated to be 17 million as of August 2012 which has gave several investors confidence of profitability in real estate in Nigeria.

In most cases, commercial banks hold more assets than any other financial institution. In some cases even more than central bank. Apart from their many functions, commercial banks facilitate growth and development. Banks lends in many areas or sectors of the economy. Viewed from the building and construction sector, they contribute to investment, employment creation, and by extension, the process of infrastructure and economic growth. However, the researcher is examining the roles of the commercial banks in Nigeria in financing building and construction projects in Nigeria (Farrel, 1985).</p> <p>The building and construction industry in both developed and developing countries may be viewed as that sector of the economy which, through planning, design, construction, maintenance and repair, and operation, transforms various resources into constructed facilities. The types of public and private facilities produced range from residential and non-residential buildings to heavy construction, and these physical facilities play a critical and highly visible role in the process of development (Kheni et al., 2008). The major participants from the building industry include the architects, engineers, management consultants, general contractors, heavy construction contractors, special trade contractors or subcontractors, and construction workers, along with the owners, operators, and users of the constructed facility. </p> <p>Olowo-okere (1985), (cited in Eshofonie, 2008) asserted that most countries put over 55% of their gross domestic investment into the creation of physical facilities, including infrastructure that is necessary for development. The building sector has various levels of manpower ranging from highly skilled professionals to completely unskilled labourers. In developing countries, physical construction activities alone provide between 2 and 6% of the employment demands of the nation and the subsidiary activities provide an additional 2 to 4%, while in the developed countries the figure rises to between 6 to 10% and 4 to  6 % (Cockburn and Charles, 1970; Okeola, 2009). Ibironke (2004) and Shittu and Shehu (2010) stated that the building industry plays a key role in satisfying a wide range of physical, economic and social needs and contributes significantly to the fulfillment of various major national goals.</p> <p>The commercial banks form an important source by which many investors get funds to finance building and other real property projects. Commercial banks are money creating financial institutions that perform three major functions, namely acceptance of deposits, granting or loans and the operators of the payments and settlements mechanism.</p> <p>The major issue in building, real estate development and investment is finance. There is no iota of doubt that funding is an important factor in real estate development and building projects. The complexity and to a large extent, its capital intensive nature demands proper and adequate funding to make it realizable. The terms and availability of the needed funds determine the trend of building operation. Availability and easy accessibility of building finance in sufficient quantity will definitely accelerate all forms of property development. Building financing is concerned with the production of finance for building houses and office complexes which are basic necessities in a growing economy like Nigeria. The benefits to be derived from a rise in building financing in Nigeria are many and include; </p> <p>1. Increased rural and urban houses for the teaming Nigerian population. </p> <p>2. The construction of industrial estate for the localization of industries and commerce. </p> <p>3. An increase in employment for those in the construction industry. </p> <p></p> <p>The sourcing of funds for investment in building development poses a great deal of problem for the developer. This is largely due to economic instability and stringent measures imposed by most financial institutions. This is compounded by the fact that the interest rate structure has had an unfavourable impact on funding the development of building sector. Since the financing of building development is a long term project, it has necessitated the high interest rate that is being charged on the funds provided for such development purposes. Hines (1995) revealed that six major building financing methods are used across the world namely; Joint Venture, Equity and Debt Financing, Sale-lease Back Financing, Advance Payment of key money and Sale of Securities.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Over the years, the government had been the major player in the area of building and housing development in Nigeria, by providing direct finance to the builders for previous housing schemes. This was embedded in the housing policy of past administrations but today, the dwindling nature of revenue accruing to the government, coupled with gross mismanagement and misappropriation of public funds and revenue has prohibited the ability of the government to continue to play her role as before (Nubi, 2000). The mortgage finance institutions are faced with certain problems of low level of awareness of the services rendered by the institutions, bureaucracy in the granting and disbursement of mortgage loans to the borrowers, misunderstanding of the banking terms by the depositors and the public due to the used of technical and professional terms which are not understood by a layman and problem of repayment of loans by the borrowers. Commercial banks has the key player in the financial sector has contributed to the development of various sectors of the Nigerian economy by funding.

Also included are by- products of process lines or materials that may be required by law to be disposed of (Okecha 2000). Solid waste can be classified in a number of ways, on the basis of sources, environmental risks, utility and physical property. On the basis of source, solid wastes are again classified as: Municipal Solid Wastes, Industrial Solid Wastes and Agricultural Solid Wastes. Nigeria’s major urban centres are today fighting to clear mounting heaps of solid waste from their environments. These strategic centres of beauty, peace and security are being overtaken by the messy nature of over flowing dumps unattended heaps of solid wastes emanating from household or domestic or kitchen sources, markets, shopping and business centres. City officials appear unable to combat unlawful and haphazard dumping of hazardous commercial and industrial wastes which are a clear violation of the clean Air and Health Edicts in our environmental sanitation laws, rules and regulation.</p> <p>Refuse generation and its likely effects on the health, quality of environment and the urban landscape have become burning national issues in Nigeria today. All stakeholders concern with the safety and the beautification of our environment have come to realize the negative consequences of uncleared solid human wastes</p> <p>found in residential neighbourhoods, markets, schools, and central business districts in our cities. These solid wastes have become recurring features in our urban environment. It is no longer in doubt that Nigerian cities are inundated with the challenges of uncleared solid wastes. As a result, urban residents are often confronted with the hazardous impact to their collective health and safety. </p> <p>A United Nations Report (August 2004) noted with regret that while developing countries are improving access to clean drinking water they are falling behind on sanitation goals. At one of its summit in 2000 (Uwaegbelun 2004) revealed that The World Health Organization-(WHO 2004) and United Nations International Children Education Fund- (UNICEF 2004) joint report in August 2004 that: “about 2.4 billion people will likely face the risk of needless disease and death by the target of 2015 because of bad sanitation”. The report also noted that bad sanitation – decaying or non-existent sewage system and toilets- fuels the spread of diseases like cholera and basic illness like diarrhea, which kills a child every 21 seconds.</p> <p>The hardest hit by bad sanitation is rural poor and residents of slum areas in fast-growing cities, mostly in Africa and Asia. In 1992, the “Earth Summit” succeeded in alerting the conscience of the world to the urgency of achieving environmentally sustainable development. The Summit asserted that if we know enough to act today, then we must also find answers to many tough conceptual and technical questions that have remained unsolved over time. It affirms that rapid urbanization in developing world if ignored can be a threat to health, the environment and urban productivity.</p> <p>Cities are the engines of economic growth, but the environmental implications of such growth need to be assessed and managed better. The critical and most immediate problems facing developing countries and their cities are the health impact of urban pollution that are derived from inadequate water services, poor urban and industrial waste management, as well as air pollution, especially from particulates which constitutes part of solid waste.</p> <p>Among the pressing environmental and public health issues in Nigeria today is the problem of solid waste generation and disposal. The problem of solid waste management is a historical one because man’s existence is inextricably linked to the generation of waste. The problem is becoming intractable as many cities in developing countries cannot keep pace with urbanization, pollution, and the increasingly concomitant generation of garbage due to changing life styles and consumption patterns.</p> <p>The mountainous heaps of solid wastes that deface Nigerian cities and the continuous discharge of industrial contaminants into streams and rivers without treatment motivated the federal government of Nigeria to promulgate Decree 58 for the establishment of Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA) on 30 December 1988 (Federal Military Government 1988).</p> <p>A national policy on the environment was formed and the goals of the policy include: to secure for all Nigerians a quality of environment adequate for their health and well being; to raise public awareness and promote understanding of the essential linkages between the environment and development; and to encourage individual and community participation in environmental protection and improvement efforts (FEPA 1989). As regards the solid waste sector, the specific actions desired include collection and disposal of solid waste in an environmentally safe manner; setting up and enforcement of laws, regulations, and standards; encouragement of public participation; environment monitoring and imposition of penalties on defaulters to encourage compliance (FEPA 1989; FRN 1991).</p> <p>In spite of the formulation of FEPA and a national environmental policy, the environment has not been adequately protected. Interest is mainly on aesthetics, which is rarely achieved (Agunwanba 1998). Wastes collection is irregular and restricted to the major cities. Improperly sited open dumps deface several cities, thereby endangering public health by encouraging the spread of odors and diseases, uncontrolled recycling of contaminated goods and pollution of water sources (Adegoke 1989, Singh 1998).</p> <p>Sadly, there seems a resignation to the unremitting solid wastes build up by the relevant authorities, where such bodies exist at all. However, in reactions to the inescapable environmental impact of delay in solid wastes removal, the federal government for example, introduced the monthly environmental sanitation in the early seventies. There from the States and Local Governments were expected to take a cue and evolve their own solid wastes management (SWM) strategies based on the peculiarities of their environment.</p> <p>Each state had in the process of mitigating urban solid wastes, set up Wastes Management Boards (WMB) in attempts to tackle the occurrence of wastes and their hazards to society as a whole. While the unhealthy aspects of abandoned solid wastes can be contained, the more avoidable features of blocked drains, traffic impedance and floods have yet to be fully tackled.</p> <p>One resonant feature common in the wastes build-up and emanating environmental degradation scenarios is the high cost or capital intensive nature of its amelioration as well as tackling the solid wastes menace. It requires a lot of financial and human capital to minimize and attempt to eradicate the adverse effects of exposed and untreated solid wastes in our urban centres.</p> <p>It is expected that government would in due course arrive at the means to combat solid wastes and reduce their negative impact on area residents and the perception of our cities as being dirty, chaotic, and full of traces of rotting or fermenting garbage that emit odours harmful to the human body. Obviously, the timely removal of accumulated solid wastes require much more than our governments at all levels are presently engaged in. Further plans, policies and programs would need to be put on a more permanent basis in order to combat the dastardly effects of environmental degradation. Understandably, it would require effective mobilization of resources such as involving all stakeholders in regular counter measure to suppress uncontrolled solid wastes generation and irregular disposal outside city confines altogether.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>As a result of increased urbanization and infrequent environmental sanitation exercises, urban residents dump solid wastes carelessly or haphazardly – anywhere they deem fit. Such controversial tendencies and attributes would seem incomprehensible; if we desire to live in beauteous environments. Some of the lagoon front in the country has been turned into a dump for human and all sorts of solid waste. Trucks fully loaded with feces queue up in large numbers to discharge the contents into the lagoon (Njoku 2006). Environmental experts are of the view that the implication of this practice is very grave. The failure of relevant agencies to stem the tide of reckless waste dumping and littering of Nigerian cities’ infrastructure (streets and roads) and surrounding bushes indicate a clear pattern of non-enforcement or non-implementation of existing environmental sanitation laws.</p> <p>Irregular and unplanned dumping of solid wastes, especially at night, which are often in gross violation of relevant rules and regulations continue to hinder plan preparations and effective land use delineation which were expected to usher in a beautiful, clean and orderly environment. Consequently, there remains a huge gap between policy formulation, execution and implementation which exacerbate the problem of solid waste management in Nigerian cities which necessitate the need to evaluate the problems of solid waste management in Nigeria by the researcher.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objective of this study:</p> <p>1.  To evaluate the problems of solid waste management in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To examine the consequences of poor solid waste management in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.  To identify the strategies than has been adopted in solid waste management in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What are the problems of solid waste management in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.  What are the consequences of poor solid waste management in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  What are the strategies than has been adopted in solid waste management in Nigeria?</p> <p><b>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>HO: Solid waste management has not been effective in Nigeria.</p> <p>HA: Solid waste management has been effective in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  This study will educate the general public, stakeholders in environmental management, students, government and policy makers on the problems of solid waste management focusing on Nigeria with a view of identifying management strategies to combat the menace associated with poor solid waste management.</p> <p>2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on the evaluation of problems of solid waste management in Nigeria will cover all issues related to solid waste management system in Nigeria.

Osemenan (1987) reported that Nigeria has become the “world’s junk-yard of abandoned and failed projects worth billions of naira and it is greatly unthinkable that Nigeria blessed with so great potentials in the building and construction industry can experience such magnitude of project failure and abandonment. According to another report by Kotangora (1993) there are about 4000 uncompleted or abandoned project belonging to the Federal Government of Nigeria with an estimated cost of above N 300 billion which will take 30 years to complete at the present execution capacity of government, also according to him this issue of abandonment and construction project failure is been left without adequate attention for too long which is now having a multiplier effect on the construction industry in particular and the national economy as a whole. The building and construction industry plays a very dominant role in the economy of any nation. A healthy economy usually experience an increase in building and construction activities, but in a depressed economy, the incidence of project abandonment and construction failures tends to be more prevalent. Akindoyeni (1989) qualitatively reasoned that some of the causes of project abandonment and construction failure in Nigeria are deaths of client, inability of client to attract fund and lack of good planning.</p> <p>The abandonment of development projects is the act of discontinuing any activities or maintenance works on such development project within a time frame of the contract agreement and with no intention of returning back to the development (Spelman, 1993). Similarly, O’Flaherty (1993) while reflecting on property development projects suggest that it is when an owner or developer is ceasing to provide the required maintenance management to a developed property. There could also be construction failure due to improper planning.</p> <p>However, real property development projects being a capital intensive undertaking should be critically analyzed to ascertain its feasibility and viability before embarking on it. But, on several occasions and as it had been observed, governments, contractors and agencies have abandoned development projects mid-way into construction and completion.</p> <p>The causes and effects of these development projects abandonments and construction failure are not just peculiar to a particular reason rather cut across several reasons (Ayodele and Alabi, 2011), and as well as creating a total dwindling effects on the values of developed properties located close and within the vicinity. The expected prominence of any earmarked development projects is to be completed, while at the same time, adding values to the built environment aesthetics. Although, development projects are temporary endeavors undertaken to create a unique product and services with a defined beginning and ending date (Gardner, 2005). The accomplishment of such purposes should be realized at all times otherwise needless of such development (Gardner, 2005). The development projects specific in the study framework is infrastructural projects (such as; house, electricity, road, schools, and drainage). However, the study purpose is to investigate and assess the causes and effects of development projects abandonment  and construction failure in Nigeria. <b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The unceasing abandonment and failure of development projects is so shocking in the developing countries such that Nigerian has remained one of the countries in such difficulty (Ayodele and Alabi, 2011; Kotangora, 1993; Osemenan, 1987). Therefore, the significance that the incessant abandonment of projects and construction failure would bring several effects on the aesthetics of the environment, real properties and its values and the economy cannot be overemphasized since some of the development projects provide the basic services that should meet the needs of the people. However, this study will examine the causes of construction project failure and abandonments in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the causes of construction project failure and abandonments in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To examine the effect of construction project failure and abandonments in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.  To determine the solution to the problem of construction project failure and abandonments in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What are the causes of construction project failure and abandonments in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.  What is the effect of construction project failure and abandonments in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  What is the solution to the problem of construction project failure and abandonments in Nigeria?</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  This study will educate the general public and the experts in the building industry on the causes of construction project failure and abandonments in Nigeria with a view of proffering solution to the problem.</p> <p>2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic. </p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on causes of construction project failure and abandonments in Nigeria will cover the issues of abandoned projects, failed project and all other abandoned infrastructural facilities.</p> <p><b>LIMITATION OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>Financial constraint</b>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p> <b>Time constraint</b>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

A risk is that probable event that could lead to depreciation of the value of property or outright loss of investment (Clayton, 2007). The existence of such factors should not discourage an investor from investing but rather use the knowledge of commercial real estate risk analysis and management that the researcher is examining to help secure an investment. The primary commercial risk in real estate investment in Nigeria is the possibility of falling into the hands of fraudsters. Fraudsters sometimes attempt to sell a property that does not belong to them. This is another source of issues for investors but could be eliminated by engaging the services of professionals to help investigate the title to the property that is being sought for purchase and to ensure that all the documents needed from the seller are prepared, signed and collected (Fisher, 2005).</p> <p>Another possible commercial real estate risk investors may face as a real estate investor in Nigeria is government or political risk. Because of the wide ranging power of the executive arm of government and fluidity of functions, the government could acquire private land but the land so acquired must be for public purposes. Unfortunately, there are several instances where government has acquired private land for “public purposes” and “development control” only to turn around and allocate to other individuals to use for their own private projects. Some have experienced their Certificate of Occupancy revoked by a new government due to the fact that the owner does not belong to the same political party. This kind of policy inconsistency is a major discouragement to investors. However, be that as it may, whenever investors are planning to purchase a land in an area, engage professionals (e.g. Surveyors) to confirm whether or not the land is under acquisition by government or could or could not be sold (Black, 1986).</p> <p>At other times, after government has acquired family lands and compensated the appropriate families, some of the traditional land owners still go ahead to sell portions of those lands to the unsuspecting public. Many people purchase such lands and begin to build without government building approvals. The implication of this, as many have painfully learnt, is that when government decides to take possession and pull down the structures on such lands, such a purchaser will not be compensated by government. It is also important to note that some areas have already been acquired or building developments in such areas already restricted (Syz, 2008). For instance, land under the power cables should not be built upon. Many are flaunting this law but should the government decide to enforce such regulations, several people would be affected.</p> <p>There are also financial risks involved in commercial real estate investment. If an investor decide to use a bank loan to buy a property, there is need for the awareness that what we call mortgages in Nigeria, is technically a commercial loan. Ideally, a real estate/home loan should be a single-digit interest loan, but what Nigeria currently have are double – digit commercial loans. Although, the government established a National Housing Fund (NHF) single – digit – interest loan that could advance a contributor up to N25m, many have not been able to access the loan due to bureaucratic bottlenecks and red tape. Some who have accessed the loan have had to apply for a bridging loan at commercial double-digit interest rates in order not to miss their desirable property. </p> <p>Despite its inherent risks, commercial real estate presents a compelling opportunity for investors. Not only does the sector provide many long-term investment benefits, including healthy income returns and a hedge against inflation, but fundamental factors such as the improvement of the risk/return characteristics of the overall mixed asset portfolio. The case for investing in commercial real estate looks particularly attractive when viewed in the context of the current market environment, although it is not without risk. Perhaps the most obvious reasons why commercial real estate merits inclusion in a management portfolio are derived from both cyclical and noncyclical factors – specifically, the favorable long term outlook for real estate demand, from both users and investors, property cash flows and real estate’s potential inflation hedging characteristics. The liquidity of commercial real estate provides investors the most efficient means to obtain exposure to property markets globally. The ability to trade daily not only provides a useful tool for investors to create tactical allocations to the sector and global regions, but it also provides a means to efficiently re-balance allocations as market conditions change.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>It is very important for investors in commercial real estate to first ascertain the risk factors of an investment asset as good as possible before committing investment funds to such investment. Investors’ informed decisions with respect to the risk and develop strategies of real estate investments in order to ensure profitability. Commercial real estate investment is usually rental properties intended to generate a return from rental income or capital appreciation. Commercial property types are office, retail, multi-family, industrial and hotel, self-storage, seniors housing and health care among others. Investments in these real estate assets are associated with multiple risk complexities which includes: investment illiquidity, asset value volatility, asset valuation inaccuracies, leverage-amplifying negative performance during falling markets, limited/ imperfect benchmarks to gauge closed-end fund performance, combination of a large lot size (capital intensive investments) and high transaction costs.

As a result, there is an urgent need to address the high cost of these products which is said to have slowed down the growth of the building and construction sector in Nigeria. Building materials constitute the largest single input in housing construction. While Adedeji (2010) observed that about sixty (60) per cent of the total housing expenditure goes for the purchase of building materials, Arayela (2005) averred that the cost of building materials constitute about 65 percent of the construction cost. </p> <p>Ogunsemi (2010) opined that building materials form the main factors that restricts the supply of housing and ascertained that they account for between 50-60 percent of the cost of buildings. Thus, Adedeji (2002) rightly observed that one main barrier to the realization of effective housing in Nigeria as revealed in successive government efforts has been the cost of housing in the country. He argued that in the early periods, shelter in Nigeria was easily affordable as building materials were sourced from the immediate environment at affordable costs. Technology also was readily available with commensurate simple techniques. But contact with the outside world through interregional and international training of professionals in foreign countries as occasioned by colonization, brought changes to tastes and hence outlook to house forms. These changes rendered the undeveloped local building materials inadequate while there was an increased demand for exotic ones. Accordingly, Arayela (2002) posited that the modern building industry lays much emphasis on sophisticated building materials and techniques that are expensive and energy consuming. Though, housing delivery efforts have evidently been inhibited by prohibitive costs of building materials, this problem cannot be reasonably and reliably overcome by merely resorting to the use of locally available materials without due considerations to the applicable initiative, the cost of processing and sustainability of the local materials. One of the most important components of a sustainable building is the material efficiency. Correct selection of building materials can be performed by taking into account their complete life span and by choosing products with the minimal environmental impacts. For instance, González and Navarro (2006) estimated that the selection of building materials with low environmental impacts can reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by up to 30%. The use of renewable and recycled sources is widely encouraged as the life-cycle of a building and its elements can be closed (Chwieduk, 2003). The major factor that greatly affect the selection of building materials are their costs and social requirements such as thermal comfort, good mechanical properties (strength and durability), aesthetic characteristics and an ability to construct quickly. Ideally, the combination of all environmental, economic and social factors can give a clear description of a material, and thus helps in a decision making process regarding the cost of the materials suitable for buildings (Abeysundara, et, al.,2009) .  Nigerians would continue to pay more for accommodation in major cities until the cost of building materials is subsidized through probably through tax reduction. The instability in the price of building materials was posited as a direct result of high taxes which in turn impacts on the cost of accommodation in major cities across the country. According to Arayela (2002), many completed housing estates had remained unoccupied because of the high rental and sale prices attached to them as against the meager income of the average Nigerian workers. He also added that if government can revitalise our industrial base, the cost of building materials will come down and many more people would be able to build houses. He therefore  urged the Federal Government to provide tax relief for local manufacturers and importers of building materials in order to reduce the high cost of accommodation in major cities.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Building materials have been playing an important role in the construction industry—they are those materials put together in erecting or constructing structures, no field of engineering is conceivable without their use (Akanni, 2006; Udosen &amp; Akanni, 2010). Building materials contribute immensely to the quality and cost of housing, from what is used in the foundation to the materials for roofing and finishes, while the building materials industry is an important contributor to the national economy of any nation as its output governs both the rate and the quality of construction work.</p> <p>The cost of building materials poses a significant threat to both the construction industry and people aspiring to own houses (Anosike, 2009; Mekson, 2008; Mohammed, 2008; Njoku, 2007); for example, a bag of cement, which is valued at Ν1,350.00 in 2006, goes as high as Ν1,850.00 in 2009 (Anosike, 2009) depicting about 37% increment; the bag goes as high as Ν2,000.00 in 2015 during peak season (field survey 2015). Supporting this view, Jagboro and Owoeye (2004) earlier established that increase in the prices of building materials has multiplier effects on housing development while Idoro and Jolaiya (2010) affirmed that many projects were not completed on time due to the cost of materials, which have been on the increase. Besides timely completion, high prices of building materials form a crucial constraint to improving housing conditions in Nigeria (United Nations Centre for Human Settlement [UNCHS], 1993).</p> <p>In spite of the past studies on the cost of building materials in Nigeria, little is publicized about the implications of the rise in cost on the construction industry; most literature (Jagboro &amp; Owoeye, 2004; Mekson, 2008; Njoku, 2007; Oladipo &amp; Oni, 2012) has concentrated on identifying the causes with little emphasis on the implications; hence, the research seeks to provide information on the effect of cost of building materials on housing development in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the effect of building materials cost on housing development in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To determine the factors responsible for high cost of building materials in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.  To proffer solutions that will reduce the cost of building material to ensure adequate housing development in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What is the effect of building materials cost on housing development in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.  What are the factors responsible for high cost of building materials in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  What are the solutions that can reduce the cost of building material to ensure adequate housing development in Nigeria?</p> <p><b>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>HO: Cost of building materials does not affect housing development in Nigeria.</p> <p>HA: Cost of building materials does affect housing development in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  Findings from this study will educate the general public on the current market cost of building materials in Nigeria and its effect on sustainable housing development in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  The results of this study will sensitize the policy makers and the government on the need to make and implement policies that will reduce the cost of building materials in Nigeria thereby encouraging massive housing development all over the country.</p> <p>3.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on the effect of building materials cost on housing development in Nigeria will cover the current prices of building material in Nigeria focusing on how it has influenced the provision of affordable housing for the Nigerian populace.</p> <p><b>LIMITATION OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>Financial constraint</b>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p> <b>Time constraint</b>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

Adequate housing provides the foundation for stable communities and social inclusion (Oladapo, 2006). Gilbertson et al. (2008) have observed that there is a significant association between housing conditions and physical and mental health of an individual. People’s right to shelter is thus a basic one and the provision of decent housing to all requiring them should be the hallmark of every civilized society and one of the criteria for gauging development. However, the provision of adequate housing in Nigeria and other developing nations alike still remains one of the most intractable challenges facing human and national development. Previous attempts by all stakeholders, including government agencies, planners and developers to provide necessary recipe for solving the housing problem have yielded little or no success.</p> <p>Teufic and Ural (1978) Ogundele (1989) Agbola (1987) Okpala and Onibokun (1986) recognized finance as part of housing problems but ranked land and building materials higher. Their findings influenced government housing policies and subsequent establishment of some relevant programmes and institutions like the Site and Service Programme and the National Institute of Road and Building Research. The drought of information and working knowledge of housing finance operation is a major problem today. In a tight money market, housing is the first area to suffer, since neither the builder nor the consumer can readily obtain finance for housing. Actually, many builders have difficulty obtaining capital for their projects even in normal times. Two of these problems – the high interest rates that contribute to the high cost of housing and the difficulty in obtaining capital for home construction. According to Onabule (1996) 245 Primary Mortgage Institutions were established under the NHP within 1991-1996. Unfortunately, only 54 are now operating, mainly in South West part of the country and Abuja. According to Abiodun (1999), National Housing Fund collected about 4 billion naira from the Mandatory Saving Scheme. Out of N300 million loan approved by FMBN, only N100million was advanced.</p> <p>According to Arilesere (1997), Abiodun (2000) and Okupe et al (2000), the history of housing finance in Nigeria had been an appalling one. The sudden leap from Agro-based to Petro-Naira based economy did not help matters. The assertion that “money was not our problem but how to spend it” accredited to one of our Heads of state, is a summary of a Nation that lacked focus in the formative years. This situation together with unprecedented population growth has remained unchecked ever since.</p> <p>The Housing Sector plays a more critical role in a country’s welfare than is always recognized, as it directly affects not only the well-being of the citizenry, but also the performance of other sectors of the economy. Adequate housing provision has since the early 1970s consequently engaged the attention of most countries, especially the developing ones, for a number of reasons. First, it is one of the three most important basic needs of mankind– the others being food and clothing. Second, housing is a very important durable consumer item, which impacts positively on productivity, as decent housing significantly increases workers’ health and well being, and consequently, growth. Third, it is one of the indices for measuring the standard of living of people across societies. Consequently, programmes of assistance in the areas of finance, provision of infrastructure and research have been designed by governments to enhance its adequate housing delivery. The focus on finance has, however, been very prominent for obvious reasons. This is because housing provision requires huge capital outlay, which is often beyond the capacity of the medium income/low income groups.</p> <p>A major area of concern has been housing financing, which has often been fingered as one of the most formidable constraints in the housing sector. It is in recognition of the critical importance of finance in housing delivery that the researcher is examining housing financing in Nigeria; issues and solutions.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The problem of housing has become an every day discussion in all quarters of the public and private services of the developing countries of Africa especially in Nigeria which is being focused upon in this study. It has become increasingly glaring that most of the urban population in Nigeria live in dehumanizing housing environment while those that have access to average housing do so at abnormal cost. According to Onibokun (1986), Nubi (1991), rent in major cities of Nigeria is about 60% of an average workers disposable income.</p> <p>Ekweme (1979), Iyagba et al (1998) explained that the rate of demand for new houses was in part predicated on the rate of formation of new houses and in part on the rate of replacement of old housing stock. With this challenges of high cost of house financing in the building sector, the researcher will provide an overview of housing finance in relation to the issues and challenges therein in this study.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the issues related to housing finance in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To identify the solution to the issues of housing finance in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.  To ascertain the level of housing finance by the Nigerian government.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What are the issues related to housing finance in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.  What is the solution to the issues of housing finance in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  What is the level of Nigerian government involvement in housing finance?</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  This outcome of this study will enlighten the general public on the issues of housing finance as it is widely known that the capital involved in housing development is very huge, this study will educate on strategies that can be adopted in executing housing project with minimal financial problems.</p> <p>2.  The outcome of this study will also sensitize the policy makers on the need to make good housing policies and the government of the day on the need to implement the policies by investing massively in housing development especially in the urban area to meet the accommodation needs of the citizens.</p> <p>3.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on issues and solutions to housing finance in Nigeria will cover the level of housing development in Nigeria with clear identification of housing problems.

The contribution of the building and construction industry to national economic growth necessitates improved efficiency in the industry by means of cost effectiveness and timeliness, and would certainly contribute to cost savings for the country as a whole. It is also common knowledge that the implementation of the construction project in the industry is usually accompanied with poor quality delivery and delivery time delay and cost increase as well as owner dissatisfaction (Hafez, 2001). Thus, the efficient use and management of material have an importance influence on a company's profit and can delay project construction (Abdul­ Rahman and Alidrisyi, 1993). The researchers will examine the impact of material management on project delivery in Nigeria.</p> <p>Material management is a planned procedure that include, the purchasing, delivery, handling and minimization of waste with the aim of ensuring that requirement are met (Illingworth and Thain, 1998). According to Culvert (1998), a detailed material schedule and co-ordination of the requisition and order of material are important in assuring material availability. Efficient material planning is a key to high productivity on site. Material planning embraces quantifying, ordering and scheduling-. Productivity will suffer if the material planning process is not executed properly (Kaming, Olomolaiye, Holt and Harris, 1997).</p> <p>Kwik (1994) stated that another issue (which is sometime beyond management control) is material shortages, for example yearly cement shortages have long been a topic of debate within the construction industry. Bell and Stukhart (1987) investigated a total concept for a Material Management System (MMS), which combined and integrated the take-off, vendor evaluation, purchasing expediting, and warehousing and distribution functions of material. The system resulted in improved labour productivity, reduced material surplus, reduced material management, manpower and cost saving. A1-Jibouri (2002) described a computer simulation model, which helps to solve the problem of order and deliveries of materials in real life by keeping a predetermined list of order and delivery time of all the materials on site. The delivery of each kind of material then takes place automatically at the specified time.</p> <p>Ineffective materials management for projects can result in significant cost blow-outs and delays in project completion. Such cost inefficiencies will negatively impact global competitiveness, and owner operators and engineering, procurement, and construction companies are trying to streamline work processes for their projects. Inaccurate materials information, such as incorrect bills of materials, inaccurate cycle counts, shipping errors, receiving errors and so on, will also affect the overall project life cycle and increase project costs. Having to deal with subcontractors outside of the materials management process impacts the overall project supply chain as there is an increased risk of data inconsistencies. </p> <p>Material management is the system for planning and controlling to ensure that the right quality and quantity of materials and equipment are specified in a timely manner. Materials should be obtained at a reasonable cost, and be available for use when needed. The cost of materials represents a large proportion of the cost. A good management system for materials management will lead to benefits for construction. Cash flow has become crucial for the survival of any business, if materials are purchased early, capital may be tied up and interest charges incurred on the excess inventory of material. Material may deteriorate during storage or be stolen; also delays and extra expense may be incurred if materials required for particular activities are not available. </p> <p>Despite the importance of the materials, very little research has been directed towards understanding the management of materials from order to production; most research is focused upon the management of the design and procurement process and on labour site productivity. Materials management, which includes procurement, shop fabrication, logistics, supply chain management, production on site, and field servicing, requires special attention to achieve cost reduction. The supply chain is a convenient term used to describe a complex web of activities. The use of new equipment and innovative methods of materials handling has influenced changes in construction technologies in recent years. </p> <p>Modern methods of material management have been embraced by the manufacturers across a wide range of industry sectors outside of construction. </p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Ogunlana and Proukumtong (1996) studied construction delays in a fast growing economy: comparing Thailand with Nigeria and some of the construction delays were attributed to material management: the study blames material shortage on site on unreliable supply from material suppliers occasioned by the general shortage in the industry, although there were specific instances in which poor communication between sites and head office purchasing, planning and co-ordination could be cited. However, much research has not be done on material management and project delivery in Nigeria considering the economic situation of Nigeria and the market full of substandard products. This study will therefore examine the impact of material management of project delivery in Nigeria in terms of quality and time.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the impact of material management on project delivery time in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To examine the impact of material management on project quality upon delivery in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.  To determine the advantages and disadvantages of material management in project construction.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What is the impact of material management on project delivery time in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.  What is the impact of material management on project quality upon delivery in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of material management in project construction in Nigeria?</p> <p><b>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>HO: Material management does not affect project delivery in Nigeria</p> <p>HA: Material management does affect project delivery in Nigeria</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study will be of importance to building professionals and the general public because it would not only clarify but also create awareness of the extent to which inadequacies in material management can adversely affect project delivery.

Until now, the understanding of its composition and growth has been somewhat limited to its required use in Nigerian national accounts. Development is a general word that encompasses all aspects of human life, segments and disciplines, which give direction to the state of an economy. Globally, real estate sector is one of the most profitable ventures of every economy and one of the indices of measuring economic growth of a society. It is a sector that mirrors the economic viability and sustainability of an economy and its poverty level. Though there was no accurate data about housing shortage in Nigeria, it was however estimated that the shortage has risen to over 17 million (Ebie, 2005). Successive governments over the years have attempted to resolve these shortages with various policies but rather than reducing, the shortages kept increasing year in year out. According to Ajanlekoko, 2001, the Federal housing agencies located in each state of the federation, were statutorily created to execute public housing programmes for each state of the federation based on the formulated housing policies.</p> <p>Specifically they are to undertake the development of estates by acquiring, developing, holding, managing, selling, leasing or letting any property movable or unmovable in their respective states; provide a home ownership saving scheme in respect of any housing estate or building owned, constructed and managed by them with a view to enabling members of the public purchase or build their own houses; provide sites and services scheme for residential, commercial and industrial purposes for the people of their respective states; construct and maintain modern dwelling houses at reasonable costs for sales to members of the public, undertake the construction of offices, commercial and industrial buildings for letting out to members of the public among other things, engage in other investment activities and opportunities as may be determined by the respective state governments. If there has been effective implementation of housing policies, all these would have significantly benefitted the masses and above all contributed to the growth of the nation’s economy as a result of profit made from sales and rents. Unfortunately however, most of the state housing agencies are under-utilized and have been rendered redundant and could hardly carry out their primary responsibility as elaborated in the respective laws setting up these agencies (Zubairu, 2001). Basically, the problems of housing delivery in Nigeria are rooted in three major factors namely lack of finance, escalating cost of building materials and infrastructural development cost. These three problems are however peculiar to all housing delivery agencies and somewhat make affordable and mass housing difficult and has however reduced the contribution of the real estate sector to the nation’s economy.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Today in Nigeria, most of the housing corporations and the housing estates built by the previous governments merely exist by names (Mailafia, 2005). In some states, housing corporation staffs who are specialists in real estate development and management are rendered irrelevant in their special field while state ministries have taken over construction and in some states they have been merged with the ministries. This situation has relegated housing development to the background and hardly can we see any government owned housing unlike in the second republic. These has drastically affected the amount of income generated though the real estate sector. However, private partnership participation has enable more person to benefit from the business to improve their personal standard of living. However, the researcher is examining the impact of the real estate sector on the economy growth of Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the impact of the real estate sector on the growth of Nigeria’s economy.</p> <p>2.  To identify the factors limiting development of the real estate sector in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.  To determine how the real estate sector can contribute massively to the economic development of Nigeria.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What is the impact of the real estate sector on the growth of Nigeria’s economy?</p> <p>2.  What are the factors limiting development of the real estate sector in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  How can real estate sector contribute massively to the economic development of Nigeria?</p> <p><b>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>HO: Real estate sector has not contributed to the economic growth of Nigeria.</p> <p>HA: Real estate sector has contributed to the economic growth of Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  Findings from this study will be a useful guide for the policy makers and the government of the day on how real estate sector can contribute to the nations development and how the housing policies can be implemented effectively to boost economic growth.</p> <p>2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The scope of this study on the impact of the real estate sector on the growth of Nigeria’s economy will cover the structure and activities of real estate in Nigeria and its contribution to the nation’s economy.</p> <p><b>LIMITATION OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.  </b><b>Financial constraint</b>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>2.  </b><b>Time constraint</b>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

A megacity status is conferred by the United Nations on cities with a population of 10 million and above. Building and preserving a model mega city comes with great challenges. Providing a sufficient amount of infrastructure and other necessities that would accommodate the needs of over 18 million people could be daunting (Ayeni, 2008).</p> <p>By 2025, officials and population analysts agreed that the number of people in the city and in the surrounding communities, especially, in Ogun State axis, would leap to 30 million. Prominent among the challenges are housing, infrastructure and transportation, particularly in more than 10 local government areas (LGAs) that made up of the state, excluding local council development areas (LCDAs). Besides, the notorious traffic jams, choking pollution, inadequate supply of potable water, insecurity and absence or inadequate social and economic needs of the people pose more challenges. Apart from series of efforts put in place by government through several urban renewal programs, the uncontrolled influx of people from virtually every states of Nigeria, including neighboring countries, such as Benin Republic, Togo, Ghana and others, is heightening the fear that the next few years would provoke a daunting task for the authority (Tim, 2003).</p> <p>It has been observed that in some houses in Lagos metropolis, septics are channeled directly into the drain. The government is, therefore, challenged to invest heavily in the protection of the environment through urban renewal programs in order to avert environmental abuse and its consequences. People migrate from villages to the city-centre, without adequate understanding of reality on ground. Here, culture comes into play, such as open defecation as being done in the village, spreading of clothes publicly and cooking exercise in any open place, among others which is frustrating the efforts of the state government at transforming the city through urban renewal programs. Official admitted that planned urban renewal is a major challenge in an emerging model city like Lagos (Batley, 2003). Prior to the current urban regeneration efforts by the government, Lagos used to be referred to as a jungle of various emerging slums. However, a systematic urban development and slum renewal programme, in partnership with several development agencies, has since been put in place to reverse the trend being a major remedy to combat the menace characterized by urbanization. Consequently, various model city plans that included Ikeja Model Plan, Victoria Island/Ikoyi Model City Plan, Lekki Comprehensive Land Use and Infrastructure Master Plan have been completed while Mainland Central Model City Plan Badagry Draft Master Plan and Alimosho Master Plan have been concluded, while others are at various stages of execution. However, in order to give the urban renewal programme a legal backing, the Lagos State Model City Development Law was enacted in 2009 while the State Urban and Regional Planning Law were signed on July 7, 2010.</p> <p>According to Lindan (1993), certainly, a megacity requires a stronger financial base. The sheer size of funding required in sustaining a megacity is beyond what a government could provide on its own. To this end, Kadiri was of the view that both federal and Ogun state governments should support Lagos in her efforts to sustain the challenges involved as a result of its mega status through the urban renewal programmes. According to Ogunleye, for the fact that many of the old slum areas are not in hidden locations make it easier for government to incorporate them in its urban renewal programmes. The formation of new slums is prevented but people’s influx is however not controllable in Lagos State, knowing full well that no legislation that frown against migration to the city. But government will do well if it opens up new settlement with the necessary infrastructure put in place. Although, government has embarked on infrastructure renewal projects that include the execution of on-going projects such as the light rail scheme from Orile to Mile 2, the redevelopment of the Lagos-Badagry expressway into ten lanes incorporating BRT lanes and light rails, on-going reconstruction of the Mile 12-Ikorodu road incorporating BRT lanes, the recently commissioned Ejigbo- Ajao Estate link bridge, recovery and redevelopment of loops hitherto used by criminals as hide-outs among others could only become feasible with a sustained system of funding. Notwithstanding the profoundness of these projects, it appears that much still need to be done to meet the need of millions of commuters on daily basis.</p> <p>The condition of the environment also constitutes a major challenge to the Lagos megacity city. Lagos, for instance, generates 10,000 tonnes of waste daily, almost three times higher than what the whole of Ghana generates daily. Also, the kind of industrial pollution experienced in Lagos is second to none in the country. Maintenance of law and order is another major challenge of the Lagos mega city. Though a mega city status is conferred on a city as a result of population growth, building and sustaining a model mega city is not a tea party as reflected in the Lagos experience. In the case of Lagos, a major challenge, however, is how to cope with the ever-increasing population of Lagos with its attendant consequences on infrastructure</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study considers the solution to the challenges of Lagos mega-cities characterized by urbanization as an effective urban renewal programme. This approach is aimed at providing housing, environmental policies and planning strategies appropriate for facing the challenges of the urban growth and development. A megacity is usually defined according to the United Nation as a metropolitan area with a total population in excess of 10 million people. Some definitions also set a minimum level for population density (at least 2,000 persons/square km). A megacity can be a single metropolitan area or more metropolitan, depending on the definitions and boundaries being used. However, the researcher will provide an overview about urban renewal programme as a remedy to Lagos Mega city challenges.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the challenges of the Lagos mega city.</p> <p>2.  To identify the urban renewal programmes put in place by government of Lagos State in addressing Mega city challenges.</p> <p>3.  To determine the effectiveness of urban renewal programmes in Lagos State.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What are the challenges of the Lagos mega city?</p> <p>2.  What are the urban renewal programmes put in place by government of Lagos State in addressing Mega city challenges?</p> <p>3.  What is the effectiveness of urban renewal programmes in Lagos State?</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  The outcome of this study will educate the general public on how an effective urban renewal programmes can curb mega city challenges.

It may consist of government initiated or government backed approach to property redistribution of land as in the case of Nigeria, an outright transfer of ownership of land from the citizens to the state. The common characteristic of land reforms is usually the modification or the replacement of existing institutional arrangements governing possession, use and title. Thus, while land reform may be radical in nature such as large scale confiscation and transfers of land from one group to another or from one group to the state, it can also be less drastic and conciliatory in nature such as less painful transfers of land to the state and regulatory reforms aimed at improving land administration (Dale, 2007).</p> <p>Land is perhaps the single most important natural resource in the sense that it affects every aspect of a people’s live; their food, clothing, and shelter. It is the base for producing raw material for the manufacturing industry. It is an important resource. No nation-city or rural area can survive as an entity without it. Thus, every person in a nation – the banker, the industrialist, the labourer, the educator, the student, the planner, the farmer- has a vital stake in the country’s land problems and its proper utilization (Acquaye, 1976).</p> <p>        The Land Reform committee in Nigeria is aimed towards enabling the states to be effective managers of land. It is aimed to provide a systematic cadastral survey of land in the entire federation (a political entity called Nigeria). The Term of Reference makes it an essential body to assist both states and local government to carry out the cadastre survey and codify the possessory rights of vast majority of the people access to land and landowners. The Term of Reference necessitate the body to collaborate and provide technical assistance to state and local government in undertaking cadastral survey and to ensure the demarcation of land boundaries and title holdings are demarcated in such a way that communities, hamlets, villages, towns etc are recognized. It was also saddled with the responsibility of encouraging and assisting states and local government to establish adjudication mechanism for land ownership conflict resolution and to make recommendation for mechanism for valuation in both rural and urban areas.</p> <p>Security of tenure and land rights of citizens is an important foundation for economic development. For many of these, land titles are the main sources of collateralization for obtaining credit from informal and established financial institutions. Consequently, securing land rights and land titles is particularly relevant for all socio‐economic classes in the nation’s economy but especially to the farmers whose pervasive poverty to date derives from not having definitive property rights appropriate to a market economy. Furthermore, fees and taxes on such landed properties are very important sources of revenue for governments particularly at the State and Local Government levels. A national programme that thus sets out to enhance and secure the property rights of all groups in the society can only end up creating a economic empowerment.</p> <p>Funding Land Reform programme should therefore be a national effort to be borne by all three tiers of government in proportion to their capabilities (Mabogunje, 2007).</p> <p>For a country striving to be one of the twenty largest economies in the world by the year 2020, the situation with respect to land rights and transactions in land still leaves very much to be desired. The World Band publication on “Doing Business in Nigeria 2010” rated Nigeria 178th out of 183 economies in respect of difficulties of registering properties in the country.</p> <p>Mabogunje (2007) attributed this to the following reason “a large share of land in the country is not formally registered [whilst] informal titles cannot be used as security in obtaining loans which limits financing opportunities for businesses” especially small and medium‐size enterprises. If Nigeria is to meet the challenges of competing effectively in an increasingly globalizing world, it is thus imperative that it gives very urgent and sustained attention to promoting its land reform program in all of its ramifications to facilitate property development.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>        Land Titling and Registration is essential for economic development of a Nation. The Nigerian nation had had a multiplicity of land tenure system until the 1978 Land Use Act which harmonized all the systems.</p> <p>        The land use pattern in Nigeria estimated arable land to be about 33% of the total land area, permanent pastures cover 44%, permanent crops cover 3%, forest and woodlands 12%, and others 8%. Thus land is still the main asset of the rural Nigerians where over 80% are peasant farmers; however this asset has not been fully utilized for economic empowerment because they do not have proper records and titles that can be used as collateral to raise capital. It is in an attempt to economically empower the vast majority of Nigerians, who are rural dwellers, by turning their land holdings to economic capital, that the current Federal Government of Nigeria initiated the Land Reform Agenda. However, the researcher is providing an overview of land reforms in Nigeria considering the issues and prospects.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To provide an overview on the issues of land reforms in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To examine the problems of land reforms in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.  To analyze the solution to the problems of land reform in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What are the issues of land reforms in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.  What are the problems of land reforms in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  What are the solutions to the problems of land reform in Nigeria?</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  Outcome of this study will educate the general public and students on the issues, problems and solutions of land reforms in Nigeria with a view of identifying the inadequacies.</p> <p>2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied, it will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on land reforms in Nigeria will cover all the issues and problems of land reform in Nigeria.

A professional connotes a person with a distinct competence for a specified function or discipline (Ojewunmi, 2005). Such a person would have been trained or has acquired the necessary training in that discipline to become a professional in that field. A professional exists within the context of a profession; a distinct discipline or career path with its own training, qualification and membership requirements and standards. It is in the bid to establish such standards that professional bodies exist to ensure that persons within its fold have the requisite training/qualification and also abide by its rules and ethical standards (Kuye, 1998). A professional in any field is a highly regarded person and is deemed to have a certain level of competence expected of a person in that profession.</p> <p>Real estate agency is essentially a land based profession that deals with the business of buying, selling or leasing of interests in real estate, which may be land or buildings or interests therein. Practitioners of this trade are generally addressed as Estate Agents in our environment. Considering the importance of housing in mans hierarchy of needs and the huge deficit that exists in the housing sector in Nigeria, Real estate Agents generally play a very important role in the socio-economic life of the country. Generally a real estate agent is a person, who possesses the authority to act on behalf of another person with a view to establishing contractual relationship between his principal and a third party. The person, who employs the agent, is usually called the Principal. Several variants of real estate Agent/Agency exist (Olatunji, 2008).</p> <p>The practice of Real estate Agency in Nigeria at present remains largely unorganized, unregulated and unprofessional. Apart from the Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers that has set standards for its practice by its members i.e. Estate Surveyors and Valuers, the large majority of those who practice estate agency do so without the basic training in that field, without any certification or qualification, without any regulation and largely in an unprofessional manner (Gambo &amp; Ashen, 2012).</p> <p>The practice is generally open to all comers and entry and exit are at the sole discretion of the person. Due to the lack of a central professional/regulatory body that will set minimum standards for entry, set standards for its practice, as well as ensure adherence to a code of ethics, most estate agents are generally on their own and quackery with its attendant consequences is very prevalent if not the order of the day (Gambo &amp; Ashen, 2012). A multiplicity of local estate agents Associations exists but these are essentially local bodies without the right structure, leadership or plan to advance the practice of real estate agency beyond the parochial interest of the founders or originators (Hemuka, 2002).</p> <p>The effects of this present state of real estate agency practice in Nigeria are indeed too numerous to count. The major effects are that due to lack of regulation and requisite competence on the part of the practitioners, the consuming public has been on the receiving end of estate agents in terms of very poor services, fraudulent transactions and losses of income through the activities of dubious practitioners (Hunter, 1997). As a result of this, the public perception of the real estate agent is very poor. Real estate Agents are generally looked upon as persons, who engage in sharp practices and whom you have to deal with, with “all eyes” open. In view of this, the practitioners are not respected in the society. The very low level of respect for the practitioners has led to a situation where both vendors and landlords alike do not see the need to remunerate them appropriately, while the lack of standardization and regulation has led to both the landlords and the vendors turning themselves into agents. In most cases, multiple agents are appointed and owing to lack of standardized practice procedures it usually turns into a cut throat competition amongst them. The level of abortive work done by the average real estate agent is phenomenally high due to the non standardized practice procedure. The police, EFCC and other law enforcement agencies are after the real estate agents in the belief that a lot of money laundering is done through the acquisition of properties with illicitly acquired wealth (Olatunji, 2008). </p> <p>To achieve professionalism in the practice of real estate agency in Nigeria, the right approach will be to work towards ensuring that Real estate agents are appropriately trained and certified to practice, establish standardized prequalification and registration protocols for the prospective estate agents, keep a register of all qualified and certified estate agents, enforce compliance to a code of ethics and practice through sanctions, institute and implement mandatory training programmes for practitioners, Institute appropriate professional indemnity insurance programmes for members, to ensure the protection of members of the public, set remuneration due to agents whether as single agents or cooperating agents, generally regulate the practice of estate agency, develop and project the practice of estate agency as a respectable brand that will continuously earn the trust of members of the public through quality service delivery of its members. It will also protect and defend the interest of practitioners.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Real estate agency practice in Nigeria like other countries of the world contributes massively to housing delivery system as it helps to meet as well as cater for the housing/accommodation needs of people. Due to the important roles real estate agents play in the housing and accommodation delivery sector of the economy, so many people have become victims of accommodation fraud from the hands of some of these estate agents who go about duping genuine accommodation seekers which has been the reason for calls from many quarters on the need to professionalize the profession in Nigeria. Professionalizing real estate agency in Nigeria will benefit not just the consuming public but also the practitioners. While the public will benefit through improved or quality agency services from reliable and well referenced real estate agents, the practitioners will benefit through proper regulation of the practice, which will ensure that only qualified and certified persons practice the trade and that the practitioners are appropriately trained, equipped and remunerated.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the issues involved in the professionalizing of real estate agency practice in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To determine the way forward for the professionalizing of real estate agency practice in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.  To analyze the factors hindering the professionalization of real estate agency practice in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What are the issues involved in the professionalizing of real estate agency practice in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.  What is the way forward for the professionalizing of real estate agency practice in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  What are the factors hindering the professionalization of real estate agency practice in Nigeria?</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  The outcome of this study will be of benefit to the government and its agencies in that the practitioners of the trade will be brought under one umbrella, which will make easier the regulatory work of such government agencies like the EFCC in its fight against money laundering.</p> <p>2.  The result will educate the general public on the need to patronize the professional real estate agents and what criteria makes someone a real estate agent e.g. qualifications and the professional body the real estate agent belongs to.</p> <p>3.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on professionalizing real estate agency in Nigeria; issues and way forward will cover the activities of real estate agency practitioners in Nigeria considering professional ethics and code of conduct.</p> <p><b>LIMITATION OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>Financial constraint</b>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p> <b>Time constraint</b>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

It is not a coincidence that food, shelter and clothing believed to be the three essentials that sustain mankind, also have some linkage to land. Food grows out of land while shelter is affixed to it, and man’s clothing is made largely from what grows out of land. Indeed, whether in ancient times or today’s modern system, land constitutes a significant index for man’s wealth, and as economic activities have assumed more sophistication over time, land has continued to play a central role in their development (Lewis , 1994). There is hardly any business venture that does not require to be supported by some form of real estate: from the small business that requires real estate as offices from where its business can be organized, to the major venture that needs it for its factory. </p> <p>Consequently, through some very robust and well thought out land policies comprehensively address challenges that are encounter in the real estate sector. This is not exactly the situation here in Nigeria and the result is that there is a myriad of problems in the real estate sector (Adewale, 2000). In the course of this study, the researcher will provide an overview of real estate investments in Nigeria and its associated challenges.</p> <p>Real estate investment is intrinsically connected to the economic development and well being of any nation, thereby necessitating some intervention by prudent governments. Such interventions vary in degrees, depending on the nation. In Nigeria, individual could rarely lay claim to any part of it as owner and therefore could not alienate it without the consent of the head. </p> <p>Proper financing is all-important to successful property/real estate investment and development. Various forms of finance on varying terms from diverse investing agencies are available to the property/real estate market. The principal field where various forms of investment finance are employed is that of development where every loan has to be specially tailored for an individual scheme and the particular stages within the scheme. Since real estate and property development in particular involves huge capital expenditure, finance is therefore an essential input, the nature of which is to provide capital to enable the enterprise operate commercially (Ratcliff, 1999). The cost and availability of finance for real estate development can influence the viability of such project. It is necessary to examine the nature of real estate investment in Nigeria with a view of finding solutions to the associated challenges.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>In recent times, research on real estate investment has been on the front burner has it is the major source of housing for man. In the hierarchy of man’s needs, housing has been ranked second and as a result of this; housing provision has become a paramount cornerstone of the policies of various governments both at federal and state levels since independence in Nigeria. The consequences of the rapid rate of urbanization are most visible in the rapid deterioration of urban housing resulting in urban housing poverty especially as there is no proportionate increase in the number of housing stocks.</p> <p>.</p> <p>During the period of economic boom in the 1970s in Nigeria, there was surplus capital, the economic climate then was favorable for the development of real estate and the prospect of gain was over blown and so were the rate of development. Due to the recent drop in the prices of crude oil world wide and corruption, government has not been able to invest in real estate. Overpopulation and urbanization has led to massive increase in property development.</p> <p>Financial houses readily obliged developers’ loans, as they perceived minimum risks.</p> <p>Since real estate development requires huge capital outlay, there is always the need for real estate developer to source for fund. However, this study will examine the scope of real estate in Nigeria and its associated challenges with a view of making useful suggestions on the way forward for real estate in Nigeria.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To provide an overview of real estate investment in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To examine the challenges associated with real estate investment in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.  To identify the way forward for real estate in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What is the level of real estate investment in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.  What are the challenges associated with real estate investment in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  What is the way forward for real estate in Nigeria?</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>HO: Real estate investment has no challenges in Nigeria.</p> <p>HA: Real estate investment has several challenges in Nigeria.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  The findings from this study will educate the general public on the benefit of real estate investment and its associated challenges which will form the basis for guidance in decision making.</p> <p>2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on real estate investment and its associated challenges in Nigeria will cover the extent of real estate investment in Nigeria looking at the factors that has facilitated or hindered it.

Improvement of realty property as part of a real estate investment strategy is generally considered to be a sub-specialty of real estate investing called real estate development. Real estate is an asset form with limited liquidity relative to other investments, it is also capital intensive (although capital may be gained through mortgage leverage) and is highly cash flow dependent (Syz, 2008). If these factors are not well understood and managed by the investor, real estate becomes a risky investment. The primary cause of investment failure for real estate is that the investor goes into negative cash flow for a period of time that is not sustainable, often forcing them to resell the property at a loss or go into insolvency. A similar practice known as flipping is another reason for failure as the nature of the investment is often associated with short term profit with less effort (Clayton, 2007).</p> <p>Management and evaluation of risk is a major part of any successful real estate investment strategy. Risks occur in many different ways at every stage of the investment process. For instance mitigation strategy for fraudulent sale is to verify ownership and purchase title insurance. Real estate owners often assume risk on their property exposure in response to unavailability of coverage. While risk retention by ‑ financially sound companies may help to reduce their cost of risk, absence of insurance is not always desirable. In many cases, property owners are required under the terms of their loan covenants to maintain full insurance to value, with restrictions placed upon the amount of deductibles they may carry (Fisher, 2005). Additionally, under high-deductible or self-insurance programs, operating companies no longer have a budgeted premium, and payment of unexpected retained losses creates potential cash  flow problems. Finally, property owners or management of companies have no ability to charge the full cost of retaining property risk to their clients. Although real estate markets represent a large proportion of total wealth in both developing and developed countries, the real-estate derivatives markets are still lagging behind in volume of trading and liquidity with has greatly influenced project viability (Black, 1986). Over the last few years there has been increased activity in developing derivative instruments that can be utilized by asset managers to reduce real estate risk. The possibility of financial loss occurring as the result of owing a real estate investment and its implication on project viability will be focused on in this study. Real estate risk might arise from such things as liability, legal issues, partner problems that can force a sale, fire or theft, loss of rental income and purchasing property with an imperfect title.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b><p>Real estate management is a particularly difficult challenge because of its tendency towards liquidity. Typically, even published indices in real estate are based on annual appraisals of large properties, not actual transactions. The recent unprecedented recession has resulted in major long term distress across the real estate industry, and has had severe implications for owners, developers, managers and investors alike. Environmental and construction exposures, catastrophic modeling, stricter lender requirements, and complex requirements involving distressed banks are just some of the risks facing the real estate industry.

There is bound to be an increasing dependency on the private rental market for a long time to come in view of the high cost of various building materials, high interest rates on mortgage loans and the challenges facing applicants for the certificates of occupancy all these challenges coupled with poverty and unemployment in Nigeria has made it difficult for some tenants to pay their rent leading to accumulation of rent arrears. Due to poor enactment of policy and implementation, some tenants are stubborn and difficult refusing to pay their rent intentionally with dubious motive to cheat the landlords (Topham, 2012). The absence of many large corporate or institutional investors in the rental property market has widened the gap. </p> <p>According to Burke (2000), the relative poor quality of tenancy management coupled with the polarization of estate agency practice have led to conflicts and disputes between or among landlords, estate agents and tenants as a result of refusal of some tenants to pay their rent areas. Bad tenants can be a real problem for not paying rent on time or leaving properties in a mess. In advanced countries, lodged information about bad tenants in tenancy databases assists estate agents and landlords make more informed decisions before taking in new tenant because some tenant will never abide by both oral and even written agreement leading to problems between the landlord and the tenants. </p> <p>Accordingly, a landlord who seeks to recover his rent areas from a tenant must strictly comply with the provisions of the statutes guiding landlord and tenancy agreements in Nigeria. In other words, the slightest deviation from the requirements of the law will frustrate an attempt to recover possession of rent areas and the premises no matter how troublesome and terrible such a tenant may be. Every State in Nigeria now has its own law on recovery of rents, areas and premises. The law in Nigeria is Recovery of Premises Act. Cap 544 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria (Abuja) 1990. Section 2, Recovery of Premises Act Cap 544 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria (Abuja) 1990 states that a landlord is a person entitled to immediate reversion of the premises and includes the attorney or agent of any such landlord or any person receiving (whether in his own right or as an attorney or agent) any rent from any person for the occupation of any accommodation in respect of which he claims a right to receive same. This section further states that a tenant includes any person occupying premises, whether on payment of rent or otherwise, but does not include a person occupying premises under a bona fide claim to be the owner of the premises. It is however imperative that landlord must operate within the confines of the law in the recovery of areas and treatment of difficult tenants in both residential and commercial properties which is what this study is focused on.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Every day with the increase in population, there is a concurrent need for houses to accommodate this rising population. As a result, there has always been the need for individuals, corporations and governments to build and lease or rent houses to fill this void. These houses could either be for residential or commercial purposes. This has brought the need to regulate the relationship between landlords and tenants so as to avoid arbitrary increments in rents, non-payment of rent areas, wrongful eviction and illegal holding over of premises. The procedure for recovery of rent areas and premises is largely regulated by statutes. On any day following the day the rent was due, when the tenant failed to pay, the landlord can serve a termination notice to be effective ten days after the date the notice was served. The tenant may within five days after receipt of the notice pay all rents due and the notice of termination is then void (University of British Columbia, 2004). If the tenant refuses to pay or move out, eviction procedure may commence. Rent arrears are the commonest of all the reasons for tenant eviction and disagreement between tenants and landlords. (ACN, 2011; Nigeria Property Centre, 2012; Topham, 2012), the researcher will however examine the process of rent areas recovery and treatment of difficult tenants in residential and commercial properties in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study</p> <p>1.  To examine the process of recovery of rent arrears from difficult tenant in residential and commercial properties in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To analyze the treatment of difficult tenants in residential and commercial properties in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.  To identify the factors that causes disagreement between landlord and tenants in residential and commercial properties in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What are the processes of recovery of rent arrears from difficult tenant in residential and commercial properties in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.  How can difficult tenants be treatment in residential and commercial properties in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  What are the factors that causes disagreement between landlord and tenants in residential and commercial properties in Nigeria?</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  Outcome of this study will educate the landlord on the process of recovery of rent arrears from the tenants and how difficult tenants can be treated in residential and commercial properties in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  It will also enlighten the tenants on the need to maintain  adequate cooperation with the landlord with respect to prompt payment of rent.</p> <p>3.  The result will be useful for the government and policy makers on the need to formulate an effective policy that will solve any problem that may arise between the landlord and tenant of residential and commercial properties in Nigeria.</p> <p>4.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on the recovery of rent arrears and treatment of difficult tenants in residential and commercial properties in Nigeria will cover issues related to non-payment of rents arrears by tenants in Nigeria and how it can be addressed.</p> <p><b>LIMITATION OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>Financial constraint</b>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p> <b>Time constraint</b>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

The regulations are used to protect public interest in the use of private land. The regulations stem from the need to provide public amenities, to increase the efficiency of land-use, to limit urban sprawl and unnecessary encroachment on agricultural land, and to achieve economies of scale and least-cost production of public services (Courtney, 1983).  The regulations are also used to ensure the availability of land to all groups, and to ensure that the benefits of development go to the community as a whole.</p> <p>        Today, if you buy land in Nigeria and you do not have the Certificate of Occupancy (C of O) from the government, it is not yours, all you have is a lease, that is, you never have a freehold. You cannot even have access to any loan or do anything tangible if you do not have fund of your own, not even the National Housing Fund which was set up by the government to render such assistance. Yet the Certificate of Occupancy is even more difficult than getting the land itself. All efforts by some State Governments especially the Lagos State government to ease the procedure and collection have been described as mere gimmicks. We have heard series of cases where Governors wield their powers to revoke legally acquired rights of occupancy in the interest of the public, whereas it was obvious that they were done on political reasons especially against oppositions. The former President of the federation who was the author of the Act when it was promulgated during his first military administration had to reassure Nigerians on 26th of September 2001 in Abuja that “no government owns land” and that “land belongs to the people”. This statement was made when he was condemning the excesses of the Governors. As stated above, since it is a known philosophy that laws are made by men for men and are operated, implemented and enforced by human beings through various legal institutions, our concern is how the Act has affected sustainable housing development schemes in Nigeria.</p> <p>Several controversies that were created by the Act have been well documented in different reactions and</p> <p>write-ups (Mabogunje (2007; 2011) and Aluko (2007; 2009; 2010) dealt excessively on the gory state of affairs about the housing situations in Nigeria in general and how it could be sustained. In this research study, we try to examine the effects that the Land Use Act has had on sustainable housing provision in Nigeria. Since one of the major areas of the Act is to control future uses and open new land for the needs of Nigeria’s growing population especially in urban areas, yet there is still the outcry of the people to affordable housing provision. In Lagos State for example, the municipalities (local governments) have no say in the issue of Certificate of Occupancy as all lands in the State has been declared urban and are all under the control of the governor. Whereas in the commencement of the Land Use Act 1978 No. 6 on 29th March, 1978, it was stated that “whereas it is in the public interest that the rights of all Nigerians to the land of Nigeria be asserted and preserved by law”. And that all lands comprised in the territory of each State in the Federation are hereby vested in the Governor of the Stat. The Act also provides that “all land in urban areas shall be under the control and management of the Governor of each State”. </p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The concern of the researcher in this study is not really another criticism of the Act but an in-depth evaluation of how it has achieved its aim in the mass provision of housing to the people. However the hope of the Nigerian masses lies in the Act with the current wave of high cost of acquisition of land. It should be noted that one of the cogent reasons why the Act came into existence was because of the nature of trusteeship of land in the past. It was difficult for anyone to get access to land. It is important for the researcher to examine if the Act has made it easy for Nigerians to get land for housing development. Ownership of a house starts from the acquisition of a piece of land. That is to say the intending house owner must first of all have access to land. In urban areas access to land is not quite easy and that is why one of the objectives of the Land Use Act is to ensure that land is made available promptly to all those who need it in the interest of the economy. Having regards to the fact that housing is one of the best indicators of a person’s standard of living and of his place in the society, it also serves as a place in which man seeks shelter, comfort, security and dignity among other things, it is important to examine the effect of Land use Act of sustainable housing development in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the effect of land use acts on sustainable housing development in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To investigate the influence of land use act on ease of land access by Nigerians.</p> <p>3.  To identify the factors limiting sustainable housing development in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What is the effect of land use acts on sustainable housing development in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.  What is the influence of land use act on ease of land access by Nigerians?</p> <p>3.  What are the factors limiting sustainable housing development in Nigeria?</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>HO: Land use act has no significant effect on sustainable housing development in Nigeria</p> <p>HA: Land use act has significant effect on sustainable housing development in Nigeria</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  Findings from this study will educate the general public, government, students on the state of housing development in Nigeria and also enlighten them on land use act and its impact on sustainable housing development in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied, it will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on the effect of land use act on sustainable housing development in Nigeria will cover all the existing housing development and schemes by government and how the land use act has affected the ownership of land for housing development.</p> <p><b>LIMITATION OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>Financial constraint</b>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p> <b>Time constraint</b>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

Corruption made itself visible when the institution of the government was founded due the behaviour of people appoint or elect to manage the government institutions (Anyanwu, 2002; Idomeh, 2006). Corruption has recently become a major issue in foreign aid and Nigeria nation as a whole. Corruption is an ancient practice that has been traced back to pre-biblical time and made itself known in the ancient civilizations of developed and developing countries. Political and social corruption is not a recent phenomenon that pervades the Nigerian state. Corruption is a social problem that has interested many scholars. Ruzindana (1999) sees corruption in Africa as a problem of routine deviation from affordable standards and norms by public officials and parties with whom they interact. The major concern for inter-nation aid policy during the last five decades has been to improve the living condition for the poor in the poorest countries of the world by way of providing affordable housing development schemes. </p> <p>Nigeria has been described by many as a country not lacking in policy formulation, but on implementation. Once a need is said to be detected, the governments swoop into action by constituting a committee to look into the situation. The committee begins to sit, formulates and presents a policy to the government who in turn gives assent to it. This tradition is not peculiar to the mortgage and housing policies alone, but it has contributed in no small measure, to the failure of the housing programmes in the country. Despite the formulation of brilliant policies capable of transforming the housing programmes in the country, yet no significant improvement in the availability of affordable houses in Nigeria.</p> <p>There was the 1991 National Housing Policy which reeled out so many rules and programmes, that will change the lives of the average Nigeria for the better in terms of home ownership. The policy in and of its own, was supposed to ensure that the average Nigerian has access to decent housing and accommodation at affordable cost by the year 2000, through the provision of long term loans at an interest rate of not more than four per cent per annum. There was also the 2006 National Housing Policy which went the extra mile of partially disengaging the government from involvement in housing programme and including private investors and real estate developers into the national housing programmes, by the end of the day, it all appeared like moving round a vicious circle, as those policy were only good as documents and not in implementation (Anyanwu, 2012).</p> <p>Mortgage banking in Nigeria is said to have started in 1956 with the establishment of the Nigeria Building Society. According Oduwaye (2014), the society collapsed in the early 70s due to its inability to perform its statutory functions. This led to government injecting N20m and changing its name to Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN). The FMBN took off in 1977, with a takeoff capital of N20 million from the federal government. The FMBN was unable to meet up with the pressure of demand. According to statistics, in 1970, outstanding application were N223.8 million and available funds equaled N127.0 million, meaning that demand and supply was in the ratio of 2:1. This degenerated to ratio 4:1 in 1986 when the outstanding application increased to N465.8 million and only N105.3 million was available. The bank has never been able to meet up with demand. The failure of the FMBN over the years and acute shortage of housing led to the promulgation of the National Housing Policy of 1991. As can be deduced from the above, since government was never able to address each of the problems at their various stages, they kept degenerating from bad to worse, until the present day situation of 17 million housing deficit, which now appears insurmountable. However, the researcher is examining the impact of corruption on mortgage and housing development in Nigeria.</p> <p>According to experts, successive governments have never been serious about implementing those policies and have never made adequate budget for mortgage financing with a human face. According to Audu (2014), mortgage policies implementation are very poor because the issue of housing is highly capital intensive, government, both state and federal, do not make adequate budget for housing.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The need to study corruption especially on mortgage development in Nigeria has continued to generate passionate commentaries and academic interest due to the level of corruption in the country and its effect on the growth of every sector. In Nigeria corruption is one of the reasons for many unresolved problems that have critically hobbled and reduce housing development (Ayobolu, 2006). International centre for economic growth (1999) states that corruption is a canker worm that has eaten deep in the fabric of the nation which ranges from petty corruption to political or systematic corruption. Corruption has affected mortgage development through poor implementation of policies, diversion of funds etc. the researcher is examining the effect of corruption on mortgage development in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the impact of corruption on mortgage development in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To determine the level of real estate and mortgage development in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.  To identify ways to combat corruption to enhance mortgage development in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What is the impact of corruption on mortgage development in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.  What is the level of real estate and mortgage development in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  What are the ways to combat corruption to enhance mortgage development in Nigeria?</p> <p><b>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>HO: Corruption does not have any impact on mortgage development in Nigeria.</p> <p>HA: Corruption does have impact on mortgage development in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  The outcome of this study will educate the government and policy maker, law enforcement agents on how to combat corruption as a way of promoting mortgage development in Nigeria through proper policy formulation and implementation.</p> <p>2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on the impact of corruption on mortgage development in Nigeria will cover all the mortgage policies formulated to enhance housing development in Nigeria compared to the level of housing development in Nigeria.

One of the most important aspects of peoples’ lives is their physical living conditions and in Nigeria just like in many other countries. Traditionally Nigeria has adopted new technology rapidly, with the relatively large population of over 170 million and the high demand for housing. Internet use has followed this pattern with World Wide Web access now available to the vast majority of Nigerian homes.</p> <p>The Internet is still seen as a fairly new tool by many people. With respect to the current graphic-intensive state of the media (multi-media presentations) and encrypted e-commerce (secure on-line purchasing) used on the internet, this technology is very new (Birvin, 1999). However, the backbone of the Internet has roots going all the way back to the Soviet Union’s launching of Sputnik in 1957. In response (to Sputnik), US forms the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), the following year, within the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish America's lead in science and technology applicable to the military. Real estate listings were part of the fabric of the Internet. Originally, entire Usenet message boards were reserved for listing homes, with eager homeowners looking to cut out the real estate commission which has been in operation in advanced countries (Rosen, 1996). When the Internet started to boom, real estate practitioners got in on the game as well, adding their listings on their own sites. Real estate services also started developing Internet platforms. In 1996, LendingTree.com introduced their marketplace concept. This was the first service offered for real estate that existed only in cyberspace. Many other banks offering on-line loans already existed, but this showed the unique power of the Internet. Today, sites offer a myriad of real estate services in an online environment all over the world. While some of them have traditional brick and mortar operations, many of these new companies exist only over TCPIP (Transmission Control Protocol over Internet Protocol) (Rosen, 1996).</p> <p>The role of internet marketing in real estate has grown profoundly over the past few years. In an industry that once used print media as its primary form of delivering the marketing message, there is now an urgent need to have transitioned to the internet in order to reach today's homebuyer. An online presence is a vital component of a real estate professional's marketing strategy. Because today's consumers want accurate information quickly and conveniently, real estate professionals must harness the features and capabilities of online marketing to meet these ever-increasing needs. In this study, the researcher will provide information on the influence of online marketing on real estate business.</p> <p>Real estate is an information-intensive business. Agents connect buyers to sellers through control and dissemination of information. Agents are valued for the information skills they bring to making both listings and sales. Since houses are expensive, not easily describable and infrequently bought or sold, most individuals still feel the need for assistance with this transaction from a professional. As well, these are all factors that tend to increase transactions costs (Williamson, 1981). However, the use of online marketing in real estate business can be used to disintermediate the traditional agent and broker is of focal interest here, as it potentially threatens the traditional relationship between agent and home owner. Disintermediation is the elimination or displacement of market intermediaries, enabling direct trade with buyers and consumers without agents (Wigand, 1997).</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Real estate is a promising setting for studying online marketing because it is an information-intensive and information-driven industry; transaction-based, with high value and asset-specificity; market-intermediary (agents and brokers connect buyers and sellers rather than buying or selling themselves); and experiencing on-going information technology (IT) related changes through online marketing. In an attempt to increase popularity, productivity and profitability, real estate agents and brokerage firms are using the Internet to deliver market information to consumers about the residential real estate market. This study examines to what extent has online marketing influenced real estate business.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the influence of online marketing on real estate business.</p> <p>2.  To determine the effectiveness of online marketing in real estate business.</p> <p>3.  To identify the problems associated with online marketing in real estate business.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What is the influence of online marketing on real estate business?</p> <p>2.  What is the effectiveness of online marketing in real estate business?</p> <p>3.  What are the problems associated with online marketing in real estate business?</p> <p><b>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>HO: Online marketing does not influence real estate business</p> <p>HA: Online marketing does influence real estate business</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  The result from this study will educate the general public on the rudiments of online marketing and especially how it can influence the real estate business.</p> <p>2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on the influence of online marketing on real estate business will cover the level of online marketing in Nigeria especially in the real estate development sector.

Adequate housing provision has since the early 1970s consequently engaged the attention of most countries, especially the developing nations for a number of reasons. First, it is one of the three most important basic needs of mankind- the others being food and clothing. Secondly, housing is a very important durable consumer item, which impacts positively on productivity, as decent housing significantly increases worker’s health and wellbeing, and consequently growth. Thirdly, it is one of the indices for measuring the standard of living of people across societies (Sanusi, 2003).</p> <p>Propelled by the patriotic quest of addressing Nigeria’s acute housing problem, the Federal Government came up with a National Policy on Housing and Urban Development in 2002. The policy has since then triggered milestone reforms in the nation’s housing industry aimed at repositioning it for efficient and effective housing delivery and maintenance. One of the means through which the policy is been achieved is on public-private partnership concept. The thrust of the policy is to raise the home ownership rate among Nigerians to a respectable level by moving the housing industry to sustainably deliver mass, decent and affordable housing with the active participation of the private sector-driven mortgage based housing delivery and maintenance system (Oduwaye, 2004). The policy believes that this will particularly address the housing problem of most Nigerian citizens.</p> <p>The concept of private partnership in housing financing, delivery and maintenance system is predicated on the pooling together of resources from the various stakeholders, each party making inputs, thereby minimizing wastage and maximizing results achieved. Ikekpeazu (2004) stressed that the expediency of the increased adoption of the public-private partnership for housing financing and delivery in the present socio-economic circumstances of shortage of housing in Nigeria is now even more glaring than ever. With the increasing demand of the population on the national economy and the government’s propensity for enlarging the multi-sectorial allocations in terms of finance, it is becoming obvious that government alone can no longer provide adequate housing for all categories of her citizens particularly the low income earners. </p> <p>The organized private sector comprise of members of the real estate developers association of Nigeria and some commercial banks that have real estate departments. Average citizens including the low-income earners do not easily have access to housing finance because of their low wages. Nigeria is a country with high unequal income distribution, a situation that restricts the reach of the vast majority in the acquisitionof quality housing. This study examines the role of public-private partnership in housing finance, delivery and maintenance in Nigeria.</p> <p>The public-private partnership for housing delivery under Nigeria’s current housing policy (Abdulsalam, 2008) confers certain identifiable roles on both the public and the private sector. The roles of the private sector in housing financing, delivery and maintenance with particular reference to private partnership includes responsible for production of physical houses, responsible for primary mortgage lending, required to invest mortgage securities and responsible for the production and supply of building materials, particularly local content.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Housing finance constitutes one of the major pillars of housing delivery and maintenance system. Indeed, without a well-organized and efficient housing finance mechanism, the goal of a housing development and maintenance policy will be largely unattainable. Housing finance has been recognised as an important, almost indispensable factor in the housing delivery and maintenance system. This is because only the very few in any nation can afford to pay cash for a house or pay cash for a major renovation of the house. Most other people must have to finance their house building and maintenance through loans, personal savings, assistance from relatives or friends and gifts. Introduction of public-private partnership in housing delivery and maintenance is to enhance the productivity of the housing sector, increase housing affordability and improve access to basic infrastructure and social services. Ikekpeazu (2004) stressed that in order to attain the desired outcome for private partnership, the perception of the housing sector as a vast arena of social problems and a drain on the economy must change. Housing must be seen as an important economic sector with crucial linkages to the overall economy of a nation. The housing sector is a key component of the economy. It is typically the largest single form of fixed capital investment, in most economics. Based on these facts, the researcher seeks to examine the role of private partnership in house finance, delivery and maintenance in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the role of private partnership in house finance, delivery and maintenance in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To ascertain the level of investment in housing delivery and maintenance in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.  To identify the problems of housing finance, delivery and maintenance in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What is the role of private partnership in house finance, delivery and maintenance in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.  What is the level of investment in housing delivery and maintenance in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  What are the problems of housing finance, delivery and maintenance in Nigeria?</p> <p><b>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>HO: Private partnership has not contributed to housing finance, delivery and maintenance in Nigeria.</p> <p>HA: Private partnership has contributed to housing finance, delivery and maintenance in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  The results of this study will educate the general public on the role of public private partnership and how it can be used as the instrument of development in housing finance, delivery and maintenance.</p> <p>2.  The findings will sensitize the stakeholders in building construction and real estate management on the need for effective collaboration with the private sector to ensure speedy financing and delivery of housing units all over the country noting that private partnership has facilitated development in housing delivery and maintenance in other advanced countries of the world.</p> <p>3.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on the role of private partnership in housing finance, delivery and maintenance in Nigeria will cover the involvement of private sector in the provision and maintenance of housing units with focus on the existing housing structure and management in Nigeria.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>LIMITATION OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.  </b><b>Financial constraint</b>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>2.  </b><b>Time constraint</b>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

Over the past decade the economy has been growing at an average rate of around seven percent yearly and, after Johannesburg, Lagos has the biggest, most liquid market in the region thereby creating the need for massive housing development. A central bank, reserve bank, or monetary authority is a public institution that usually issues the currency, regulates the money supply, and controls the interest rates in a country. Central banks often also oversee the commercial banking system of their respective countries. In contrast to a commercial bank, a central bank possesses a monopoly on printing the national currency, which usually serves as the nation's legal tender (Arthur and Sullivan, 2003). Example is the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The various roles of CBN will however in no doubt have specific impact on housing delivery in Nigeria.</p> <p>According to Wikipedia.org, Central banks around the world play similar functions some of which may include- implementing monetary policies, determining Interest rates, controlling the nation's entire money supply, the Government's banker and the bankers' bank (\"lender of last resort\"), regulating and supervising the banking industry, setting the official interest rate – used to manage both inflation and the country's exchange rate– and ensuring that this rate takes effect via a variety of policy mechanisms and managing the country's foreign exchange and gold reserves and the Government's stock register.</p> <p>Shelter is one of the basic necessities of life. Indeed, the housing sector plays a very critical role in a country’s prosperity as it directly affects not only the wellbeing of the citizenry but also the general performance of other sectors of the economy. Thus, provision of housing has, since the early 1970‟s, engaged the attention of most countries, especially the developing ones, for a number of reasons. First, it is one of the three most important basic needs of mankind. Consequently, programmes of assistance in the areas of finance, provision of infrastructure and research have been designed by governments to enhance adequate housing delivery. The focus on finance has, however, been very prominent for the reason that, housing provision requires huge capital outlay, which is often beyond the capacity of most of the citizens (Akeju, 2007).</p> <p>Increase in the rate of urbanization has exerted pressure on government and other government agencies like the Central Bank of Nigeria to develop plans for housing development in Nigeria as a result of situation experienced in most cases that the demand for housing units outweighs the supply. To address this gap, individuals, firms, and government must intervene. </p> <p>The first attempt at institutionalizing housing financing through the apex bank in Nigeria was the establishment of the Nigerian Building Society (NBS) in 1956. Thereafter, regional governments set up housing corporations, savings and loans banks and cooperative banks through the supervision of the Central Bank of Nigeria to provide funds in the form of mortgage credit for housing development (CBN, 2003). Following the Indigenization Act (1972) which aimed, amongst others, at promoting and transferring the ownership and control of foreign enterprises to Nigerians, the Nigerian Building Society, in 1977, was renamed and metamorphosed into the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria, (FMBN) to reflect the 100 per cent ownership of the Federal Government of Nigeria. Within two years of the establishment of the FMBN, its capital base was increased from N20 million when it was bought over by government in 1977 to N150 million in 1979, reflecting an increase of over 600 per cent. The current equity base of the FMBN is about N5 billion, with only 50 per cent of it paid-up (CBN, 2011). Equity in the bank is split between the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) and the Central Bank of Nigeria, (CBN). In 1994, the FMBN was granted the status of the premier and apex mortgage institution in Nigeria under the supervision of the Central Bank of Nigeria. However, the researcher is analyzing the role of CBN in ensuring affordable housing for Nigerian citizens (CBN, 2007).</p> <p>The Central Bank of Nigeria through the FMBN has encouraged the emergence and promotion of the growth of viable primary mortgage institutions to service the need of housing delivery in all parts of Nigeria; mobilized both domestic and offshore funds into the housing sector; linked the capital market with the housing industry by establishing and operating a viable secondary mortgage market to support the primary mortgage market; and distributed the National Housing Fund (NHF) in accordance with the provisions of the NHF Act” (CBN, 2011).<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The problem of housing has become a daily discussion in all quarters of the public and private sector of the Nigeria economy and has prompt several government agencies to implements plans for housing development for both their staffs and the general public at affordable cost. It has become increasingly glaring that most of the urban population in Nigeria live in dehumanizing housing environment while those that have access to average housing do so at abnormal cost. According to Onibokun (1986), Nubi (1991), rent in major cities of Nigeria is about 60% of an average workers disposable income. With the high cost of house building and the effort of government and its agencies that has been inadequate in the housing delivery, the researcher will analyze the role of CBN in ensuring affordable housing for Nigerians.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the role of CBN in ensuring affordable housing for Nigerians.</p> <p>2.  To ascertain the affordability of housing for Nigerians.</p> <p>3.  To determine the factors preventing Nigerians from getting affordable houses.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What is the role of CBN in ensuring affordable housing for Nigerians?</p> <p>2.  What is the affordability of housing for Nigerians?</p> <p>3.  What are the factors preventing Nigerians from getting affordable houses?</p> <p><b>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>HO: CBN has not contributed to the provision of affordable housing for Nigerians.</p> <p>HA: CBN has contributed to the provision of affordable housing for Nigerians.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  The findings from this study will educate the general public on the roles that government agencies and Central Bank of Nigeria can play in the provision of affordable housing for Nigerians.</p> <p>2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on the role of the CBN in ensuring affordable housing for Nigerians will cover the contribution of the Central Bank of Nigeria towards sustainable housing development in Nigeria.

Housing represents one of the most basic human needs. To most groups housing means shelter but to others it means more as it serves as one of the best indicators of a person’s standard of living and his or her place in the society (Nubi, 2008). It is a priority for the attainment of living standard and it is important to both rural and urban areas. These attribute make demand for housing to know no bound as population growth and urbanization are increase very rapidly and the gap between housing need and supply becomes widen. This housing deficit has continued to accumulate over the years as a result of poor housing policy implementation by successive government in Nigeria. Cultural factors such as preferences and values or social status, taste and financial resources, also influence a house physical characteristics. In developing countries, poor housing delivery has been attributed to inadequate mechanisms and systems for land allocation, funding, mortgage institutions and infrastructure (Encarta, 2007).</p> <p>Nigeria is perhaps the fastest urbanizing country in the African continent. One of the most important challenges facing the country is the provision of affordable housing. As more and more Nigerians make towns and cities their homes, the resulting social, economic, environmental and political challenges need to be urgently addressed (Raji, 2008). A recent study of housing situation in Nigeria put existing housing stock at 23 per 1000 inhabitant. Housing deficit is put at 15 million houses (Mabogunje 2007) while N12 trillion will be required to finance the deficit. This is about 4 times the annual national budget of Nigeria (FHA, 2007). House prices and rents, on the other hand, have grown ahead of general inflation. Making matters worse, the composition of houses for sale and rent on the market has been inexorably shifting towards very expensive house (Nubi, 2008).</p> <p>Between 1975 and 1980, there were plans of deliver 202,000 housing units to the public but only 28,500 units, representing 14.1% was achieved. Also, out of 200,000 housing units planned to be delivered between 1981 and 1985, only 47,200 (23.6%) was constructed. Under the National Housing Fund (NHF) programme initiated in 1994, to produce 121,000 housing units, it was believed that less than 5% was achieved. In spite of a series of government policies towards housing delivery, there exists a gap between housing supply and demand.</p> <p>Research has shown that 75% of urban housing is situated in slum conditions (UNDN, 2005), and indeed the quality of the housing is poor and clearly an affront to human dignity (Agbola and Olatubara, 2003). As part of effort to increasing qualitative, affordable housing for the masses in the country, the Federal Government in 2004, pledged to adequately fund research pertaining to the manufacture and the use of local materials in the sector. Housing delivery in Nigeria is provided by either the Government or Private sector, but despite Federal Government access to factors of housing production, the country could at best expect 4.2% of the annual requirement. Substantial contribution is expected from other public and private sectors. The production of housing in Nigeria is primarily the function of the private market; approximately 90% of urban housing is produced by private developers. Due to housing demand created by rural- urban migration, which account for 65% of urban population growth, the fixed supply of urban land, and inflation of rental and housing ownership cost (Taylor, 2000).</p> <p>The problem of affordable housing has been a concern for both the government and individuals. Appreciating these problems, both public and private sector developers make effort through various activities to bridge the gap between housing supply and demand, but the cost of building materials, deficiency of housing finance arrangement, rigorous loan conditions from mortgage banks, government policies amongst other problems have affecting housing delivery significantly in Nigeria (Raji, 2008). However, the researcher is of the opinion that government still has much to do in terms of solving housing deficit in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The problem of housing deficit in Nigeria has been a topic of discussion at different forum of the economy. The situation even becomes more serious and worrisome when one realizes the fact that despite a number of political, social, and religious initiatives taken in the past in Nigeria, a large proportion of the nation’s population still lives in sub-standard and poor. In Nigeria, housing provision by government commenced before political independence in 1960 and despite various government interventions and huge investments in housing provision, the housing problem in the country still remains intractable as many rural and urban populations in Nigeria do not have access to decent, safe and affordable housing. This is as a result of the government inability to provide adequate and affordable housing to the populace. However, the researcher seeks to examine the role of the federal government in solving housing deficit in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the role of the federal government in solving housing deficit in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To ascertain the level of housing deficit in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.  To identify the solution to the problems of housing deficit in Nigeria.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What is the role of the federal government in solving housing deficit in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.  What is the level of housing deficit in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  What is the solution to the problems of housing deficit in Nigeria?</p> <p><b>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>HO: Government has not solved the problem of housing deficit in Nigeria.</p> <p>HA: Government has solved the problem of housing deficit in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>The outcome of this study will educate the Nigerian populace on the contribution of government to solving housing deficit in Nigeria.

Skill Gap is the difference in the skills required on the job and the actual skills possessed by the staff. A Skills Gap arises when a worker does not have all the skills necessary to do the job effectively. Therefore, skills gaps refer to the situation where an industry has workers but they are not skilled enough to meet the organizations’ objectives (Jean, 2003).</p> <p>The building industry is growing but it seems the stock of competent skilled construction workers has dwindled (Odusami &amp; Ene, 2011).  A skill gap is the shortage in performance. It is the difference between what is required or expected and what we actually get. Put in another way a skill gap is the required performance minus the present performance. Hence it is also called the performance gap. Basically, a skills gap or performance gap is the difference between the actual or present performance and the optimal or future performance.</p> <p>Vocational training is an educational training which encompasses knowledge, skills, competencies, structural activities, abilities, capabilities and all other structural experiences acquired through formal, on-the-job or off-the job which is capable of enhancing recipients opportunity for securing jobs in various sector of the economy or even enabling the person to be self-dependent by being a job creator. Federal Republic of Nigeria (2004) opined that vocational training is an aspect of the educational process involving, in addition to general education, the study of technologies and related sciences and the acquisition of practical skills, attitudes, understanding and knowledge relative to occupations in the building sector. Manfred and Jennifer (2004) advocated that vocational training comprises all more or less organized or structured activities that aim at providing people with the knowledge, skills and competencies necessary to perform a job or a set of jobs whether or not they lead to a formal qualification. These definitions show that the relationship between vocational training and skill development towards a sustainable building industry in Nigeria. Common indicators of Skills issues are poor workmanship and building failure. Nigerian cities with the exception of the enclave of the rich and powerful are characterized by poor quality structures, poor layout and streets access, lack of essential utility services, inadequate security, and social services (Alemika, 2010). Apparently, deficiencies exist between the skills of vocational workers and those required to meet the needs and expectations of employers in the Building sector which prompt the researcher to examine the role of vocational training in bridging the skill gap that exist in building industry in Nigeria. The skill gap in the Nigeria building industry can be attributed to the dwindling stock of competent skilled construction workers and the influx of unskilled, inefficient and dissatisfied workers who see the building sector as a last resort (ITF, 2014). Adequate and effective vocational training in Nigeria can meet the highly skilled human resource need in the Nigerian building industry. Skill needs in building sector includes building drawing skills, surveying, landscaping and site preparation skills, foundation skills, ability to use machines for construction, ability to use hand tools for practical work, brick and block laying skills, roofing skills, masonry skills in building, concreting and reinforcement skills, carpentry and joinery skills, final finishes skills and plumbing skills. In recent times, the government of Nigeria through the Federal Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development has shown concern about the present dearth of skilled artisans and craftsmen in the building construction industry. They asserted that artisans and craftsmen constitute an important component of the value chain in housing delivery and essential for the production of well-built, good quality and durable housing on a greater scale across the country. The ministry is using two vocational training centres located in Lagos state to upgrade the skills of this category of tradesmen. The ministry recently completed the renovation and upgrading of its facilities at the Harvey road, Yaba-Lagos training centre and a school of Architectural and Building Technicians is being constructed in Kuje, in the FCT. Efforts are being made by the Nigeria Federal government to establish six more skills acquisition/ vocational training centres in different parts of the country, as well as undertake a review of the curricula for artisan and vocational training in conjunction with relevant institutions.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Apart from skill obsolescence that occurs over time in the Nigerian building industry, there are other factors that cause skill gaps which an effective vocational training would have curtailed.  A major factor is the changing pattern of working in building industry. The current trends in the world of work such as globalization, commercialization, flexi-hour, deregulation, outsourcing, contract work, homework and freelancing have led to marked changes in industry structure.  New definition, new meaning, and new application of knowledge drive all these changes.  New forms of work structures which are flexible, adaptable, less hierarchical, and multi-skilled and which encourage continuous learning are becoming sources of competitive advantage in the building industry.  International competition for jobs and workers has also intensified, leading to the global talent hunt for innovation-driven knowledge workers. However, the researcher is examining the role of vocational training in bridging these skill gaps that exists in the Nigerian building industry.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the role of vocational training in bridging the skill gap that existed in Nigerian building industry.</p> <p>2.  To identify the skill gaps in the Nigerian building industry.</p> <p>3.  To examine the effectiveness and adequacy of vocational training in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What is the role of vocational training in bridging the skill gap that existed in Nigerian building industry?</p> <p>2.  What are the skill gaps in the Nigerian building industry?</p> <p>3.  What is the effectiveness and adequacy of vocational training in Nigeria?</p> <p><b>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>HO: Vocational training has not bridge the skill gap in Nigeria building industry.</p> <p>HA: Vocational training has bridge the skill gap in Nigeria building industry.</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  The outcome of this study will educate the general public, government and policy makers on the level of vocational training in Nigeria and also the skill gaps that existed in the Nigeria building industry considering the role of vocational training.</p> <p>2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on the role of vocational training in bridging skill gap in the building industry in Nigeria will cover the successes and failure of buildings and other structures in Nigeria has a reference in ascertaining the level of competency of Nigeria builders.

Management indicates a need to be cared for, monitored and accountability given for its useful life and condition. This is much akin to the role of management in any business (Wikipedia, 2015).</p> <p>Public residential property management is also the management of personal property, equipment, tooling and physical capital assets that are acquired and used to build, repair and maintain the public residential property. Property management involves the processes, systems and manpower required to manage the life cycle of all public residential property as defined above including acquisition, control, accountability, responsibility, maintenance, utilization and disposition (Njoku, 2006). According to Ebie (2012), duties involved in public residential property management generally will include a minimum of these basic primary tasks</p> <p>-      The full and proper screening or testing of an tenants/applicant's credit, criminal history, rental history and ability to pay.</p> <p>-      Lease contracting or accepting rent using legal documents approved for the area in which the property is located.</p> <p>-      Mitigation and remediation regarding any maintenance issues, generally within a budget, with prior or conveyed consent via a Limited Power of Attorney legally agreed to by the property owner.</p> <p>There are many facets to this public residential property management, including managing the accounts and finances of the real estate/residential properties, and participating in or initiating litigation with tenants, contractors and insurance agencies. Litigation is at times considered a separate function, set aside for trained attorneys. Although a person will be responsible for this in his/her job description, there may be an attorney working under a property manager. Special attention is given to landlord/tenant law and most commonly evictions, non-payment, harassment, reduction of pre-arranged services, and public nuisance are legal subjects that gain the most amount of attention from public residential property managers. Therefore, it is a necessity that a public residential property manager be current with applicable municipal, county, state and Federal Fair Housing laws and practices. In advanced countries, public residential property management, like facility management, is increasingly facilitated by computer-aided facility management (CAFM).</p> <p>However, managers of public residential properties in Nigeria are faced with various kinds of challenges ranging from uncooperative attitude from workers, poor maintenance and environmental condition, security and other basic infrastructures. Some managers in Nigeria has been able to cope with some of this challenges but the researcher will provide an overview about the challenges and how public residential properties can be managed effectively.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>According to Bello (2008), public residential properties is more than a mere shelter; it includes all facilities within and around it, embracing a bundle of services which entails both product and process. Management of public residential building embraces in all ramifications the maintenance and development process, be it economic, social, physical). In fact, management of these properties has been subject of focus by researcher in recent times based on the cumbersome nature of the process. The problem of poor management of public residential properties is a global phenomenon and the severity of the problem differs from one nation to another. However, the researcher is seeking to examine the challenges of management of public residential property in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the challenges of management of public residential properties in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To analyze the effect of adequate management of public residential property on its value.</p> <p>3.  To identify the solution to the problems of public residential property management in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What are the challenges of management of public residential properties in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.  What is the effect of adequate management of public residential property on its value?</p> <p>3.  What are the solutions to the problems of public residential property management in Nigeria?</p> <p>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  The outcome of this study will educate the general public on the intricacies of public residential properties in Nigeria emphasizing on its proper management and some other management challenges which will form a guide for estate managers in decision making.</p> <p>2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The scope of this study on the challenges of management of public residential properties in Nigeria will cover all the basic problems faced by managers in effective maintenance of both the infrastructure and finances generated from it.</p> <p><b>LIMITATION OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>Financial constraint</b>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p> <b>Time constraint</b>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

Shelter is a basic necessities an esteemed need of man. It used to be ranked second after food in the hierarchy of man’s needs but according to Ebie (2009) it is the first and most important of all rights. According to him, because of the importance attaching to provision of housing and coupled with the fact that a proper housing unit in all its ramifications is more than mere blocks of buildings since it embraces all social services and utilities that go to make a community or neighbourhood a livable environment, it is now a right. Though inadequate, but the federal government of Nigeria and various corporate organizations have invested in the building residential estate for the purpose of profit making and meeting the housing needs of Nigerians. Even though this provision is not actionable, it reinforces the call for government at all levels to invest in massive housing provision in Nigeria and this study is however examining the role of Akwa Ibom State Government in the development of residential estates in the state. </p> <p>A residential housing estate is a group of homes and other buildings built together as a single development. The exact form may vary from country to country. Accordingly, a housing estate is usually built by a single contractor, with only a few styles of house or building design, so they tend to be uniform in appearance. </p> <p>The desire for adequate and affordable housing also has strong links to the need for security, safety and proper socio - economic status of individuals and communities. In spite of this widely acknowledged importance of housing and various efforts in making adequate and affordable housing available to majority of people, a large proportion of urban residents in less developed countries do not have access to decent housing at affordable cost (Tipple, 2004; 2006; UN-HABITAT, 2006; Greene and Rojas, 2008).</p> <p>As a result, most urban residents in Developing countries live in housing conditions that constitute an affront to human dignity and which comes with appalling social, economic, spatial and health implications (Coker et al., 2007; UNFPA, 2007). Hence, inadequate housing condition has become an intractable challenge that has continued to receive attention from governments and individuals in many developing countries. Previous studies have shown that successive administrations in Nigeria had launched a minimum of seven residential housing programmes in the last few decades in a bid to address increasing housing challenges in the country (Akinmoladun and Oluwoye, 2007; Ademiluyi and Raji, 2008) However, substantial literature on public residential estate in developing countries has revealed three main streams of criticism (Mukhija, 2004). First, it is argued that most public residential schemes are inefficient and ill conceived, and thus failed to meet the needs of target population (Rondinelli, 1990; Mba, 1992). Second, direct government involvement in housing provision is viewed as being negligible compared to the volume of residential estates provided by informal private sector (UN-HABITAT, 2006). Finally, government intervention in the housing market to check rising cost of housing is seen as counter – productive and an impediment to smooth operation of housing market and efficient housing delivery system.</p> <p>Consequently, many scholars and stakeholders have argued that government has no business in providing housing for people, but rather government should act as a partner, enabler and facilitator of housing process by making available appropriate incentives, policy and good regulatory environment necessary for effective private sector participation in building of residential estate (Ebie, 2009). It is important to note that state governments have not been able to contribute to the development of residential housing schemes in Nigeria as most of the available residential estates are built by the federal government. However, Akwa Ibom state government has built 310 prime units mini estates at 10 per local government in all the Local Government Areas mainly for local government chieftains. Work is ongoing on the construction of 10,000 modern and affordable houses to the Akwa Ibom populace.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Ong and Lenard (2002) were of the opinion that provision of residential estate should be collaborative effort between government and private sector and this does not necessarily mean reduction in government’s social responsibility in providing housing for the citizens, but rather it implies the production of housing through collaborative approach in an integrated manner. In the light of foregoing criticisms coupled with the need for sustainable solution to burgeoning housing challenges in most state in Nigeria including Akwa Ibom state; it is important to ascertain the contribution of state governments over the years on the provision of residential estate for the citizens. The foregoing gory picture and deplorable condition of housing in Nigeria applies with equal force to Akwa Ibom State if not to a higher extent considering that more than 60% of the population live in urban areas. Thus Akwa Ibom State also shares in this global developmental reality; and one of the most important challenges facing the state is how to ensure adequate and affordable housing to the poor and low-income group. Unfortunately, despite all efforts of the state government at achieving sustained housing delivery through provision of residential estates to the common people, existing realities indicate the goal is far from being achieved. It is against this background that this study examines the role of Akwa Ibom state government in the development of residential estates.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study</p> <p>1.  To examine the role of Akwa Ibom state government in the development of residential estates.</p> <p>2.  To analyze the perception of Nigerians on the provision of residential estates</p> <p>3.  To identify the factor hindering the provision of residential estates in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What is the role of Akwa Ibom state government in the development of residential estates?</p> <p>2.  What is the perception of Nigerians on the provision of residential estate?</p> <p>3.  What are the factors hindering the provision of residential estates in Nigeria?</p> <p><b>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>HO: Akwa Ibom State government has not provided adequate residential estates for the citizen</p> <p>HA: Akwa Ibom State government has provided adequate residential estates for the citizen</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>A research on the role of State government in the development of residential estate in Nigeria a case study of Akwa Ibom State is no doubt an important one. This is going by the notion that the outcomes of current strategies engaged by government in solving the problem of providing adequate, affordable and sustainable housing in this State in recent time are not known. Therefore, this study is important for several reasons. </p> <p>First, Bana (1991) and Emerole (2002) indicated that inadequate capacity of public housing agencies to deliver housing was one of the key challenges of public housing in Nigeria. This suggests that understanding the organizational capacity and constraints of public housing agencies to provide housing is necessary in judging their performance. It can also help improve on their capacity and thus enhancing the productivity of the public housing sub-sector. This study is thus important on the basis that it attempts to provide basic information that will enhance our knowledge of the organizational capacity of selected key public housing agencies in study area. This is also considered necessary in assessing the outcomes of public housing provisions and making useful recommendations. </p> <p>Second, Mukhija (2004) noted that there is little consensus on the strategies and approaches governments should follow in addressing the housing need of their citizens. This suggests that research works are yet to focus attention on comparing outcomes of the various housing delivery strategies used in public housing provisions to identify which strategies work best and under what conditions. This situation accounts for continuous engagement of inefficient and dysfunctional housing delivery strategies, which Emerole (2002), Oladapo (2002) and African Ministerial Council in Urban Development (2008) noted was responsible for increasing housing supply deficit in Nigeria. By investigating the outcomes of four housing delivery strategies used in residential estate provisions in Akwa Ibom State.</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on the role of state government in the development of residential estates is limited to the public housing schemes and residential estates initiated and completed by the government of Akwa Ibom State.</p> <p><b>REFERENCES</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Ademiluyi, A.I., and Raji, B.A (2008).Public and Private Developers as Agents in Urban Housing Delivery in Sub-Saharan Africa: The Situation in Lagos State. <i>Humanity &amp; Social Sciences Journal 3 (2) 143-150</i></p> <p><i></i></p><i></i> <p>Akinmoladun, O.I., Oluwoye, J., (2007).

And is more conspicuous in the urban than rural areas and has been linked to such problems like demographic inconsistency and in continuity in sanitation policy and data availability. The increase in population as a result of industrial revolution in major towns and cities of the world have necessitated rapid growth or high rate of urbanization and development for instance; Nigeria cities in recent time have witnessed rapid population growth resulting from influx of migrants from rural area to the cities. This brings about the concentration of industrial, commercial, infrastructural,  administration and government activities in urban centers. Thus, as the population of cities grows, the  rate of waste generation also increases leading to increase burning of refuse (in the developing  countries) and high rate of air pollution ,which increased concentration of green house gases that  causes global warming and eventually Climate change. The volume of waste generated in any city is  often reflection of the intensity of human activities such as population urbanization and social  development, resources exploitation and unchecked technological advances. All these activities  generated one form of waste or the other. And the volume of waste generated has also increased  tremendously .the implication of this is that we have more waste to cope with. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><b>CHAPTER</b> <b>ONE</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1            </b><b>  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused the temperature of the earth to rise by 0.6Cover the last 100 years. The ten (10) warmest years of the 20th century all occurred in the last 15 years of the century and 1998 was the warmest year on record (www.defra.gov.uk). Thermal expansion and glacier melting are causing sea level to rise, rises in sea level can increase the salinity of freshwater throughout the world ,and cause coastal lands to be washed under ocean exposing populations toincreased risk of flooding, .patterns of precipitation are changing, with greater like hood of extreme events and more areas subject to water stress warmer water and increased humidity may encourage tropical cyclone, and changing wave patterns could produce more tidal waves and strong beach erosion on the coast.

The site of building collapse scattered across the length and breadth of Nigeria is quite alarming that it is unimaginable what effects it will have on the building industry and Nigeria economy as a whole. One could imagine what edifices these buildings would have been if only they were constructed accordingly. It has been reported that Nigeria, especially Lagos State has become the “world’s junk-yard” of collapsed buildings worth billions of naira (Famoroti, 2005). It is quite unimaginable that a county blessed with so great potentials in its construction industry can experience such magnitude of building collapse Fadamiro in 2002 defined building as “an enclosure for spaces designed for specific use, meant to control local climate, distribute services and evacuate waste”. Buildings can be defined as structural entities capable of securing self by transmitting weights to the ground. More so, buildings are defined “as structures for human activities, which must be safe for the occupants”(Odulami, 2002). However, these same buildings have been posing treats and dangers to people either during or after construction as a result of its collapse. Collapse as a whole occurs when part or whole body of a structure fails and suddenly gives way, the structure, as a result of this failure, could not meet the purpose for which it was meant for. Building collapse is an extreme case of building failure. It means the super-structure crashes down totally or partially (Arilesere, 2002). Building failure occurs when there is a defect in one or more elements of the building caused by inability of the material making up the components of such building elements to perform its original function effectively, which may finally lead to building collapse. Buildings are meant to provide conveniences and shelter to the people, but the same building has been a danger trap to the same people. Building is expected to meet certain basic requirements such as buildability, design performance, cost effectiveness, quality, safety and timely completion (Olusola, Atta &amp; Ayangade, 2002). Generally, buildings are expected to be elegant and functional but many projects are constructed that do not meet any of these basic requirements. The recurring incidence of building collapse, some of which claimed innocent lives is a consequence of this. Many studies has been carried out and various workshops organized in major cities of the country by various bodies, government agencies and institution in order to look into causes of the incidence of building collapse in Nigeria, but none has been able to come out with how each of the determined factors directly lead to building collapse in the country. There are many factors that cause building collapse in Nigeria and they are structural design and quality management according to Olusola (2002).The quality management entails material variability, testing variability, judgment factor, contractors’ variability, poorly skilled workmen and unprofessional conduct. The study aimed at examining the cases of residential building collapse in Nigeria with a view of identifying the causes, effect and solution.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Building collapse is a defect or imperfection, deficiency or fault in a building element or component. It may also be as a result of omission of performance. The degree of building collapse can therefore be related to the extent or degree of deviation of a building from the “as – built” state which is in most cases represent the acceptable standard within the neighborhood, locality, state or country. (Ikpo, 1998). However, building collapse can simply be defined as a total or partial/progressive failure of one or more components of a building leading to the inability of the building to perform its principal function of comfort, satisfaction, safety and stability. The incessant buildings collapse in Nigeria has become a great concern to all the stakeholders – the professionals in building industry, government, private developers, clients and users, as well as the neighborhood residents. Fall out of the researcher’s concern about the increasing incidents of collapse building nation-wide form the basis for this study to find out the major causes, effects and probable remedial measures to collapse of buildings in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the causes of building collapse in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To identify the effects of building collapse in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.  To identify the remedial measures or approaches to building collapse in Nigeria</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What are the causes of building collapse in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.  What are the effects of building collapse in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  What are the remedial measures or approaches to building collapse in Nigeria?</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  The outcome of this study will educate the general public and the government of the day on the causes, effect and solutions to the cases of building collapse in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on residential building collapse in Nigeria with careful examination of the causes and the effects with a view of finding a lasting solution to the issue of incessant building collapse in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>LIMITATION OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>Financial constraint</b>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p> <b>Time constraint</b>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

Stakeholders and industry operatives in building technology are unanimous in their opinion that the process of housing delivery in Nigeria needs a change of strategy. In this study, the researcher is examining modern ways that could be explored to meet the nation’s housing deficit which stands around 17million units (Akeju, 2012).</p> <p>Although Nigeria with a population of over 160 million people has been identified as the largest market in Africa for everything, including real estate, growing demand for decent shelter has continued to meet leaner supply of housing units. Over the years, successive governments in the country had tinkered with policies in a bid to achieve its mass housing objective but due to lack of reasonable commitment to it, achieving the goal has remained elusive (FRN, 2007).</p> <p>Experts who gave analytical insight into the problem of housing delivery in Nigeria called for a declaration of a state of emergency in the housing sector, saying innovative thinking and modern strategies could bring about better outcomes that will enhance housing delivery process in the country. It is a known fact that financing of housing projects remained one of the biggest problems in the sector that is militating against housing delivery. Akeju (2012) is of the opinion that the major issue in housing delivery is funding, getting appropriate funding. There is money flowing everywhere but the right type of money needed for long term project like housing is not available. Something that can really work for affordable housing can be akin to what the Federal Mortgage Bank offers which cannot go round.</p> <p>Modern strategy in housing delivery in Nigeria will reiterates the government’s priority to tackle overcrowding and the ambitious target to reduce severe overcrowding in rented housing apartments (Bush, 2004). Alongside making funding available for larger homes, with at least higher number of bedrooms, and a long-term commitment to deliver the family sized affordable homes should be identified in a strategic plan for housing delivery (Easton, 2006).</p> <p>There are many strategies needed to facilitate massive housing delivery in Nigeria but modern and technologically-inspired large scale housing schemes – schemes and sites with thousands of housing units could play a significant role in the delivery of the large number of houses the Nigerians needs. The experience of the last 20 years suggests that the level of demand for new homes over the next decade will not be met by piecemeal incremental developments.</p> <p>In Nigeria today, there is a shortage of housing for low-income earners and constantly growing housing demands (due to increase in population) that are not met. Unfortunately, banks are reluctant to provide mortgage facilities to low-income earners. In order to solve the housing/mortgage challenges faced by the Nigeria populace, the Nigerian Mortgage Refinance Company (NMRC) was established to promote home ownership and increase the availability and affordability of mortgage loans to Nigerians. In spite of the incorporation of NMRC in June 24, 2013, not much has changed. The apathy of banks towards mortgage transactions still lingers, understandably, because of the risk of default. To buttress this, 66,402 Nigerians applied for mortgages during the recent Nigerian Housing Finance Programme. Only 10,000 Nigerians were selected. However, the interest rates by primary mortgage institutions that participated in the programme were alarming (14.5% -19%). It is suggested that a cue be taken from other countries where the cost of mortgage for first time home buyers are low, with small down payments and easy terms especially, a single digit interest rate.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The problem of housing delivery is of great concern in many countries. This problem is especially prominent in Nigeria. The challenge as been magnified as a result of a myriad of issues, not least, a high population growth rate, shortage of necessary skills and disintegrated supply chain. There is need for Nigerian government and stakeholders in the building industry to rise up to housing needs of Nigerians in quality and quantity. Some researchers has advocated other modern methods of construction like dry construction has strategy to mass housing delivery. However, the researcher is examining how modern strategies can be used to ensure that the housing need of Nigerians are met.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the modern strategies that can be used for effective housing delivery.</p> <p>2.  To determine the effect of modern strategies on housing delivery in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.  To analyze the factors hindering the use of modern strategies in housing delivery in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What are the modern strategies that can be used for effective housing delivery?</p> <p>2.  What is the effect of modern strategies on housing delivery in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  What are the factors hindering the use of modern strategies in housing delivery in Nigeria?</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  Outcome of this study will educate stakeholders in the building industry, government and policy makers on the modern strategies that can be used to solve the problems of housing deficit in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on appraisal of modern strategies for housing delivery in Nigeria will cover all the effort and approaches of past and present government of Nigeria at tackling the problem of housing deficit in Nigeria.

There are various taxes that apply to real estate or real property transactions in Nigeria. The common public representation or perception that there are no real property or real estate taxes in Nigeria is not correct. Some of the common taxes that apply to real property transactions in Nigeria include the company’s income tax, value added tax, capital gains tax and stamp duties tax. Any income with the resulting profit earned by any person from such income, whether such a person is a corporation or an individual, from a property transaction, is liable to the payment of tax. Where the income earner is a corporation, the corporate tax rate in Nigeria is thirty per cent (30%) of the annual profit of the corporation; and where the income earner from a property transaction is an individual or a registered business enterprise or partnership, the graduated tax rate is twenty-four per cent (24%) for individuals earning N3,200,000 and above, per annum (Nwosu, 2004).</p> <p>In addition to paying Companies Income Tax, incorporated corporations in Nigeria, engaged in any commercial activity, including real estate or real property transactions from which they make a profit, are liable to pay two per cent (2%) of such profit as Education tax to the Education Trust Fund. This Tax is collected on behalf of the Education Trust Fund by the Federal Inland</p> <p>Revenue Service (“FIRS”). All goods and services in Nigeria, including goods and services utilized in the real estate industry, are liable to be invoiced and to the payment of Value Added Tax (“VAT”) at the rate of five per cent (5%) of the value of such real estate goods and services. The Capital Gains Tax Act provides that any time an asset, including a real estate asset, whether situated in Nigeria or outside of Nigeria, is disposed off by a Nigerian tax payer, and a gain is derived as a result of such disposal, the resulting gain or profit shall be liableto a ten per cent (10%) Capital Gains Tax (“CGT”) less such allowable expenditures that were utilised to enhance or preserve or defend the title to the asset.</p> <p>However, gains arising from the disposal of an individual’s principal private residence for another person’s principal private residence are exempted from the provisions of the Capital Gains Tax Act. Also exempted from CGT are commercial motor vehicles and personal Gifts from which no monetary gain is derived.</p> <p>The Stamp Duties Act requires that all written instruments, including instances where any property or interest in property is or are transferred or leased to any person, must be stamped.</p> <p>Generally, Stamp Duties is charged at the rate of 75 kobo for every N200 of the consideration of certain real estate transactions like mortgages, while for conveyances or the transfer or sale of real property, the stamp duties rate is 75kobo for every N50. The Stamp</p> <p>Duties rate for lease and rental agreements is 16kobo for every N200 of the consideration of the lease or rental agreement.</p> <p>Any written document that is not stamped is not allowed to be received in any judicial proceeding in Nigeria until the stamp duty and the resulting penalty for the nonpayment of the stamp duty is paid. There are fines and other penalties for any failure to pay stamp duties on any written instrument that is not exempted from the payment of stamp duty. </p> <p>A real estate transaction is the process whereby rights in a unit of property (or designated real estate) is transferred between two or more parties, e.g. in case of conveyance one party being the seller(s) and the other being the buyer(s). It can often be quite complicated due to the complexity of the property rights being transferred, the amount of money being exchanged, and government regulations. Conventions and requirements also vary considerably among different countries of the world and among smaller legal entities. Tax refers to a “compulsory levy by a public authority for which nothing is received directly in return” (James and Nobes, 1992). According to Nightingale (2001), “a tax is compulsory contribution, imposed by government, and while taxpayers may receive nothing identifiable in return for their contribution, they nevertheless have the benefit of living in a relatively educated, healthy and safe society”. She further explains that taxation is part of the price to be paid for an organized society and identified six reasons for taxation to include provision of public goods, redistribution of income and wealth, promotion of social and economic welfare, economic stability and harmonization and regulation. Compliance with these taxes by parties to real property transactions in Nigeria has not been studied, but general tax compliance in Nigeria is low except when enforced.</p> <p>According to the traditional model of tax compliance by Allingham and Sandmo (1972), taxpayers choose how much income to report on their tax returns by solving a standard expected utility-maximization problem that trade off the tax savings from underreporting true income against the risk of audit and penalties for detected non compliance. (Allingham and Sandmo, 1972).</p> <p>Therefore, a more appropriate definition of compliance could include the degree of willingness with tax laws and administration that can be achieved without the immediate threat or actual application of enforcement activity. Tax compliance may be viewed in terms of tax avoidance and evasion. The two are conventionally distinguished in terms of legality, with avoidance referring to legal measures to reduce tax liability and evasion as illegal measures. </p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The subject of taxation has received considerable intellectual and theoretical attention in the literature. Taxation is one of the most volatile subjects in governance both in the developing and developed nations. Low tax compliance is a matter of serious concern in many developing countries especially on real property transactions in Nigeria.  This has limited the capacity of government to raise revenue for developmental purposes (Torgler, 2003). This implies that the higher the revenue, the more likely government will put in place developmental plans for the enhancement of the living standard of the people.

Culture, on the other hand, is a way of life, a lifestyle, customs, traditions, habits that portray the attributes of a person/people. </p> <p>Maintenance culture is an attitude which is sadly lacking in Nigeria, whether in the home, office, school or factory. Mbamali (2003) added that poor maintenance culture has become a widely recognized problem in Nigeria which has poorly affected the quality of public properties.</p> <p>Public property is property that is dedicated to public use and is a subset of state property. The term may be used either to describe the use to which the property is put, or to describe the character of its ownership (owned collectively by the population of a state). This is in contrast to private property, owned by an individual person or artificial entities that represent the financial interests of persons, such as corporations. State ownership, also called public ownership, government ownership or state property, are property interests that are vested in the state, rather than an individual or communities (Wikipedia, 2015).</p> <p>Maintenance culture in Nigeria is one of the lowest around the world, especially, in our principal towns and cities where the majority of public properties are located. In the rural areas, the story is different and pleasant to hear. The traditional practice of communal clearing of community owned places such as market playground is in almost every village and in private homes. Also, it is customary to refurbish building interiors with mixtures of cow dung or natural red clay. The end result is attractive and totally indigenous. According to Wahab (1995) the nation accords low priority to property management leading to neglect of public properties. Mbamali (2003) asserted that we have no maintenance policy and therefore no such culture exists. Neglect of maintenance has accumulated consequences in rapid increase in the deterioration of the fabric and finishes of a building, accompanied by a harmful effect on the contents occupants Seeley, (1987). Inadequate maintenance culture is a peculiar feature of almost every public building in Nigeria. According to Rotimi and Mtallib (1995) is partly due to poor maintenance culture on one hand and partly due to the absence of an appropriate benchmark. Gurjit (1990) asserted that lack of proper maintenance culture bring the life of these public building last before reaching the total obsolescence state. The declining maintenance culture in Nigeria and its effect on public buildings and all other properties has become a major problem to the government at various levels. This study examines ways of improving maintenance culture and its effect on quality of public properties</p> <p>A great portion of a nation wealth is evident in the total value of its public properties and buildings; it is also an important factor in the production of the building to be preserved. A poorly maintained building in a decaying environment depresses the quality of live and contributes in some measures to anti social behaviour which threatens the socio\" political environment it finds itself in</p> <p>According to Stephen (2002) public properties services rarely perform as well as desired. The causes emanate from deficiencies in design, construction, commissioning and maintenance, many researchers have also observed that the generators of maintenance problems could be looked upon has caused during the design stage or construction stage or initiated during the usage stage or the user’s carefree attitudes (Bad maintenance culture) which will eventually deteriorate the condition of the property. </p> <p>He further said that all these could be planned for during the design stage. Maintenance problems though do manifest during the use of the building, their causes might be during the design stage. These made Dekker (2002) to assert that thinking on the maintenance should start in the design phase. According to Speight (2000), it is at the design stage that the maintenance burden can be positively influenced for better or for worse. Where the designer fails to make adequate consideration for minimizing maintenance problems, it always turns out to be a big problem when the building is eventually occupied for usage, the consideration for effective maintenance as one of the parameters for the building design. Seeley (1997) also said that a skilful design can reduce the amount of maintenance work and also make it easier to perform, since good maintenance begins on the drawing board.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Oladimeji (1996) further described maintenance of public properties as the combination of any continuous actions carried out to retain a property in or restore it to an acceptable condition. Onwuka (1989) stated that maintenance culture is concerned with the planning and control of construction resources to ensure that necessary repairs and renewal are carried out with maximum efficiency and economy to enhance the quality of the property. However, the researcher is examining the ways of improving maintenance culture and quality of public properties in Nigeria.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine ways of improving maintenance culture in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To determine ways of enhancing the quality of public properties through improved maintenance culture.</p> <p>3.  To determine the factors affecting maintenance culture in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.4      </b><b>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>2.  What are the ways of improving maintenance culture in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  What are the ways of enhancing the quality of public properties through improved maintenance culture?</p> <p>4.  What are the factors affecting maintenance culture in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  The findings from this study will educate the government and policy makers, stakeholders in building and the general public on the need for improvement in maintenance culture as a way of improving the quality of public property.</p> <p>2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on improving maintenance culture and quality of public properties in Nigeria will cover the attitude of Nigerians to the adequate maintenance of public properties, looking at ways to improve maintenance culture with a view to improve the quality of public properties.</p> <p><b>LIMITATION OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>Financial constraint</b>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p> <b>Time constraint</b>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

The Nigerian property market with its potential, like similar markets in several emerging economies in Africa, has not benefitted from internationalized property investment and remains poorly researched (Babawale, 2008).</p> <p>With surging rents, significant housing deficits, and over-regulation, the Nigerian property market is a matrix of opportunity and unique challenges, which only optimistic investors would be able to successfully convert into viable, long-term profits.</p> <p>Having already attained titles of being Africa’s largest economy and most populous nation (with over 178 million people), Nigeria seems bound to also top the list for Africa’s most expensive location for residential and property and office. With two of its major cities, Abuja and Lagos, following closely behind Angola (with average monthly rental charges of $150 per square metre of prime office space and annual rental charges of $25,000 per four-bedroom house), it should come as no surprise that there is growing interest in the lucrative prospects of up to $400 billion in real estate opportunities (JLL, 2010).</p> <p>The fast rate of population growth coupled with the significantly slower supply rate of housing in Nigeria has led to a startling housing deficit of 17 million units. This inevitably led to sharp increases in rent prices, with the average executive 4-bedroom house in Abuja being rented for a monthly price of $8,500 and the average executive 4-bedroom house in Lagos, being rented for $8,000 per month.</p> <p>Whilst opportunities are present in the market, there are also an abundance of obstacles, which may deter progress for investors in the Nigerian property market. Rental yields can reach 10% and above but rising costs of building materials, as a result of the relatively higher cement prices, threaten longevity of such benefits as the average cost of building a home in Nigeria (approximately $50,000) increases year on year. The significant infrastructure deficit of the nation has also contributed to the rising costs (JLL, 2010).</p> <p>It has been said that the rising costs of houses is not only attributable to the cost of factors of production but also to the regulatory costs of building a home in Nigeria which can be as much as 20% of the total costs of building the house. Property registration is a significant factor that contributes to the costs due to the fact that 65%-70% of land in Nigeria is held under customary title, which can require court proceedings to appropriate the rightful holder of the title to plots of lands. Complications like this have made the registration process both longer in duration and more expensive than is necessary at 20.8% of the value of a Nigerian home.</p> <p>As well as having attractive rent prices for landlords and similar investors, the Nigerian property market also provides attractive returns on investment that cannot be ignored by investors seeking to purchase property in the nation where an investment in real estate can bring returns of 30-35%. The high-end Lagos market, for example, illustrates the potential for profitable investments with properties selling for $1.37 million (JLL, 2010).</p> <p>Whilst such numbers evoke hope in the Nigerian property market, it must be remembered that there is a need for affordable housing. Although the middle class of Nigeria is rising, there are still over 87 million Nigerians living on less than a dollar a day. This fact presents both challenges and opportunities as it is clear that in the long-term there is a housing market that will grow robustly but it must be attended to using methods that will would avoid the paradigm of the majority of the population being priced out of the market.</p> <p>What may be a more alarming realization for some is that only 5% of the housing units in Nigeria were financed with a mortgage, with the majority of Nigerians relying on their private savings to purchase or build homes as a result of several factors, with the most important being the lack of affordable financing. This presents not only a negative effect on the demand for housing in Nigeria but also challenges to property developers who may have hopes to raise finance for their investments. There are, however, ways of overcoming such challenges as we can see from the actions of notable property developers in Nigeria who utilize cost-saving methods such as building on demand (selling all housing units before building them) (Aluko &amp; Amidu, 2005).</p> <p>Doing business in Africa is rarely easy. What may be daunting about the business challenges of Africa are not that they are impossible to overcome but rather that they are more distinct and seemingly greater than the challenges presented in other regions of the developing world. This should not overshadow the golden opportunities and rewards that the tenacious and persistent would perhaps gain. Difficulty is merely opportunity in disguise</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The Nigerian property market in spite of its size and robustness appears not to have elicited commensurate attention from international investors. It has only recently managed to receive no more than a glimpse of industry based reviews and perhaps a handful of academic research which practice is even rarely sustained. It would appear that it may have been considered to have a lot of challenges; yet no empirical study has been conducted to date on the Nigerian property market to reveal its state as has been done for similar property markets elsewhere. Consequently, investor perception about the market will remain hinged on myths rather than empirical evidence (Lim, et al. 2006).</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the prospects of the Nigeria property market.</p> <p>2.  To identify the challenges of the Nigerian property market.</p> <p>3.  To investigate the present state of the Nigerian property market.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What are the prospects of the Nigeria property market?</p> <p>2.  What are the challenges of the Nigerian property market?</p> <p>3.  What is the present state of the Nigerian property market?</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  This study will educate the general public especially the investors of the present state of the Nigerian property market with a view of identifying the prospects and challenges.</p> <p>2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on the Nigeria property market; prospects in the midst of challenges will cover the state of the Nigeria property market to identify the challenges therein with a view of analyzing the prospects.</p> <p><b>LIMITATION OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>Financial constraint</b>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p> <b>Time constraint</b>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

The site of building collapse scattered across the length and breadth of Nigeria is quite alarming that it is unimaginable what effects it will have on the building industry and Nigeria economy as a whole. One could imagine what edifices these buildings would have been if only they were constructed accordingly. It has been reported that Nigeria, especially Lagos State has become the “world’s junk-yard” of collapsed buildings worth billions of naira (Famoroti, 2005). It is quite unimaginable that a county blessed with so great potentials in its construction industry can experience such magnitude of building collapse Fadamiro in 2002 defined building as “an enclosure for spaces designed for specific use, meant to control local climate, distribute services and evacuate waste”. Buildings can be defined as structural entities capable of securing self by transmitting weights to the ground. More so, buildings are defined “as structures for human activities, which must be safe for the occupants”(Odulami, 2002). However, these same buildings have been posing treats and dangers to people either during or after construction as a result of its collapse. Collapse as a whole occurs when part or whole body of a structure fails and suddenly gives way, the structure, as a result of this failure, could not meet the purpose for which it was meant for. Building collapse is an extreme case of building failure. It means the super-structure crashes down totally or partially (Arilesere, 2002). Building failure occurs when there is a defect in one or more elements of the building caused by inability of the material making up the components of such building elements to perform its original function effectively, which may finally lead to building collapse. Buildings are meant to provide conveniences and shelter to the people, but the same building has been a danger trap to the same people. Building is expected to meet certain basic requirements such as buildability, design performance, cost effectiveness, quality, safety and timely completion (Olusola, Atta &amp; Ayangade, 2002). Generally, buildings are expected to be elegant and functional but many projects are constructed that do not meet any of these basic requirements. The recurring incidence of building collapse, some of which claimed innocent lives is a consequence of this. Many studies has been carried out and various workshops organized in major cities of the country by various bodies, government agencies and institution in order to look into causes of the incidence of building collapse in Nigeria, but none has been able to come out with how each of the determined factors directly lead to building collapse in the country. There are many factors that cause building collapse in Nigeria and they are structural design and quality management according to Olusola (2002).The quality management entails material variability, testing variability, judgment factor, contractors’ variability, poorly skilled workmen and unprofessional conduct. The study aimed at examining the cases of residential building collapse in Nigeria with a view of identifying the causes, effect and solution.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Building collapse is a defect or imperfection, deficiency or fault in a building element or component. It may also be as a result of omission of performance. The degree of building collapse can therefore be related to the extent or degree of deviation of a building from the “as – built” state which is in most cases represent the acceptable standard within the neighborhood, locality, state or country. (Ikpo, 1998). However, building collapse can simply be defined as a total or partial/progressive failure of one or more components of a building leading to the inability of the building to perform its principal function of comfort, satisfaction, safety and stability. The incessant buildings collapse in Nigeria has become a great concern to all the stakeholders – the professionals in building industry, government, private developers, clients and users, as well as the neighborhood residents. Fall out of the researcher’s concern about the increasing incidents of collapse building nation-wide form the basis for this study to find out the major causes, effects and probable remedial measures to collapse of buildings in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the causes of building collapse in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To identify the effects of building collapse in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.  To identify the remedial measures or approaches to building collapse in Nigeria</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What are the causes of building collapse in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.  What are the effects of building collapse in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  What are the remedial measures or approaches to building collapse in Nigeria?</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  The outcome of this study will educate the general public and the government of the day on the causes, effect and solutions to the cases of building collapse in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on residential building collapse in Nigeria with careful examination of the causes and the effects with a view of finding a lasting solution to the issue of incessant building collapse in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>LIMITATION OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>Financial constraint</b>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p> <b>Time constraint</b>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

Housing is seen as one of the best indicators of a person’s standard of living and of his or her place in society (UNCHS, 1993). Housing and building conditions also reflect the living standards of a society (Venkatarama, 2004). Thus, the importance of access to adequate and affordable housing took the front burner in the mid 20th century. Most Nigerian don’t have access to decent housing units due to the cost occasioned by the cost of building materials. This has led to various researches into development of the new and innovative dry construction techniques to enhance access to housing for all.</p> <p>The new construction technology which is based on dry construction system which are manufactured from cement, quartz sand, cellulose, natural calcium and water, are processed by autoclave (drying process under high pressure and temperature) for durability and dimensional stability. They are manufactured into boards. The boards which come in various sizes and thicknesses between 6mm and 20mm, are manufactured under strict quality control and international standards.</p> <p>Describing the dry construction system as a modern building system which tends to translate the building process into an industrial process, Le (2014) said the system is more versatile and faster construction method that allows up to 70 per cent construction time saving possible when compared with the traditional wet construction using bricks and blocks. He added that whatever the design idea the Architect can conceive, the dry construction system can achieve, pointing out that various reference building projects using the boards now abound in Nigeria.</p> <p>This system, unlike the traditional brick and block method requires minimum use of water. The system generates minimum construction waste and dry construction buildings have much better preserve room temperature and they are energy efficient. The use of timber associated with the traditional construction is avoided with dry construction, and the system impacts positively on reducing deforestation.</p> <p>Lower dry construction load impacts on minimum excavation, less soil disturbance. The system compliments better the green building idea for modern construction world over. In additional, the system is a lightweight construction. It is about 10 times less in weight compared to equivalent blocks and mortar construction, resulting to savings in foundation and structural costs.</p> <p>Dry construction for eave solution has also proved to be a much viable solution with lower self-weight, faster and better technical finishes. Dry construction building boards have a high fire resistance rating and good acoustic and thermal properties. It is also a moisture and pest resistance solution. Explaining that skill-gap is a major challenge for dry construction, Le (2014) noted that some companies in Nigeria who are in partnership with other stakeholders with skills in dry construction technology to put in motion machinery for skill acquisition with regular trainings to ensure the technology is domicile with the Nigerian populace, adding that customers’ perception is another challenge to address, while efforts are in top gear towards continuous education about the modern system of building.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Various researchers are of the opinion that with the demand for housing in Nigeria growing at a geometric rate while housing provision is at arithmetic rate, there is obvious need to evolve a more practical method of achieving mass housing development in the country. Dry construction presents an excellent opportunity to government at all levels and the primary mortgage institutions to guarantee speedy provision of mass and affordable housing in Nigeria. The researcher is of the view that dry construction technology will provide for building professionals and contractors a viable alternative to the traditional wet construction method with blocks and bricks and concrete. However, this study will examine the role of dry construction in ensuring affordable housing in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the role of dry construction in ensuring affordable houses in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To examine the process involved in dry construction system.</p> <p>3.  To determine the factor limiting the use of dry construction system for building development in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What is the role of dry construction in ensuring affordable houses in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.  What is the process involved in dry construction system?</p> <p>3.  What are the factors limiting the use of dry construction system for building development in Nigeria?</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>HO: Dry construction system cannot be use as a means for the provision of affordable houses for Nigerian.</p> <p>HA: Dry construction system can be used as a means for the provision of affordable houses for Nigerian.</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  The outcome of this study will educate professionals in building technology and other stakeholders in the building industry on the need for active innovative development with the use of dry construction system with the view of ensuring the provision of affordable houses for Nigerians.</p> <p>2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study on the role of dry construction in ensuring affordable houses in Nigeria will cover all the process involved in the use of dry construction system with a view of determining approaches that can be adopted in the delivery of sustainable mass housing for Nigerians.</p> <p><b>LIMITATION OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>Financial constraint</b>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p> <b>Time constraint</b>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

Its provision has always been of great necessity to man. </p> <p>        As a unit of the environment housing has profound influence on the health, efficiency, social behaviour, satisfaction and general welfare of the community. It is a reflection of the cultural, social and economic values of a society and one of the best historical evidences of the civilization of a country (Olotuah, 2000).<br/><br/></p> <p>        The provision of adequate housing in any country is very vital as housing is a stimulant of the national economy. Housing is a set of durable assets, which accounts for a high proportion of a country’s wealth and on which households spend a substantial part of their income. It is for these reasons that housing has become a regular feature in economic, social and political debates often with highly charged emotional contents (Agbola, 1998).</p> <p><br/>         In Nigeria, like in many other developing nations of the world housing problems are multi dimensional. The problems of population explosion, continuous influx of people from the rural to the urban centres, and the lack of basic infrastructure required for good standard of living have compounded housing problems over the years. Access to this basic need by the poor who constitute the largest percentage of the world population has remained a mirage and it needs to be critically addressed. Ogieto (1987) has observed that the disparity between the price and quantity of housing on the one hand, and the number of households and the money available to them to pay these prices on the other, constitutes the central problem of housing. The cost at which houses reach the market goes a long way to determine affordability. Where the unit cost of houses is abnormally high only a few people are able to afford the houses. According to Okupe and Windapo (2000) the gap between income and shelter cost in Nigeria is very wide. </p> <p>This has almost eliminated the low-income earners from the housing market, The research intends to provide an assessment of  the delivery of low income housing in Nigeria ;its prospect and challenges</p> <p></p> <p><b>CHAPTER 1</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1       </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Shortage of adequate housing virtually abounds in every country, particularly in the developing and third world countries. The shortage, in both quantitative and qualitative terms, is more acute in the urban centres. Omojinmi (2000) observed that people that sleep in indecent houses in urban Nigeria are more than people who sleep in decent houses. Thus, it is assertive that there is inadequacy in housing to cope with the ever-increasing population in Nigeria (Arayela, 2003). The causes of this dearth in housing are numerous.  High construction cost is found to be present in all countries, albeit in varying degrees of significance (Adedeji, 2007).  Afolayan (1987) attributes the high cost of construction to rising cost of building materials, inflation rate in the economy, high space and quality standard adopted by designers, professional fees for housing design and construction, excessive profit of contractors and 10% interest payable on National Housing Fund in Nigeria (NHF).Cases of high cost of housing compared to the low salaries of civil servants in Nigeria could be seen in the sale of 2-bedroom bungalows at Otedola Estate in Lagos, which according to LSG (1999) was the cheapest obtainable and the subsequent sale of 2-bedroom flat at Ikorodu by LSDPC (Lagos State Development and Property Corporation) at N1.7 Million.

National Housing Fund provided that 2.5% of the income of workers be paid to the fund as mandatory savings. </p> <p></p> <p>LOW INCOME EARNERS DEFINED</p> <p>The Nigerian National Housing Policy (FGN, 2004) defines the low-income group as all employees and self-employed persons whose annual income is N100, 000:00 and below (i.e. the equivalent of salary grade level of 01-06 within the civil service). Interestingly, the national minimum wage is N44, 000. 00 per annum. About fifty-seven percent (57%) of the Nigerian population falls below the poverty line, which is on the average of US$1 per day (Wahab, 2006). In reality, most employees who work outside the public sector or outside the organized private sector, as well as many self-employed Nigerians earn well below the national minimum wage. </p>\n\nDELIVERY OF LOW INCOME HOUSING IN NIGERIA PROSPECTS AND CHALLENGES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DELIVERY OF LOW INCOME HOUSING IN NIGERIA PROSPECTS AND CHALLENGES", "id": 51}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><b>ISSUES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EXECUTION OF PUBLIC SECTOR HOUSING PROJECTS IN NIGERIA</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>        Housing (Shelter) is unarguably one of the basic necessities of man. It used to be ranked second after food in the hierarchy of man’s needs but according to Ebie (2009) it is the first and most important of all rights. According to him, because of the importance attached to housing and coupled with the fact that housing in all its ramifications is more than mere shelter, then, execution of public sector housing embraces all social services and utilities that go to make a community or neighbourhood a livable environment, this is now a right in Nigeria. This position is reinforced by section 16(1)(d) of 1999 constitution under the Fundamental Objectives of State Policy which compels the Nigerian State “to provide suitable and adequate shelter for all citizens” Even though this provision is not actionable, it reinforces the call for public sector driven mass housing provision in Nigeria. Housing being a right entails that all strata of a society including the less privileged members of the society, the old, the disadvantaged, the wondering psychotics should own or have access to decent, safe and sanitary housing accommodation at affordable disposal prices or rental with secure tenure.</p> <p>        Unfortunately the reverse is the case as in spite of the policies, institutions and regulations which various Nigerian Governments have put in place since independence; there is still dearth of housing for low income segment. A recent study of housing situation in Nigeria put existing housing stock at 23 per 1000 inhabitant. Housing deficit is put at 15 million housing units (Mabogunje, 2007) while 12 trillion naira will be required to finance the deficit. This is about 4 times the annual budget of Nigeria (FHA, 2007). Housing is of supreme importance to man and one of the best indicators of a person’s standard of living and his place in society. However, at no point has it been adequately supplied either quantitatively or qualitatively (Jiboye 2009; Omoniyi &amp; Jiboye, 2011). Over time, the need for adequate shelter has continued to attract global attention especially in developing countries where the urbanization process has been growing at an alarming rate. The phenomenal rise in population, increase in number and size of most cities in the past decades have led to acute shortage of adequate dwelling units in many urban centres globally (Jiboye, 2009).</p> <p>Consequently, in recent time, the issue of housing has formed part of the major discussion in several global summits such as the 1992 Rio-de Janeiro summit on environment and development, the 1996 Habitat summit at Istanbul, the 2000 New York, United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGS) summit, 2002 World Summit in Johannesburg and the 2005 La Havana, UN sustainable Cities Documentation of Experience Programme (Oladunjoye, 2005; UN-Habitat, 2007; UNDPI, 2008).</p> <p>        Nigeria, like other developing countries is saddled with uncontrollable growth of the urban population caused by lack of provision of infrastructural facilities and poor economic conditions in the rural areas. The proportion of the Nigerian population living in urban centres has increased phenomenally from 7% in the 1930s, 10% in 1950, 20% in 1970, 27% in 1980 to 35% in 1990</p> <p>(Okupe, 2002). Over 40% of Nigerians now live in urban centres of varying sizes. The incidence of this population in urban centres has created severe housing problems, resulting in overcrowding in inadequate dwellings, and in a situation in which 60% of Nigerians can be said to be “houseless persons” (Federal Government of Nigeria, 2004).</p> <p>        Besides the incidence of overcrowding in the existing housing stock, rural-urban drift has occasioned the sprouting of make shift dwellings or squatter settlements in cities that are devoid of minimum structural and normative quality. Majority of the houses are constructed with all sorts of refuse/second-hand materials in illegally occupied self allocated land, they are badly maintained and lack the basic necessities of life like sanitary facilities, light, air and privacy. As evidenced by past researches in housing studies, most urban centres in the country are characterized by high density buildings, acute sanitary problems, pollution of air, surface water, noise and solid wastes (Filani, 1987, Agbola, 1998). According to Olotuah (2002) estimated 2.3 million urban dwelling units are substandard, only 33% of urban houses can be considered to be physically sound, and 44% and 19% require minor and major repairs respectively to bring them to normative and structural quality. Despite all efforts of the government at achieving sustained housing delivery to the common people, existing realities indicate the goal is far from being achieved. It is against this background that this research examines the major issues and challenges of execution of public sector housing in Nigeria with a view to stimulating relevant agencies of government and other stakeholders into designing appropriate strategies for effective execution of public sector housing in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>        In many developing countries, including Nigeria, urban housing crisis is escalating unabated despite a number of new policies, programs and strategies being engaged in by public and private sectors aimed at execution of public sector housing in addressing this problem (Okupe, 2002). Since execution of public sector housing is principally carried out by government agencies and their collaborators, the researcher argues that one vital step to addressing myriads of issues and challenges in execution of public sector housing in Nigeria is to identify areas of weakness in public housing agencies and subsequently address such weakness for enhanced productivity (Jiboye, 2009). It is for this reason that the study investigated the contextual and organizational challenges related to execution of public sector housing in Nigeria in the post independence era. </p> <p>This study attempted at using key organizational components to assess areas of challenges in execution of public sector housing among government agencies in the study area. This is with a view to assisting public-sector housing policy makers and program managers chart future pathways for improved performance in public housing provision and management in Nigeria.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The general objective of this research is to analyze the issues and challenges in the execution of public sector housing in Nigeria while the following are the specific objectives:</p> <p>1.  To examine the challenges of execution of public sector housing in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To ascertain the factors causing housing challenges in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.  To determine the solution to the issues of execution of public sector housing in Nigeria.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What are the issues and challenges in execution of public sector housing in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.  What are the factors causing housing challenges in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  What are the solutions to the issues of execution of public sector housing in Nigeria?</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  Outcome of this study will educate stakeholders in housing development and the general public on the issues and challenges of execution of public sector housing in Nigeria thereby making the study very useful as a guide to policy makers in government.

Good tenant employee relations back-up by a comprehensive tenancy agreement and timely payment of rents are required for a cordial relationship to exist between the landlord and to also boost tenant satisfaction. Tenant relations generally deal with avoiding and resolving issues concerning residents living in a landed property. These issues may relate to house rents, tenancy agreements, and may result in conflicts if not properly managed (Salleh. 2008).  </p> <p></p> <p>The relationship of landlord and tenant may be defined as the relationship that exists between parties to a lease. It usually arises when the owner of an estate grants, usually by means of contract, the right to possession of his land or part of it, to another person to hold for a specific period of time. Such a grant is what is called a lease, demise or tenancy. The period granted is the term or term of years.</p> <p>This relationship is one of tenure which means that it is for a period which is either subject to definite limits. As a rule, the landlord confers on the tenant the right to exclusive possession for a period which is subject to a definite time limit, as in the cases of a lease for a term of years, or which though indefinite can be made subject to a definite limit by either party as in the case of a tenancy from year to year (Mohd, 2000).</p> <p></p> <p>The relationship between tenants and landlords In Nigeria has reached a very significant stage in the modern day society in Nigeria, thus there is a need to know and review the effect of the relationship between the landlord and the tenant on residential properties. Reviewing this, also, it is important for us to know the position as it exists between tenant and landlord in residential buildings prior to the legal evaluation of tenancy Law in Nigeria. More importantly, it is also desirable for each party to know their right as guaranteed under the various applicable laws on the subject matter. This will ensure a peaceful co-existence between tenants and landlords in residential buildings. </p> <p></p> <p>However, this work focuses on the evolution and development of tenancy law in Nigeria, with particular reference to the rent Control and Residential Premises Edict, Law of Anambra State Nigeria 1994. The orientation of the course is strongly practical to suit the relationships that co-exist between a tenant and landlord in Nigeria. It will also examine the various perspective that relates to tenancy such as standard rent payable by the tenants, the rent review clause, option to review clause, rent book distress for rent, profit. Further the course will also examine the compensation available for the use and occupation of the demised premises by the tenant consequent upon the termination of his tenancy. It will also examine security of tenure and grounds for possession as contained under Schedule II of the rent control and</p> <p>Recovery of Residential Premises Edict, Laws of Ifite, Anambra State of Nigeria 1994.</p> <p>A lease establishes the relationship of landlord and tenant and is both a conveyance of a possessory estate in real property and a contract between the parties. Through the lease, the tenant receives a right to legal possession of the property in exchange for \"valuable consideration\" (i.e., rent) paid to the landlord. Most leases specify the duration of the agreement, any terms for extending the agreement and details regarding rent payments. Because a lease is both a conveyance and a contract, two sets of duties between the landlord and tenant arise: those that exist in relation to residential property laws, and those that arise due to the contractual promises of the lease. </p> <p>Housing codes were established to ensure that residential rental units were habitable at the time of rental and during the tenancy. In Ifite, housing violation of these rules may lead to eviction action or to the tenant being allowed to withhold rent in some cases. The right to access of a residential property is also ensured by warranties which are prescribed by common and/or statutory law. A breach of the warranty of habitability or a covenant within the lease may cause an eviction or allow the tenant to withhold rent. </p> <p>So long as these obligations are not met by either party, this could be breach on this relationship that is binding by factors dependent on obligation to be fulfilled by the landlord and the tenant on his property.</p> <p><b>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The management of public housing by many estate owners, landlords and caretakers in most developing countries, including Nigeria is often bedeviled by poor maintenance, high rentals and more often than not, tenants are unsatisfied with their dwelling units. These factors plus poor or no tenancy agreements between landlords and tenants contribute towards the general decline of public housing (Hegedus &amp; Mark, 2004). </p> <p></p> <p>Drafting of a comprehensive tenancy agreement requires the services of a competent lawyer, who will concisely spell out the duties and responsibilities of both the landlord and the tenant is sometimes ignored by some landlords or not drafted at all. In the absence of a comprehensive tenancy agreement, conflict and soar relationship between the landlord and the tenant my arise, when one party is not satisfied with the conduct of the other. </p> <p></p> <p>The resultant derelict state of public housing sadly also incubates high vandalism rates which in turn further contribute to the high maintenance cost of residential properties. British researcher Sheena Wilson (1979) asserts that it is often difficult to distinguish intentional forms of damage from wear and tear, indifference, neglect and thoughtlessness in public housing estates. Vandalism in such neighbourhoods therefore, is part of a spectrum of behaviour which begins with very common forms of carelessness such as dropping litter, and continues through a wide range of rough handling—bumping prams into glass swing doors, taking short cuts through newly planted flower beds, for example—to the stage where damage is deliberate: glass broken by stray objects such as stones when children are playing, smashed fittings, and dismantled fire-hoses. These are typical features in public housing owing to various factors. </p> <p></p> <p>From previous research works, it has become clear that non fulfilment of obligations binding on relationships can have a drastic effect. For there to be a proper conveyance of title or right to occupy in the case of a residential property by a landlord to a tenant, there are obligations binding on both parties that must be met (Basorun, 2012). </p> <p>This binding factor which is called ‘rent’ on the part of the tenant has a bigger effect as to whether it will last long or not. On the part of the landlord is the obligation to lease or withhold the property. Rent as a determinant in this relationship can be a constraint due to a survey conducted in 2011 by Dele Taiwo Associates an Estate Management firm with offices round Nigeria.</p> <p>There are challenges posed by these factors. Challenges such as eviction, withholding of a right to legal habitation of the property in exchange for \"valuable consideration\" (i.e., rent) paid to the landlord, has affected the relationship between the landlord and the tenant for various reasons ranging from non communication of position by the landlord in case of renovations or nonpayment of rent as at when due by the tenant. Most tenants especially in residential properties ignore their obligation to pay utility bills and other bills binding on them by virtue of occupying the property. All these have played a huge role in affecting the relationship between the landlord and the tenant especially in Ifite.</p> <p><b>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The main aim of the study is to critically examine the effects of landlord and tenant relationship on residential property. Specific objectives of the study are:</p> <p>1.     To examine the extent in which landlord and tenant relationship could improve residential properties in Ife Te Anambra.</p> <p>2.     To examine factors that has militated against cordial relationship between landlord and tenants.</p> <p>3.     To propose ways of improving landlord and tenant relationship as to better residential property.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>In-order to guide the study and achieve stated objectives for the study, the following research questions were formulated:</p> <p>1.     To what extent can landlord-tenant relationships affect residential properties?</p> <p>2.     What factors militate against the cordial relationship between landlords and tenants?</p> <p>3.     What better ways can landlord-tenant relationships be enhanced?</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>Ho</b>: Landlord and Tenant relationship has no significant effect on residential property.</p> <p><b>Hi</b>: Landlord and Tenant relationship has significant effect on residential property.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Public housing although critical and inevitable in facilitating access to decent housing for the low income earners like students especially in cities and urban areas, should not be taken seriously. If landlord and tenant relationship is adequately managed, public housing is capable of supplementing the inadequacies of market driven housing delivery systems and delivering a more inclusive society. The management of public housing cannot be feasible if rent collection and other residential or tenancy agreements are not properly documented and effected. A functional rent collection and management system can be an integral component of a responsive policy platform that facilitates sustainable delivery and management of public housing. </p> <p>This study will therefore greatly contribute towards improving Landlord and tenant relationships and proffer solutions to most landlord-tenant disagreements and conflicts.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.7 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The study is limited to the effects of landlord and tenant relationship on residential property in Ifete, Anambra state, using selected residents of school hostels as a case study. </p> <p>Concerning, limitations, time frame and financial constraints are usually the major constraints of every research study.

</strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>As far a real estate is concerned, value goes with the same economic laws as values of other goods and services. Therefore, value of real estate relates its basis to the law of demand and supply just as price of commodity in the market. The other underlining factors that guide residential property market in the study shall also be highlighted. Value is the worth of and article in exchange. The money worth that will accrue to the lesser will be and inverse function of the value of demand, long time age especially in the days of oil boom, the property market of the area was dull because people prefer to build than to let or lease because building cost was cheap. But, in the decade the property market of the study area has experienced gradual changes in rental value.</p> <p>The nature of this change is the focus of this project, the concept of values of property factors affecting property values and some other related topics will be treated</p> <p>Various factors that can being about changes in residential property values and a graphical representation was made which showed a monumental changes in their rental values when compared the present year.</p> <p>Osun became state in August 27th 1991 in the sixth year anniversary broadcasting of President Ibrahim Babaginda. The state was one of the Nigeria new states created in 1991 others are Abia state, Kebbi state, Kogi state, Delta state, Jigawa state, Enugu state, Yobe state and Taraba state. Before this time, the state was part of old western Region and later became part of the Old Oyo state before it finally became a state today. Most of the towns and villages in Osun State of today are as the country itself</p> <p>The state capital is Osogbo with a total number of thirty local government councils. Among the major towns in Osun state are Osogbo, Ilesah, Ile-Ife, Ede, Ilaorangun and Egigbo among others. The state has a total land of 86002 square kilometers and share boundary with Kwara in the North. Oyo in the west, Ogun and Ondo in the South and Ekiti in the East.</p> <p>The national figure of 1991 put the state population as 1,144,907 Male and 1,193,663 Female. With the population density of 233 and in 2006, the total population is 3,423,535 with the population density of 379 and the current population density is 4,000,000.</p> <p>Before the inception as the state capital does not harbor much number of people but since the inception as the state capital the number of people increased and many environment, economics and development changes occurred hence, the introduction of banks and industries spring up which lead to the growth and expansion of the state, the rental value increases to a great change to the physical and economic activities in Osun State. The state was blessed with abundant deposited of natural resources such as Gold, Clay, Limestone and Granite.</p> <p>The state expansion of tropical climate while the local natural vegetation is the lowland rainforest types.</p> <p>Owa Laorooye (Laro) and Oguntimehin (Timehin) both co-founders came from Ipole, the original homestead of the earliest settlers, around 1650 and 1700.</p> <p>Timehin was a great hunter. He had mad e several expeditions to the Osun forest during which he discovered Osun River whose water never dried throughout the year. The presence of Osun River and other physical features of the area impressed Timehin. Back at Ipole (located some 12 kilometers from Osun River and which had been experiencing acute water shortage), he informed Owa Laorroye of his adventure, discovery and conviction that if they shifted their abode to the area, the problem of water shortage would be solved. After due consideration, Laro, Timehin and their people left Ipole to settle along Osun River.</p> <p>            Legend has it that when a tree fell into the historic River, a voice complained and pleaded. Spirit of the forest you have broken all my dyeing pois move power from here so that you may prosper. Aro and Timehin were said to have replied in fear Osogobo ode o, which translate into the spirit of the forest sorry. The two men believed the voice to be that of the Osun goddess. From that day, the settlers called their abode Osogbo which was perfected to OSOGBO. The spot where Osun River is worshipped today was where Osogbo people first settled. Following the Osun goddess complaint and Advice, the first settlers Oba Larooye and Timehin and their people moved upwards as directed to where the first historic palace in Osogbo is now situated.</p> <p><strong>1.1         </strong><strong>AIM</strong> <strong>OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of study is to examine the trends in the rental value of residential properties since the creation of Osun state.</p> <p><strong>1.3       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <ol><li>To identify various factors that responsible for trends in rental value of residential properties</li> <li>To examine the rental value of residential properties in the study area.</li> <li>to identify various problems militating against the performance of  residential properties in the study area.</li> <li>To make recommendations and conclusion.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4       JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In ascribing any rental value to any set of property the future level of productivity of the property have became a thing of significance. So one of the things to which the developers are most sensitive is the feature level of rental. A small amount of the balance in prediction can have great effect in the success or failure of a project. This as a guide to viability of a development scheme, it is important that feature levels of income generated from the property must be highly granted.</p> <p>In doing this, decision which affects the feature has to be taken into consideration. But before this can be done, it is necessary to make allowance for condition that would show ahead. Since current rental on investment as mainly aims at meeting feature needs of the owner.</p> <p>Residential property in its nature is more or less dynamic thus a study of past trends of the property in the market would serve as a useful guidelines to the whole state be it investors. This enable public as well as private developer know how their scheme fit into future development of the sub-growing urban area as a whole.</p> <p>The study of trends of property values most especially residential property is of great importance to the estate management profession. An understanding of trends on property value is great importance for their being assessment purpose or valuation.</p> <p>This is because it provides a good guide and it can be used for projecting such things as revenue generation, either for the state or local government. An understanding of the trends in rental value of a property, particularly residential property, in most cases it can also be used to determines the capital value of the property in the nearest future and also the actual rent to be taken by the landlord, could be determined if an accurate trend can be got.</p> <p><strong>1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Basically, the project propose to examine the trends in rental value of residential property within the state. Although the estate belongs to the Government which ahs vested interest into the individuals who developed the respective property. The respective landlords who pay the corporation an annual ground rent now lets out their property for over years</p> <p>In this project a critical examination will being made on the responsible factors and forces causing changes in rental value of residential properties.</p> <p><strong>1.6       RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>During the course of this study, data and other important materials were collected in the following ways,</p> <ol><li>Reference to relevant books and journals</li> <li>Oral interview in connection with the study was carried out within the study area.</li> <li>Field survey of the study area.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.7       LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The major problem we encountered was that Osogbo is a large area with many estate surveyor and value firm, location at relating short distance from each other as had to result to trekking from one firm to another and also some of the estate surveyors and values were not willing to answer the oral interview conducted because of their tight schedules.</p>\n\nTRENDS IN RENTAL VALUE OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY IN AN EMERGING STATE CAPITAL.

Analysts, however, underscore the need for the government to provide a good working environment especially in the area of decent accommodation for the military so as to facilitate its efforts to give quality service delivery (Adeniyi, 2004).</p> <p>It has been observed all over the country that most of the barracks of the armed forces are currently in a derelict state, while several soldiers are not quartered in barracks. This is not to suggest that the Federal Government of Nigeria has not been mindful of the accommodation needs of the armed forces, as it has initiated some interventionist measures to ensure the soldiers’ wellbeing. For instance, former President Olusegun Obasanjo inaugurated the Presidential Committee on Barracks Rehabilitation (PCBR) in 2001 to oversee efforts to rehabilitate military barracks across the country (Vanguard, 2011).</p> <p>Housing has been recognized to be in the same category with air, food and clothing as a basic necessity of life (Okpala, 1985). It’s basic function is to protect man against the weather and to guarantee him some security against marauders. Housing is one of the major problems facing the Nigerian military. Housing problem has been a general problem in all government parastatals in Nigeria because of the high level of corruption and embezzlement of allocated funds coupled with poor implementation of the housing policies for the military personnel (Adeniyi, 2004). Various governments at Federal and State level have in the past made efforts of improving the housing situation in the military Barracks. The low-income group to which most soldiers belong is the most hard-hit by the shortage of housing. The shortage of housing persists despite the various government efforts because the supply is far short of housing needs (Ogunshakin and Olayiwola, 1992). Housing programmes targeted at the low-income group of soldiers invariably end up with the rich senior officers because of the autocratic nature of the profession.</p> <p>Military barracks across the country are in dire need of rehabilitation and in many cases lack enough accommodation for soldiers in spite of the yearly budgets of billions for barracks repairs, (Daily Trust, 18th March 2015). Daily trust (2015) also revealed that military barracks in Lagos, Kaduna, Kano, Bauchi and other places are characterized with many buildings that are in a state of disrepair, with broken doors, windows and leaking roofs.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The problem of insufficient housing and accommodation to military personnel is primarily that of a crisis situation, manifesting and expressing itself in quantitative and qualitative forms.

The demands for arable land, grazing, forestry, wildlife, tourism and property development are greater than the land resources available (Ratcliff, 1999). In the developing countries including Nigeria, these demands become more pressing every year. The population dependent on the land for food, fuel and employment will double within the next 25 to 50 years. Even where land is still plentiful, many people may have inadequate access to land or to the benefits from its use especially for property development.  Land must change to meet new demands yet change brings new conflicts between competing uses of the land and between the interests of individual land users and the common good.</p> <p>Land is a private property, its ownership and use is protected by the constitution (Farmer and Gibb, 1979). It is the free gift of nature to mankind. Every activity of man as of necessity takes place on land and as a result of increased activities there arose conflicts in different land uses. One land use tends to succeed another, where this is no control of such succession and use. Ratcliff (1999) states that succession of land use for its own sake is hardly desirable and change in advance of the appropriate time will only contribute to the inefficiency of the urban structure. He also argued that there are times when succession appear to lag behind the needs of the community, when actually, the fundamental factors that call for a readjustment of land uses are not present. Thus, the need for spatial ordering of land use with a view to creating functionally efficient and aesthetically pleasing environment for living, circulation and recreation, becomes imperative.</p> <p>The creation of a balanced land use system (urban equilibrium), that is, the provision of adequate land for the various land uses, consistent with the creation of functionally efficient physical environment, is the objective of the land use allocation. Land use allocation is to ensure the best utilization of land in the national interest, and to prevent individual land owners from using that land to the detriment of body politic (Lawal, 2000). There has been several concern in the recent times as to the procedure involves in the allocation of land for property development. It ranges from the high cost to the fraudulent activities attached to land for property development.</p> <p>This is inspite of their common law right to develop their land, as they like, provided they do not cause any nuisance or interfere with the rights of others. Land use allocation necessarily has to do with the siting of buildings and communication routes with objectives of achieving equilibrium between convenience, beauty and cost. According to Nwanekezie (2009), land use allocation determines where residential buildings and even new industries should be located, how raw materials can be transported to them, and their products distributed to market, where the employees should live, how they would get to work, where schools and other institutions should be situated.</p> <p>The basic principle of allocation is that adequate land should be set aside for each uses at the onset in appropriate locations pending the time they will be needed and or funds will be available for their provision or development. This is because it takes at least ten to twenty years to fully develop a residential neighborhood for instance, and it is not possible to provide at the initial stage of development all the facilities and services proposed in a layout plan even if money is not a constraint. Their provision of development is normally spread over time to keep peace with the development states of the neighbourhood.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Most cities in Nigeria and other developing countries were not planned (Nwanekezie, 2009). They started as villages or trade centres before increasing in size to a big city today. Such process of city growth has been marked with haphazard development, poor planning, urban sprawl and environmental degradation. Business districts often spill over into the surrounding residential and industrial areas. The variety of growth and changing pattern of land use found in different cities complicate the process of identifying simple principles that govern the allocation of land uses.</p> <p>Barlower (1978) states that urban land use allocation has been designed to promote the orderly development of the nations land resources, minimize certain problems and conflict associated with private use, foster the optimum development of the land resource base and maximize the public welfare. However, the major concern in this study is to assess the land use and allocation procedure for property development in Uyo Local Government Area.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To assess the procedure of land use allocation for property development in Uyo local government area.</p> <p>2.  To determine the effectiveness of the procedure of land use allocation in Uyo local government area.</p> <p>3.  To identify the factors militating against land use allocation procedure in Uyo local government area</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What is the procedure involved in land use allocation for property development in Uyo local government area?</p> <p>2.  What is the effectiveness of the procedure of land use allocation in Uyo local government area?</p> <p>3.  What are the factors militating against land use allocation procedure in Uyo local government area?</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  The outcome of this study will educate the general public on the essence of land use allocation and as well enlighten them on the effectiveness of the procedure to facilitate convenient property development process.</p> <p>2.  This research will be a contribution to the body of literature in the area of the effect of personality trait on student’s academic performance, thereby constituting the empirical literature for future research in the subject area.</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study will cover the procedure of land use allocation for property development in Uyo local government area.</p> <p><b>LIMITATION OF STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>Financial constraint</b>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p> <b>Time constraint</b>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

It typically characterizes technical structures such as housing, roads, bridges, tunnels, water supply, sewers, electrical grids, telecommunications, and so forth, and can be defined as \"the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable, sustain, or enhance societal living conditions. However, all these coupled together can bring about the provision of good and affordable housing (Nubi, 2003).</p> <p>Housing infrastructural provision refers to the bringing into existence of the basic amenities and services which must be in place for a particular activity or pursuit. However, no nation can boast of significant development or an enhanced economy without providing the basic infrastructures for the citizens’ well-being (Otegbulu &amp; Adewunmi, 2008).</p> <p>Provision of adequate infrastructural facilities is not taken for granted in developed countries; however, it remains a major challenge in developing countries, especially in Nigeria (Ajanlekoko, 2001). According to Yomi (2003), the problem of housing provision has become an everyday discussion in all quarters of the public and private services of the developing countries of Africa including Nigeria. It has become increasingly glaring that most of the urban population live in dehumanizing housing environment while those that have access to average housing do so at abnormal and outrageous cost. Different definitions have been ascribed by several authors to the word infrastructure. Infrastructural development is the provision of basic physical and organizational structures needed for the operation of a society like industries, buildings, roads, bridges, health services, governance and so on (Amis &amp; Kumar, 2000). It is the development of enterprise or the products, services and facilities necessary for an economy to function (Sulivan and Sheffrin, 2003).</p> <p>Infrastructures can be described generally as the set of interconnected structural elements that provide framework supporting an entire structure of development (Donald, 1974). It is an important term for judging a country, region or state’s and individual’s developments/status. Infrastructural development typically refers to the provision by government or other authorities the technical structures that support a society, such as roads, water supply, sewers, electrical national grids, telecommunications, and so forth (Fulmer, 2009). Amis and Kumar (2000) argued that infrastructure helps individuals cope with the different dimensions of poverty. It follows therefore, that whenever people are deprived of basic infrastructures, the result is impoverishment. It also follows that cities with the greatest number of poor people are those whose citizens lack infrastructure the most (Fox, 1994). Infrastructure development and housing provision are interwoven. Without infrastructures, housing cannot be provided and hence should be treated integrally (Otegbulu and Adewumi, 2008). An ideal neighbourhood should be provided with good roads, drainage networks, electricity and portable water supply, good waste management system and security which are all aimed to ensure conducive housing unit.</p> <p>The condition of these services in Nigeria towns and cities contradicts the principle of sustainability in housing provision. A sustainable housing development would not only have environment friendly and energy efficient buildings, it would also have access to employment, schools, shops, places of entertainment, primary health care, and it would be accessible by public transport.</p> <p>Adequate supply of housing has remained a mirage to all cadres of the society in Nigeria. Rapid growth in population creates demand pressure towards shelter and efficient supply and distribution of basic utilities and services for city dwellers. In most cities, the problem of housing is not only restricted to quantity but to the poor quality of available housing units. Hence, Infrastructural development play an invaluable role in housing; however things have gone from bad to worse especially in developing countries like Nigeria. Their arises a need thus for a research into the state of infrastructural provisions in housing provision, unraveling the present state of decline, its causalities and, the enactment of probable and sustainable solutions in the light of new technologies.</p> <p>One major aspect of Nigeria’s problem with respect to housing is the poor state of the infrastructures (Ajanlekoko, 2001). A major challenge to providing adequate housing is the lack of primary infrastructure, as roads, water, electricity, social amenities etc, which accounts for about 30 percent of housing costs. In most cases developers have to provide the infrastructures which in most cases falls short of the standards in terms of quality and quantity — as a means of cutting costs. </p> <p>Current finance for housing provision and infrastructural development is inadequate both in terms of capital resources and of lending policies and conditions compared with the types of income and borrowing capacity of the large majority of States in Nigeria.</p> <p>Lack of funds alone is not a root cause of poor infrastructural development and services. It is a symptom of more fundamental problems. These include instability, lack of confidence, distorted economic policies, and difficulties of governance. The mobilization of public and private funds of infrastructural development depends, in the long run, on the alleviation of these problems.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Literature on housing provision have tend to focus more on issues of policy, finance, and economics of housing provision, issues such as infrastructures are treated en-passant. However as the demand for quality housing is on the increase researchers are on the outlook for ways to present housing from a comprehensive perspective. The role of infrastructural development in housing provision cannot be overemphasized and should not be treated as a last minute consideration. The study aims at evaluating the effect of infrastructural development on provision of housing in Nigeria with a view to provide policy makers and other stake holders the required information needed to evaluate and review the effectiveness of policies and delivery strategies and also provide a framework for enforcing enacted guidelines in view of achieving sustainable developments in the housing sector thereby ascertaining the sustainability of the housing environment.</p> <p><b>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To examine the effect of infrastructural development on the provision of housing.</p> <p>2.  To examine the level of Nigeria government’s commitment towards infrastructural development in the country.</p> <p>3.  To examine the relationship between infrastructural development and provision of housing.</p> <p><b>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>1.  What is the effect of infrastructural development on the provision of housing?</p> <p>2.  What is the level of Nigeria government’s commitment towards infrastructural development in the country?</p> <p>3.  What is the relationship between infrastructural development and provision of housing?</p> <p><b>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>HO: There is no significant relationship between infrastructural development and provision of housing</p> <p>HA: There is significant relationship between infrastructural development and provision of housing</p> <p><b>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  The outcome of this study will educate the government and policy makers in Nigeria on the level of infrastructural development and provision of housing with a view of formulating and implementing policies that will ensure good housing and infrastructural development.</p> <p>2.  This research will be a contribution to the body of literature in the area of the effect of personality trait on student’s academic performance, thereby constituting the empirical literature for future research in the subject area.</p> <p><b>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>This study will cover the level of infrastructural development in Nigeria and its subsequent effect on the provision of affordable and conducive housing environment.</p> <p><b>Financial constraint</b>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p> <b>Time constraint</b>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

The houses inhabited by slum dwellers are mostly decrepit, overcrowded, in neighborhoods that are prone to flooding and beset with poor sanitation and shortage of potable water. Slums are easily formed in areas experiencing rapid urbanization without commensurate increase in the provision and maintenance of housing and infrastructure. Slums have been conceptualized as a group of buildings or an area characterized by overcrowding, deterioration, insanitary conditions, or absence of basic and essential facilities like potable water, drainage system, schools, health facilities, recreational grounds, post office, among others. Slums generate spontaneously and are in some cases, a direct result of the prevalence of poverty experienced by the inhabitants of cities (Olotuah, 2006). Slums, which are regarded as an element of urban decay, also result from congestion in overcrowded cities where poor immigrants seek to settle for just any available accommodation irrespective of quality. The overwhelming negatives notwithstanding, there are some positive aspects to slums. In recent years, some environmentalists and organizations such as the United Nations Population Fund suggested that despite the poor living conditions, slums are positive both environmentally and socially. Because slums are characterized by very high density of housing, its environmental impact is smaller than that of dispersed rural communities. Furthermore, the fertility rate of new slum dwellers is below the replacement rate; this mitigates dangers associated with overpopulation that results from manpower-intensive subsistence agriculture, and frees up arable land for the nature, or more efficient industrialized agriculture. Slum dwellers also appear to have vastly better opportunities for getting jobs, starting small businesses and climbing out of poverty than rural inhabitants (Akinyode, 1998). Nigeria is ranked as one of the countries with high slum prevalence. The proliferation of shanty dwellings, squatter settlements and slums in most of our cities in Nigeria including the cross rivers state which is the being focused on in this study. However, it has been asserted that the presence of slum increase the rate of crime in the area thereby affecting the value of the residential property (Omole, 2010). The prevalence of slum in Nigeria has significantly affected the value of residential properties in the affected areas. This value is determined by the prices of the residential property or by the value of rent per a period time that is collected on them. However, the researcher will find out the impact of slum on the value of residential property in Nigeria.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>        The process of urbanization which means specific changes in the distribution and structure of population as well as in a size and character of a settlement, their network or system, has many sided relationship with slums formation. The rapid rate of urbanization witnessed in the last century has produced more slums in the major cities of the world, particularly in developing countries where thousands of rural people move into the major cities at large proportion. Presence have slum is believed to have been a major cause of organized crime in the society.

More than 50% of these facilities have over 20,000 students each. Nigerian universities have experienced a significant rise in student enrolments over the past decades. However, the surge in students has not been matched by a corresponding growth in student accommodation and the available ones have not been properly managed. Figures from the National Universities Commission show that the provision of student housing is less than 30% of demand. The vast majority of students live in privately rented accommodation.</p> <p>Bulk of “first generation” universities in Nigeria have stopped funding student accommodation. Many of the newer universities have taken the private sector participation route, although the quality of accommodation varies widely. The student enrolment in tertiary institutions is growing at an average of 12% per annum and the provision of new purpose-built student housing is limited. This in itself creates opportunities for the development of student housing in many cities in Nigeria.</p> <p>Akpan (2000) suggests that developers could partner with universities in build-operate-transfer arrangements on new accommodation. There are also opportunities for better management of existing accommodation. “While the majority of institutions may be reluctant to give up control, the deteriorating condition of the majority of university-owned halls of residence indicates the need to manage these assets in a different way.” Student accommodation should also have a strong focus on innovation and sustainability. “Developers need to be innovative in their approach to design, supplying functional accommodation, which incorporates the basic needs of students and provides additional facilities and services including laundry, internet services, relatively constant electricity, water supply, shuttle services, etc. The university community should be at the forefront of sustainability issues, this should be reflected in development and management (FRN, 2008).”</p> <p>Okoh (2004) added that in the future, the availability, quality and cost of student accommodation on offer will be a vital component for universities to lure good quality students. The increasing number of students in tertiary institutions in several Nigerian cities has caused serious accommodation problems and campus hostels can no longer cope with demand. Establishment of private hostels off-campus was initially perceived as a solution but landlords have taken advantage of the high demand by upping rentals and students are reeling under the financial burden. They have turned to the government for help.</p> <p>There has been steady growth in the student population in tertiary institutions, most of which have been expanding their teaching, administrative and research infrastructures. But no effort has been made to provide more accommodation for students and staff.<br/> This has allegedly been a deliberate resource allocation policy, with tertiary institutions - at the regional and national level - uninterested in committing funding to accommodation (Akpan, 1998).</p> <p>Many tertiary institutions possess large amounts of land on which student hostels could be built. But it is claimed that private sector figures on university governing councils have discouraged government investment in building campus residences. Critics say that owners of houses and land near campuses made proposals to university authorities to build cheap and affordable accommodation for students. According to reliable sources, some university officials obtained bank loans to build hostels that are operated under holdings whose owners are often their relatives.<br/> \"The reason for this strange policy is not far-fetched. Members of the property class who have invested in the construction of these hostels would naturally want their investment to yield dividends,\" explained Akpan (1998).</p> <p>Today students are having a rough time at the hands of hostel owners whose primary obsession, has been alleged, is to maximize profit with little concern for students' welfare. Students have also complained about the absence of a learning environment in private hostels. You get an impression that you are, at times, in a shopping mall when you enter most private hostels in Nigeria universities (Ubong, 2001). </p> <p>A portion of these hostels are transformed into mini markets with hawkers. At night and during the weekend the hostels are very noisy and movements in and out of the hostels are not restricted.<br/>However, the researcher will provide an overview on the problems and prospects of managing student hostel in Nigeria using University of Uyo Hostel as a case study.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Research into the management of student hostel in Nigeria universities has been on the front burner in recent times as steady growth in the student population in tertiary institutions which has created the need for expansion in infrastructures including accommodation facilities.

The evolution of off-campus student hostels occurred as a result of poor management of the school owned hostel accommodation. This development has not been able to eradicate the management challenges relating to student hostel.

Unlike other assets class, commercial properties are types of properties that are owned to generate income. It is heterogeneous, physically modifiable and segmented asset which is treated separately (Hendershott <em>et al.,</em> 2000).  It houses most locations where economic activities take place within an economy.  As an investment asset, it represents a means for accumulation of wealth by investors. According to Ibottson and Associates (2001), commercial properties and real estate constitute more than half of the economic wealth in the world.</p> <p>The economy of Jos has grown significantly well from an agrarian and tourism driven to a business oriented one. The property market of Jos is assumed to be doing well in the sense that property investments with reference to commercial properties in this area has become `particularly strong and generated huge capital profit to its owners. As commercial properties are important part of Jos landscape, which service both the business and financial aspects of the locality, it contributes immensely to the growth of real Gross Domestic Product (GDP).</p> <p>In addition, the office market has been given a lot of attention by most practitioners as compared to order sectors of property. This is because, the office market is usually seen to be well established with quite regular transactions over a long term and mostly has good geographical locations than some other property class (Higgins &amp; Valence, 2000).</p> <p>There is no particular place referred to as the real estate market due its characteristics. These property characteristics usually make it difficult for a uniform price to be fixed on properties of the same type even if they are located close to each other. The prices of commercial properties are often volatile due to the fact that they are determined by the market’s internal and external forces within which most property decisions are made. The yields from real property are arrived at by both internal and external factors such as gross domestic product, inflation, exchange rate and interest rate.</p> <p>There are a lot of risks involved in different asset class and inflation is said to be one of those threats which can affect the performance of commercial properties. (Bryan <em>et al.,</em> 1997) is of the view that inflation has to do with the increase in money supply in an economy which may be referred to as ‘monetary inflation’, as distinct from ‘price inflation’ which is an increase in the price of commodities in a country. In other words, the word inflation can simply be referred to any increase in the general level of prices which is sustained and non-seasonal in character. Problems can arise during inflation when we suddenly experience an unexpected inflation which is when the increase in prices of goods and services does not adequately match with the rise in individual’s personal income.</p> <p>The rent of every commercial property is regarded as a major cost to the lessee and an object of generating revenue to the lesser and it also shows the performance of the real estate market. Participants in this category of market such as developers use it as a measure of the viability of their investment. The inflation rate inherent in the nation’s economy is caused by both the endogenous and exogenous factors to the economy which has a direct effect on the property market. A good investor always want to put his money where it is guaranteed to a large extent so therefore they tend to invest in inflation-proof businesses such as the property investment. From the perspective of a tenant however, his major aim is to be able to afford his rent and still have something reasonable to take home as profit from the income he generates. Such is made possible if he enjoys a subsidized rent from his lease.</p><p> <strong>1.2       Statement of the Problem</strong> </p> <p>It is a reality that real estate investment now yields a lot of return from its sales and rental value which has encouraged lots of asset investors to go into real estate development. This has resulted in making many asset investors to develop more properties and also modify and beautify the already existing properties. Just like other developing countries, the Nigerian economy has also been experiencing a lot of changes in prices of its commodities, labour and service charge as a result of expected and unexpected inflation. In the light of this however, commercial property owners (landlords) extort their tenants by fixing rents arbitrarily without due consideration of the demand and supply factors.</p> <p>Nowadays, the way and rate commercial property rents are been reviewed is alarming. Adequate and comprehensive research needs to be carried out to properly consider the impact of inflation on the rental values of commercial properties in the study area and perhaps find a lasting solution to the stated problem.</p> <p>This research focuses on the extermination and assessment of the extent to which the changing inflation rate in the economy affects the rental values of commercial properties and to further determine whether commercial properties are good hedges against inflation in the study area.</p> <p> <strong>1.3       Aim and Objectives of the Study</strong> </p> <p>This study aimed at assessing inflation impact on the rental values of commercial properties in Jos, Plateau State from 1990 - 2014, while the objectives of the study are to:</p> <p>1. Examine the rental levels of commercial properties in the study area.</p> <p>2. Determine the variation in rents across commercial property (shops and offices) types in Jos, Plateau State from 1990 to 2014.</p> <p>3. Examine the trend of inflation rates in Nigeria over the study period.</p> <p>4. Examine the effect of inflation on rents of commercial properties in jos metropolis, from 1990 to 2014.</p><p> <strong>1.4       Research Questions</strong> </p> <p>1. What are the trends in rental value of commercial properties? Do commercial property rents vary across the study area?</p> <p>2. Is Treasury bill a good proxy for expected inflation?</p> <p>3. Does commercial property return hedges expected and unexpected inflation?</p><p> <strong>1.5       Research Hypothesis</strong> </p> <p><strong>Null hypothesis (H0):</strong> There is no statistical significant relationship between Unexpected Inflation rate and rental values of commercial properties (shops and offices) in Jos, Plateau State from 1990-2014.</p> <p><strong>Alternative hypothesis (H1):</strong> There is statistically significant relationship between Unexpected Inflation rate and rental values of commercial properties (shops and offices) in Jos, Plateau State from 1990 – 2014.</p><p> <strong>1.6       Scope of the Study</strong> </p> <p>This study is limited mainly to the impact of inflation on rental values of commercial properties in Jos Metropolis from 1990 to 2014. It is specifically limited to shop and office properties. This research work seeks to be limited to only shops and offices because, they are the most common types of commercial properties in the study area and more information can be gotten from them.</p> <p>To ensure that we arrive at a reasonable conclusion that can be generalized, Ajayi (2000) stated that a wide range of studies should be used as it can provide a strong basis for a thorough comparative analysis.</p><p> <strong>1.7       Significance of the Study</strong> </p> <p>This study will be of significant to the government and the various players in the Nigerian real estate sector as it assesses the impact of inflation on rental values of commercial properties in Jos. It would give us more information and facts on inflation and how it affects the rental values of commercial properties in the area of the study. Hence, exposing investors, estate surveyors and valuers to understand inflation better and how it impact on the rental value of commercial properties in Jos and Nigeria at large. In addition, it will also help in contributing to the wealth of knowledge established by other researchers in this area.</p><p> <strong>1.8 Limitation of the Study</strong> </p> <p>First of all this work was limited on the ground floor for shops and 1st floor for offices. Also I had some challenges during the course of data collection because some firms didn’t fill the complete questions while others did not even return the questionnaires.   </p><p> <strong>1.9 Geographical location of the Study Area</strong> </p> <p>Plateau State is situated in the North-central and the middle belt zone of Nigeria. It is lying between latitude 80°24'N and longitude 80°32' and 100°38' east. The northern part of the state is mostly rocky consisting of hills and lots of captivating rock formations. It is about 179 kilometres (111 miles) from Abuja, the nation's capital city. Jos is linked by road, rail and air to order parts of the country. At an altitude of 1,217 m (3,993 ft) above sea level and enjoys a more temperate climate than most part of the states in Nigeria with an average monthly temperature ranging from 21–25 °C (70–77 °F). This temperature is however different from mid-November to late January bringing about a night-time temperature drop to as low as 11 °C (52 °F), resulting in cool or cold nights. Owing to the cool high-altitude, the weather of Jos receives about 1,400 millimetres (55 inches) of rainfall annually arising from the precipitation due to the location of the city on the Jos Plateau.</p><p> <strong>1.10 P</strong><strong>opulation and</strong><strong> Economic base of the Study Area</strong> </p> <p>Plateau State is said to be a small Nigeria primarily because nearly all the languages of Nigeria are present there. There are more than 50 languages in Plateau state. These include: Berom, Ngas, Tarok, Alago, Goemai, Mada, Nwaghavul, Gbagyi, Eggan, Youn, Montol, Gwandara, Mapun, Chip, Rindre, Bagghom, Egbura, Hausa, Fulani, Kambari, Bassa, Afo, Fler, Taroh, Geomai, Fier, Bugi, Miship, Pyem, Challa, Ron-kulere, Afizere, Miango, Youm, Boggohom, Rukumba, Piapung, Kwalla, Montol, Jukun, Ninzam, Koro, Gade, Amo and so on.</p> <p>Plateau state is best known for its mining and agricultural activities of the peoples. Sorghum, maize, Acha (a grain known as “Hungary rice”) potatoes, cowpeas, rice, fruits, vegetables and millet are the main staple crops of the area. Plateau state is an important mining area in Nigeria and is known for its major export of tin and columbine. Plateau state can also be described as a state with lots of vocational jobs such as businesses and arts. It has high rate of commercial activities due to its weather which usually attracts people and investors. This can be seen by the existence of large industries such as coca-cola and Nasco Company.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p> <strong>1.11. TOURISM AND RELIGION</strong> </p> <p>Plateau State is known as <em>The Home of Peace and Tourism </em>with the following tourist attractions: Wildlife Safari park, Shere hills, National Museum, Assop falls, Kurra falls, Wase rock, Riyom rock and others.</p>\n\nIMPACT OF INFLATION ON RENTAL VALUES OF COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES IN JOS, NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF INFLATION ON RENTAL VALUES OF COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES IN JOS, NIGERIA", "id": 60}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><b>THE ACCURACY OF MORTGAGE VALUATION AS A LENDING REQUIREMENT FOR SELECTED BANKS IN KADUNA METROPOLIS</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>DEPARTMENT: ESTATE MANAGEMENT AND VALUATION</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.0     INTRODUCTION</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Landed property constitutes often major portions of company assets acceptable as collateral securities for corporate lending. According to Babawale et al (2013), real estate valuations are vital for financial institution, particularly banks, for no less than two reasons. First, valuations are frequently required during the underwriting or renegotiating of mortgage loan advances, where valuations ought to give a reasonable evaluation (future) market estimation of the property that will serve as collateral for loan. Second, valuations are required if the organization or bank needs an updated assessment of collateral values for outstanding loans it holds on its asset report. Moneylenders constantly require an exact appraisal of worth for every situation. This is on account of they have to realize that they can recover their credit by offering the property if the borrower defaults and they need to take ownership. The financial services authority likewise obliges lenders to guarantee that there is sufficient security for their credit by guaranteeing that the property is worth at any rate what is being loaned on it. Incidentally, the valuation additionally serves to ensure the borrower against unexpectedly borrowing more than their property is worth.</p> <p>Credit transaction between financial institution and investors grew to such an extent that securities such as shares and bonds, debenture, unit trust, Treasury bill, property are required as prerequisite for advancement of capital for whatever purpose the investor may require it for, since Investment have become a driving force of future income generation to individual, corporate organization and government as well, people are so eager to invest most especially In real estate but most of the investors are either having half of what they need to invest or not having at all which will lead to borrowing from financial institution, at this junction valuation is the only determinant of fair market value of the mortgage property which will serve as security for loan.</p> <p>Practically, finance sourcing is a major component of every investment programs. And the need to have tangible and sustainable collateral before capital advancement seems to be a big task to investors. Bonds, Treasury bill, shares and stocks were alternatives collateral securities required by mortgage debt provider before loan were advanced. But due to the insecurity of the collateral during default in loan payment, property is now regarded as better alternative since one of its many characteristics is hedge against inflation.</p> <p>Figures acquired during valuation activities are extremely critical to thevoperationsvand businessvdealingsvofvthe clients, vwrongvopinion ofvvaluevcan bringvaboutvstrainvin businessvdealings. vForvinstance, vdifferentvbanksvhavevsufferedvloss byvgrantingvloans in excessvofvactualvvalue, vandvnumerousvorganizationvproprietorsvhavevbeen persuaded that theyvwerevmaking benefitsvin resourcesvwhile really they were running at loss.

This mostly occurs when valuers use the cost method of valuation without making reference to the income approach”. Other errors contributing to this problem are; lack of rental evidence, lack evidence of recent transaction and wrong use of capitalization rate. To make it worse, some valuers don’t use the correct procedures of arriving at opinion of values and focus on satisfying their clients (mortgagor) demand in terms of value by demanding and accepting bribe from the mortgagor. This simply act rise a great doubt in the hearts of financial institution that requires valuation report to serve as lending requirement.</p> <p><b>1.2       </b><b>AIM AND OBJECTIVES</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The aim of this study is to assess the accuracy of mortgage valuation as a lending requirement for selected banks in Kaduna Metropolis.The specific objectives are to;</p> <p>  i.                  identify the methods adopted in valuation of  property for mortgage purpose, </p> <p>ii.                  identify the causes of inaccuracy in mortgage valuation,</p> <p>iii.                  evaluate the accuracy of mortgage valuation, and</p> <p>iv.                  evaluate the reliability of mortgage valuations prepared by estate surveyors and valuers for mortgage institutions in Kaduna metropolis.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b></b></p> <p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.3       </b><b>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</b><b></b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The research questions for this study are:</p> <p>  i.                  What are the methods adopted in valuation of properties for mortgage purpose?</p> <p>ii.                  What are the causes of inaccuracy in mortgage valuation?</p> <p>iii.                  How accurate is mortgage valuation?</p> <p>iv.                  How reliable is mortgage valuations prepared by estate surveyors and valuers for mortgage institutions in Kaduna metropolis?</p> <p><b>1.4       </b><b>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p>This study is limited to the accuracy of mortgage valuation, and the effect of undervaluation and overvaluation of mortgage properties to banks and investors.

This research focuses on two set of people which are the estate surveyors and valuers and bankers in Kaduna metropolis and their involvement in mortgage transactions for the period, 2004 -2014.</p> <p><b>1.5     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p>The importance of this study to the financial institutions, investors, individual, estate surveyors and valuers, cannot be overemphasized. The security of interest and capital is the chief goal of mortgagees. The amount a borrower is qualified to access will depend, among others, on the earning capacity of an income-producing property; the earning capacity is determined by valuation. It is the usual practice to advance by way of mortgage two-thirds of the estimated market value of the property, thereby leaving the mortgagee with a one-third margin of safety. However a study like this will serve as an eye-opener to investors whose properties are valued, banks who use valuation as their basis for collateral, valuers who determine or estimate the worth of such security and academic world with respect to lending requirement in its entirety.</p> <p>1.6       LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>1.      Time constraints to adequately collect data from the field</p> <p>2.      Banks and Estate Surveyors and Valuers were too busy to respond appropriately</p> <p><b>1.7       THE </b><b>STUDY AREA</b><b>  </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Kaduna metropolis is chosen as the study area because it is one of the most important commercial city in northern part of Nigeria and providing a sufficiently vibrant economic and valuation activities.

Seventy questionnaires were distributed out of which forty three were completed and returned, giving 61.4% response. Results showed that although facilities managers in Nigeria are well aware of the risk portfolio of their organizations, but adequate measures are not put in its proper place to prevent and prepare for any eventuality. For example, respondents opinion on how often BCP is being used in managing facilities shows that 65.1% do not use it often, 69.8% agreed that BCP is based on demand by client/organization. The outcome of the result of the study showed that even if BCP is in use, it is not proactive, also refusal of government and clients to request for BCP contributed to the lack of preparation of plan. It was recommended that government should make it mandatory for all organizations to request facilities managers to prepare BCP to guide and prepare for any eventuality in the form of disasters and their position as part of their financial statement. Professional bodies and associations affiliated to disaster management, should assist organizations by organizing workshops, trainings, awareness campaigns for personnel of such organizations.</p>

<p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>While governments, not-for-profit institutions, and non-governmental organisations also deliver critical services, private organisations must continuously deliver products and services to satisfy shareholders and to survive. Although they differ in goals and functions, business continuity planning (BCP) can be applied by all governments.</p> <p>Elliot <i>et al </i>(1999) defines business continuity planning as identifying an organisation’s exposure to internal and external threats and synthesizes hard and soft assets to provide effective prevention and recovery for the organisation, while maintaining competitive advantage and value system integrity.</p> <p>There is much misunderstanding of business continuity management (BCM) and as yet no commonly practiced methodology for the assessment of an organisation in this regard (Honour 2001). Elliot <i>et al</i> (1999) noted that there is no structured implementation of capabilities to directly address the risks presented to us in the modern world. These newly emphasized risks in partnership with the inherent vulnerabilities resulting from the lack of a structured approach to BCM calls for a more robust and measurable means of protecting our continuity management that is continuity assurance.</p> <p>As the name implies, continuity assurance is concerned with actively planning to avert the threat or reduce from the act, though this recovery is implicit in the approach detailed in this work.</p> <p><b>1.2       PROBLEM STATEMENT</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Management of facilities in developing countries like Nigeria is replete with a lot of problems. Prominent among them is the disruption of business operations, delays, ineffective or poor quality service. This is due to lack of clear understanding of those organisations risk profile or portfolio and absence of proactive measures that will ensure the continuation of critical business operations. As a result of the aforementioned, this affects the organisations in many ways, e.g. service provision is poor or substandard, profit maximization is seriously affected and the reputation of the organisation is equally affected, etc.</p> <p><b>1.3       JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Emergency Preparedness and Business Continuity is one out of the eleven (11) core competencies in the management of facilities. This needs a holistic study of the core competencies to see ways and means for effective facilities management. Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is suppose to be properly put in place for any business to strife, be it small, medium or big.</p> <p>It is in the light of the above that a critical look at plans that are supposed to be put in place by FM for business to continue and also to mitigate any negative effect of any disaster on the organisation.</p> <p>It is an acknowledged fact that one of the important and necessary conduction for smooth successful and effective management of any facility devoid of any interruption that may have far reaching impact on the organization is the putting in place proactive measure to ensure the continuation of critical activities considering the facilities management practice in Nigeria (being at the development stage) a feedback system is needed or information is needed on how this important activities were undertaken especially the approach adopted, (1) quality of the plan, (2) how they are implemented and (3) problems relating to the implementation and above all the quality of human resource who prepares and implement (facilities management) this will enable the facilities management practice to benefit from such results.</p> <p><b>1.4       AIM AND OBJECTIVES</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.4.1    Aim</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The aim of this project is to evaluate the business continuity plans prepared by facilities manager in Nigeria with a view to providing guidelines and procedures for an orderly and timely business continuance. </p> <p><b>1.4.2    Objectives</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>a)                  To study how BCP is used in the management of facilities in Nigeria.</p> <p>b)                  To determine the factors affecting the effective use of BCP in management of facilities by comparing (a) above.</p> <p>c)                  To assess the perception of stakeholders/facilities managers on how BCP can promote effective management of facilities.</p> <p><b>1.5       METHODOLOGY   </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The methods used could be summarized under the following sub-headings: </p> <p>1.5.1        <b>Literature Review </b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Review of related literature on the subject using magazines, journals, conference proceedings, internet, interviews, etc. This was done in order to articulate existing knowledge on principles, procedures and practice of undertaking business continuity planning in facilities management.</p>\n\nAN APPRAISAL OF BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN BY FACILITIES MANAGERS IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN APPRAISAL OF BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN BY FACILITIES MANAGERS IN NIGERIA", "id": 62}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div> <p><b>AN APPRAISAL OF INMATES’ REHABILITATION FACILITIES IN KADUNA AND ZARIA PRISONS</b></p><p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><i></i></p><p><i> </i></p><i></i> <p><i></i></p><p><i> </i></p><i></i> <p><b>ABSTRACT</b></p> <p>This central thrust of this research is to appraise the inmates’ rehabilitation facilities in Nigerian Prisons using Kaduna and Zaria prison as a case study. Against this backdrop, this study attempts to empirically appraise the inmates’ rehabilitation facilities in Nigeria prison with Kaduna and Zaria Prisons as the case study. To achieve this, sample size of 145 inmates, 37 staff was selected through simple random sampling by the use of prison register. Qualitative and Quantitative data were collected through the use of questionnaire and interview method. Also the analysis of data was through the combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis. This result of the data analysis showed that the respondents varied in socio-demographic characteristic such as age, sex, marital status, educational qualification, religion etc. further, the data showed that many of the inmates said that there is rehabilitation facilities such as carpentry, work, electrical work, shoe making etc. though some opined that despite the existing scheme it was only meant for convicts and awaiting trial were excluded from the benefiting in such schemes.The study also found that: Provision for rehabilitation services is still neglected and not international best practices compliance; the incarceration condition of the inmates with respect to accommodation, feeding and medication does not meet the United Nation’s standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners; prison inmates of these prisons prefer one rehabilitation services to the other. The most preferred rehabilitation service is recreational activity-football. Despite the aforementioned problems the prison still has been able to play the role of rehabilitation at a small measure.Based on these findings, it was recommended among others that deliberate efforts should be made by the Federal Government and prison service providers to reform the Nigerian prisons and make it international best practice compliance. There is also the need to introduce more rehabilitation services, facilities and reformative programmes such as training inmates on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and giving adequate awareness programmes so as to rehabilitate prison inmates and stop recidivism.<b></b></p><p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b></b></p><p><b> </b></p><b></b> <p>Table of Contents</p>

</b><b>INTRODUCTION:</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p><b>1.1              </b><b>Background of the Study</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>The noble goal of the prisons services is to reform those who pass through the prison gates and also to protect the society from the convicted felons. It also serves to keep in safe custody persons legally sentenced to jail and identify the cause of inherent anti social behavior and treat and reform them to become law-abiding citizens. The prison also has the responsibilities to train inmates in trades that will make them useful to themselves and the society at large. (prisons lecture manual 2003).</p> <p></p> <p>According to the Jarma (2001) these objectives are not being met in Nigeria, he contend that instead of reforming inmates the prisons system is hardening them and subjecting them to horrible, degrading conditions and punishment, sometimes exceeding the crime committed, the process makes them to become physicals and psychological damaged, with the feeling of been unwanted, unloved and abandoned in uncaring environment.</p> <p></p> <p>Most studies of prison in Nigeria have been concerned with the sociological analysis of the prisons as social systems that have examined inmates (Sarki 2003, Muhammad, 2005).</p> <p></p> <p>Yet little attention has been given to the other factors that lead to the failure, in achieving the stated objectives i.e reforming, rehabilitation and reintegration. Such factors are inmates’ rehabilitation facilities which are almost in obsolete state and poor management in handling the available one. Inmates’ rehabilitation facilities which comprised of inmates’ accommodations, skill acquisition facilities, education facilities, recreational facilities e.t.c are inadequate or in state of disrepair. Many prisons in Nigeria have no basis utility services e.g toilet, water, light, medicine, etc and where they have are severely limited. (Asokhia M.O 2012)</p> <p></p> <p>Though Nigeria government budges a little amount in comparison with other countries in the world with almost the same population size but corruptions, poor management, unprofessionalism n handling the facilities are the accelerating factor to this unwanted situation. (Ogundipe 2008)</p> <p></p> <p>To find a solution to these problems and proposed ways of improvement in the management of inmates’ rehabilitation facilities are the question that this project will address.</p> <p></p> <p><b>1.2              </b><b>Statement of the Problem</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>One of the cardinal’s objectives of prison system is to wear prisoners away from crime and other anti-social activities and give them direction that will enable them lead normal live again. The idea is to employ the period of incarceration to impact other offenders the need to be law-abiding (prison lecture manual 2007) </p> <p></p> <p>Prisons are conceived as corrective institutions.

One of the major sources of finance is real estate taxation. Property tax reform is one of the alternatives proposed as a means for raising increased revenue to meet the financial needs of cities in less developed countries. Property rating is employed in Nigeria at the local government levels to raise revenues for public purposes. Rates are levied not on the nation as a whole but on a particular locality that is deemed ripe for the imposition of rates and with the consent of parliament. This consent is not given on every occasion of rate collection. The power is general one, given by statute without restriction and for all times.</p> <p>          The general lack of interest on the part of the property ratepayers and the reluctance of some assessment jurisdictions to disclose information, the property rate administration is often surrounded in mystery. This centres on the fact that the core of property tax (rate) administration is the value of each taxpayer’s property, so that each taxpayer will bear fairly his proportional part of the overall tax levy. Property owners have a right to know the approximate, fraction of estimated market value that is being used for tax (rating) assessment purposes.</p> <p>          If the local government have to exist and to viable as the third tier of government they must surely need some local revenue in order stand firmly property rating is the most obvious source of such revenue. Property rating not only helps in influencing development but is also the major source of local government revenue used in defraying the cost of services rendered by local government includes, inter-alia, parks, burial grounds, registration of marriage, death and birth.</p> <p>          It is important to note that rate is a form of tax, hence the use of property rate and property tax is interchangeable, although there is a slight difference between rate and tax, beside that rate is a form of tax, while in rating the amount of revenue required by a rating authority is first decided and then distributed among the rate payers according to a pre-fixed standard in other kind of tax the exact amount to be generated at the time of imposition is unknown.</p> <p><strong>1.1               </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>From investigation and empirical data on property rating in general and in Enugu state in particular, one observes a gold mine with proper handling waiting to be exploited as can seen in Enugu north it is, therefore the aim of this paper to examine the administration of property rating in the state, how well informed the rate payers are, their attitudes, improvement in the system, how well the system has been paying off, and of course, a critical appraisal of the system.</p> <p>The purpose of this paper is to study and identify the sources of local government finance, its problems, methods of property assessment as provided in some rating laws/Edicts, the impact of control of rent edict on property assessment, prospects of property rating and make recommendations not only on how best to expand the local government financial base with particular reference to property rating system but also on how best to implement the rating in the country. The purpose also includes the prospect of site value rating as a means of boosting the local government finance.</p> <p><strong>1.2               </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The local government reform law gave the function of rate collection to the local authorities. The valuation unit in the old Anambra State was staffed by civil servants. The unit organized tenement rating and prepared valuation list which were after due procedure sent to the rating authority to serve demand notices and collect tenement rates.</p> <p>One of the greatest rating problems in most rating authorities is the problem of collection. The weak or ineffective administration has resulted in a high rate of default. For example in 1978/79 in the whole of Enugu north 21% of the estimated rate revenue was collected. Some rating authorities are now embarking on a commission basis.</p> <p>The question of prosecuting defaulters is not actively pursued in most local rating authority areas for two reasons:</p> <p>(a)      Most of the defaulters are the élites who will adjudicate such cases.</p> <p>(b)      For political expediency landlords are political power brokers who chairmen of local rating authorities would not like to embarrass by prosecution.</p> <p>Part xiii of this Edict captioned “Rating” which includes sections 103 to 146 empowers a local government area, in other words, a rating areas to impose property rating on property owners as a source of revenue raising. In Enugu state in general, and Enugu North local government in particular, weaknesses are readily discernible in the present property rating structures which in retrospect, prevents successful implementation of their service. Most of the property rating administrators at the local government headquarters is mere technicians, others basely literate which in no less measure hamper their sense of judgments as per the nature of the properties they collect data from, to be used by the rating valuers in the ministry of local government as Enugu, to arrive at the annual values of the properties. This problem was aggravated during the political era when employment opportunities were nation on political rather than qualification basis.</p> <p>In collation with this, most property owners in Enugu are illiterates and do not know their rights.  Most of them do not know why they should pay property rate at all. Added to this ugly situation is the ambiguity mounted by the assessors (valuation officers) in their notice to the property owners indicating the assessed value thereof. They only show the assessed annual value with out signifying the actual rate payable. When most of landlords see these, they simply deafen their ears, and blatantly refuse to pay, misconstruing the annual value as the rate payable value. They are only brought to attention of this premise by litigation, which is not the best interest of the local government, the cost and time consummations. </p> <p>Another factor is how to equate the rating burden of the property owners in the locality with the value of services provided by the government activity. Implicit in this problem is the question of how to improve the current deplorable situation and weakening rural development programs via sound administration of property rating revenue.     </p> <p><strong>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY </strong>          </p> <p>The main objective for the introduction of property rating in the local government is to raise revenue from the source. Revenue, thus generated are utilized by the local government where the tenements/properties are located to provide essential service which the government grants cannot easily take care of.</p> <p>      Local government provides essential services such as the supply of water and electricity, repair of wads and bridge, supplementing of the government grant for the payment of staff salaries not employed by the government. They also, have the responsibility to provide good drainage system and the planning of their local government area.</p> <p>It is a fact that no government could long exist without the power to levy and collect taxes.(Barlowe.R)goes on to contend that the power to tax is the one great power upon which the whole national fabric is based. It is necessary to the existence and prosperity of the nation as the air he breathes is to the natural man. Thus the taxing power provides government with the major portion of revenues they use to finance their many operations and function, and it also provides a tool they can use for various fiscal and regulatory purposes.</p> <p><strong>1.4     SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This work can not be said to be a comprehensive work. This is because property rating is so wide a discourse that all its facets could not, within the time limit and the volume margin, be covered effectively.</p> <p>Coupled with these constraints aforementioned, the Enugu State North L.G.A played a vital role in frustrating the researchers endeavours. Again, the notion of administrators that the documents relating to property rating were mainly secrets and could not be made available to researchers unless on government permission met with its own problem.</p> <p>Further more, reluctance due to ignorance on the purpose of the research on the part of the property owners to disclose necessary information on their own parts of the administration was also there. This was so pronominal that most of them either refused the collection and filling in of the questionnaires or automatically dodged certain personal interview question.</p> <p>Despite all these constraints, and with perseverance and strong commitments, to the task on hand, the researcher was able to break through, and gathered adequate data necessary to make objective deduction and generalization on the property rating administration in Enugu North Local Government Area, Enugu State.</p> <p><strong>1.5            </strong><strong>DEFINITION OF IMPORTANT TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>A)      PROPERTY RATING:         </strong>Also known as local government value of property paid to local government coffer as an amount per naira of the dateable value of the property.

This phenomenon is predicted on her over increasing population complied with sophistication in taste and demand for domestic and industrial goods by her urban population. The uncontrolled generation and disposal of these wastes have deteriorated our otherwise conducive urban environment. Virtually all cities in Nigeria are characterized by helps or mounting of solid wastes. The health implications of this development on our urban streams, health and socio-economic development leave much to be desired.</p> <p>The realization of good health, hygiene and sustainable development in any society is practically impossible when pollution by way of solid wastes impact strongly on hers socio – economic, cultural and environmental settings.</p> <p>Policy markers, leaders of though and political office holders are daily confronted with endemic problems of what to do with mounting heaps of solid wastes in our urban environment. Many choice properties by virtue of their proximity to dump sites have deteriorated significantly and this has serious negative effect on their rental and capital values.</p> <p>The present scenario depicts a state hopeless as virtually all Agencies of government entrusted with managing the wastes especially ENSEPA seems to be at cross road on what to do.</p> <p>1.1    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</p> <p>Solid waste management is a very difficult task, as we all know. It creates a lot of problems to people which include:- drainage blockage (flooding), traffic jam, health hazard and unsightly environment.</p> <p>In addition, environmental pollution in urban centers due to solid wastes is a matter of serious concern to the international community, for pollution in any form interferes with our good chain, health, comfort, amenities, properties values and living standards. Today, all businesses are affected by both environmental changes and government effort towards controlling these changes.</p> <p>1.2    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY     </p> <p>The main purpose of this study is to effective of solid waste management as a booster to Nigeria Economy.  More over the research aims at finding out what should be done in order to reduce the health hazards and of the increasing menace of solid wastes management in urban areas.</p> <p>1.3    BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR THE STUDY</p> <p>Urbanization, which is the purpose of people’s aggregation in cities, has witnessed tremendous increase in recent times. Most cities now in Nigeria have grown to full-scale urban status. The implications of urbanization is manifested in the areas of unemployment, inadequate social amenities due to undue pressures on the available ones by teaming population, increase in crime wave, sophistication and changes in demand and taste complied with high consumption on industrial and domestic goods leading to large volumes of solid wastes.</p> <p>The presence of the solid wastes in our city environment without effective waste collection and disposal machinery has left most of these cities in solid state and their implications on the health of urban. It leaves much to be desired hence the need for this study.</p> <p>1.4    THEORETICAL FOUNDATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This study is based ion W. Wilkie, Jodan’s Topical hygiene and sanitation theory, which state “that the collection and disposal of refuse and waste matter is any integral part of effective sanitation exercise.</p> <p>From the above view and theory, any effective waste management packaged for proper address of our solid waste hydra headed problems benefit all individual main market.</p> <p>1.5     RESEARCH QUESTION</p> <p>The following research questions wee formulated to guide the study. These include:</p> <p>1.      How do you dispose your solid waste?</p> <p>2.     Are there any waste bins in your shops?</p> <p>3.     How often is waste evacuated from your day?</p> <p>4.     Do you sort your waste before disposal?</p> <p>5.     Are there sufficient equipment and manpower?</p> <p>6.     Are the storage, collection and transportation in Cities dumps from individual shops?</p> <p>7.     How far are waste dumps from individual shops?</p> <p>1.6    SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>The study is therefore restricted to solid waste management in Cities.

It contributes to the physical and moral hearth of a nation and stimulates the social stability, the work efficiency and the development of the individuals. But in spite of these facts there is on doubt that housing in quantitative terms is still one of the major problems facing the Nigerian Urbanities and governments beside the characteristic slums and conditions it is becoming increasingly difficult for average Nigerians to own houses. Also it is very difficult to procure decent accommodation at reasonable rent in the market. The rent are high in each state and fairly high in the other state capitals, but still not commensurate with the monthly in comes of all categories of low, middle and upper wage earners and the self-employed.</p> <p>The major cause of high rent is that the supply of housing is fair less than demand. The recommended 20 percent of the monthly income on rent. The problems are more acute in those cities and towns where ad commercial and industrial activities have long been established, fast growing and concentrated cities. To find houses to rent is a big problem and if such houses are eventually found, they are let out at very exorbitant prices that take a large percentage or the monthly income of the acceptant not minding the location and the accessibility of the residence to the place of work. Until recently for an was becoming exceedingly very difficult for an average wage earner as well as the self –employed individuals to build houses of their own within a long period of time say ten years through their private savings. Most civil servants in Nigeria between 1978 and 1988 cloud hardly make some savings not to take of building houses of their own. Also, the cost of building materials is very exhobitant, cost of land, labour and professional fees are very high which has led to the situation whereby the construction cost per square meter is far more than what an individual could meet after the provision of food and other social needs.</p> <p>Also due to the fact that individual cannot own houses of their own as a result of the high construction cost involved, it has contributed to people hiring at very exorbitant rates because there are more buyers one of housing good than the supply of those goods and services. The effect of this housing shortage mostly predominately in Urban areas not only led to over crowing in several cities, it has also led to many taking shelter under the bridges, schacks and make shifts (as in the case of Lagos). The most unfortunate thing is that the existing residential buildings are not suitable to modern needs and lack in converses such as water closets (Wcs),P,Pe-borne water, power supply, open spaces etc. the situation prompted the united Nations to launch the aggressive programme of shelter for all in the year 2000.</p> <p>To achieve this, the federal government of Nigeria incorporated it in the Nation’s third development plan (1975-1980) and sought to participate actively in the provision of housing for all income groups achieve significant increase in housing supply and bring relief especially to the low income earners and the self- employed who where the most affected by the acute shortage a situation whereby the Urban worker paid over 20% of his monthly income on rent. This has led to the provision of Estates by both the  federal and the state government in order to increase the housing stock available to the Urban population. It is on this background that this work tries to examine the effect of these housing Estates on Residential Housing Delivery.</p> <p>1.2     STATEMENTS OF PROBLEMS</p> <p>Government all over the world especially in developing countries embarks on the provision of housing Estate for their Wizens, this is usually to argument housing provision by the private sector of the economy. Although these estates were established by law and status, they present management problems inducing legal, physical, Financial, social – political and other problems such that in recent time management of public housing Estate has presented hydra-headed problems. These problems manifest themselves in the form of dilapidated buildings, poor sanctuary and environmental condition all resulting from poor management and lack of maintenance.</p> <p>This clearly, the crux of the housing problems in Nigeria today relate to the low income groups which constitute the main elements of both Urban and rural population with all these factors mentioned above one sees the housing problems in general as the problems that motivated both the federal and the state government, the Imo state government and the Imo state Urban and housing corporation and all the other state government and housing corporations to formulate their housing programmes. This is because good residential housing gives room for more production.</p> <p>1.3  AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The main aim of this research work is to evaluate the effect of housing estate on the residential housing provision in the Nigerian Urban cities: To achieve this aim the following objectives are set out.</p> <p>(1)    To identify the various housing estates in the study area.</p> <p>(2)    To determine the quantity (number)of houses provided through the Imo housing corporation in Owerri</p> <p>(3)     To determine the effect of these housing Estate on the residential housing provision</p> <p>(4)     To identify problems and constraints of the Imo housing corporate in the provision and management of these housing Estates.</p> <p>(5)    To recommend ways of ameliorating the problems in (4) four above with a view of providing more housing Estate in the urban area.</p> <p>1.4  RESEARCH QUESTIONNAIRES</p> <p>1.    Mention various housing estate in Imo state Owerri</p> <p>2.    What is the quantity number of housing provided by the Owerri housing co-operation?</p> <p>3.   What are the effect of these housing estates on the residential housing provision?</p> <p>4.    What are the problems encountered by the Owerri housing co-operation in the provision and management of these housing estates?</p> <p>5.    Recommend ways of ameliorating the problems with a view of providing more housing estates in the urban area.</p> <p>1.5      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>It has often been argued that the distribution of residential housing ownership, specifically among the working class, increased support for the ownership of private property in general and areasthesises housing as an area of social structure pound on capitalist private enterprise.</p> <p>To further buttress this point residential housing delivery in Owerri has made the individuals and low income earners to enjoy its role in stimulating national economy, its social services or significance and its financial and economic importance to individuals. Such services provided in that area include provision of shelter or accommodation, provides collateral security for loans / mortgage loans, durable goods which can be inherited, contributes to physical development, source of social prestige / status, provides employment opportunities, investment – which yields a flow of income it checks cost of housing reengage in the city, provision of schools, hospitals, recreational centers etc.</p> <p>Therefore, since the need for shelter or accommodation is very universal, its significance or importance is very obvious. The importance of residential housing cuts across nation or political boundaries and it is a staminate to good health and individual productivity. This citizens of any nation who dwell in decent housing will enjoy good health, be productive and thus contribute positively to the growth of their nation’s economy. As we look at the social significance of housing to man, its role in the economic development of a community or individuals, we would be able to fully appreciate the importance of residential housing to man which is really the focus of this topic.</p> <p>1.6     THE SCOPE OR STUDY</p> <p>This project is limited to the analysis of the effect of the provision of housing estate on residential housing delivery using the World Bank Housing Estate Owerri as a case study- However this work is not concerned with provision and development of Housing Estates.</p> <p>1.9    OVER-VIEW OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This project comprises of five chapters the first chapter is the introduction comprising statement of the problems purpose of the study, Arms and objectives, significance of the study, scope and limitation of the study research Question and over –view of the study.

Unfortunately, none of this institution was able to meet up to the standard of an average higher institution of learning of course; most of their courses were limited to civil servants. Not only that, they cannot award certificate beyond ordinary level diploma (OND).</p> <p>In an attempt to remedy this and advance the course being offered by the aforementioned institution and perhaps put them into acceptable standard the Ukpani  Asika administration on list April 1972, merged the former college of technology with the college of administration.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the amalgamation of the two-sister school could not meet up with both the state and national needs. Administration set October, 1972, the East central state administration set up a provisional council to determine structure of the government, the appropriate structure of an autonomous institution that would produce high quality technologist and technicians, professional managerial manpower in certain subject areas that will rhyme with the state and national needs.</p> <p>Consequently, on 3ist may 1973, the edict no of 1973, titled” the institution of management technology Edict” was promulgated. The Edit become operational from Ist July, 1973 and thus gave birth to what is now known as the institute of management and technology (IMT) Enugu.</p> <p>1.1    BACKGROUD OF THE STDUY</p> <p>A hostel by definition is a building in which cheap food and lodging is provided for students, but unfortunately in tertiary institution in Nigeria. The never seems to be the case. This is what prompted as to research on this issue. This research, though on higher institutions, has a special reference on the institute of management and technology (IMT) Enugu.</p> <p>It has been established that the inadequacy of hostel accommodation has an adverse effect on then actualization of qualitative and standard education in Nigeria, universities and polytechnics, that is why we have  taken it upon our selves to find out the lapses and problems that has heralded to this problem of inadequate accommodation.</p> <p>More so, there are other problems which prompted us to research on this topic this include:</p> <ul><li>Students involvement in armed robbery</li> <li>Student’s involvement in prostitution</li> <li>High rate of disobedience by student as a result of not living in an academic environment.</li> </ul> <p>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The problems associated with this subject matter includes that students in higher institution are being deprived of their sociological and psychological needs as a result of poor hostel accommodation. Include the student can stay in a room impacts some psychological pains on the students, as privacy is to a large extent</p> <p>Further more, the academic pursuit of the students has being hindered, the students now pay less attention to studies. In I.M.T for instance, that institution has two campus and some of the students who        stay in campus two now have to risk their lives in transporting themselves to the other campus. Not only that, the students spend a lot of money in transportation and education and the under standing which the students are supposed to gain on the part of the school it self, some of the rooms which were made to accommodate students are being used as offices for the stay in the institutes. Some of the rooms are vacancy and this being wasted because of poor management all this adversely affects the student academic pursuit.</p> <p>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>This study will be concerned with the problems posed by poor hostel accommodation, as it affects the quality of education in higher institute with particular reference to the institute of management and technology, ( IMT) Enugu and these are as follows:</p> <p>The students lack concentration on studies as a result of deprivation of privacy. Students pay less attention to studies and spend much of their time trying to make money, as the money they have, have been spent on transportation.</p> <p>Cultism is about to take our the academic activities that are supposed be going on in the school, as most of students who stay off campus now mix with undesirable elements and they get involved in corrupt practices</p> <p>The dual campus system makes the students to be worn out before reaching their lecture halls. Administrative lapse has hindered the implementation of policies that could enhance the quality of life of the students in the hostels.</p> <p>The fact that apart from the hostel fees, student who stay in the hostels spend a lot of money on feeding and acquisition of other recreational facilities.</p> <p>Student says they bribe officials before rooms could be allocated to them.  Why school authorities fail to provide accommodation for students eg in ESUT for instance, their is no accommodation for students, lest alone saying that it is inadequate.</p> <p>The last but not least is for us to find out what the management is doing about the in suffivier rooms of accommodation in IMT for instance as some of the rooms that were meant to accommodation students are now being used as offices.</p> <p>OBJECTIVE OF STUDY</p> <p>By and large, accommodation, irrespective of it s nature or shape lost ensure reasonable comfort and relaxation. To ensure thus, it must not be in capable of providing adequate rooms of accommodation and certain basic recreation facilities such as pipe borne water, library centers, etc. but unfortunately, most, if not all the higher institution of learning in Nigeria are devoid of some of these basic facilities and infrastructure.</p> <p>The school, having been more advance and nationally known, created more rooms for the creation of more departments, which paved way for admission of student and recruitment of more personal.</p> <p>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The project will be of immense importance to the strident and authorities of tertiary institutions, especially imt as it would not only help them trace the cause and effect of accommoda5tion problem but also suggest how best to tackle them. Above all the way the researcher squarely traced and uprooted the root causes and effect before dashing out her recommendation will alert the government too quickly and precisely intervene, thus bringing the problems of poor student’s academic performance in adequate accommodation.</p> <p>RESEARCH QUESTIONS:</p> <p>Does IMT have enough accommodation space f0r his student?</p> <p>Does inadequate hostel accommodation affect the student study habit?</p> <p>Does lack of hostel accommodation contributes to the unnecessary exposure of IMT female student to sugar daddy and landlord?</p> <p>Are students happy to be accommodation outside the two campuses?</p> <p>Does accommodation problem make student of IMT spend most of their money on security accommodation else where?</p>\n\nTHE PROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF MANAGEMENT OF STUDENTS HOSTEL ACCOMMODATION IN HIGHER INSTITUTION IN NIGERIA <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF MANAGEMENT OF STUDENTS HOSTEL ACCOMMODATION IN HIGHER INSTITUTION IN NIGERIA ", "id": 67}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>APPRAISAL OF THE EFFECT OF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT ON PROPERTY VALUE</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.1     BACKGROUND OF STUDY</p> <p>The issue of property management has persisted in the Nigeria society for quite sometime. Property management is the art and science of real estate with respect to it’s development, maintenance, cash flow from users and occupiers in order to achieve optimum benefits for the owner and all parties interested in the property within the ambit of relevant laws.</p> <p>It is observed that for many years. most properties have lacked proper management due to absence of qualified property managers who are professionally equipped to handle property management.</p> <p>Many property owners (Landlords) do not usually engage the services of estate surveyors and valuers. They appoint “caretakers” to look after or take care of their properties. These caretakers in turn have limited powers as they can only collect rent from tenants and engage in minor repairs of the properties. Moreover, they are mostly laymen and not trained in estate management. This has affected the value of some properties in the market.</p> <p>Therefore, the ability of a property to yield highest returns and posses a long physical and economic life depends on good property management. Good property management has transcended ordinary maintenance of property based on tenant’s complaints and graduated into purposeful planning of building services and efficient accounting system with due regard to the legal, economic and social interests of the tenants and Landlord alike.</p> <p>If we look around and study some of the multi-storey and public properties in some of our state capitals, most especially Awka, one can easily distinguish between the well managed and the neglected ones.</p> <p>Proper management of our landed properties is as important as the construction of these properties and it is vital to the economics, historical, social and cultural development of our nation and it should be accorded its due importance both privately and publicly.</p> <p>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>Property developers as well as governments all over the world especially in developing countries embark on the development of properties. Although these properties were approved by the town planning authorities, they present physical, economical, environmental, financial and social problems.</p> <p>Physically, the property becomes a source of discomfort to occupants due to wear and tear of the physical structure of the property. Any person looking for accommodation for residence or business may not like to take up the property that is old or lacked maintenance.</p> <p>Economically, the property does not generate income as it used to when it was newly constructed.</p> <p>Environmentally, these properties contribute to the degradation of the environment. They also pose a threat to people’s life as they can collapse and kill the occupants.</p> <p>The social effect borders mainly on the property driving away high standard people. It was observed that these properties have turned out to become properties of low standard. All these result from poor management and lack of maintenance.</p> <p>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>(a)     To ensure that the property is kept in a good state of repairs through regular maintenance within the estate.</p> <p>(b)     To ensure that all those management tools such as letting, maintenance schedule, rent collection etc are properly articulated.</p> <p>(c)      To elongate the economic life or useful life of a property through activities which tend to remove physical, economic and functional obsolescence.</p> <p>(d)     To identity the well managed and neglected properties in the study area with a view to comparing their levels of income as well as state of maintenance.</p> <p>(e)      To proffer necessary measures that should be taken in remedying the identified anomalies in poorly managed properties.</p> <p>1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The findings of this study will no doubt be of immense benefit to several state holders and interest groups in the real estate development industry.</p> <p>This study will also be particularly significant to the entire society, the Anambra state government and inhabitants, as it will come out with remedial measures towards the eradication of improper management of landed properties which does no one any good.</p> <p>In addition, it will be of great benefit to professionals in the building industry, real property investors, occupiers, scholarly future researcher in related areas, policy and law makers, students and a host.</p> <p>1.5     SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The scope of the work is limited only to commercial properties in Awka. The metropolis in question has over the years witnessed poor management of landed properties owned by both private and public bodies due to the ignorance of property owners.</p> <p>Work has however been limited to the appraisal of the effect of property management on the value of commercial properties.</p> <p>1.6     LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</p> <p>It is a fact that nothing is foolproof on earth. This position was equally the case with this study, firstly, there was the problem of logistic. Our people are known to have very poor research culture.</p> <p>This was manifested in the cold attitude which some people approached for information showed and their unwillingness to fill the questionnaire given to them.</p> <p>Time constraint was experienced, as there was not enough time to carryout more research on this work.</p> <p>Some people were not convinced about the objective of this study and so they held back certain vital information for obvious reasons known only by them.</p> <p>Financially difficulty also created hindrance as funds for transportation to source materials and fill the questionnaire posed a great problem.</p> <p>All the same, the study has been carefully conducted for one to have a good insight into the subject matter.</p>\n\nAPPRAISAL OF THE EFFECT OF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT ON PROPERTY VALUE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " APPRAISAL OF THE EFFECT OF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT ON PROPERTY VALUE", "id": 68}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT IN ENUGU NIGERIA</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0     INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Proper financing is all-important to successful property investment and development.

The cost and availability of finance for real estate development can influence the viability of such project.</p> <p>Inspite of the importance of development finance in property development, there is dearth of information on the amount of funding that takes place, by whom, or the method used. Though this is not unexpected given the general characteristics of development funding: there is no central agency or institution to co-ordinate the business of property funding.</p> <p>          In the hierarchy of man’s needs, housing has been ranked second and as a result of this; housing provision has become a paramount conerstone of the policies of various governments both at federal and state levels since independence in Nigeria. The consequences of the rapid rate of urbanisation are most visible in the rapid deterioration of urban housing resulting in urban housing poverty especially as there is no proportionate increase in the number of housing stocks.</p> <p>The house occupies a very unique position in the life of all human beings and stands out as one of the basic necessities of human beings after food as there is the innate desire of every man to own a decent house. It is the most single noncommercial investment or consumer of income. </p> <p>For most working Nigerians, the earning capacity is generally low and makes it practically impossible for the average Nigerian to save towards owning a house. In addition, the dwindling economic fortunes in Nigeria which dims the capacity of individuals to own a house.</p> <p>The economic boom periods of the 1970s also contributed to the housing problems in Nigeria.</p> <p>During this period, there was surplus capital, the economic climate then was favourable for the development of real estate and the prospect of gain was over blown and so were the rate of development. The oil boom brought in an era of urban development, which was beyond all expectation and thus led to a massive surge in property development. Financial houses readily obliged developers’ loans, as they perceived minimum risks.</p> <p>However, with the crash in oil prices in the early 1980s, the economy was thrown into crises and recession thus set in which badly affected the real estate sector. Since real estate investment and development requires huge capital outlay, there is always the need for real estate investors and developer to source for fund. This capital is usually higher than the equity capital of such aninvertor and the only way out of this predicament is to source for found through other means apart from his personal savings.</p> <p>Which other sources of finance apart from equity capital are available to the real estate investors? What problems are being encountered in getting funds through these various sources?</p> <p>1.1   BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</p> <p>Real estate has continued to play a significant role in man’s evolution. It is not a coincidence that food, shelter and clothing believed to be the three essentials that sustain mankind, also have some linkage to land. Food grows out of land while shelter is affixed to it, and man’s clothing is made largely from what grows out of land. Indeed, whether in ancient times or today’s modern system, land constitutes a significant index for man’s wealth, and as economic activities have assumed more sophistication over time, land has continued to play a central role in their development (Lewis , 1994). There is hardly any business venture that does not require to be supported by some form of real estate: from the small business that requires real estate as offices from where its business can be organized, to the major venture that needs it for its factory.</p> <p>Consequently, through some very robust and well thought out land policies comprehensively address challenges that are encounter in the real estate sector. This is not exactly the situation here in Nigeria and the result is that there is a myriad of problems in the real estate sector (Adewale, 2000). In the course of this study, the researcher will provide an overview of real estate investments in Nigeria and its associated challenges.</p> <p>Real estate investment is intrinsically connected to the economic development and well being of any nation, thereby necessitating some intervention by prudent governments. Such interventions vary in degrees, depending on the nation. In Nigeria, individual could rarely lay claim to any part of it as owner and therefore could not alienate it without the consent of the head.</p> <p>Proper financing is all-important to successful property/real estate investment and development. Various forms of finance on varying terms from diverse investing agencies are available to the property/real estate market. The principal field where various forms of investment finance are employed is that of development where every loan has to be specially tailored for an individual scheme and the particular stages within the scheme. Since real estate and property development in particular involves huge capital expenditure, finance is therefore an essential input, the nature of which is to provide capital to enable the enterprise operate commercially (Ratcliff, 1999). The cost and availability of finance for real estate development can influence the viability of such project. It is necessary to examine the nature of real estate investment in Nigeria with a view of finding solutions to the associated challenges.</p> <p>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>In recent times, research on real estate investment has been on the front burner has it is the major source of housing for man. In the hierarchy of man’s needs, housing has been ranked second and as a result of this; housing provision has become a paramount cornerstone of the policies of various governments both at federal and state levels since independence in Nigeria. The consequences of the rapid rate of urbanization are most visible in the rapid deterioration of urban housing resulting in urban housing poverty especially as there is no proportionate increase in the number of housing stocks.</p> <p>During the period of economic boom in the 1970s in Nigeria, there was surplus capital, the economic climate then was favorable for the development of real estate and the prospect of gain was over blown and so were the rate of development. Due to the recent drop in the prices of crude oil world wide and corruption, government has not been able to invest in real estate. Overpopulation and urbanization has led to massive increase in property development.</p> <p>Financial houses readily obliged developers’ loans, as they perceived minimum risks.</p> <p>Since real estate development requires huge capital outlay, there is always the need for real estate developer to source for fund. However, this study will examine the scope of real estate in Nigeria and its associated challenges with a view of making useful suggestions on the way forward for real estate in Nigeria.</p> <p>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>1.  To provide an overview of real estate investment in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.  To examine the challenges associated with real estate investment in Nigeria.</p> <p>3.  To identify the way forward for real estate in Nigeria.</p> <p>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>1.  What is the level of real estate investment in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.  What are the challenges associated with real estate investment in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.  What is the way forward for real estate in Nigeria?</p> <p>1.5   HYPOTHESIS</p> <p>HO: Real estate investment has no challenges in Nigeria.</p> <p>HA: Real estate investment has several challenges in Nigeria. </p> <p>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>1.  The findings from this study will educate the general public on the benefit of real estate investment and its associated challenges which will form the basis for guidance in decision making.</p> <p>2.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This study on real estate investment and its associated challenges in Nigeria will cover the extent of real estate investment in Nigeria looking at the factors that has facilitated or hindered it. It will also cover the challenges associated with real estate investment in Nigeria.</p> <p>LIMITATION OF STUDY</p> <p>Financial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).</p> <p>Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work. This consequently will cut down on the time devoted for the research work.</p> <p>1.8   DEFINITION OF TERMS</p> <p>Investment: an investment is a monetary asset purchased with the idea that the asset will provide income in the future or appreciate and be sold at a higher price.</p> <p>Real estate: property consisting of land or buildings.</p>\n\nCHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT IN ENUGU NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT IN ENUGU NIGERIA", "id": 69}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>RURAL MANAGEMENT AS A STRATEGY FOR REDUCING RURAL – URBAN MIGRATION IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <div><p><strong>(A CASE STUDY OF ISHIELY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EBONYI STATE)</strong></p><p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p><p>Rural resources have a lot of potential which needed to be brought into full production as to uplift the values.

As a strategy, for reducing Rural – Urban Migrations in Nigeria, a case study of Ishiehi Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, seek to identify rural development programmes/projects extent of rural urban migration and factors responsible for rural urban migration in the study area.</p><p>From the findings based on the analysed data, integrated Rural Development Strategy has been pin-pointed and recommended as a feasible and viable measure toward minimizing the rate of rural – urban migration in Nigeria at large and Ishielu in particular.</p><p>TABLE OF CONTENTS</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>1.0              Introduction</p><p>1.1       Statement of the Problem</p><p>1.2       Aims and Objectives of the Study</p><p>1.3       Background and Need for the Study</p><p>1.4       Research Question</p><p>1.5       Research Hypothesis</p><p>1.6       Scope and Limitation of the Study</p><p>1.6.1    Delimitation Scope</p><p>1.6.2    Limitation</p><p>1.7       Significance of the Study</p><p>1.8       Theoretical Foundation of the Study</p><p>1.8.1    Economics Growth Model and Rural Development Dual Economic Model.</p><p>1.8.2    Diffusion Model of Rural Development</p><p>1.8.3    Basic Resource Theory.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>2.0              Literature Review</p><p>2.1       Meaning of Development</p><p>2.2       Rural Area and Rural Development</p><p>2.3       Classification of Rural Development Programme</p><p>2.3.1    Local (Community Programmes)</p><p>2.3.2    Government Programmes</p><p>2.4       Strategy</p><p>2.4.1    Rural Development Strategies</p><p>2.4.2    The Basic Weeds Approach</p><p>2.4.3    The Infrastructural Approach</p><p>2.4.4    The Minimum package or Sub-Sectorial Approach</p><p>2.4.5    The New Technology Approach</p><p>2.4.6    The Functional or Sectorial Programme Approach</p><p>2.4.7    The Industrialization Approach</p><p>2.4.8    The Community Approach</p><p>2.4.9    The Integrated Approach</p><p>2.5       General Concept of Integrated Rural Development in Nigeria</p><p>2.6       Urban Growth and Migration</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>3.0              Research Designs and Methodology</p><p>3.1              Re-Statement of the Problem</p><p>3.2               Design and Methodology of the Study</p><p>3.3              Sampling Technique and Procedure Employed</p><p>3.4              Description of the Study Area</p><p>3.5              Method of Data Collection</p><p>3.5.1    Primary data Collection</p><p>3.5.2    Secondary Data Collection</p><p>3.6              Description of Data Collection</p><p>3.7              Description of Statistics for Analysing Data</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>4.0              Data Presentation and Analysis</p><p>4.1              Personal Characteristics of the Respondents</p><p>4.2       Identification of Rural Development Programmes in the study Area.</p><p>4.3              Reasons or factors Responsible for Rural Urban Migration</p><p>4.4              Extent of Rural – Urban Migration in the Study Area</p><p>4.5              Testing of Hypothesis</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE </p><p>5.0              Findings, Recommendations and Conclusion</p><p>5.1              Findings</p><p>5.2              Recommendation</p><p>5.2.1        Strategy’s Institutional Framework</p><p>5.2.2         Programmes Under the Strategy</p><p>5.2.3    Policies, Principles and Philosophy in the Strategy</p><p>5.2.4    Funding the Strategy</p><p>5.2.5    Suggestion for further study</p><p>5.3              Conclusion</p><p>References</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Nigeria, a country in West African sub-region is blessed with abundant natural and material resources. With an estimated current population of over nine hundred and twenty four thousand (924, 000) square kilometers, Nigeria is easily the most populous in African and one of the largest in terms of geographical area. About seventy percent of the population depend on agricultural activities for their livelihood and live in rural communities.</p><p>Currently, over forty million out of the total population of over one hundred million people live in urban area. Therefore, the rural area within the geographic entity of the country is whereby majority of the population is found.</p><p>Some of the government officials fear of the belief held that urban areas constitute the development potential of the state, the rural areas, have been neglected in terms of development opportunities.</p><p>Following the moribund attitudes that existed  in the rural areas the rural dwellers are attracted to the urban areas to benefits from better paying jobs qualitative supply of basic amenities, highs level of commercial, recreational and industrial activities. Arising from the rapid. Urban population growth and physical expansion are very serious physical planning problem such as poor physical layout like Ajegunle, Gwagwa,, Abakpa in Lagos, Abuja, Abakalike and Enugu respectively. Also in the list include mass transit problem inadequate supply of housing, water and other basic social services.</p><p>Hence, it is expected that various governments policy maker rural dwellers, planning team and the general public should involve in harnessing the capture and build in preference of the rural dwellers at anytime.</p><p>1.1       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p><p>Generally in Nigerian, there have been uneven development and glaring inequality of opportunities between the rural and urban area. In spite of the fact that the majority of Nigerian are rural dwellers rural areas still have little or no opportunities for education and employment. No doubt rural areas in Nigeria are characterized by poverty, malnutrition, poor communication, illiteracy unproductive agriculture with the use of traditional implement, general low per capital income. Also includes lack of health facilities, public electricity, borne whole water and motorable roads which hinder them from evacuating foods and industrial raw materials.</p><p>Rural development proper should module all and sundry, unfortunately lack of sufficient fund for progamme execution, high cost of building materials and labour, failure to incorporate people affected in planning and in more serious note, the rural dwellers level of understanding is too low that instead of attracting government attention by initiating a project, they expect the government to do every thing for them which is impossible. All these factors problems act as a push against the rural dwellers in the study area to the urban areas, where they can enjoy social amenities and infrastructure such as water supply, electricity, health facilities, tarred roads, and abundant job opportunities. At the end of this study, we shall know how the rural development can be effective means (strategy) for reducing rural – urban migration in Nigerian generally and Ishielu Local Government Area of Ebonyi State particular. The preceding sentence, therefore, form the focus of this research.</p><p>1.2       AIMS OF OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p><p>Maris system of life is dynamic coupled with his insatiable nature which demands better food, shelter and clothes. These are usually achieved through verity of good jobs efficient use of human and natural resources.</p><p>The extensive area of land in the rural area can be put to various industrial and agricultural activities, thereby improving the lots of rural dwellers and urban dweller alike Agriculture provide us with food, medicine, firewood, timber and other raw material to the industries as well as employment and foreign exchange. Unfortunately the rural dwellers and farmers which constitute the largest population in the rural areas have not been properly taken care as regards development and as a result the rural dwellers rush to the urban areas to find alternative jobs and social amenities that abound in the urban areas.</p><p>This study therefore, is aimed at carrying out a research as follows</p><p>(i)                 To identify rural development programmes /projects available in the study area.</p><p>(ii)               To identity reasons/factors responsible for rural – urban migration.</p><p>(iii)             To examine the extent of rural urban – migration.</p><p>(iv)             To suggest and make feasible  recommendation on reducing migration in the study area.</p><p>1.3       BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR THE STUDY</p><p>The advent of civilization brought about urbanization or urban settlement. Civilization is the climax of man’s inventions as a means of raising his standard of living. Man believes in hedonism and indeed obtain much pleasure in the company of other fellow men. No doubt, this is why if one had to give one word the raison d’etre for a city it would surely be “communicated”. People come together in cities to be able to communicate person to person, person to firm person to government.</p><p>In the pre-history of urban evolution when technology was large and archaic, people had to search for fertile lands for abundant for harvest. These fertile land occurred in Abakaliki division now in  Ebonyi State. Settlements in these areas were promoted as a result of fertile land. The oldest organized settlement known today as the cradle of civilization such as settlement at alluvial plains of Rive Nile, Tigris, Euphrates, Indus and Yangtze – kiang were equally as a result of fertile land.</p><p>The discovering of limestone and the establishment of Cement Company at Nkalagu in Ishielu Local Government Area in 1957 attracted many investors and offered employment to the people. During this era there were considerable notice of immigrants in Nkalagu and its neighbouring communities. As a result of failure of the cement company to produce satellite town thereby extending its social amenities to the surrounding communities, the dwellers in the said communities like Nkalagu, Amazu, Umuahuli, Nkalaha, Obeagu started rushing to the urban areas in middle seventies. It is at this period that rural urban – migration gathered much momentum in the study area.</p><p>Generally, cities or urban areas apart from fertility of land discussed already started growing as a result of goods site for defence like Ibandan, mineral deposit such as in Enugu for Coal and Port Harcourt for crude oil, other include religious activities like Elele in Nigeria Jerusalem and Mecca. More recently, political tranquility influence of royal courts, holiday attraction and be antiful sceneries as well as economic activities, coastal orientation mineral deposit and traffic junction are the prevailing factors for the growing of cities. The level of standard of living which most of the cities or urban areas provide compel rural dwellers to more to urban areas and settle. It is in the light of rapid growth of urban over rural communities that form the bedrock of this study.</p><p>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTION</p><p>The following research questions were formulated to guide the study.</p><p>(i)                 What kind of rural development programmes/projects are being / have been executed in your rural area?</p><p>(ii)               Does lack of integrated rural development responsible for rural – urban migration in your area or not?</p><p>(iii)             In what way(s) have the absence of integrated rural development affected the standard of living in your rural area?</p><p>(iv)             In your own opinion what are the factors militating against rural development in your area?</p><p>1.5              RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</p><p>HO       Lack of integrated Rural Development is not responsible for Rural – Urban migration.</p><p>Hi        Lack of integrated Rural Development is responsible for Rural Urban Migration.</p><p>1.6              SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p><p>1.6.1        SCOPE</p><p>This study concentrates more on the rural development as a strategy for reducing rural – urban migration in Nigeria with a particular reference to Ishielu Local Government Area of Ebonyi state.</p><p>Ishielu local government area with Ezillo as its headquarters has a total population of one hundred and twenty eight thousand seven hundred and twenty persons according to the result of 1991 population census (see table I). The communities that form the local government area are as follows Agba, Amazu, Azumyaba, Ezillo, Ezzagu, Iyonu, Nkalagu, Nkalaha, other are Nkezi, Obeagu, Ohafia, Okpoto and Umunuali.</p><p>1.7       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p><p>This research is an attempt to highlight the various development imbalance existing in the rural and urban areas which resulted rural urban migration. The rapid acceleration of the urban areas as a matter of urgency need to be redressed through the propagation of well articulated rural development programmes or strategies. Therefore, the problem is on how to inculcate adequate planning development in rural areas to fit the overgrowing migratory demand without sacrificing any of the migrants motives and objectives.</p><p>Rural dwellers seen to be most beneficiary, government and the general public will also in one way or the other be benefited, if my suggestions and recommendation are adhered to.</p><p>1.8       THEORETICAL FOUNDATION OF THE STUDY</p><p>1.8.1    ECONOMIC GROWTH MODEL AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT DUAL ECONOMY MODEL</p><p>The dual economy model classifies the economy of less development countries in two. The modern sector and the subsistence section. These are also referred  to as  the urban and rural sector respectively (Olayide et al 1981). According to the model the modern (urban) sector is both capital and technological intensive which the subsistence (rural) sector is less capital intensive. The model believes that while the urban sector is market orientated, the rural sector produces for family consumption and relies on non-purchased inputs like labour and -----. The model accuses the rural sector of lack of savings and capital formation.</p><p>The problems with this model is that its adoption as a development strategy will lead to outflow of resources from rural to the urban area. there will be a rural neglect which creates a gap in earning. Also there will be migration to cities and consequently unemployment and increased demand for urban social services like water, electricity and so on. Moreover thee is no economy where the rural sector is characterized by absence of saving and capital formation, rather savings are small. It assign a restrictive role to agriculture as a mean of providing cheap foods and raw materials for industrialization. That is the rural urban migration as a result of lack of saving and capital formatting in the rural areas.</p><p>The congestion in the urban areas, unemployment and social are the out come of rural – urban migration which is brought about by the neglect of rural development. The government should realise that for a balance economic growth and development, the rural area have to be developed along side the urban areas.</p><p>This models attempts to explain the existence of substantial productivity difference among farmers in the same economics and geographic region. The model attributes the difference in production to difference in the adoption of new varieties of seeds mechanical and chemical inputs, by farmers (Olayide et al 1981)</p><p>This model of great relevance to rural development in the less developed countries like Nigeria. It introduces the idea of agricultural extension services, experimental stations and demonstration farms / farm settlements.</p><p>The model of some relevance in the development of the study area. the idea of farms settlement and demonstration farm have been experimented upon in Ezillo community the headquarters of the study area.</p><p>The problem associated with this model is that the same people are not willing to adopt modern method of farming and organization. They are skeptical about the use of fertilizer and insecticides due to ignorance in farming, there is the need to educate the farmer on the use and profitability of the new techniques. The works successfully where the farming population is educated and enlightened.</p><p>1.8.3    BASIC RESOURCE  THEORY</p><p>This theory state that economic growth and development depends on the availability of natural resource in a region. This model holds that the development of these resources attract investment capital to these areas and bring about increase in income and employment. One of the limitation of the theory is that mere availability of basic resources are not enough for economic growth to occur in a region. There has to be appropriate technology and expertise to exploit these resources.</p><p>The relevance of this model in the study area n that the government should realised the need for education and man power training for a self – reliance and economic development. The dependence of imported machinery and equipment as well as the personnel to operate these equipment does not make for a self – reliance. This goes to show why in spite of abundant natural resources in the study area hunger and disease have continued  to threaten the survival of the rural population. The prices of locally produced goods have remained higher than their imported counterparts.</p></div>\n\nRURAL MANAGEMENT AS A STRATEGY FOR REDUCING RURAL – URBAN MIGRATION IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RURAL MANAGEMENT AS A STRATEGY FOR REDUCING RURAL – URBAN MIGRATION IN NIGERIA", "id": 70}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION ON REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT</p> <p><strong><em>ABSTRACT</em></strong></p> <p><em>The effect of environmental pollution on real estate development. Environmental pollution is one of the problem affecting real estate development that needs quick attention. Due to many industries located in Nigeria there is much discharge of gaseous effluent and waste disposal. Also there is the increase of automobile which generates fumes; smoke from generating plant which is on the increase polluting the environment. This research use Warri, Delta state as a case study. The research examined the effect of environmental pollution on real estate development. It also look at the extent to which it affected the entire property and other people living around the area and suggested possible solutions.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Warri is one of the well known oil producing city in Delta State Nigeria. Warri is one of the prominent towns in the Niger Delta endowed with great natural resources.</p> <p>Oil is the primary base of Nigeria’s economy and is also the cause of major  environmental and social problems in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Over the years, oil exploration, production, and refinement in Nigeria has resulted in various environmental and ecological problems that range from oil spills, gas flares, habitat destruction, air and water pollution, and land degradation. Also, a major cause of oil pollution in that same region is also to a great extent, from the activities of illegal oil bunkering and illegal refineries operated indigenes and some highly placed individuals in government. The chemical properties of spilled oil often affect the productiveness of soil and pollute water bodies, thereby causing irreparable damage to agricultural lands as well as aquatic bodies. Gas flaring is a significant environmental and economic problem in Nigeria emits approximately 70 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually (US EIA1999). This adversely affects the socio-economic actives of local communities, which is primarily based on fishing and farming (Egunjobi, 1993).  It is estimated that in one region alone in the Niger Delta, flaring is statistically likely to cause 49 premature deaths, 5000 respiratory illnesses among children and some 120,000 asthma attacks and 8 additional causes of cancer each year ( Environmental Rights Action and the Climate Justice Programme). Another major issue ravaging Nigeria  is water pollution.</p> <p>According to Anukam (1997), the main source of water pollution in Nigeria has to do with forestry activities. Deforestation and improper soil tillage practices increase the concentration of soil particles that make their way into water bodies and in turn increases their sediment loads. The discharge of industrial waste materials into bodies of water is another major source of pollution in Nigeria.</p> <p>Discharges from industries such as petroleum, mining, iron and steel, pharmaceuticals, and textiles among others have increased the contents of sulfates and nitrates in water bodies and has altered properties such as color and odor (Adelegan 2004). A large percentage of Nigerians derive most of their domestic and drinking water from ponds, stream, and shallow wells. Hence, water pollution is a major health concern that places the health of about 40 million people at risk of diseases such as cholera, dynestery, diarrhea, and typhoid (Anukam 1997, Adelegan 2004, Orubu 2006).</p> <p>Domestic and Industrial Waste has also constituted a major source of environmental pollution in Nigeria.</p> <p>The improper disposal and ineffective management of municipal waste creates  major environmental and aesthetic problems in most of Nigeria’s urban areas. Due to overpopulation and the creation of slums, most municipal areas currently generate more waste than they can manage (Ogbonna and Ekweozor 2002).</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Irrespective of the numerous environmental laws enacted to protect the environment, environmental degradation has continued unabated. Oils pillage and gas flaring activities are still commonplace in Nigeria, especially in the oil-rich Niger Delta. Gas flaring has also continued unabated irrespective of the Nigerian government’s directive to end flaring by 2010 (Kalu, 2009). Thousands of barrels of oil have been split into the environment through our oil pipelines and tanks in the country. Enforcement of environmental regulations is still poor as industries continue to discharge untreated waste water into the environment. Heaps of refuse are always a constant sight to behold in Nigerian streets and markets.</p> <p><strong>1.3 AIM AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research work is to examine the effect of environmental pollution on real estate development in Delta state.</p> <p>However the objectives are as follows:</p> <ol><li>To identify and examine the impact of environmental pollution on real estate development in Warri.</li> <li>To make suggestions/recommendations on how to address/reduce pollution of the environment.</li> </ol> <ul><li>To identify the issues of environmental pollution in real estate development.</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Inadequate finding has restricted the carrying out of a complete and comprehensive research on the effect of Environmental Pollution on Real Estate in all the oil producing state in Nigeria. Also there is the problem of distance coverage to visit all the communities within the study are for the propose of data collection. Based on this, Warri in Delta state will be the sitting of the study and all information gathered shall be generalized in the context of research report.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONs</strong></p> <p>This research is carried out to find answers/suggestions to the following questions.</p> <ol><li>To what extent has the Nigerian government program towards reduction of the effect of pollution on real estate been actualized?</li> <li>How has environmental pollution affected the value of real estate and as such discourage investors from real estate development?</li> </ol> <ul><li>What are the solutions to the challenges of environmental pollution on real estate development?</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.7 DELINEATION OF STUDY AREA</strong></p> <p>Warri is one of the well known oil producing city in Delta State of Nigeria. Warri is one of the prominent towns in the Niger Delta endowed with great natural resources. Although it is not the capital tertiary of Delta state (Center of Activity). It is well populated and as well as such, has much commercial activity are carried out within the area. This research work shall be centered on Warri as the study area since it is used as the case study of this research.</p> <p><strong>1.8 LIMITATION OF TUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work was limited by reluctance of residence to give all information required for the purpose of this research work. Also availability of finance requirement to visit the entire community of Warri limits this work to an extent. Much time were not devoted for this research work. With this limitation, it can not be fully stated with confidence that a complete coverage was given to the project as demanded.</p> <p><strong>1.9 </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>The outcome of this research will educate the general public on the issues and the adverse effect of environmental pollution in real estate development.</p> <p>The findings from this study is going to necessitate measures that will lead to demand for improved implementation of environmental pollution control laws in Nigeria.</p> <p>This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently. If applied, it will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p><strong>1.10 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <ol><li><strong>EFFECT</strong>: is a change that results when some thing is done or happens; an event, condition, or state of affairs that is produced by a cause.</li> <li><strong>POLLUTION</strong>: Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change.</li> </ol> <p>Pollution occurs in different forms, air, water, soil, radioactive, noise, heat, thermal and light.</p> <p>Iii.   <strong>ENVIROMENT</strong>: The sum total of all surroundings of a living organism, including natural forces and other living things, which provide conditions for development and growth as well as of danger and damage.</p> <ol><li><strong>ENVIROMENTAL POLLUTION:</strong> Is defined as the release of toxic harmful substances into the environment by their natural force or man and his resources.

This work traces the history of property rating in Nigeria Local Government. It states the definition of some basic terms. The aims of property rating in Nigeria local government cannot be over emphasized. Owning to the obligations and works laid on the hand of the local government authority, they engage in tenement rating with the aim of getting the following: To increase the local government revenue, to provide the poor with the need facilities, to encourage the owners of building to develop them and development of the council unit and the purchase of big machines. Rating has been used to discourage urban decay by answering the big question of how to put cities in order. It is now noted according to the fact from Oru-West Local Government that many houses has been pulled down and new ones has been created because of effect of heavy taxation on such properties. Although rating has been noted to be the best way of getting money, there are some problems like lack of personality, skills, equipments needed etc. which are discussed in detail in chapter four of this project have been disturbing the free flow of ration of our economy.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>Title page </p> <p>Approval page</p> <p>Dedication</p> <p>Acknowledgement</p> <p>Abstract</p> <p>Table of Content</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0      introduction</p> <p>1.1      Background of the study</p> <p>1.2      The historical development of property rating in Nigeria</p> <p>1.3      Research methodology</p> <p>1.4      Some basic terms associated with Tenament rating.</p> <p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>2.0      Literature Review</p> <p>2.1      Property rating in Oru-West local government</p> <p>2.2      Need for revenue and rational for property rating</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>3.0      Method/Process of propery rating in Nigeria local government</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>4.0      Case study/Presentation and Analysis of Data</p> <p>4.1      Property rating as a source of local government revenue</p> <p>4.2      Why rating is the best means of local government revenue</p> <p>4.3      Problems of property rating in Nigeria local government</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p>Conclusions and Recommendations</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.0      <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Property rating which is also known as tenement rating is the rate or tax levied upon the owners or occupiers of properties or tenements which are rateable. It is the kind of tax or rate which is levied on the properties which are not government or publics own. Rates from the main source of revenue to the local government. The term tenement rating was not known until 1601 when the United Kingdom introduced the poor relief fund gradually, the property rating began to gain ground in the nations and especially Nigeria local government authorities which I now a great source of the local government’s finanace not only for the development of their areas of jurisdiction but to maintain these places e.g Oru – West local government is one.</p> <p>Before the introduction or rating, the local government based their realization of fund on the grants from the state and federal, borrowing from banks, Agriculture etc. and some other way of fund realiation. The fact is that the money the government got those days were not enough to pilot the affairs of their areas. They were looking for ways on which they can embark on so to get adequate money owing to the introduction of property rating, the government now have another means of getting money.</p> <p>The aim for the introduction of property rating is to enable local government realize adequate revenue that should be used in providing all the needed facilities like pipe-borne water, electricity, access roads, good streets etc. for the consumption of both poor and rich people.</p> <p>Howeer, with taxation by rate the amount of revenue required is fast decided and ths total liability is then distributed amount the tax payers or rate payers. The maount of the tax is fixed by dividing the sum to be raised by the aggregate rateable value. The basis of assessment of the property rate is the rateable value of land and buildings.</p> <p>In Oru-West local government Imo stae, the record has it that a handful of money was realized from tenement rating. This helped them more than the agricultural sector and other sectors in the area therefore, rating is of paramount help to the world and Nigeria local governments in particular.</p> <p>1.2      <strong>Historical Background of Oru-West Local Government Area</strong></p> <p>Oru-West local government was created in the year 1996 from the old Oru local government. It is made up of ten towns namely: Ohakpu, Eleh, Aji, Nempi, Ozara, Otulu, Ubulu, Amaofu, Ibiasoegbe and Mgbidi which is the headquarter of Oru-West local government area.</p> <p>It covers an area of twenty-five kilometer with estimate population of 1.4 million inhabitants. The people are mainly villagers and predominatly farmers. For instance, Eleh people and known for cassava production, Otulu are known for palm tree and plantain plantation, Mgbidi are known for poultry keeping, Aji are known for yam production, Ibiasoegbe are known for livestock keeping and management, Ozara people are known for fishing because of the large lake in their town.</p> <p>The local government council headquater at Mgbidi was built and furnished by revenue generated from property rating in the area.</p> <p>1.3      <strong>THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF PROPERTY RATING IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p>Property rating in Nigeria is not entirely new. In the public services were very few. Nevertheless roads, market places, chiefs palace, meeting squares were built and maintained with communal efforts that is, individuals in the community contributed their quota of crops and services for the up-keep and maintenance of all these facilities. These contributions were nothing more than rates.</p> <p>Our rating system in Nigeria was derived from  Britain laws. The rating law in Britain originated with the poor relief Act 1601 which provided for the levying of taxation on every occupier of land houses etc towards the relief of the poor. This law is often called the statute of Elizabeth of England.</p> <p>Property rating was first placed on the Nigeria statute book in 1915, this law was the organized place of property rating as a source of local government finance. By 1958, the 1915 ordinance was modified and amended  to form the assessment oridncance caps 15 and 16 laws of Nigeria and Lagos. In 1975, when the head of state, General Mohammed came into power, there was a local government reform that is, the various local government Edicts were enacted and this changed the property rating system. The various states were empowered to enact local government Edict that presently gae rating the legal backing with which it operates in Oru-West local government Area, Imo state.</p> <p>1.4      <strong>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>Information was collected from records pertaining to property rating in local government secretariat, Journals, Oral interviews, lectures delivered on property rating in the department of Estate management and discussions/interviews text-books and project work.</p> <p>1.5      <strong>SOME BASIC TERMS ASSOCIATIED WITH TENEMENT RATING</strong></p> <p>In the discussion of property rating as source of local government revenue one must expect to come across some of the words that are associated with ratin. In the first place let us take rating.</p> <p><strong>RATING: </strong>This is defiend as the levying of landed properties in the form of taxes on their uses, occupation and ownership which is used for the provision of facilities by the local government that is, the third tier of government in their areas of jurisdiction.</p> <p><strong>PROPERTY RATING: </strong>This is a form of taxation, it can be tax on ownership or occupation or use of a landed property i.e tenement rating it can be levy or tax on the head of any taxable adult who resides or works within a local government area that is, capitation rate. Howereer, property rating is the rate or tax levied upon the owners or occupiers of properties or tenement which are retable. Rates form the main source of internal revenue to the local government.</p> <p><strong>RATEABLE VALUE:</strong> This is the amount of money which the rate nairage is applied on after the deduction of outgoings and decapitalization amount which had been taken out from the money. For instance, if a lessor gets say N1000 as the rent. He will then remove the outgoings and the rate officers will decapitalize the amount with capitalization amount say, 5% the remaining money is the rateable value.</p> <p><strong>RATE NAIRAGE: </strong>This is the amount per naira payable as the rate on the net annual value or rateable value of a property or heeditament in  a particular year by the appropriate erating authority. This is determined by calculating the total expenditure expected too be done and then divide by the figure of the total ratable value of rateable properties or herditaments in the rate nairage.</p> <p><strong>TENEMENT: </strong>This means land with building which is help or occupied as a distinct or separate tenancy or any pier but does not include land without building.</p> <p><strong>HEREDITAMENT: </strong>The term herditament is the property which is liable to rate, it is shown in the production as a seprate item. It include all physical land and building. It is also the right or interest over a unit of a reatable property. Hereditament can be physical or non-physical from the rating point of view.</p> <p><strong>DECAPITALIZATION: </strong>This is the act of applying the decapitalize value say, 5% according to the one chosen by the government so that the rateable value can be derived. In Nigeria local government 5% is used for the decapilized amount. The aim of decapitalization is to arrive at the amount which the rate to be paid. The value gotten is known as the decapitalized value.</p> <p><strong>GROSS VALUE:</strong> This is the rent at which a hereditament might reasonably be expected to let from year to year if the tenant under took to pay all usual tenants rates and taxes and the landlord under took to bear the cost of the repairs and insurance, and the other expenses if any, necessary to maintain the hereditament in a state to command that rent on the property.</p> <p><strong>NET ANNUAL VALUE:</strong> This is an amount equal to the rent at which it is estimated that the hereditament might reasonably be expected to let from year to year, if the tenant under took to pay all, usually tenant’s rates and taxes, and to bear the cost of repairs and insurance and other expenses if any, maintain the hereditament in a state to command that rent.</p> <p><strong>ASSESSED VVALUE: </strong>The assessed value refers to the value at which the tenement is for the time being assessed in accordance with thte order made under section 106.</p> <p><strong>SCHEDULED TENEMENT:</strong> This means a tenement in any local government area in the state.</p> <p><strong>RENTAL VALUE: </strong>This is described as the open market rent paid or payable from year to year in respect of the tenement in question or as established by analysis and comparison of the general level of rent actually paid for that class of tenement in that are of locality in case of controlled properties.</p> <p><strong>RATEABLE OCCUPIER:</strong> It is not easy to give accurate and exhaustive definition of the word “occupier”, occupation include possession as it’s primary element but it also include something more, legal possession does not of it self constitute an occupation.</p> <p>        However, the owners of a vacant house is in possession and may maintain trespass against any one who invades it, but as long as he leaves it vacant, he is not rateable for it as an occupier. If howeer, he furnishes it, and keeps it ready for habitation whenever he pleases to go to it, he is an occupier though he may not reside in it one day in a year.</p> <p>        One other hand, a person who without having any title takes actual possession of a huse or piece of land, whether by leae of the owner or against has will, is the occupier of it.</p> <p>        Another element that is necessary to constitute occupation is permeanence. An itinerant show man who erects a temporary structure for his performance may be an occupier of the structure.</p>\n\nPROPERTY RATING AS A SOURCE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROPERTY RATING AS A SOURCE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE", "id": 72}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This work is about an evaluation of the role of government in solving housing problems in Anambra state. For many years housing has not receive its deserved attention in this country. Particularly Anambra state due to it popular demand and population it is hoped however that my findings would be of immense interest to the government. The report will form a good reference point of future scholars and government who may wish to conduct similar studies. I have always had this long desire to study to determine the evaluation of the role of government in solving housing problems in Anambra state.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0     INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Social scientists are yet to agree on which of the three basic needs of non-shelter, food and clothing which one comes first.</p> <p>What is beyond debate is the fact that it takes more efforts resources and planning to meet the house needs of every society. In urban centres, provision of recent and affordable accommodation has continued to test the competence of the administrators.</p> <p>Sheltr has been Universally accepted as the second most important essential human need after food. Housing in all ramifications is more than mere shelter since it embraces all the social services and utilities that go to make a community or neighbourhood a livable environment. Infact, man has been in their need of this essential commodity for his well being even the primitive men could not do without the caves, which provided shelter to them. Indeed, housing is a veritable index of measuring the social economic and technological development of a nation, “show me the quality of your people’s house and I will tell what kind of nation you are” could aptly become a maxim.</p> <p>          The simple refuse affording privacy and protection against the elements is beyond the reach of most members of human race.</p> <p>          In attempt to lessen the housing burden on the populace, various governments in Nigeria at one time to other adopted housing programmes. The policies are directed toward the production and management of climatically, socially and economically suitable housing at an affordable price.</p> <p><strong>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The research was carried out to know the role of government in solving housing problems in Anambra state.</p> <p>The research opts for the Anambra state housing development corporation as a good case study to review the success of housing for all by the government.</p> <p>Awka South Local Government Area (LGA) is made up of eight towns, namely Okpuno, Amawbia, Awka, Ezinato, Isiagu, Mbaukwu, Nibo, Nise and Umuawulu.</p> <p>Awka is the capital of Anambra state and the seat of the government: it is accessible by road form all parts of eastem region states. Nise have notable infrastructure like WAEC (West Africa examination Council) state head office and St. Paul Univeristy College situated there.</p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Housing is recognized in the world wide as one of the basic necessities of life. As every normal adult is expected to have a house both for himself and his family, but due to economic hardship being experience in the country, this basic necessity of life no longer affordably by greater majority of Nigerians various housing policies and programmes have always been partial if not a failure. It is in this context that the research has decide to carry out a survey work on the role of government in solving housing problem.</p> <p><strong>1.3            </strong><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Due to the fapid hazardous growth of Anambra state as a result of rapidly growing population, over crowding, environmental condition and the phenomenal changes in economic political and social condition, pose obvious challenges can termed to be as follows.</p> <p>1.       The provision of accommodation facilities for the teeming and ever increasing population of the state and it’s environment for commercial and residential purpose.</p> <p>2.       To acquire develop hold, manage, sell, loose or let any property moveable within the state.</p> <p>3.       Housing the homeless people of the state and providing more reasonable alternatives for those hither ot or presently poorly accommodated.</p> <p>The establishment of a home-ownership saving scheme in respect of any housing estate or building owned, constituted and managed by the corporation. The above mentioned in the aim of every succession government in the state, since the inception of the corporation.</p> <p><strong>1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objectives of the role of our government in solving housing problems in Anambra state can be summarized as:</p> <p>1.       To  highlight the role of housing in our society vis-à-vis the problem suffered form shortage and problems of housing provision.</p> <p>2.       To analyze the various ways which the government had used and are still using in the provision of housing for the teeming population in Anambra state thereby examining the historical development of government policy in the area of housing.</p> <p>3.       To examine critically and analyze the actual problems which are militating against housing production in Anambra state, including focus on their sources of finance and budget allocations.</p> <p>4.       To suggest recommendation to the problems. In big cities, like Awka, Onitsha, Enugu, Port-Harcourt, Lagos, etc because of the high influx of people to those cities and the existing housing stock not being able to cope with the increasing population, house rents have been so high, so also land prices and many low quality houses without adequate facilities were quickly springing up.</p> <p><strong>1.5     DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The write up of this thesis is limited to the available data being collected in ministry of works, housing and transport, 5 works roads, Awka, Anambra state. The constraints encountered include that of the department of architecture of the ministry of housing which declined to give out building design and layout for securing purpose.</p> <p><strong>1.6            </strong><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>HOUSING</strong></p> <p>Housing is the total unit of shelter and it’s environmental which gives man better quality of life. The term  environment in this regard comprises of three groups and this includes natural aspect of environment includes air, water, vegetable and everything natural endowed to man. The artificial aspect is things made or created by man that adds to the beauty of nature and makes life more comfortable for man, these include services such as road, electricity, sewage, pipe borne water etc. as well as other building around.</p> <p>          The final aspect is man himself. Hence, forms of housing can be grouped into or can be traced back to time to the early age, the traditional society, and the modem society. Housing can be looked at as an object where people live or an activity where people undertake.</p> <p>          Turner (1968) refers to housing as a verb and as a noun. As a verb, housing could be seen as an activity i.e people who are in one way or other partake in the building of these houses. The people are the principle actors, as a noun, it could be seen as an object produced by people.</p> <p>          Vagele (1971) said in one of his course paper that decent and adequate human shelter is one of the basic needs of the individuals, the family and the community. as the house and the residential environment have a profound influence on human health, efficiency, social behaviours and satisfaction. It also determines the level of social and economic development of a nation.</p> <p>          Ownership of house is a symbol of prestige and social stature in traditional societies and trends to roster social cohesion and a sense of belongingness. Good housing is essential for human dignity and staff fulfillment. In essence, it provides the physical frame work and the environmental values of man and society are released, enriched and integrated.</p> <p>          The quality and quantity of the housing stock is a reliable barometer for measuring and standard of living the level of technology, culture and civilization of any nation. One of primary indications of the “success” of a country is how it has housed its people. There are three basic physiological needs of human beings namely: food, shelter and clothing.</p> <p>          Housing is a complex. Product providing a combination of services that are crucial to development in both welfare and economic terms and hence the accordance of great importance in national planning and development programmes. Housing must be judged by what it does to people rather than by what it is. Any housing strategy that delivers just houses and structures instead of houses as shelter and services if not meaningful and non-functional of the study.</p> <p><strong>GOVERNEMENT</strong></p> <p>Government is broadly defined as the administrative group people with authority to govern a political state. Government is the means by which store policy is enforced, as well as the mechanism for determining the policy of the state. A form of state government or form of state government refers to the set of political institutions by which a government of a state is organized. Every successive government is composed of a body of individual who control and exercise control over political decision making. Their unction is to make and enforce laws and arbitrate conflicts.</p> <p><strong>NATIONAL HOUSING POLICY (N.H.P.)</strong></p> <p>It was approve in 1990 and launched in 1991 with the sole aim of ensuring access to decent accommodation of affordable cost to all Nigerians.</p> <p><strong>NATIONAL HOUSING FUND (N.H.F)</strong></p> <p>It encourages the development of specific programmes that would ensure effective financing of housing development in particular low cost housing for low income earners.</p>\n\n THE EVALUATION OF THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN SOLVING HOUSING PROBLEM <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  THE EVALUATION OF THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN SOLVING HOUSING PROBLEM ", "id": 73}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Housing has become one of the major problems in which individuals, private / public establishment are facing in the new state capital in Nigeria today. </p> <p>Housing do not offer shelter only but also they are considered as a status social and a successful life.

He dignity of man is usually enhanced by his ownership of house. The greater population of the world population is housed, the population that is well housed is in the minority while dilapidated houses are accommodating the greater population of the world. </p> <p>The concentration and rapid increase of population in the new state capitals is based on the few and inadequate social services in the town. The main pointer in the new state capital is the problem of a housing, houses to match the over-growing demand so as to produce rent which are reasonable to meet the community and which are equitable in terms of returns to investors in housing in the urban area and developing areas like Asaba-statistics have it that in Asaba, some areas, the home is too small to allow for decent family life and offers no more than a tiny abode to its members. Statistics also have it that urban dwelling are in general over-crowded and surrounded by a deplorable urban landscape situation. This most unsatisfactory situation is still setting hard due to the impact of population growth and urbanization, there has been a remarkable increase in recent years. </p> <p>          In the recent rate of growth of population together with a steady force of population from the rural area to the urban centres. Theres has been a rapid increase in the number of experts, administrative and technical personels as a result of improvement, changes and growth in development standard improvement in the general level of prosperity; income, living condition of people has led to people demanding more and better houses. </p> <p>          On the other hand, supply for number of reasons has not kept pace with this demand in the urban areas because of industries situated there, it has made it possible for people to migrate to these areas despite the quality of a problem in finding a means to have accommodation which is relatively cheap with the means of the rural folk and yet of sufficient high quality ot satisfy certain basic requirements. </p> <p>          Though these days, expert now live in the rural areas because of developments, it still takes time to construct dwelling house, while the buildings are under construction, they will have to accept the available ones. The housing problem out of necessity to be considered against the background of the social philosophy of the community. there are certain peculiarities associated with the economic of housings, particularly the fact that there is considerable inconsistency on both the demand and supply side of housing. </p> <p>          There is the unadulterated ‘MARXIST’ view that government should be totally committed and has a responsibility ot provide accommodation at reasonable rents must be provided for every person and so on should be allowed, for instance to take advantage of his ownership of land or wealth to exploit the tenant group in society, having said all these, it will be proper to state the problem of housing in Asaba. It is very common to see that the acquisition of and is tough in the sense that land is expensive and counted in supply and in addition, it takes a rather long time to negotiate and come by good title to land even after land must have been acquired and building erected. It is not enough because it cannot accommodate the teeming population and this ten leads to over crowding which is not good for healthy living. Buildings are over crowded and human being also are too much due to large household size and shortage of housing. </p> <p>          One point should be understood and that is of good planning, if Asaba is well planned, then the problem of housing may not be much. But because of inadequate facility utilities and amenities not been provided for. It will then be worsen when the population is much or over crowded. Come to think of it rents are very high for the good enough buildings and this does not go down well for the low income earners and this makes for an unhealthy way of living but if the government could come and build low cost houses, then it will save these dwellers from their suffering. </p> <p>          Although dwellers who can afford decent houses ot live in, it makes for the high growth of tenement, because they now resort to live in place where there is not good ventilation and the house cluster. These houses are not permanent in the sense that if there is heavy wind or rain, the building collapses and life is lost, tough because they will have to provide another accommodation or they will have to rebuild. </p> <p>          Lack of planning is another problem because since these houses are built carelessly, it does make for good planning. They do not get the go ahead from the authorities concerned, these buildings have been developed and demolished when the planning authorities find out, so it is safer to get the go ahead from the authorities concerned even though it will take so much time ot acquire but it should be worthwhile in the long run. </p> <p>          Decent housing is one of the basic need of every individual, the family and community. in general a pre-requisite to the survival of man. The housing as a unit of the environment has profound influence on the health, efficiency, social behaviour satisfaction and general welfare of the community it reflects the cultural, social and economic value of a society as it is the best physical and historical evidence of civilization in a town and country. The importance of providing adequate housing in any town cannot be over stated. It is a stimulant of the national economy. </p> <p>          Decent housing on the other had can be regarded as a right of every individuals, a great population of the population in Asaba live in sub-standard and poor housing and a deplorable, unsanitary rapid urbanization and economic growth have compounded the problem of acute population in Asaba. </p> <p><strong>1.1     HOUSING PROBLEM IN ASABA</strong></p> <p>There is therefore great shortage of housing especially for the low-income earners in Asaba. A household sample survey conducted one selected part of the town in October 1995 by the participants of this workshop revealed that about 84.46% of the housing units are flats while only 28.4% are tenement units. This has resulted in high room occupancy ration of more than five (5) persons per habitable room as recorded in parts of Umuaji, Umuezei, Egengbome in Asaba. </p> <p>          flat sharing or multiple occupation of apartment flats are measures used by those of low-income earner to redress. This often leads to the deterioration of the residential buildings and the environment. The causes of shortage of tenement house can be attributed to such factors as high cost of land by acquisition, lack of finance, high cost of building materials, and population trends, unwillingness of private developer to invest in tenement houses due largely to know returns from such development and the fact that planning schemes for some of the layout deliberately excluded tenement building eg Ezena Avenue. </p> <p>          Sitting of certain housing project (i.e portion of low cost housing) are some of the factors responsible for flooding in the city. Some draws in the Ezenei Avenue, low cost housing for example were constructed with utter disregard to the topography of the area so that water is expected to flow against the radiant. In general, the problem of housing in Asaba is more of shortage of appropriate  housing units in form of tenement or rooming houses whose rents are affordable by people in the low income level than shortage of flat apartment many of which vacant due to high rentage. </p> <p>          Also flood wreaks in Asaba, make people lose property and also the lost of five’s are encountered. These problems bring about rebuilding and displacement of occupants of the affected buildings. </p> <p><strong>1.2            </strong><strong>HISTORICLA BACKGROUND OF ASABA</strong></p> <p>Asaba is located in the eastern part of delta state with sixteen (16) local government area. A rapid developing urban centre and the administrative headquarter of Delta state in Nigeria. Its historical roots is from both Kogi and Anambra state. </p> <p>A woman named Diaba from Agbakuba village in Nteje, Anambra state, was said to have been impregnated by Onojobo, a prince and trader from Igala land, while she was residing in Eze Anyanwu’s court as one of the court girls. She was said to have hailed from the royal line of Ezechima, the legendary ancestor of numerous settlements east of the Niger, including Onitsha. This explains why Benin, Asaba and Onitsha seem to share a common culture and tradition as in the area of festival regalia like traditional coral beads and hand-woven big flowing white gowns and traditional titles scuh as the Onowu Iyasele of Onitsha and the Iyase Onowu of Asaba. Asaba is one of the emerging urban centres of present date Nigeria. Before the creation of Delta and Ado state, Asaba was the headquarter of Oshimili south local government which has a limited political significance. After the creation of Delta state and Asaba as the headquarter continue to attract many governmental functionaries such as ministries and all types of government parastatals thereby swelling up in population increase, in working class people. </p> <p>Today, Asaba is experiencing greater housing problems than ever before and it is feared that impact may take some time to subside. </p> <p><strong>1.3     PROBLEMS OF LAND ACQUSITION FOR HOUSING </strong></p> <p>Before the land use Act of 1978, ownership of land was rested on individuals and community which result to cumbersome and obstacles to individuals willing to acquire an interest in land. The alnd use Act stopped private owners and individuals form owning land rather having possession on it in perpetuity. It rested all land in the power of the governor of each state. Before a private individual acquires and interest in land from the state governor, he has to undergo series of protocol before he can be issued with a right of title or certificate of occupancy to use and enjoy the relevant piece of land usually evidence in certificate of occupancy (C OF O). </p> <p>          The system and process of securing title to land is unsatisfactory and cumbersome. As a first step towards this, the private individual has to buy a form which contains some questions to be completed and submitted before specified time. The authority concerned with the processing and insurance of this certificate of occupancy often make situations difficult for the developer who would otherwise which to make immediate development. this is because the certificate of occupancy consume a lot of time before it can be issued to a developer. The next stage after the processing of the form is that, those that have been approved are rent to the governor for endorsement and whereby governor is busy, he can then assign this duty of endorsement to the commissioner of lands, works and transport, who endorses his signature with a red wax to show its validity. </p> <p>The successful applicant is then given a certificate of occupancy to use and enjoy the land subject to the conditions and covenants contained in the said certificate. </p> <p>The logic being the issue of condition and covenants is that only authorized occupier can develop, enjoy or lease the land but subject of course to the zoning and planning laws and other regulations affecting land use, in relevant urban area. it is now clear from the foregoing that housing is militated against by the problem of land acquisition in Asaba. </p>\n\nTHE PROBLEM AND PROSPECTS OF HOUSING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROBLEM AND PROSPECTS OF HOUSING", "id": 74}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The subject of this research investigation is “The Role of Internal Auditor and the method of Internal Control in Local Government in Enugu state specifically.

The federal government has also recently revamped and restructured the local government system to enable it perform its role of promoting, co-ordinating and implementing community services enhancing citizens participation and maximizing the use of local resources. Enormous amount of money of flowing to the local government form the federation account (    ), the of the state internally generated revenue and the revenue of the local government.</p> <p>The federal government of Nigeria came up with a financial instruction in 1979, instructing all local government to set up internal audit unit in each local government. But the behaviour and attitude of operation of local government system resulted in many local government not setting up internal audit unit or if set up. They were not functional. The federal government in 1988 set in motion a real ware of change. A real frame work of internal auditing in the local government was spelt out in order to make it less difficult for management of the local government as the greatest contributing factor to the poor performances of local government.</p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM:</strong></p> <p>The local government has three broad sources of revenue, they include: direct from the federation’s account, of internally generated revenue of the state government and revenue generated internally by the local government her self. The internal sources available to the local government area include: rents from market stores, royalties paid by some residents company in a local government contractors registration, sales of car/bus emblems, etc.</p> <p>Since the local government has a whole lot of possible sources of revenue, the problems therefore include,</p> <p>a)       How can efficient management controls be achieved?</p> <p>b)      What is the role of internal auditing in ensuring this control?</p> <p>c)       How can the internal auditing be made a useful tool management control?</p> <p><strong>1.3     OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>a)       The researcher intends to find out, the role of auditors and the method of internal control in local government.</p> <p>b)      Whether the function of the internal audit department are performed in compliance with the established standards and policies and how much it has succeeded in achieving the objective of the local government.</p> <p>c)       In the end, the researcher shall establish some acceptable benefit that may be derived from effective audit control system</p> <p><strong>1.4     RESEARCH QUESTIONS:</strong></p> <p>a)       Do Udi Local government Area have an internal audit department?</p> <p>b)      If internal auditing helps to know how the polices of management were executed?</p> <p>c)       Can the duties of the internal auditor be performed by either the accounts division or the external auditor who must be statutory?</p> <p>d)     Do all the internal auditors of the local government area report to the auditor general, through the executive chairman of their local government area?  </p> <p><strong>1.5     RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS:</strong></p> <p>In the research work, the following hypothesis were formulated, tested and analysed in solving the research problem.</p> <p>Ho:    The internal audit department helps the accounting system of the local government.</p> <p>Hi:     The internal audit department does not help the accounting system of the local government.</p> <p>Ho:    The internal audit department does not help to prevent fraud and improve revenue position.</p> <p>Hi:     The internal audit department helps to prevent fraud and improve revenue position.</p> <p>Ho:    Reporting to the auditor general, through the executive chairman of the local government makes the internal auditor perform his fiduciary duties diligently.</p> <p>Hi:     Reporting to the auditor general, through the executive chairman of the local government makes the internal auditor not to perform his fiduciary duties diligently.</p> <p><strong>1.6     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>This research is on attempt to survey the constructive parts, which internal auditing can play in the local government system in Nigeria with particular reference to Udi Local government Area of Enugu State.</p> <p>A lot of problems are facing the local government area as not having an effective audit central system one of these problems is the management seems to gloss over the operation of the local government, which are carried out in disorganized manner. The researcher was motivated to choose this topic because of his belief that if management of Udi local government, an efficient management which is pre-requisite for high productivity will be assured.</p> <p>This is so because an efficient control system will enable the management to monitor the performances of the executives and take necessary and adequate corrective actions to ensure high performances of the executive and take necessary and adequate corrective actions, to ensure high performances at all levels.</p> <p><strong>1.7     SCOPE OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>The scope of the study is limited to Udi local government area of Enugu state. This is because of the limited time available for the researcher for the submission of the report and the financial involvement of the scope is further widened. Furthermore, from the related literature review, it was observed that there were enough bases for generalizing the result of the study.</p> <p><strong>1.8     LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study has been limited by a number of factors notable among the limitations was our people’s poor reaction to research questions and reading meaning into any attempt at any form of interview.</p> <p>One of the vital documents needed for this investigation could not be supplied because it was audited account for 2007 and 2008 financial year.

The objective of the study is to know whether the function of the internal audit department are performed in compliance with the established standards and policies and how much it have succeeded in achieving the objectives of the local government. The methods of data collection were interviews, direct observation and study of secondary materials. In analyzing the data collected, percentage and some formulated hypothesis were used. The major findings of this study are: That Udi Local Government Area has an Internal audit department, that internal auditing helps to know how well the policies of the management are executed, that the duties of the internal control be performed by either the accounts division or the external auditor who must be statutorily appointed, that all the internal auditors of the local government report to the auditor general, through the executive chairman of the local government area. The researcher hereby recommends that internal auditing should be employed in local governments, because it will help immensely in management control.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>Title page</p> <p>Approval page………………………………………………..………………i</p> <p>Dedication …………………………………………………………..………ii</p> <p>Acknowledgement………………………………………….………………iii</p> <p>Abstract……………………………………………………………..………iv</p> <p>Table of contents……………………………………………………….……v</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1            Background of the study ……………………………..………………1</p> <p>1.2            Statement of problem…………………………………………………2</p> <p>1.3            Objective of the study…………………………………...……………2</p> <p>1.4            Research questions……………………………………………………3</p> <p>1.5            Research hypothesis……………………………………………..……3</p> <p>1.6            Significance of the study………………………………………..……4</p> <p>1.7            Scope of the study……………………………………………….……5</p> <p>1.8            Limitation of the study…………………………………………..……5</p> <p>1.9            Definition of terms……………………………………………....……6</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p>2.1            Introduction……………………………………………………...……8</p> <p>2.2            Theoretical framework………………………………………..…..…11</p> <p>2.3            Current Literature review………………………………………..…12</p> <p>2.4            Summary of Literature review…………………………..……..……34</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</strong></p> <p>3.1            Research design……………………………..……………………….39</p> <p>3.2            Area of the study……………………………………………….……39</p> <p>3.3            Population of the study……………………………………..……….39</p> <p>3.4            Sampling method…………………………………………..…..……39</p> <p>3.5            Research Instruments…………………………………………..……40</p> <p>3.6            Validity and Reliability of research Instruments……………………40</p> <p>3.7            Sources of data………………………………………………..……41</p> <p>3.8            Method of investigation. …………………………………..…..……42</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR: ANALYSIS OF DATA PRESENTATION</strong></p> <p>4.1            Data presentation and Interpretation…………………………...……43</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION</strong></p> <p>5.1            Summary of findings ………………………………………………50</p> <p>5.2            Conclusion …………………………………………...………..……50</p> <p>5.3            Recommendation ………………………………….…………..……52</p> <p>References……………………………..……………………….……55</p> <p>Appendix A ……………………………..…………….…………….56</p> <p>Appendix B………………………………………………...…..……57</p> <p>Questionnaire ………………………………………...………..……58</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>The new civil services move with designed to make the service more functional professional, productive and responsive to the socio-economic needs of the nation. The federal government has also recently revamped and restructured the local government system to enable it perform its role of promoting, co-ordinating and implementing community services enhancing citizens participation and maximizing the use of local resources. Enormous amount of money of flowing to the local government form the federation account (    ), the of the state internally generated revenue and the revenue of the local government.</p> <p>The federal government of Nigeria came up with a financial instruction in 1979, instructing all local government to set up internal audit unit in each local government. But the behaviour and attitude of operation of local government system resulted in many local government not setting up internal audit unit or if set up. They were not functional. The federal government in 1988 set in motion a real ware of change.

The study adopted survey research design, due to the nature of the enquiry. To achieve the purpose, the researcher raised some objectives, research questions and literature review, for an in-depth study of the formulated topic. The population of the study was drawn from the organization, under investigation and sample size taken through Yaro Yamane. The sources of data were through primary and secondary to get the accurate information in the field. The data gathered in the field were analyzed, using simple percentage, frequency table. The researcher recommended that the organization should engage in the service of qualified personnel officers and make use of company’s laid down policies and procedures in the interest of the staff and goals of the organization.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER 1</strong></p> <p><strong>                                      INTRODUCTION        </strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   Background of the study</strong></p> <p>The focus of this research is on the contributions of human capital management towards the achievement of organizational goals. </p> <p>Human capital management is a branch of management concerned with the recruitment of development, control and welfare of the staff of the organization. It has to do with the promotion or dismissal of staff.</p> <p>The point therefore in what value does this branch of management play to help the organization achieve its sets objective.</p> <p>        Some people argue that with or without human capital management the business organization can still achieve the business objectives.</p> <p>        According to Okorie (1992) who wrote in the business firms of February 9, 1992” such practices as human capital management studies seems to be merely academic exercise as good interpersonal relationship in organizational is imbued by nature and should be acquired by training. He went further to the example by saying that “such successful business as Omouka inter-business, the makers of rocket nails, sprang up and have been sustained by school nor read any personal management.</p> <p>Since they can still succeed without it, in other words human capital management has nothing to contribute to the efficient running of business organization to achieve goals.</p> <p>On the other hand Ibekwe (1984) say that since management itself means working with and through people, it is necessary to understand the word efficient way to work with the entire staff, management has something to contribute the good management of organization for the achievement of their broad goals.</p> <p>It is therefore, the position of this research to solve the above conflict. The research should ascertain whether or not the human capital management has only goals. It has to make this contribution if human capital management has no contributions to make, the research will ascertain why, despite its effectiveness, i.e. widely employed in many modern business organization.</p> <p>In addition, in every organization, there are three major resources to be managed if the organization wants to achieve its objectives and goals. These resources are humans, materials and financial resources. And out of these three, human resource management is the most important and difficult to manage. The reason being that every human being is born unique and therefore is bound to have different characteristics i.e. the ways they think, feel, reason and act.</p> <p>Secondly, human beings control and co-ordinate the other resources. They constitute the workforce of an organization and are referred to as personnel. Since human nature plays a very major part in the overall success of an organization, it is therefore important to have an effect working relationship between the employee and the manager as this is essential for the success of the organization. </p> <p>Human capital management, which involves the efficient and effective management within an organization, is one of the vital functions of Educational Administrators is because every administrator has a function to perform through this staff and his own abilities. Every university like other formal organizations needs human beings to execute its programs and achieve educational goals and objectives. To be able to achieve this, the Registrar who is the chief of administration has to ensure that personnel with whom the works knows what to do, when to do it and how to do it. Another name for HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (H.R.M) is HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT. No matter the name; we chose to call it, its basic function is to deal with people who make up an organization. And these people have diverse interest, goals and values.</p> <p>        Akpakwu (2013) regards human capital management as the proper utilization of the people in an organizational goal. To this extent, it involves understanding the nature of people in an organization, their needs and aspiration and evolving the necessary strategies to accomplish these needs and aspirations. It also involves identifying the objectives of the organization. </p> <p>        Armstrong in Akpakwu (2003) sees human capital management as the process of obtaining, organizing and motivating the human resources needed in by an organization. He advocated for the creation of a very conductive and cordial environment in order to satisfy the needs of the workers and achieve organizational goals. </p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>        It is true that many business organizations have succeeded without acquiring the formal knowledge of human capital management. But it is true that many of these organizations could have record more successes if scientific human capital management was applied in them. </p> <p>The efficient of such organization would have trained or at least doubled in the presence of human capital management. Problem remains that we need t ascertain the extent roles human capital management plays to help these organizations achieve their objectives. There is the need to determine the most important; it can contribute towards the organizational efficiency.</p> <p>Therefore, the problems of this study are posed as a question, they are:</p> <p>1.          Does human capital Management contribute anything to the achievement of organizational goals?</p> <p>2.          What are the ways of making these contributions?</p> <p>3.          Does good human capital management improve productivity?</p> <p>4.          Can efficient human capital Management change workers attitude to work?</p> <p><strong>1.3 Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The major purpose of this study is to assess at the role of human capital management towards the achievement of organizational goals. </p> <p>Specific objectives that guided the study are: </p> <p>1.          To identify if there are human capital management contribution to the growth of NNPC Company.</p> <p>2.          To examine the mode of contribution to the company</p> <p>3.          To identify if human capital management  improve productivity </p> <p>4.          To examine if Human capital management training affect the attitude of staff in the organization</p> <p>5.          Determine if Human capital management generally improve the efficiency of the organization. </p> <p><strong>1.4 Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>This study examines the effectiveness of human capital management in the achievement of organizational goals  .</p> <p>The findings and suggestions from this research work will help different sectors of business organizations lacking in human capital management to see the need of capital management to be implemented in their organization.</p> <p>        Finally, this research work is of strategic important to students and other researchers in the same area of study and it will also serve as a spring board or reference materials for other scholars in their own research work.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Research Questions</strong></p> <p>For the purpose of this research study, the researcher has adopted the following research questions:</p> <p>1.          Does human capital management in any way contribute to the achievement of organization’s goals?</p> <p>2.          Does effective management contributed to the achievement of organizational goals?</p> <p>3.          Would effective human capital Management improve productivity?</p> <p>4.          Does human capital management positively change workers attitude to work?</p> <p>5.          Does quality human capital management generally improve the efficiency of organizations?</p> <p><strong>1.6 Scope/Delimitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>The research limited to the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporations “NNPC’ Port-Harcourt as the case study. The research will be conducted in the corporation. The conferment of the researcher NNPC was informed by the fact that it would be possible to carry out the research in all the Business organization in the country.</p> <p>Therefore, the affairs of a given company or corporation needs to be studied and used as reference to obtain what implies to other firms in the country.</p> <p><strong>1.7 Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Human Capital Management</strong>: This is concern with the formal system for management of people within the organization with greater emphasis is place on planning, controlling, organizing, coordinating and others.</p> <p><strong>Management: </strong>This is the complementation of all the component of the organization control in one place in order to bring about efficiency and effectiveness in the organizational aims and objectives and does the process of determining the appropriate organizational structure.</p> <p><strong>Organization: </strong>This is a group of people that work together with aims and objectives to achieve organizational goals.</p> <p><strong>Efficiency: </strong>This is the ratio of actual outputs to actual inputs.</p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS ", "id": 76}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>It is always known that cleanliness is next to godliness and health is wealth Good health is achieved if there is good management of the environment. <br/>The need for a good management of the environment cannot be over emphasized since there is a continuing environmental decay as a result of increased urbanization. <br/>Pollution is a major problem of urbanization of which most of the causes have been identified as industrial combustion, solid waste generation, oil spillage disposal etc. since these causes are inevitable; there is need for a good control of them. In this project there will be a critical look at solid waste management situation with special focus on Ogbete main market Enugu. <br/>The project, which is required for the attainment of ND programme, will be divided into five chapters. <br/>The chapter one, which is the introductory part of the project, the statement of the problem is intended to be those associated with solid waste management problems, which may include health hazard, ditty environment, blockage of drainage system etc. In the main study, all those problems will be discussed intensively.<br/>The purpose of this project which will be treated in the main project will center on identifying the importance of such management and all the various strategies of checking excessive solid waste generation and management in the market in particular and Enugu city in general. <br/>The background and need for the study will focus on past experiences of solid waste of management and problems associated with it so as to know how to improve subsequent situation. From all those information one can make some hypothesis, which can be either positive or negative at the end of he study. <br/>In the chapter two, the project is intended to review some literatures on the subject matter, which takes the form of books, paper, journals, etc. here there will be a though review on some related topics such as solid waste management, policies on solid waste management, generation, classification and importance of solid waste management. These are expected to be extracted from library and other sources.<br/>The chapter three will deal mainly on research methodology and design. Here the sources of data i.e. Primary and secondary sources will be highlighted.<br/>Primary sources have to do with questionnaires, direct interview etc which secondary sources have to do with information from libraries, books, journals and magazine etc. Some statistical models such as bar chart, pie chart, and histogram will be used to present this data in a specific manner. <br/>The chapter four has to do with data presentation and analysis. Here field data collected are analysis and presented in a format to achieve analytical conclusion. Statistical analytical methods are to be used here to arrive at scientifically conclusions. <br/>Chapter five deals on findings of the reseach, recommendation he prefer to tackle solid waste management problems in the study area and conclusions. </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br/>Empirical evidence ranks Nigerian as one of the countries world that produces high qualities of solid waste. This phenomenon is predicted on her over increasing population complied with sophistication in taste and demand for domestic and industrial goods by her urban population. The uncontrolled generation and disposal of these wastes have deteriorated our otherwise conducive urban environment. Virtually all cities in Nigeria are characterized by helps or mounting of solid wastes. The health implications of this development on our urban streams, health and socio-economic development leave much to be desired. <br/>The realization of good health, hygiene and sustainable development in any society is practically impossible when pollution by way of solid wastes impact strongly on hers socio – economic, cultural and environmental settings. <br/>Policy markers, leaders of though and political office holders are daily confronted with endemic problems of what to do with mounting heaps of solid wastes in our urban environment. Many choice properties by virtue of their proximity to dump sites have deteriorated significantly and this has serious negative effect on their rental and capital values. <br/>The present scenario depicts a state hopeless as virtually all Agencies of government entrusted with managing the wastes especially ENSEPA seems to be at cross road on what to do.</p> <p><strong>1.1 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS </strong><br/>Solid waste management is a very difficult task, as we all know. It creates a lot of problems to people which include:- drainage blockage (flooding), traffic jam, health hazard and unsightly environment. <br/>In addition, environmental pollution in urban centers due to solid wastes is a matter of serious concern to the international community, for pollution in any form interferes with our good chain, health, comfort, amenities, properties values and living standards. <br/>Today, all businesses are affected by both environmental changes and government effort towards controlling these changes.</p> <p><strong>1.2 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>The main purpose of this study is to access solid waste situation in the citizen of Nigeria, more especially in Ogbete main market Enugu. More over the research aims at finding out what should be done in order to reduce the health hazards and of the increasing menace of solid wastes in our market and cities.</p> <p><strong>1.3 BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR THE STUDY </strong><br/>Urbanization, which is the purpose of people’s aggregation in cities, has witnessed tremendous increase in recent times. Most cities now in Nigeria have grown to full-scale urban status. The implications of urbanization is manifested in the areas of unemployment, inadequate social amenities due to undue pressures on the available ones by teaming population, increase in crime wave, sophistication and changes in demand and taste complied with high consumption on industrial and domestic goods leading to large volumes of solid wastes. <br/>The presence of the solid wastes in our city environment without effective waste collection and disposal machinery has left most of these cities in solided state and their implications on the health of urban. It leaves much to be desired hence the need for this study.</p> <p><strong>1.4 THEORETICAL FOUNDATION OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>This study is based ion W. Wilkie, Jodan’s Topical hygiene and sanitation theory, which state “that the collection and disposal of refuse and waste matter is any integral part of effective sanitation exercise. <br/>From the above view and theory, any effective waste management packaged for proper address of our solid waste hydra headed problems benefit all individual main market.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTION </strong><br/>The following research questions wee formulated to guide the study. These include: <br/>1. How do you dispose your solid waste? <br/>2. Are there any waste bins in your shops? <br/>3. How often is waste evacuated from your day? <br/>4. Do you sort your waste before disposal? <br/>5. Are there sufficient equipment and manpower?<br/>6. Are the storage, collection and transportation in Ogbete main market dumps from individual shops? <br/>7. How far are waste dumps from individual shops?</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE OF STUDY </strong><br/>The study is therefore restricted to solid waste management in Ogbete main market. The scope of study is created into two sections:- <br/>a. Delimitation <br/>b. Limitation</p> <p><strong>1.6.1 DELIMITATION </strong><br/>This study reviews solid waste management problems in Ogbete main market.</p> <p><strong>1.6.2 LIMITATION </strong><br/>One of the things that the researcher encountered in the course of the study was time factor. <br/>The researcher was also limited in this study due to lack of reading materials in school library, magazine, journal, literature and books to read were handicaps. <br/>Another factor that confronted the researcher during his field survey was the un-cooperative action of the respondents.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>1. The major significance of this study is that it will help in no small measure to maintain efficient and effective waste management system of the study area. <br/>2. Furthermore, it will help in improving the environmental condition of Ogbete main market. <br/>3. The findings of this study will also form the basis for further investigations in this study area. <br/>4. Finally, it will help in the prevention, reduction and control of the disease associated with solid wastes and food poisoning.</p> <p><strong>1.8 OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>For effective coverage of this research it is divide into five (5) chapters made up as follows: <br/>Chapter one deals with the statement of the problem, purpose of the study, background and need for the study, the theoretical foundation of the study, research question, scope of study, significance of the study and overview of the study. <br/>Chapter two is the literature review. This chapter deals with the view of relevant literature by authorities in environmental and solid waste management. <br/>Chapter three is the research design and methodology, which gives the step-by-step procedure adopted in carrying out the study. <br/>Chapter five is the finding, recommendation and conclusion of the study. </p>\n\nSOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT", "id": 77}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION </strong><br/>The land use Decree No. 6 of 1978 otherwise popularly called Land Use Act was promulgated on 29th March, 1978, the effective date of the commencement of its operation in Nigeria. It is a statutory approach or device used by the federal government to consolidate and harmonize the diverse tenures prevalent in the country before the promulgation. It aims at ensuring the protection of the rights of all Nigerians to enable them to provide for the sustenance of themselves and their families.<br/>It abolished the age long tradition of private ownership of land in the south and introduced a uniform system of land tenure through out the country.<br/>Land tenure under this dispensation means that; one can not have an interest in land beyond the terms granted to him by the statute (usually 99 years) and such interest is renewable on expiration.<br/>The act vests all land comprised in the territory of each state (except land vested in the Federal Government for its agencies) solely in the hands of the military governors of the state who would hold such land in true for the people.<br/>Finally, the promulgation of this Act was as a result of two main factors;<br/>Firstly, was the diversity of customary laws on land tenure and difficulty in applying the various customs of the different peoples.<br/>The second factor was the rampant practice in southern Nigeria with regards to fraudulent sales of land. The same land would be sold to different persons at the same time giving rise to so many litigations.</p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>Land being the most universal, most valuable, probably the most controversial assets, the one and the only foundation of all human activities, requires a planned system of holding, control and regulations so as to avoid misuse and abuse of rights thereof. <br/>In the words of Taslim O. Elias, (a renowned Jurist). “The indigenous system does not admit that land can ever be without an owner” indeed, if land (Real property), were to be a “res nullius” (something belonging to none), it will be valueless in the economic sense, there will be no question of compulsory acquisition, purchase, revocation and subsequent compensation. It way not be out of place to suggest that without valid control and regulation, ownership of land may depend purely on the physical strength of an individual or how violent the person can be. Such situation will definitely be anchoretic. <br/>This work therefore unraveled the effects of Land Use Act, 1978 to prospective investors on real property (land), estate surveyors, private individuals etc, particularly in Enugu urban.<br/>Since its promulgation however, the land use Act has been under intense fire as virtually almost every part of it has been criticized. The Act hardly went down well with traditional Nigeria, mainly because of the factors of interest in communal land ownership comprising several dead ancestors, relatively few living members and countless unborn generations. Many of their forefathers and mothers lost their lives in the process of acquiring the lands and were buried there. Unless their bodies and bones are exhumed, it remains a taboo to leave those lands. One therefore observes the existence of several motives and circumstances attracted to land ownership. In traditional Nigeria, many of which are non – economic and therefore cannot assuaged monetarily since the owners do not sale, alienate or part with land as freely or easily as other commodities. <br/>Professionally speaking, land and its attributes, features and components embodies value – in – encounter.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong><br/>From the above discussions, certain questions might be identified that certainly, needs answers. They include;<br/>1. Is the land use decree 1978 (now Land Use Act) implemented to its fullest apart from over use of such powers by state governors?<br/>2. What are the problems associated with the techniques for valuing properties compulsorily acquired for compensation under the act?<br/>3. What is the effect of the Act on compensation?<br/>4. What adjustments should be done to the compensation, revocation of rights of occupancy for overriding public interests, allocation of land for Agriculture and grazing sections of this Act?<br/>5. What should be the appropriate technique for valuing properties compulsory acquired for compensation purposes under the Act?<br/>6. What should be the appropriate technique for zoning of land and building and valuing properties compulsorily acquired compensation purpose under the Act?<br/>7. What effect has the Act posed on the price mechanism of land and buildings?</p> <p><strong>1.3 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES </strong><br/>The objectives of this research would be as follows:<br/>a) To ascertain whether the powers exercised by the state governors under Land Use Act and the general over – view of this Act pose a threat to effective land use. <br/>b) To identify the possible problems associated with property development as a result of the Act.<br/>c) Suggesting the necessary adjustments that need to be made to the revocation, compensation of rights of occupancy in sections of this Act, in order to promote property development.<br/>d) Suggesting an appropriate technique for valuing properties compulsorily acquired under the Act.<br/>e) To suggest the right professional capable in assisting the government on land transactions and other improvements on land.<br/>f) Suggesting towards ensuring adequate compensation for a revoked right of occupancy.<br/>g) Finally, proffering ways of reflecting the realities of social, traditional and economic norms posed by the Land Use Act to the modern society.</p> <p><strong>1.4 SCOPE OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>This work unraveled the roles of Land Use Act in property development in Enugu Urban.<br/>Four zones of Okpara Avenue, New Haven, Achara Layout and Ogui layout are sampled due the large ladn mass.<br/>These four zones are where property devleopmens are more pronounced. Although lands within Enugu Urban are revoked by the public bodies for overriding public interest without putting it for what it was revoked for. The scope of the study therefore uses the four zones to represent other areas in Enugu urban where property developments take place.<br/>Such rights of communal land owner and property owners were usurped by the government thereby reducing their rights of occupancy to 99 years lease instead of allodia or absolute ownership.</p> <p><strong>1.5 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY </strong><br/>This research work was highly tideous, though extremely educative. The researcher therefore, encountered constraints during the course of this project especially finance, which made him redistrict the study to certain areas. <br/>Again time factor limited this study as I shared time among the project and other academic work. More so, the commitments of the researcher to the welfare of Estate Management Association (EMA) IMT as the president slightly delayed this work.<br/>The provisions of the Land Use Act are too extensive to be compressed into few pages. For the purpose of this study, only the arrangements of sections and the provisions pertaining to valuation and its effects are covered.<br/>Although the scope of this work was limited by time and finance, the researcher was able to carryout the work to completion.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY </strong><br/>The study of the Land Use Act No. 6, 1978 with eight (8) parts and fifty one (51) sections is the most significant land policy currently in force in Nigeria. The study will be of benefit to the government o its planning control and property acquisition procedures.<br/>Most intending property development are scared by the compensation tedinque if a property is revoked by the governor for overriding public interest, hence, this study will assist the developers for prudent appraisals.<br/>State surveyors and values coded apply the result of this research. Work in their future valuation for compulsory acquisition and in their advisory role to the public. Students and lecturers in Estate management Professional will not find this work insignificant as it explained areas of controversy in this act.<br/>With this input in Estate Management Professional, property developers will increase geometrically as recommendations preferred in this work will improve the compensation receivable by them in the event of revocation of their property rights by public bodies.</p> <p><strong>1.7 BASIS OF THE RESEARCH STUDY </strong><br/>The basis of this research is solely on land use. The speculators, private investors, the estate surveyors and valuers, farmers etc. who normally perform daily activities on land to earn their livings.<br/>With these cadres of works of life, one can easily detect the negative and positive impacts of the Land Use Act to the entire society.</p>\n\nEFFECT OF THE LAND USE ACT IN PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF THE LAND USE ACT IN PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT", "id": 78}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This dissertation deals chiefly with an analysis of the effect of the provision of housing estate on residential housing delivery with a case study of world bank housing estate Owerri. <br/>The key impetus for this research on the analysis of the effect of the provision of housing estates on other residential house in this particular area of study arises from its sudden changes in states. <br/>This study examines the effect of this changes on the physical environment and the population of the study area with particular emphasis on the area of provision of residential units and the provision of basic social amenities and infrastructures as be pithy the advancement in the status of the world bank housing estate. <br/>This also examines the sole aim of provided housing estate and the its effect on other residential houses in the area study.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>Housing is seen as one of the most important for the physical survival of man after the provision of food. It contributes to the physical and moral hearth of a nation and stimulates the social stability, the work efficiency and the development of the individuals. But in spite of these facts there is on doubt that housing in quantitative terms is still one of the major problems facing the Nigerian Urbanities and governments beside the characteristic slums and conditions it is becoming increasingly difficult for average Nigerians to own houses. Also it is very difficult to procure decent accommodation at reasonable rent in the market. The rent are high in each state and fairly high in the other state capitals, but still not commensurate with the monthly in comes of all categories of low, middle and upper wage earners and the self-employed.<br/>The major cause of high rent is that the supply of housing is fair less than demand. The recommended 20 percent of the monthly income on rent. The problems are more acute in those cities and towns where ad commercial and industrial activities have long been established, fast growing and concentrated cities. To find houses to rent is a big problem and if such houses are eventually found, they are let out at very exorbitant prices that take a large percentage or the monthly income of the acceptant not minding the location and the accessibility of the residence to the place of work. Until recently for an was becoming exceedingly very difficult for an average wage earner as well as the self –employed individuals to build houses of their own within a long period of time say ten years through their private savings. Most civil servants in Nigeria between 1978 and 1988 cloud hardly make some savings not to take of building houses of their own. Also, the cost of building materials is very exhobitant, cost of land, labour and professional fees are very high which has led to the situation whereby the construction cost per square meter is far more than what an individual could meet after the provision of food and other social needs. <br/>Also due to the fact that individual cannot own houses of their own as a result of the high construction cost involved, it has contributed to people hiring at very exorbitant rates because there are more buyers one of housing good than the supply of those goods and services. The effect of this housing shortage mostly predominately in Urban areas not only led to over crowing in several cities, it has also led to many taking shelter under the bridges, schacks and make shifts (as in the case of lagos). The most unfortunate thing is that the existing residential buildings are not suitable to modern needs and lack in converses such as water closets (Wcs),P,Pe-borne water, power supply, open spaces etc. the situation prompted the united Nations to launch the aggressive programme of shelter for all in the year 2000.<br/>To achieve this, the federal government of Nigeria incorporated it in the Nation’s third development plan (1975-1980) and sought to participate actively in the provision of housing for all income groups achieve significant increase in housing supply and bring relief especially to the low income earners and the self- employed who where the most affected by the acute shortage a situation whereby the Urban worker paid over 20% of his monthly income on rent. This has led to the provision of Estates by both the federal and the state government in order to increase the housing stock available to the Urban population. It is on this background that this work tries to examine the effect of these housing Estates on Residential Housing Delivery.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENTS OF PROBLEMS</strong><br/>Government all over the world especially in developing countries embarks on the provision of housing Estate for their Wizens, this is usually to argument housing provision by the private sector of the economy. Although these estates were established by law and status, they present management problems inducing legal, physical, Financial, social – political and other problems such that in recent time management of public housing Estate has presented hydra-headed problems. These problems manifest themselves in the form of dilapidated buildings, poor sanctuary and environmental condition all resulting from poor management and lack of maintenance.<br/>This cleary, the crux of the housing problems in Nigeria today relate to the low income groups which constitute the main elements of both Urban and rural population with all these factors mentioned above one sees the housing problems in general as the problems that motivated both the federal and the state government, the Imo state government and the Imo state Urban and housing corporation and all the other state government and housing corporations to formulate their housing programmes. This is because good residential housing gives room for more production.<br/><strong>1.3 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>The main aim of this research work is to evaluate the effect of housing estate on the residential housing provision in the Nigerian Urban cities: To achieve this aim the following objectives are set out. <br/>(1) To identify the various housing estates in the study area.<br/>(2) To determine the quantity (number)of houses provided through the Imo housing corporation in Owerri <br/>(3) To determine the effect of these housing Estate on the residential housing provision <br/>(4) To identify problems and constraints of the Imo housing corporate in the provision and management of these housing Estates.<br/>(5) To recommend ways of ameliorating the problems in (4) four above with a view of providing more housing Estate in the urban area.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONNAIRES </strong><br/>1. Mention various housing estate in Imo state Owerri<br/>2. What is the quantity number of housing provided by the Owerri housing co-operation? <br/>3. What are the effect of these housing estates on the residential housing provision?<br/>4. What are the problems encountered by the Owerri housing co-operation in the provision and management of these housing estates?<br/>5. Recommend ways of ameliorating the problems with a view of providing more housing estates in the urban area.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>It has often been argued that the distribution of residential housing ownership, specifically among the working class, increased support for the ownership of private property in general and areasthesises housing as an area of social structure pound on capitalist private enterprise. <br/>To further buttress this point residential housing delivery in Owerri has made the individuals and low income earners to enjoy its role in stimulating national economy, its social services or significance and its financial and economic importance to individuals. Such services provided in that area include provision of shelter or accommodation, provides collateral security for loans / mortgage loans, durable goods which can be inherited, contributes to physical development, source of social prestige / status, provides employment opportunities, investment – which yields a flow of income it checks cost of housing reengage in the city, provision of schools, hospitals, recreational centers etc.<br/>Therefore, since the need for shelter or accommodation is very universal, its significance or importance is very obvious. The importance of residential housing cuts across nation or political boundaries and it is a staminate to good health and individual productivity. This citizens of any nation who dwell in decent housing will enjoy good health, be productive and thus contribute positively to the growth of their nation’s economy. As we look at the social significance of housing to man, its role in the economic development of a community or individuals, we would be able to fully appreciate the importance of residential housing to man which is really the focus of this topic.</p> <p><strong>1.6 THE SCOPE OR STUDY </strong><br/>This project is limited to the analysis of the effect of the provision of housing estate on residential housing delivery using the World Bank Housing Estate Owerri as a case study- However this work is not concerned with provision and development of Housing Estates.</p> <p><strong>1.7 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>It is universally acknowledged that the conduct of a research from beginning to conclusion involves varying degrees of discomfort and pain staking effort. <br/>The first problems related to difficulty in obtaining finance to commence and conclude the research in reasonable time true to the general observation that finals for worthwhile pursuits rarely come easy. But thank God it come in just in time through.<br/>Another side of the coin concerning data collection was where government officials were willing to help but were hankered by lack of relevant data concerning the area of need. Also worth data were not available due to the relevant data were being used for the official purposes. <br/>Finally, the risk and transport cost involved during the research.<br/><br/><strong>1.8 OVER-VIEW OF THE STUDY</strong><br/>This project comprises of five chapters the first chapter is the introduction comprising statement of the problems purpose of the study, Arms and objectives, significance of the study, scope and limitation of the study research Question and over –view of the study.

He dignity of man is usually enhanced by his ownership of house. The greater population of the world population is housed, the population that is well housed is in the minority while dilapidated houses are accommodating the greater population of the world.</p> <p>The concentration and rapid increase of population in the new state capitals is based on the few and inadequate social services in the town. The main pointer in the new state capital is the problem of a housing, houses to match the over-growing demand so as to produce rent which are reasonable to meet the community and which are equitable in terms of returns to investors in housing in the urban area and developing areas like Asaba-statistics have it that in Asaba, some areas, the home is too small to allow for decent family life and offers no more than a tiny abode to its members. Statistics also have it that urban dwelling are in general over-crowded and surrounded by a deplorable urban landscape situation. This most unsatisfactory situation is still setting hard due to the impact of population growth and urbanization, there has been a remarkable increase in recent years.</p> <p>In the recent rate of growth of population together with a steady force of population from the rural area to the urban centres. Theres has been a rapid increase in the number of experts, administrative and technical personels as a result of improvement, changes and growth in development standard improvement in the general level of prosperity; income, living condition of people has led to people demanding more and better houses.</p> <p>On the other hand, supply for number of reasons has not kept pace with this demand in the urban areas because of industries situated there, it has made it possible for people to migrate to these areas despite the quality of a problem in finding a means to have accommodation which is relatively cheap with the means of the rural folk and yet of sufficient high quality ot satisfy certain basic requirements.</p> <p>Though these days, expert now live in the rural areas because of developments, it still takes time to construct dwelling house, while the buildings are under construction, they will have to accept the available ones. The housing problem out of necessity to be considered against the background of the social philosophy of the community. there are certain peculiarities associated with the economic of housings, particularly the fact that there is considerable inconsistency on both the demand and supply side of housing.</p> <p>There is the unadulterated ‘MARXIST’ view that government should be totally committed and has a responsibility ot provide accommodation at reasonable rents must be provided for every person and so on should be allowed, for instance to take advantage of his ownership of land or wealth to exploit the tenant group in society, having said all these, it will be proper to state the problem of housing in Asaba. It is very common to see that the acquisition of and is tough in the sense that land is expensive and counted in supply and in addition, it takes a rather long time to negotiate and come by good title to land even after land must have been acquired and building erected. It is not enough because it cannot accommodate the teeming population and this ten leads to over crowding which is not good for healthy living. Buildings are over crowded and human being also are too much due to large household size and shortage of housing.</p> <p>One point should be understood and that is of good planning, if Asaba is well planned, then the problem of housing may not be much. But because of inadequate facility utilities and amenities not been provided for. It will then be worsen when the population is much or over crowded. Come to think of it rents are very high for the good enough buildings and this does not go down well for the low income earners and this makes for an unhealthy way of living but if the government could come and build low cost houses, then it will save these dwellers from their suffering.</p> <p>Although dwellers who can afford decent houses ot live in, it makes for the high growth of tenement, because they now resort to live in place where there is not good ventilation and the house cluster. These houses are not permanent in the sense that if there is heavy wind or rain, the building collapses and life is lost, tough because they will have to provide another accommodation or they will have to rebuild.</p> <p>Lack of planning is another problem because since these houses are built carelessly, it does make for good planning. They do not get the go ahead from the authorities concerned, these buildings have been developed and demolished when the planning authorities find out, so it is safer to get the go ahead from the authorities concerned even though it will take so much time ot acquire but it should be worthwhile in the long run.</p> <p>Decent housing is one of the basic need of every individual, the family and community. in general a pre-requisite to the survival of man. The housing as a unit of the environment has profound influence on the health, efficiency, social behaviour satisfaction and general welfare of the community it reflects the cultural, social and economic value of a society as it is the best physical and historical evidence of civilization in a town and country. The importance of providing adequate housing in any town cannot be over stated. It is a stimulant of the national economy.</p> <p>Decent housing on the other had can be regarded as a right of every individuals, a great population of the population in Asaba live in sub-standard and poor housing and a deplorable, unsanitary rapid urbanization and economic growth have compounded the problem of acute population in Asaba.</p> <p>1.1     HOUSING PROBLEM IN ASABA</p> <p>There is therefore great shortage of housing especially for the low-income earners in Asaba. A household sample survey conducted one selected part of the town in October 1995 by the participants of this workshop revealed that about 84.46% of the housing units are flats while only 28.4% are tenement units. This has resulted in high room occupancy ration of more than five (5) persons per habitable room as recorded in parts of Umuaji, Umuezei, Egengbome in Asaba.</p> <p>flat sharing or multiple occupation of apartment flats are measures used by those of low-income earner to redress. This often leads to the deterioration of the residential buildings and the environment. The causes of shortage of tenement house can be attributed to such factors as high cost of land by acquisition, lack of finance, high cost of building materials, and population trends, unwillingness of private developer to invest in tenement houses due largely to know returns from such development and the fact that planning schemes for some of the layout deliberately excluded tenement building eg Ezena Avenue.</p> <p>Sitting of certain housing project (i.e portion of low cost housing) are some of the factors responsible for flooding in the city. Some draws in the Ezenei Avenue, low cost housing for example were constructed with utter disregard to the topography of the area so that water is expected to flow against the radiant. In general, the problem of housing in Asaba is more of shortage of appropriate  housing units in form of tenement or rooming houses whose rents are affordable by people in the low income level than shortage of flat apartment many of which vacant due to high rentage.</p> <p>Also flood wreaks in Asaba, make people lose property and also the lost of five’s are encountered. These problems bring about rebuilding and displacement of occupants of the affected buildings.</p> <ul><li>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF ASABA</li> </ul> <p>Asaba is located in the eastern part of delta state with sixteen (16) local government area. A rapid developing urban centre and the administrative headquarter of Delta state in Nigeria. Its historical roots is from both Kogi and Anambra state.</p> <p>A woman named Diaba from Agbakuba village in Nteje, Anambra state, was said to have been impregnated by Onojobo, a prince and trader from Igala land, while she was residing in Eze Anyanwu’s court as one of the court girls. She was said to have hailed from the royal line of Ezechima, the legendary ancestor of numerous settlements east of the Niger, including Onitsha. This explains why Benin, Asaba and Onitsha seem to share a common culture and tradition as in the area of festival regalia like traditional coral beads and hand-woven big flowing white gowns and traditional titles scuh as the Onowu Iyasele of Onitsha and the Iyase Onowu of Asaba. Asaba is one of the emerging urban centres of present date Nigeria. Before the creation of Delta and Ado state, Asaba was the headquarter of Oshimili south local government which has a limited political significance. After the creation of Delta state and Asaba as the headquarter continue to attract many governmental functionaries such as ministries and all types of government parastatals thereby swelling up in population increase, in working class people.</p> <p>Today, Asaba is experiencing greater housing problems than ever before and it is feared that impact may take some time to subside.</p> <p>1.3     PROBLEMS OF LAND ACQUSITION FOR HOUSING</p> <p>Before the land use Act of 1978, ownership of land was rested on individuals and community which result to cumbersome and obstacles to individuals willing to acquire an interest in land. The alnd use Act stopped private owners and individuals form owning land rather having possession on it in perpetuity. It rested all land in the power of the governor of each state. Before a private individual acquires and interest in land from the state governor, he has to undergo series of protocol before he can be issued with a right of title or certificate of occupancy to use and enjoy the relevant piece of land usually evidence in certificate of occupancy (C OF O).</p> <p>The system and process of securing title to land is unsatisfactory and cumbersome. As a first step towards this, the private individual has to buy a form which contains some questions to be completed and submitted before specified time. The authority concerned with the processing and insurance of this certificate of occupancy often make situations difficult for the developer who would otherwise which to make immediate development. this is because the certificate of occupancy consume a lot of time before it can be issued to a developer. The next stage after the processing of the form is that, those that have been approved are rent to the governor for endorsement and whereby governor is busy, he can then assign this duty of endorsement to the commissioner of lands, works and transport, who endorses his signature with a red wax to show its validity.</p> <p>The successful applicant is then given a certificate of occupancy to use and enjoy the land subject to the conditions and covenants contained in the said certificate.</p> <p>The logic being the issue of condition and covenants is that only authorized occupier can develop, enjoy or lease the land but subject of course to the zoning and planning laws and other regulations affecting land use, in relevant urban area. it is now clear from the foregoing that housing is militated against by the problem of land acquisition in Asaba.</p>\n\nTHE PROBLEM AND PROSPECTS OF HOUSING IN THE NEW STATE CAPITAL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROBLEM AND PROSPECTS OF HOUSING IN THE NEW STATE CAPITAL", "id": 81}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The word land means different things to different people and in different context.

Land is of tremendous importance to man because it is basic of all his endeavours. People look to land for their physical environment, for the food they eat and other materials needed to clothe their bodies and to provide housing and manufactured goods, for building sits, for recreational activities and for scenery and open space.</p> <p>“Also, it is the very foundation and framework upon which social, political and economic activities of a nation function”. The explains why there are emotional, spiritual and financial attachments to land in Nigeria.</p> <p>“The word land means different things to different people and in different contexts”3 has been variously defined by different disciplines. An ordinary person may regard land as a piece of the earth’s surface and its sub – soil. From economic point of view; it is a key factor in production and an economic good characterised by scarcity, utility and transferability. Land to the lawyer on the other hand is not the virgin, rent – bearing soil and other natural resources of economic theory, it is much more. “It includes all corporeal things subjacent and superjacent to the soil and annexed there to”4. The  legal view of land does not only include, visible and tangible structures and object (corporeal hereditaments), but also includes intangible and abstract objects (incorporeal hereditaments ). Land, in the language of the property and conveyancing law of Western Nigeria includes.</p> <p>Land of any tenure, building or part of building, whether the division is horizontal, vertical or made in any other way, and other corporeal hereditament; and also a rent an d other incorporeal hereditaments, and an easement, right privilege or benefit in, over or derived from land.</p> <p>Human life and society as we know cannot exist without land because it is the base of all human activities as no development takes place without it. For centuries, most wars were taught for the possession of land, and the average with the soil, field, forest and fishing  that provide him with sustenance. This, right in land were often the key factor that determined an individuals economic, social and political status. “It is also regarded as the link between the dead, living and the unborn of a family hence its inalienability”5. “As a result it is regarded as a taboo to sell land acquired through inheritance”6. Therefore, where the motive of a land owner is spiritual, the loss of property cannot be adequately compensated for by cash payment or offer of an alternative land.</p> <p>It is an obvious fact that compensation for land compulsory acquired is not always paid on time. When cash payment are made such payments prove inadequate to compensate for the property compulsory acquired.</p> <p>However, this can be redressed by removal of unnecessary bottle – necks in the procedure, and the setting up of effective appeal machinery  to lubricate the wheels of compulsory acquisition and compensation machinery in Nigeria.</p> <p>1.1    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>Land is of tremendous importance to man because it is basic to all his endeavours – all economic and human activities ultimately depend on land. that is to say land is a special natural resource that forms the foundation of all human activities as no development takes places without it.</p> <p>In Nigeria, acquisition of and compensation for interest in property is statutorily controlled in accordance with the provisions of the land use Decree (1978) among others. In acquiring land for developmental project, there are bound to  be problems which in some cases affect the rate of development in the area.</p> <p>In practices, there is evidence especially in remote village that the natives grumble because compensation for land is no more paid to them as was the case before the promulgation of the land use Decree. So, they do not even known that the land is now vested in the government.</p> <p>Compensation for the properties compulsory acquired are not promptly paid by some acquiring bodies. They delay in compensation payment greatly subjects the occupiers or owners to serious financial problems and  inconveniences. Even the puzzling basic of compensation has given rise to legal actions and disturbance of activities at the Akure Airport.</p> <p>In such cases, negotiations is struck between  the two parties and the amount agreement is deposited. Disputes also rose over ownership of economic trees.</p> <p>In addition, t her is the problem of threat to the lives of the field employees during acquisition.</p> <p>1.2    AIMS OF OBJECTIVES</p> <p>The aim of this study is to explore:</p> <ol><li>The evolution of compulsory acquisition  in Nigeria with a detailed discourse on the provisions of the land use Decree on acquisition and compensation for privately owned lands.</li> <li>To resolve the conflicts surrounding the acquisition and compensation of land in the Akure Airport through suggestions and recommendation in this work.</li> <li>The problem associated with the acquisition and compensation of this study.</li> <li>Draw inference from available primary and secondary data to alleviate these problems encountered during acquisition of land and compensation.</li> </ol> <p>1.3    SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</p> <p>Research involves investigation. The outcome of which is knowledge. The knowledge could be on addition or a new idea. The significance of a research work in man’s search for knowledge and understanding is so basic that it seems necessary to stress its importance in the field of eminent domain. This study covers areas of land acquisition, payment of compensation, land resources.</p> <p>This work therefore, will be of some interest and relevance to the Nigeria land owner and potential and owners. Professional in environmental fields; and students of Estate Management, Urban and Regional Planning and law will find this work useful.  This study will be of importance to the policy makers in public and private sectors. The government and oil companies will not be left out in benefiting from this study.</p> <p>1.4    RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</p> <p>The data used in the production of this dissertation are derived from two broad sources; VIZ –</p> <p>Primary Sources:  These are original sources of raw data collected in the process of investigation. The necessary data or information required for this study were collected under this source.</p> <p>The ministry of land and housing which is the government agent responsible for the exercise of power of compulsory acquisition, was interviewed.</p> <p>Secondary Sources:   Information derived from this sources are basically form text books, government publication, maps and newspaper were used in this study.</p> <p>1.5    LIMITATION AND SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>Research on compulsory acquisition and compensation is a length and complicated process that cannot be dealt with exhaustively in such a limited space like this dissertation.</p> <p>In the light of this, the study is limited to compulsory acquisition and compensation of Akure Airport, Ondo State and inference made there is also about Nigeria as a whole.</p> <p>Compulsory acquisition and compensation is a very broad subject. Its practice spans throughout  the country. But for purposes of detailed interview this study is restricted to Akure Airport. For purpose of this study, analysis is limited to economic tress and houses.</p>\n\nPROBLEM OF COMPULSORY ACQUISITION AND COMPENSATION UNDER THE LAND USE ACT OF 1978<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEM OF COMPULSORY ACQUISITION AND COMPENSATION UNDER THE LAND USE ACT OF 1978", "id": 82}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>One of the basic necessities of life which are food, shelter, water and Air is of great importance to humans most especially in public buildings where there is high traffic and congestion most of the time. Research has shown that people spend about 90 percent of their time indoor since the majority of people’s daily activities take place indoor, the atmosphere inside of public building has a major impact on the health and safety of majority of the population can actually have more damaging effects on health than pollution in the air outside. This necessitates the need for cross ventilation in public buildings because it helps to mitigate these health risks while also protecting the public buildings.</p> <p>A public buildings could be church, mosque, schools, or hospital, which holds a large crow for a number of reasons and etc. and if proper care is not taking in public buildings, which is always crowded needs to be supply the occupants with good ventilation so as to prevent suffocations; and there is a  needs for cross ventilation in public buildings more so,  Maslow 1943 opined that  cross ventilation is of paramount importance for human existences as consider the core basic needs and necessities. He further posited shelter and food security and water as essential ingredients that nourish the psychological and mental frame of mind of human, and when this basic needs are met; human beings level of productivity increases up to the next stage of quest for better living condition. According to O’ Brien 2016, ventilation is critical to home comfort. Proper ventilations prevent air pollutants from affecting the health of you and your family. Not only that having air flow in your home can get rid of any unwanted smells, such as from cooking and pets. It is also good to have an air flow that is uninterrupted, as anything blocking the air in your homes can Cause damage to both your homes and your health. In relation to the discussed, this research lingered on ascertaining and the assessment of cross ventilation in public buildings.</p> <p>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>According to Pultar 1999, the architectural space and circulation, carefully designed and planned space make architecture what it is, the space that we live in move through and use. Studies of space are formed in many disciplines, where they have different meanings. it is a concept that is central to many different areas of studies has varied meanings, ranging from totally abstract motion such as mathematical space, to physical ones such as astronomical space to more earthly ones, such as they expanse that surrounds us, to behavioral notions such as territorial space and personal space. This great variety of possible types of space makes the definitions of space in planning and design difficult. Generally speaking, however is a three</p> <p>Dimensional extension of the wall around us, the intervals, distances and relationship between people and things. Architectural space is defined as subsets of three dimensional extension of the wall around us such that it is entered by man, includes definite material element, especially a base that allows one to perceive its boundaries and its perceive as a whole, serves human functions of habitation, shelter or circulations and is internationally build or appropriated by man to serve such functions, (Pultar 1999). According to O’Brien, 2016, one of the reason ventilation is so important is because it controls how much moisture in lingering in your home. If have you have adequate air flow throughout your home, your walls, floors and all the wood in your home would stay dried and not collect moisture wood can rot when exposed to moisture, as can dry wall. If you let moisture build in these areas of your homes, they would not only destroy the structural integrity, but they would also cause mold to build up. Mold can have a number of negative effects on your health, if you are exposed to it for a long time. One fundamental reason is that a building provides a means of molding various elements of the natural environment, which we sample with one five senses (feelings, seeing, hearing, smelling and testing). Our senses enable us to experience heat, light, sound, odors and thus determine the character of natural and built environment. Our experience of environment is determined specifically by our capacities to sense the several types of energy the surrounds us. Radiant energy (light, thermal energy; heat) and mechanical energy (sound). And, although odor is not specifically manifested as an energy form, it is affected by thermal and possibly mechanical–energy. (Heerwagen, 2004). An architectural space is used to shape and express identity. The notion of architectural space should also be understood to include structures of space that is sets of spaces so interrelated to each other that the functions they  serve extends through these spaces.(Baxter and Martin, 2010). According to O’Brien, he posits that if you are exposing to molds for a long time, you might notice some minor symptoms, such as irritations for your nose, throats and eyes. You might possible develop a headache or a fever if you are exposé for a longer period of time. Mold can both cause immune system problems and worsen the symptoms for someone who already has an auto immune disease. For prolonged exposure to mold can result in respiratory damage; that can’t be reversed such as Asthma. If have proper ventilation in your home, you won’t have to worry about mold forming. An important characteristic of an architectural space is man’s involvement in its generation and his partaking of life in it. As an architectural planning process, it is described as communications among differentiated spaces and between the exterior and the interior which may be achieved by openings alone in the simplest plans, but most buildings requires a distinct spaces allotted to horizontal and vertical circulation such as corridors, lobbies, stairs, rams and elevators, to mention a few. These are designed by the procedures of analysis employed for differentiating uses, since their functions can be different (Pultar, 2009).</p> <p>MOTIVATION</p> <p>The interest to carry on this research work was triggered by the fact that churches, schools and hospitals are tagged and is known to be public building which host large crowds and therefore natural cross ventilation is very key in achieving comforts and also prevents suffocations; and other air bone diseases.</p> <p>Therefore, it is indispensable to supply the building with fresh air, and insufficient ventilation can cause tiredness, lack of concentration or headache. Cross ventilation offers the means to control air quality in buildings, haven witnessed the even that took place in one of these churches in Jos North area of Plateau State, it was so terrible at a point one may have lost his or her life. In trying to get the fact on the occurrence, I found out that, the people who were directly involved and affected said that, suddenly there was a teargas by the police men around the church premises, and because of the crowd and lack of ventilation in the church many people almost lost their lives. It is on this note that ventilation as it were, is very important in human life and gave rise to the need for this research work.</p> <p>1.3    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>It is the aim of the study to analyze the level of performance of natural air Ventilation with a case study of some Churches, Schools and Hospitals in Jos North Area of Plateau State. The absence of professionals left many people incapacitated, I discovered that most buildings in Jos north Area of Plateau State were not built by professionals. In view of the aforementioned, the research will linger in identifying how can the erection of building follow setting standards and established guidelines that would put human safety(health), human comforts and guaranty proper cultural heritage and thereby guaranteeing a qualitative and sustenance of good standard of living, with respect to provision of basic necessities of life (like food and shelter).</p> <p>1.4       AIM OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The aim of this study is to facilitate Cross ventilation in Public Buildings.</p> <p>1.5       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The aim of the study is to be achieved through the followings objectives;</p> <ol><li>Investigate the current trend.</li> <li>Proper Orientation of buildings with respect to their openings.</li> <li>Provide good fenestration so as to facilitate good ventilation and lightening in buildings.</li> <li>The use of landscape as microclimate control.</li> </ol> <p>1.6       SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Due to some constraints which includes; financial constraint, time constraint and geographical constraint, the researchers focused on practices and effects of cross ventilated public buildings citing the research work to Jos metropolis as the research findings can be used for proper solutions to erecting of buildings in Nigeria in retrospect</p> <p>1.7       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The findings from this research will hopefully give an understanding of how to achieve cross ventilation in public buildings. The information gotten from this study shall provide a guide which can be used towards achieving good cross ventilation as it relates to sustainability.</p> <p>1.8       RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</p> <p>The study would examine the existing literature related to the topic subjected in review. The study would adopt a survey method in form of questionnaires because it gives the opportunity to make inferences about the characteristics of a population which is the purpose of the study.</p> <p>The following means would be employed in the collection and collation of the data for this research work: the data obtain for the research work subjected and tested by the use of statistical tools and statistical means of analysis, the statistical tool employed were to be analyses descriptively.</p> <ol><li>Primary data: personal study carried out through the collection of data in the form of questionnaires administered to the occupants of public buildings and site investigation as well.</li> <li>Secondary data: data sourced from various books, articles, journals written on the subject of appraisal.

In this proposed project is highly essential that  schools should be provided and skill acquisition program since most problem faced by the displaced person in camps are mainly lack of educational and skill acquisition training.</em></p> <p><strong>1.1  </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The world overtime has experienced several disasters, natural ranging from floods, hurricanes, landslides and others; and man-made like wars. These tragedies have result in an increased number of people from their homes and means of livelihood, posing a difficult challenge to the world at large.At the beginning of 2007, there were an estimated 24.5 million people, hounded out of their homes by war or persecution, in at least 52 countries. As outcasts in their own lands, they often have very limited legal or physical protection and face an uncertain future <strong>(</strong>UNHCR 2007<strong>)</strong>, by the end of 2014 it was estimated 38.2 million IDPs worldwide, the highest level since 1989, and the first year for which statistics on IDPs are available.<strong> (</strong>“UNHCR – Global Trends –Forced Displacement in 2014”. UNHCR. 18 June 2015.<strong>).</strong>It is very difficult to get accurate figures for IDPs because their population are not constant, IDPs may be returning home while others are fleeing, others periodically return to IDPs camp to advantage of humanitarian aid.<strong> (</strong>IDMC 2006).</p> <p>Africa remains the continent with the highest number of people who have been internally displaced. In 2011, IDMC (internal displacement monitoring centre) monitored displaced persons in the sub-Saharan African countries. There were an estimated 9.7 million IDPs existing in these countries, representing over a third of the world total internally displaced population. Having access this IDPs camp, it was discovered that this camp lack essential services such as water, shelter, healthcare and education (IDMC 2011).</p>\n\nINTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS CAMP<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS CAMP", "id": 85}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Several studies have postulated that the accessibility of a location affect the values of properties in that location.

Therefore, this study has shown that accessibility has significant impact on residential property value in New Haven Layout, Enugu and its environment. It has enlightened the tenants on the important of living in an area with good infrastructural facilities.</p> <p><strong>1.1   </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>At the foot of the Milliken Hill ridges lies Enugu, the then Capital of east-central state of Nigeria Enugu, which literally means ‘’hill top’, derives its name from its position among the Udi hills on an attitude of 689.8feet above sea level, area of 28.27 square meters with population of 722,664 according to 2006 census (Wikipedia, 2016) and close to two million according to 2015 estimates (Wikipedia, 2016).</p> <p>According to ministry of information Enugu state (2002), Enugu owes its existence to the discovery of a rich seam of coal at east of Ngwo village in 1909 by a geological exploration team led by a British Mining Engineer W. J.Leck arrived in Enugu with a group of labourers from Onitsha led by Mr Alfred Inoma.W.J.Leck and his white assistants made their first home in temporary mud house on top of the Milliken Hill ridge in what is now known as the Hilltop, while the indigenous labourers established their own settlement on a super 200feet up the ridge and was called Alfred Inoma.</p>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF ACCESSIBILITY ON RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY VALUES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF ACCESSIBILITY ON RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY VALUES", "id": 86}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study investigated the differentials that exist in rents between town center and peri-urban in bukuru.

It is a basic need for human survival and an essential component to the advancement of the quality of life of the citizenry. This universally accepted fact has been acknowledged by successive Nigerian government, as evident from the pockets of in coordinated initiatives and programmes in mass housing development over the years. Despite these efforts, differences in housing rent remain a major challenge.</p> <p>Effective housing rent involves many actors and therefore requires effective partnership collaboration and information the significant shortfall in housing provision and rent has been attributed to the inadequacy of the existing national housing policy (1991) to meet current challenges and economic trends and to guide development in the sector.</p> <p>Housing, in all its ramification is more than mere shelter, since its embraces all the social services and utilities that goes to make a community or neighbourhood a  livable environment the problem of housing in Nigeria are enormous and complex, exhibiting marked regional differences furthermore, the challenges faced by the rapid rate of uncontrolled and unplanned urban growth are immense. Million of people lives in sub-standard and sub-human environment characterized by slumps, squalor and grossly inadequate social amenities. The problem of housing in our urban centres is not only restricted to the quantity of housing unit, infrastructure, the disparity in housing rent and the environment, the result is manifested in growing overcrowding in homes, neigbourhoods, communities and increasing pressure on infrastructural facilities such as roads, drainages, power supply and rapidly deteriorating environment.</p> <p>The scenario is slightly different in the rural areas where the problems are primarily, not just that of inadequate quantity of housing unit, but also that of inadequate and poor infrastructural facilities such as roads, drainages, water, power supply, differences in housing rent and basis social amenities (Schools, health care facilities etc.)</p> <p>The housing sector is the bedrock of the economy of developed nations. In the more advanced economies like the United States of America, Great Britain and Canada. This sector contributes between 30% and 70% of their Gross Domestic Product (G.D.P) investment for housing account for 15% to 35% of aggregate investment worldwide, the housing sector in Nigeria contributes a significant 0.38% to its G.D.P. these countries rose to become the greatest advanced economies on the tide of housing development, the housing sector has the potential to general employment, increased productivity, raised standard of living and alleviate poverty. It also has the capacity to reduce crime rate, militancy, terrorism and substantially address wealth distribution as well as security concerns. It is able to achieve this because investment in housing affects all facets of our life.</p> <p><strong>1.1                 </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Shelter is invariably the most basic of man’s need for survival after food in order of importance. Overtime, man has made use of elements in his environment skillfully to provide dwelling units for himself and his family, although a house is not a home, it exerts an enabling influence through its natural and physical location, on a variety of services made available, some of which includes health, education and recreation, public utility services such as power supply, transportation, sewage disposal and economic services such as work opportunity and income. Monetary value placed on these variables is usually in form of house rent or house sales. It is therefore, expected that differences in these services as regards house to house would also result in difference in their rent.</p> <p>           Market forces of demand and supply could also cause differential in house rent in the Nigeria housing market today.</p> <p>           According to the law of demand and supply “the higher the demand for particular goods or services, the higher the price for that goods or services”, that is under a price system. Competition for housing unit tends to increase the price of rent placed on such housing unit, housing problem in Nigeria, like those other developing countries are essentially urban-oriented. This is necessitated by man’s craving for greener pasture and better livelihood, causes an enormous demand for housing in urban centres far exceeding the available number in existence.</p> <p>           Rapid urban growth caused by migration of people from rural areas and other towns to urban centres, this trend of migration is usually associated with an accelerated temporal of social economic development of activities in urban centres and its result of activities in high rent as a result of shortage of dwelling unit which is as a result of demand for housing units at different spatial locations varies, hence differences in house rent is inevitably.</p> <p>           Jos South as a whole, lie every other cities in Nigeria has a high level of attraction for both indigenous and foreign migrant not only is it because of its high economic activities but also it has a conducive weather for learning and the demand for house is much more cheaper and affordable compare to other city centres like Lagos, Port Harcourt and Abuja.</p> <p><strong>1.2                 </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The problem of this study could be characterized by specifying the major ramification (aspect) of the various components that interact to constitute the observed residential rent differences in Bukuru.</p> <p>At present, Bukuru serves as one of the major urban centre in the Jos-Plateau and this is accompanied by the massive influx of people and their business to the city, housing demand supply resulted from the uncontrollable influx of people into the city.</p> <p>The security challenges in Jos in these recent times are a factor to be considered in which an individual would tend to live for safety and this is mostly influenced by the individual’s religion. In this case, the safe areas within the town tends to attract more people migrating from unsafe places thereby causing massive influx of people in such areas thereby leading to high demand for residential housing, thus, leading to high rent.</p> <p>On the other hand, places that are considered unsafe attract fewer prices for house rent because the supply for such houses is more than the demand for such housing unit.</p> <p>An acute shortage of residential houses in the area tends to have a negative and positive influence in particular on house rent generally, and in certain locations that could probably account for any differentials in house rent that may exist between Bukuru and its suburb.</p> <p>In view of the development, the problem of this study is posed in terms of the following questions:</p> <p>1.          What are the differentials in house rent between town centre and pen-urban in Bukuru?</p> <p>2.         What are the factors that account for the spatial disparity of house rent in the study area?</p> <p>3.         What is the socio-economic characteristic of the residents of the study area?</p> <p>4.         What is the monthly income of the household head of individual households in the study area?</p> <p><strong>1.3                 </strong><strong>PROBLEM DEFINITION</strong></p> <p>Housing study or housing rent is a complex undertaking that a single study frame cannot be adequately used for effective assessment. Onibokun 1971 opined that in the evaluation of housing rent the coverage should include the tenants (residents), the dwelling (housing) unit, and the environment (in which the dwelling forms a part). In the Nigeria third National Development Plan (1975-1980) residential rent was regarded as a basis index in the study of qualitative and quantitative deficiency in residential accommodation and also as an indication of the level of overcrowding. It has also been one of the indices that have been used in the provision of housing units especially in urban areas where rapid population growth associated with increased socio-economic activities has seriously aggravated the shortage of housing unit in Nigeria.</p> <p>Housing rent varies from one nation to another and within a particular country, variations in climate degree of urbanization, socio-economic progress affect housing rent.</p> <p><strong>1.4              </strong><strong>PROBLEM FORMULATION</strong></p> <p>The market forces of demand and supply interacts strongly to bring about differentials in house rent. The higher the demand for house in a location, the higher the rent for such houses in that location and vice versa. Other factors such as accessibility, housing quality, environmental quality etc. it could also interact to affect demand for houses and subsequently house rents, the market force for housing supply is usually slow in responsiveness to the market force of housing demand (Ball 1983) thus, the differentials in house rents are demand based. These factors and how they affect house rent and variations are discussed in the following sections below.</p> <p><strong>1.      </strong><strong>Housing quality</strong></p> <p>The quality of a house can be determined by the flow of services its provides, this includes the number of rooms, the  size composition and choice of materials in building, availability of internal amenities (pipe-borne water, kitchen, water closet and bath) and also house design. Longetivity of a house in terms of age and quality also enhances the quality of house. Hence, the quality level of a house is a function of the rate at which that house is demanded. Thus, rent of houses with higher quality becomes higher than those with lower quality.</p> <p>Since the qualities of houses differ with location a spatial difference in house quality would lead to reasonable differences in rent.</p> <p><strong>2        </strong><strong>Environmental Quality</strong></p> <p>            This refer basically to the external surrounding and conditions of a housing environment, the environment provides vital needs for man such as air, peacefulness, cleanliness, security and socio-economic status of neighbours, drainage, topography etc. the better environmental quality of a house and its location, the higher the demand for such houses or location and a corresponding increase in the rents of such residential house or location.</p> <p>            Bukuru, however, has a relatively high environmental quality hence differences may not be compared with other surrounding in the state. The quality of any given environment cannot be continuously uniform through space and time; it is a function of differences in people and quality, this result in spatial differences in house rent.</p> <p><strong>3  Housing Supply</strong></p> <p>            The number of houses made available as required by individuals or household in a population at a given time is referred to as housing supply in most cases the supply of housing space in a function of the profit maximizing behaviour of the builder during construction, rent of a house differs with the attribute the builder decides to supply (Butter and Beckmann, 1977).</p> <p><strong>4        </strong><strong>Housing Demand</strong></p> <p>            Migration into Jos is a basic catalyst to the insatiable demand for houses in Bukuru. However, provision of housing space has not been matched by the demand in house rents in various neighbourhood of Jos.</p> <p>            Another factor is the income level of individuals working in Jos. Increase demand for accommodation certain neighbourhood are also a function of the income level of individuals, hence a cluster in some neighbourhood with reduced average rent in contrast with neighbourhood with higher rents.</p> <p>            Income level of occupants is the major controlling factor that heightens the rents and rent differences in various locations, however housing demand is at equilibrium with housing supply.</p> <p><strong>5        </strong><strong>Housing Location</strong></p> <p>            The location of a house is valued in terms of its accessibility to place of work, to central business district and neighbourhood infrastructural facilities. The greater the accessibility of a location (and the lesser the economic cost of movement in terms of distance, time and convenience) the greater the comparative advantage of the location and thus the greater the demand for houses in that location. Therefore, attracting higher house rent since location exhibit spatial variation in terms of accessibility, house rent would also vary spatially.</p> <p><strong>1.5              </strong><strong>  AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF  THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to look at the residential rent differentials between town centres and peri-urban in Bukuru, Plateau State and in achieving this, the following objectives are to be taking into consideration;</p> <p>1.      To identify the factors that most influence any such rent differentials in the study area.</p> <p>2.      To determine the factors that influence any differentials of residential houses rent that may exist in the study area.</p> <p>3.      To determine to what extends each factor influences any differentials of house rent in the study area.</p> <p>4.      To determine the relationship between the residential housing rent and the income classes of the household head in the study area.</p> <p><strong>1.6              </strong><strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of this study looks at the differences in rent of residential housing in Bukuru town and it’s peri-urban. Some of the variables that were examined are the socio-economic characteristics of the household Head such as income, sex, marital status, occupational status, and age. The Study also cover reasons and time of immigration to Bukuru as well as the type of houses occupied.</p> <p>         The study is limited to residential houses and it is only 1 bedroom, 2 bedrooms, 3 bedrooms and 4 bedrooms houses types that was considered in this study because they are the most available in the study areas.</p> <p>         The study is to exclude temporal variations of house rents although differences in residential house rent may exist in the temporal dimension too.</p> <p><strong>1.7              </strong><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>HO – Residential house rent do not differ significantly between town centre and peri-urban in Bukuru.</p> <p>H1 – Residential house rents differ significantly between town center and peri-urban in Bukuru.</p> <p><strong>1.8              </strong><strong> JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Generally, due to the importance of shelter to human life, rent have been a major determinant on what type of houses people live in as well as the quality of houses. This research takes an in depth look at the various reason why disparity exist in housing rent.</p> <p>Due to its importance, housing rent is mainly determined by some factors such as location, income level, and security of a location, housing type and housing quality. In view of the above stated factors, this research aim at finding out which one is the major determining factor in rent differences between town centre and peri-urban in Bukuru.</p> <p>Despite the compelling need for decent affordable rental housing, one third of our nation households across the income spectrum live in rental housing, some from choice and some from necessity. Some choose rental housing because it provides an affordable and convenient lifestyle close to neighbourhood amenities, but for many working and income families home ownership is out of reach, rental housing allows families to live in communities close to work, education and affordable transportation.</p> <p><strong>1.9 STUDY AREA</strong></p> <p><strong>1.9.1 Population and Human Activities</strong></p> <p>Bukuru been the study area in the Jos South Local Government Area in Plateau State has the population of 15540 persons according to the Geo Name Geographical Database, and it is 15km South of the State Capital with the mining activities in Jos, most especially the Jos-South because an important National administrative, Commercial and tourist centre and this has lead to the influx of migrants into the area, mostly Igbos and the Yorubas who constitutes more than half of the population because of the commercial activities within the study area.</p> <p><strong>1.9.2 Location</strong></p> <p>Bukuru is located at 90 48’00” N, 80 52’ 00”E on the Jos Plateau and it has an area of 150km2 with 15km South of the State capital.</p> <p>The Local Government Area, which is divided into four (4) district of Du, Gyel, Vwang and Kuru, the town use to be considered a separate city from the city of Jos close by, but like every other form of urbanization the city of Jos has merged with the town of Bukuru form the Jos-Bukuru metropolis.</p> <p> </p> <div> <p><strong>Source: Ministry of land and survey </strong></p> </div><p>    </p> <p> </p> <div> <p><strong>Fig. 2: Map of Plateau State showing Jos South L.G.A</strong></p> <p><strong>Source: Ministry of Land and Survey </strong></p> </div><p>    </p> <p> </p> <div> <p><strong>Fig. 3: District Map of Jos South showing Bukuru </strong></p> <p><strong>Source: Ministry of Land and Survey  </strong></p> </div><p>    </p> <p><strong>       1.9.3Climate</strong></p> <p> Generally speaking, the climate of Jos is milder than that of the rest of the rest of the country. It is invigorating and the nearest equivalent to a temperature climate in this tropical zone. The temperature in Jos South is several degrees lower than those in the rest of the country. The recorded mean temperature is 18.7F (27.60C) maximum and 51.7F (10.90C) minimum, there are neither extreme dual temperature nor to much differences between the rainy and dry season.</p> <p>In the rainy season, there are interim rainfalls and sometimes drizzles on the end. One interesting aspect of Jos weather is that it may be raining in one part of the town yet other part may remain dry and sunny, besides the drainage is generally good and because of its climate and fascinating topography.</p> <p><strong>1.9.4 Topography </strong></p> <p>The landscape of Jos generally is mountainous in nature with many beautiful rock formation and its unique physical features. Basically, Jos entirely provides a hydrological centre for many rivers in northern Nigeria and confers on the Northern part of the State a cool climate suitable for livestock rearing and growing of exotic crops.</p> <p>            Its relief rises steeply from 200metres and has an average height of 1,200 meter, and there are great peak like the share Hills (1829m), extinct volcanoes and crater lakes on the Jos, which is also the some of great rivers like the Kaduna, Gongola, Hadejia and Yobes. </p> <p><strong>1.9.5   Soil and Vegetation</strong></p> <p>The major soil units of Jos (South) belong to the broad category of tropical ferruginous soils, which are much thinner on the higher plateau but attain greater depth in the Southern part. There are also sizable pockets of loamy soil of volcanic origin, and these soil groups respond quiet well to fertilizers and soil erosion is a major environmental problem.</p> <p>            Tin mining in its heyday rendered some localities around the Jos, Bukuru and much area more susceptive to soil erosion.</p> <p>            The vegetation of Jos (South) falls largely within the northern guinea Savannah zone which consist mainly of short trees, grass and the plateau type mosaic vegetation in some areas in Jos South there are thick edges of Cactus which are planted around household farms or compound land.  </p> <p><strong>1.10   CONCEPTUAL FRAME WORK </strong></p> <p>            Increasingly, urban scholars found the neo-classical economic paradigm deficient and inappropriate in explain in rents and vacancy rate across cities.</p> <p>Ernest Burges (1925) was the first sociologist to develop a recognized theory of urban rent, which he called the concentric zone theory.</p> <p>            Rent is a function of density, location and particular social classes. The ghetto, Chinatown, underworld, and the black belt are located near the center of the city, which Burges labeled as the “zone of transition”, whereas the working class and middle class and rich lives as a social group further away from the city. Burgess also noted that the value of land was determined by rapid movement of people near subways and trains.</p> <p>     Burges also presented a descriptive urban land use model, which divided cities in a set of concentric circles expanding from the downtown to the suburbs. This presentation was built on Burges observations of a number of American cities, notably Chicago, for which he provided empirical evidence.</p> <p>            This section also looked at the various factors effecting rents in the city and suburbs and examine how and why the rents increase as you move closer t the central business district. Firstly, we must understand exactly what rent is, it is a periodic payment by house user to a house owner. Each housing will have a market value, which is what is used to determine the rents.</p> <p>         Distance from CBD also affects rent; to go to work every one has some sort of commute for which the cost can be measured. In order to compensate for a lower commuting cost by offering housing closer to CBD, the rent in that area will be higher than where the commuting cost is a lot higher. One of the foundamental components of urban economics is the rent, and rent can also be impacted by the type of place where they live. For instance, if there is a theater district with a nice park, it will be more attractive to people to live there. In this case, rents will increase because people will be willing to pay more for a nicer area. This is also true for nicer schools and families, those with children may be willing to pay more in rent so that their children can attend a good school than in other areas. The opposite is also true for areas that are not so nice. </p> <p>                  A steady progress has been made in the study of residential house rents over the past 30 years through coordinated research in this area and has abounded as regards to differences in house rent and the factors that allows for such occurrences.</p> <p>Rent studies have however, been focused on those aspect from which the consumer derives maximum utilities and have attempted to rank then by such research, more light has been shed on the empirical validity of the standard theories of residential location. The areas this study concentrates on, is on the factors that affect house rents and their corresponding effect on housing demand.</p>\n\nRESIDENTIAL RENT DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN TOWN CENTER AND PERI-URBAN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RESIDENTIAL RENT DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN TOWN CENTER AND PERI-URBAN", "id": 87}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>This study critically looked at the Role of Local Government in Rural Development in Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau State, Nigeria. This research work fundamentally analyzed Local Government as a veritable tool for grass root democracy and a process for the bringing of Government nearer to the people. It has focused on the development and general wellbeing of the rural populace of Jos South Local Government. To attain the purpose of this research work on the subject matter, this research work is divided into five chapters. Chapter one deals with the introduction of the topic under review. Chapter two basically looks at the literature review. Chapter three contains the historical background of the study. While chapter four deals with presentation and analysis of the Government Area. Finally chapter five deals with summary, conclusion and recommendation of the research findings.</em></p> <p><em><br/></em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1             </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Local government as a means for grass roots and national development has persisted in spite of modern achievements in the fields of politics, economics, technology, communication, transportation etc. the increasing demand for local government in every part of the world is being motivated by the desire of the rural populace to contribute directly in the affairs of their communities. In fact, local government is as old as mankind; because it is the only form of human’s administration that has existed from the history of man. The theory of human society is shrouded with the necessity of community development through a recognized local administrative structure that culminated into local government administration.</p> <p>The 1976 local government reforms in Nigeria saw local government as the government at local level exercised through representative councils established by law to exercise specific powers within defined area. These powers should give the council substantial control over local affairs as well as the staff, institutional and financial powers to initiate and direct the provision of services. it also exists to determine and implement projects so as to complement the activities of the state and federal government in their areas, which is to be achieved through the active participation of the people and their traditional institutions, so that local initiative and response to local needs and conditions are maximized.</p> <p>The United Nations office for public administration states that local governments should have control over local affairs which will include the  powers to impose taxes or to exact labour for prescribed purposes. It states further that those who are to govern such entity should be elected or locally selected. The local government must also be constituted by law (Ola, 1984).</p> <p>Local government is any form of administration that is found at the grass roots level with the primary objective of integrating the rural populace into the decision making process of the state (Gowon, 1990).</p> <p>“Local government is the third-tier of government in Nigeria vested with the responsibility of transforming various communities into effective socio-economic and political advanced structures for national development that is the improvement of the quality of life of communities” (1979 constitution Federal Republic of Nigeria). Therefore, local government system is an administration of the rural areas by people who know their community needs. This type of administration is informed by the idea that since the people know the needs of their community, they would do everything within available resources to develop the area.</p> <p>Local government is an agent of grass roots development because of  its indispensible role in mobilizing local resources for meaningful socio-economic and political changes in the rural areas. The contribution of local government in the development of the rural areas. The contribution of local government in the development of the rural areas can be dated back to the period of community-based efforts of developing the individual societies where local authorities are used to mobilize all resources for development (Adamolekun, 1988). Therefore, every government seeks to affect the lives of its citizens by the way they handle their welfare and total well being through economic, social and political development initiatives. This, according to early scholars forms the basis of cooperation and reciprocity between government and the society, which engenders the maintenance of the well being of that society. When members of the society pool their efforts and resources together, they realize their collective goals better. The basis of legitimacy must therefore, emanate from the ability of government or the political institutions to discharge such basis responsibility as provision of amenities and security to governed (Adedeji, 2000).</p> <p>Every government owes it citizens the duly to develop them through the provision of portable water, health care, education, roads, food, shelter, and any socio-economic variables. Such provision must also include framework that will enable them to have a say on what they get and how they get it. It is in this respect that  the members of the society can be expected to discharge their own civic responsibilities to the government and the society at large. Legitimacy involves the capacity of the system to engender and maintain the belief that the existing political institutions are the most appropriate for the growth and development of the society. Groups regard a political system as legitimate or illegitimate according to way in which its values fit with theirs (Lipset, 1969).</p> <p>The existence of the three tiers of government in Nigeria is therefore, expected to respond to these functions or responsibilities. While the three tiers have varied geopolitical boundaries of authority, they all have certain common responsibilities towards the development of the country in general and in particular their individual areas of influences. As for the level of human materials and financial resources available to them, the federal government is the richest, followed by the state, leaving the local governments as the poorest. Yet the latter is the closest to the majority of the people of the country, most especially to those living in the rural areas. The local government administration is most suited for the development of the rural communities, which are very remote from both the state and central government.</p> <p>The Federal government said through Musa Shehu Yar’adua in the foreword to the guidelines for local government reforms (1976):</p> <p><em>“In embarking on these reforms, the federal military government was essentially motivated by the necessity to stabilize and rationalize government at the local level. This must of necessity entail the decentralization of some significant functions of the state government to local in order to harness local resources for rapid development. The federal military government has therefore decided to recognize local governments as the third tier of governmental activity in the nation”</em></p> <p>Local government should do precisely what the word government implies that is government at the grass roots or local level. He went further to say that, the reforms are intended to entrust political responsibility to where it is most crucial and most beneficial, that is, to the people. These local governments have remained integral parts of the administration of the country from the colonial times and have continued to remind the people of the state and central government. Most times they have always been composed of local people who the members of the society can identify and relate with, culturally. This explains the constant clamour for their creations by rural communities. There are no institutions in this country, which are  potentially more capable and including physical infrastructural facilities that local government councils. Local government represents the generally accepted fact of political life that all the functions of government cannot be run on the basis central administration alone. It consequently represent the need for political participation and fro convenience (Hashim, 1981). This is true in recognizing the fact that apart from bringing the government closer to the people which a popular cliché often used by government officials, local government are better positioned to understand the development needs of the communities.</p> <p>In spite of the existence of local government administration in Nigeria, development in the rural areas has continued to remain a mirage. In almost every rural community, there is dearth of portable water, health care delivery facilities, accessible roads and good schools, among others and also infant mortality rate and maternal deaths are on the rampage.</p> <p>Mensah and Ojowu (1989) opined that the rural areas in the third world countries have remained backward and static at a time when the global economy has experience and is still experiencing tremendous forward movement. Indeed, it is poverty level of the rural communities occasioned by this lack of development that has earned Nigeria a place among the world’s poorest nations in spite of our huge materials and human resources. The United Nations through its human development index (HDI) has consistently rated Nigeria among the poorest nations of the world. This poor state of the nation, emanated essentially, from the rural communities where over 85% of the population resides in the rural areas (Avichi, 1995), states that it was estimated by World Bank (1990) that over 1.15billion people in developing countries were living below the poverty line (US $350 per annum) and majority of these dwell in rural areas which constitute about 80% of their national populations.</p> <p>Ijere (1989), observed that, Nigeria’s rural poor constitute the other Nigeria with poverty linked characteristics, lacking purchasing power enough to maintain a minimum standard of living and they are the victims of collective poverty in contrast to pockets or “Islands” of underdevelopment, the American Style which are surrounded by regions of abundances. This situation clearly generates apathy towards government as in number of rural communities, quite a sizeable percentage of the population do not bother about government and issues emanating from official quarters. The level of mobilization is low and there is little or no consolation with the communities on any issues. This trend to question the rationality of the establishment of local government administration, which should act as a medium for rural development. An examination of the existence of local government administration from colonial times reveal that successive government have handled the issue of rural development with less than piquant approach. Local governments instead of being used as tools for effective rural transformation, tend to be used for purposes other than social development. Some reasons that csan be advanced for this sad development is the fact that Before (1976), no properly articulated rural development policies have always been introduced on the communities by government officials without their sustainability being covered. The essence of this study was to establish the role local government on rural development in Jos South Local Government Council</p> <p><strong>1.2             </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Majority of Nigerians live in the rural communities, which have failed to witness any significant development, despite the strategic positions the local governments occupy in the scheme of affairs. Poverty is endemic and a stark reality that people die from unpreventable ailment. Farming and tin mining, the main occupations of the people is declining and, the quality of primary education has fallen, health care delivery and access roads are in deplorable conditions.</p> <p>Local government autonomy means that the local government is elected at the local level and operated independently of the state and federal government. The local government is no longer an appendage or field office of the state government. But in Nigeria today, local government lack autonomy as a result of interferences by both the state and the federal governments. They lack the freedom to make their own laws, rules and  regulations, formulate, execute and evaluate their own plans and the right to recruit, promote, develop and discipline its own affairs.</p> <p>Over the years efforts have been made to reform the local government system and to increase the participation of the people. Despite these reforms there are problems with the local government system. However, some of the problems associated with Jos South Local Government Area are peculiar to some of the problems of local government in Nigeria. These problems include among other things like insufficient funding or poor financial base to exercise complete independence in the provision of social services, lack of adequate human, material and financial resources both in terms of quantity and quality to carry out its own activities, corruption and poverty mismanagement of funds and lack of autonomy. In spite of development plans in Nigeria which dates back as far as 1946, local governments in Nigeria are still underdeveloped.</p> <p><strong>1.3             </strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1.      What is the role of local government in rural development?</p> <p>2.      Why is Jos South Local Government Area not performing to expectation despite all the resources sees at its disposal.</p> <p>3.      Has local government been able to provide infrastructural facilities for the local populace</p> <p>4.      Have they been able to provide social amenities to the people?</p> <p>5.      What is the level of mobilization of the citizens in the course of rural development?</p> <p>6.      What can be done to ensure sustainable rural development through local government administration in Jos South Local Government Council?</p> <p><strong>1.4             </strong><strong>THE OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study sought to investigate the roles and functions of Jos South Local Government Area in the development of rural areas and to identify and proffer solutions to some of the fundamental problems challenging the development of rural areas</p> <p>Specifically, the study intends to achieve the following aims and objectives:</p> <p>1.      To evaluate the role of Jos South Local Government Area in rural development.</p> <p>2.      To examine the organic relationship between local government and rural development.</p> <p>3.      To make a critical appraisal of the performance of Jos South local government council between 2008-2014 in relation to rural transformation.</p> <p>4.      To identify the constraints militating against the performances of Jos South Local Government in the development of rural areas.</p> <p>5.      To analyze the prospect for Nigerian local government in the light of this investigation and coherently recommend ways for more effective and vibrant administration and management of local government in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.5             </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The important aspect of this research work is that, local governments in Nigeria today has failed in diverse ways in the provision of social services to the local people thereby rendering the development of rural areas impossible. However, the essence of this research work is to provide enlightenment and to educated the people on the need for rural development. The study will help immensely in guiding the local government policy makers to make better decisions for rural development in rural areas.</p> <p>Thereafter, this study is to provide an insight in which local people will be able to participate in the politics of their communities and to educate the people on the roles and duties they should play in the development of their locality. Thereafter, this research is beneficial to the researchers, students, Jos South LGC.</p> <p>This work is important due to the fact that it will go a long way to provide literature material and propel further research in relation to the problems of local government and rural development in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6             </strong><strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research is designed to ascertain rural development efforts of Jos South Local Government in line with the 1976 government reform which gave local government wider scope in relations to their duties and functions in grassroots developments.

Specific objectives are to; create land use/cover map of the study area from 1972 to 2012, determine the rate and magnitude of change, determine the suitability of the land for different uses and determine the extent of encroachment into the approved setback areas. Landsat MSS, TM, ETM and Spot-5 satellite imagery of 1972, 1987, 2000 and 2012 were used. A supervised classification approach using ILWIS 3.3 version was also used. Six categories of land use/cover types were generated as follow: built up areas, water bodies, agricultural land, vegetation, rock out crops and bare surfaces. Euclidean distance and weighted overlay from spatial analyst tool of ArcGIS 9.3 software was used for the suitability analysis using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis and Analytical Hierarchical Process. The guidelines in line with Land Use Act Cap 202 of 1990 and the Nigeria Urban and Regional planning Act of 1990 to monitor and control all developments approved setbacks was adopted. Results from the analysis revealed the Increase in built up area resulted to changes in other land use/cover categories between 1972 and 2012 as follow: natural vegetation has drastically decline from 68.9% to 52.9% between 1972 and 1987. It further decline from 34.3% to 25.4% between 1997 and 2012. Agricultural land witnesses an increase from 8.7% to19.1% between 1972 and 1987. Thereafter, decreases from 25.9% to 15.2% between 1997 and 2012. Bare surfaces witness an increase from 7.8% to 9.1% between 1972 and 1987. Further decrease from 12.2% to 11.6% was observed between 1997 and 2012. Rock outcrops increases from 2.9% to 3.0% between 1972 and 1987. Further increase was experienced from 3.0% to 3.1% between 1997 and 2012 Water bodies covers 10.6% in 1972 and decrease to 6.1% 1987 before increasing to 7.7% in 1997 and subsequent decrease by 5.8% in 2012. The most dramatic increase experienced in built-up area is shown from 1990 to 2012, coinciding with the relocation of the FCT from Lagos to Abuja in 1991. This result to haphazard development and encroachment of built up areas into the approved setback of road network and water bodies are as follow: Highway; 2.5468 Sqkm, local distributors: 1.305 Sqkm, access roads/streets; 1.345 Sqkm rivers, 48Sqkm. It thus recommends the Nasarawa State Government and planners to use the final suitability maps for discussions and decision making in development of the area. At the absent of that, the final suitability map is recommended to guide development in the area. <br/><br/>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>Land is the foundation of all forms of human activity. From it humans obtain the food, shelter and the space to work and relax. Land is amongst man‟s most valuable resources. It is a means of life on which our continued existence and progress depends (Dale, Peter and John, 1988). Land is man‟s most valuable resource. It is the means of life without which he could never have existed and on which his continued and progress depend. Land is a term with many meanings. To the physical geographer it is a landscape produced from natural processes, the product of geological and geomorphologic process. To the economist it is a resource which along with capital and labour is to be exploited in order to achieve economic production and development or conserved to guarantee future biodiversity. To the lawyer land is a volume of space stretching notionally from the centre of the earth to the infinite in the sky, and associated with it are a variety of rights which determine what may be done with it. To many it is simply the space for human activities as reflected in the many different forms of land use. <br/>FAO (1976) defined land as a delineable area of the earth‟s terrestrial surface, involving all attributes of the biosphere immediately above or below this surface, including those of the near-surface climate, the soil, the terrain forms, the surface hydrology (including shallow lakes, rivers, marshes, and swamps) and associated ground water and geo-hydrological reserve, the plant and animal populations, the human settlement pattern and physical results of past and present human activity. Land comprises the physical environment of the earth‟s surface from soils, topography and underlying geology, hydrology, plant and animal population and vegetation, with their influence on potential land use (Harcombe, 2010). <br/>Land is required for various uses in both the urban and rural areas. It is a major factor of production and a vital element in the socio-economic development of any country (Dent and Young, 1981). Studies have emphasized that the quality of land is an important factor for various land uses, thus as nations grow in size and rural areas become urban centers and urban centers become large metropolitan areas, there is always increase in competition and demand of land for different purposes. This requires adequate management to ensure harmonious development and functional efficiency of these uses (Sodeinde, 2002). Human use of land has been proved to alter the structure and functioning of the ecosystem. The most spatially and economically important human use of land globally include cultivation, construction, reserves, protected lands and timber extraction. Recently settlements are becoming large active land use changes especially in the developing regions of the world. This calls for effective land use management (Amos, 1986). <br/>The need for thoughtful and careful stewardship of the land, together with the more intensive use and management of its resources has emerged as a matter of major global concern due to the rapid growth of population that have caused increasing pressure on land, while simultaneously a massive migration of people to cities and towns has led to the uncontrolled growth of urban centers (Dele et al., 1988). Land use management as discussed widely by Mabogunje (1992); Durand-Lasserve (1990) and Kombe (1995) is conceived as processes involving different stakeholders in planning, facilitation and controlling land use and subsequent activities in view of sustainable development. <br/><br/>Land use management entails decision making and the implementation of decisions about land. Land use management involves making fundamental policy decisions about the nature and extent of investment. The scope of land use management involves private and public sectors who develop and make use of land; law which sets out rules and procedures in the management system; agencies which make decisions on how land may be used at various levels of government; plans which inform decisions on how land may be used (Nags and Kudrat, 1998). The content of land use management can be described in terms of three value sets (ecological, social and market values) that must be brought into balance by land planning (Sui, 1992). The analysis of land characteristics in identification of land suitable for development can play an essential part in the planning process. Among the many concerns of urban planners in guiding the spatial arrangement of activities is the optimum utilization of land for the benefit of society (Shuaib, 2005). This involves making choices between available alternatives and as such it requires a procedure for the analysis of available alternatives. Alternatives for development usually start though not necessarily with consideration for buildable land. “i.e. land on which if developments are installed would not have detrimental or adverse effects on the environment”. The process of identifying such land is the assessment of the fitness of tracks of land for development. Land suitability analysis requires integration of several data sets to model land use requirements and the characteristics of the land for the alternatives (Shuaib, 2005). <br/>Almost all African countries have a history of land use management processes dating back to their respective periods of colonial rule. However, formal land use management in Nigeria began in 1863 with the enactment of the Town Improvement Ordinance by the Colonial Government. The ordinance was meant to control development and urban sanitation in Lagos, then the Federal Capital of Nigeria. However, modern land use management could be said to begin in the country in 1946 when the Nigerian Town and Country Ordinance was enacted (Mabogunje, 1992). The general inefficiency associated with majority of the developing countries land policies, the absence of secure tenure, and inadequate land use management capacity have been cited by Bernstein (1994), Hardoy and Satterthwaite (2001) as serious problems precipitating existing land use crises in Nigeria. In recent times, the often-destructive impact of human activity on the land has led to the global need for more careful management of land use and natural resources at sustainable level. <br/>A number of policies that impinge on urban land use management has been articulated and implemented in Nigeria. These include the Land use Act of 1978, Urban Development Policy of 1992, Urban and Regional Planning Act as well as the Housing and Urban Development Policy of 2002. Similarly, land use planning and control measures have been introduced to improve urban land use planning and urban development (Aribigbola, 2008). Despite the existence of these laws and policies, land use management problems still persist in Karu area of Nasarawa State. Consequently, there is the need for a better understanding of the problems and also to articulate how to improve the existing ineffective land use management methods in the area. In evaluation of land use management, suitability plays a fundamental role in regional land-use planning. Its major objective is to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of development in certain areas, so as to find out places which are most suitable for certain land use development in the future. In the field of suitability assessment for land use management, Geographic Information System, Remote Sensing and numerical modeling techniques have been proved to be efficient tools by recent studies (Ahmed et al., 2000). <br/>GIS is an important tool in land use management. The demands of the different stakeholders is analyzed, visualized and presented to support decision-making. One of the most commonly used methods for land-use decision making is spatial Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). This method combines all the spatial factors that are important and results in a map with the best location for a certain type of land-use. Most often with MCDA, the goal is to find the most suitable location for residential, commercial, agricultural and industrial use. In addition, existing Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS) which are decision making tools that make use of spatial MCDA often concentrate on a specific type of land-use, for example urban development. When applying land-use suitability on an area, it should contain not only urban development, but also agricultural land-uses. It is against this background that this research is formulated to use remote sensing and GIS that integrates land-use suitability, covering all relevant land-use categories (urban and agriculture) in land use management of Greater Karu Urban Area, Nasarawa State, Nigeria.</p>                                                         \n\nTHE USE OF REMOTE SENSING AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM IN LAND USE MANAGEMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE USE OF REMOTE SENSING AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM IN LAND USE MANAGEMENT", "id": 89}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE EFFECT OF GOVERNMENT POLICY ON HOUSING PROBLEM IN NIGERIA  </strong></p> <p><strong>(A CASE STUDY OF LAGOS STATE MINISTRY ).</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The problems of housing encompasses the availability of housing units which has resulted into congested homes and community and resulted in the ever increasing pressure on the infrastructural facilities.

Housing is therefore viewed not only as a shelter together with its supporting infrastructures but more comprehensively as an evolutionary and participating process. Housing  is a complex system of interactions between institutions and residents which give shape to human settlements.  Housing comprises more than four walls and a roof, it also includes supporting infrastructure such as water supply, electric power, roads, shopping facilities, recreational facilities, a good and enabling environment. Furthermore, institutions such as the housing corporations, mortgage financial institutions, developers, estate agents, buyers and sellers all make up the housing industry. Housing affects all individual in any society including the homeless and the destitute. Housing can also be described as accommodation with all the necessary ancillary services with it. Housing is one of the 3 most significant in the sustainability of human existence with considerable economic, social, cultural and personal importance. The production of  housing  has been influenced largely by policies, innovation and the ability to sustain the environment (Ezengu 2000).</p> <p>Housing encompasses all social services and utilities that make life meaningful and the environment habitable. The problems that affect readily housing delivery in Nigeria are enormous and very complex. These problems in most of our urban cities in Nigeria encompasses the availability of housing units both in quality and the number available which in turn has resulted into congested homes and community and the resultant of this is the ever increasing pressure on the infrastructural facilities which will rapidly deteriorate. The situation in the rural area is even worse where the quality of housing is very poor and very low in quantity. Infrastructure like power, roads, water, drainage and every other constituent of housing is readily unavailable.</p> <p>In Nigeria today, over 7 out of every 10 people live below the minimum poverty level and 9 of every 10 are in the low income group therefore these people cannot provide housing for themselves; they then are rendered homeless or live in poor housing. The government had in place various policies as regarding housing delivery to the public but poor implementation has made it impossible to meet up with the 12-14 million housing units needed ( Balogun, 2007 ).</p> <p>Housing policy is written document which usually comprises specific objectives, strategies and programs aimed at solving the housing problems or meeting with the ever-increasing housing needs and demands of a country. Housing policy should contain the government’s views, policy objectives, strategies and programs all aimed at solving the housing problems of a particular country. Housing policies usually go together with housing programs. Housing policies are like principles while husing programs are like practic (Ezenagu,1998). Again, it can be said that husing policies are like theories while programs are like practical; both of which are aimed at solving various husing problems bedeviling a particular country or society. </p> <p><strong>1.1   Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>It has been observed that majority of the people are living in poor housing or totally homeless even in urban centre, not  to talk of the rural areas. Housing in Nigeria are generally poor and very low in quality and  quantity despite all governmental policies to provide housing to the public.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>The general objective of this study is to present the effect of government policy on housing problem  in Nigeria. The specific objectives of  this study are to:</p> <p>i.             examine the effect of government policy on sustainable housing delivery in Nigeria.</p> <p>ii.            identify problems hindering housing delivery in Nigeria.</p> <p>iii.    examine the effect of increase in population on sustainable    housing delivery in Nigeria.</p> <p>iv.      examine the important of    quality housing delivery  to living standard of people.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Research Questions </strong></p> <p>Based on the stated objectives of the study, the following research questions have been formulated:</p> <p>i.              What are the effect government policies on sustainable housing delivery in Nigeria?</p> <p>ii.           What are the problems hindering housing delivery in Nigeria?</p> <p>iii.          To what extent does increase in population affect sustainable housing delivery in Nigeria?</p> <p>iv.          What are the important of quality housing delivery to living standard of people?</p> <p><strong>1.5       </strong><strong>Research Hypotheses </strong></p> <p>1.      Hi:     Government policies have effect on sustainable housing delivery.</p> <p>H0:    Government policies have no effect on sustainable housing delivery in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.      Hi:     Increase in population affect sustainable housing delivery in Nigeria.</p> <p>H0:    Increase in population does not affect sustainable housing delivery in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.5     Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>With the phenomenal contribution of good housing delivery to the standard of living in Nigeria.  There has not been much research on the  effect  of government policy on housing problem in Nigeria, the study hopes to fill the gap.</p> <p>Specifically,  government, educational institution,  housing development company and the general public are likely to benefit from this research work.</p> <p><strong>1.6    Scope  and Limitation  of the Study</strong></p> <p>The research work emphasize on the effect of government policy on housing problem in Nigeria. The study therefore is restricted to Lagos State. </p> <p><strong>1.8       </strong><strong>  Limitations of the Study</strong></p> <p>In a study like this especially in this part of the world where awareness on research is just coming up, constraints are expected. Specific to this research, the constraints include: dearth of good materials. Even where the materials are available they are commercialized and very expensive and difficult to come by. Time to do a very tasking research of this nature and finance also posed a substantial constraint. </p> <p><strong>1.8   Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p><strong>House</strong>: This is a building made for people to live in usually for one family or a family and lodgers. More technically, a house  is a building or structural edifice comprising of walls with foundation, floors, roofs e.t.c.</p> <p><strong>Housing:</strong> This is  a  complex system of interactions between institutions and residents which give shape to human settlements.</p> <p><strong> Housing policy</strong>: This  is a written document which usually comprises specific objectives, strategies and programs aimed at solving the housing problems or meeting with the ever-increasing housing needs and demands of a country.</p> <p> <strong>Housing Market:</strong>  This a is a market where housing goods and service are sold and bought by virtue of their being demanded and supplied</p> <p><strong>Housing Quality:</strong> This the state, nature or standard of housing with respect to acceptable standards. </p> <p><strong>Housing Finance:</strong> Finance literally means finance for  housing or real estate development. It also means or includes the source of the finance, the management of the finance and all various operations on the source, management, procurement and utilization as well as repayment of such finance.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF GOVERNMENT POLICY ON HOUSING PROBLEM IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF GOVERNMENT POLICY ON HOUSING PROBLEM IN NIGERIA", "id": 90}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Property and economic development share symbolic relationship.

Overcrowding in urban housing is a serious problem. It has been estimated that about 85% of the urban population live in single rooms, often with eight to twelve persons per room. Living conditions are poor.</p> <p>Bolanle Bamgbose &amp; Associates is a real estate development company based in Lagos, Nigeria, with principal business activities in property development trading; property investment and finance; and property advisory.

Bolanle Bamgbose &amp; Associates one the renowned Property Lawyer in the Country and Lagos State most especially has taken up the challenge of meeting the need of the urban centre in building affordable homes such project embarked upon by this Law firm cum Property developer is Oke-Alo Estate in Gbagada Area of Lagos State although her role was totally limited to providing land for the owners to develop such would not have being possible without the vision a Pharmacist called Chief E.O. Ashamu (late) who at the time in the 70s bought an expanse to develop for the masses.</p> <p><strong>1.2     INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>LAND DEVELOPMENT</strong></p> <p>Purchasing unused land for potential development is sometimes called <strong>Speculative Development. </strong>Subdivision of land is the principal mechanism by which communities are developed. Technically, subdivisions describe the legal and physical steps a developer must take to convert raw land into developed land. Subdivision is a vital part of a community's growth, determining its appearance, the mix of its infrastructure, including roads, drainage systems, water, sewage and public utilities.</p> <p>In general, land development is the riskiest but most profitable technique as it is so dependent on the public sector for approvals and infrastructure and because it involves a long investment period with no positive cash flow.</p> <p>After subdivision is complete, the developer usually markets the land to a home builder or other end user; for such uses as a warehouse or shopping center. In any case, use of Spatial Intelligence tools mitigate the risk of these developers by modeling the population trends and demographic make-up of sort of customers a home builder or retailer would like to have surrounding their new locations.</p> <p>A development team can be put together in one of several ways. At one extreme, a large company might include many services, from architecture to engineering. At the other end of the spectrum, a development company might consist of one principal and a few staff who hire or contract with other companies and professionals for each service as needed.</p> <p>Assembling a team of professionals to address the environmental, economic, physical and political issues inherent in a complex development project is critical. A developer's success depends on the ability to coordinate the completion of a series of interrelated activities efficiently and at the appropriate time.</p> <p>The development process requires skills of many professionals: architects, landscape architects, civil engineers and site planners to address project design; market consultants to determine demand and a project's economics; attorneys to handle agreements and government approvals; environmental consultants and soils engineers to analyze a site's physical limitations and environmental impacts; surveyors and title companies to provide legal descriptions of a property; and lenders to provide financing.</p> <p>Land use, land valuation, and the determination of the incomes of landowners, are among the oldest questions in economic theory. Land is an essential input (factor of production) for agriculture, and agriculture is by far the most important economic activity in pre-industrial societies. With the advent of industrialization, important new uses for land emerge, as sites for factories, warehouses, offices, and urban agglomerations. Also, the value of real property taking the form of man-made structures and machinery increases relative to the value of land alone. The concept of real property eventually comes to encompass effectively all forms of tangible fixed capital. With the rise of extractive industries, real property comes to encompass natural capital. With the rise of tourism and leisure, real property comes to include scenic and other amenity values.</p> <p>Starting in the 1960s, as part of the emerging field of law and economics, economists and legal scholars began to study the property rights enjoyed by tenants under the various estates, and the economic benefits and costs of the various estates. This resulted in a much improved understanding of the:</p> <p>·       Property rights enjoyed by tenants under the various estates. These include the right to:</p> <p>o   Decide how a piece of real property is used;</p> <p>o   Exclude others from enjoying the property;</p> <p>o   Transfer (alienate) some or all of these rights to others on mutually agreeable terms;</p> <p>·       Nature and consequences of transaction costs when changing and transferring estates.</p> <p>The rate of urbanization in Nigeria has witnessed tremendous increase in the last two decades. Census in the early fifties showed that there were about 56 cities in the country and about 10.6% of the total population lived in these cities. Given the expected increase in urban population, the magnitude of the housing problem in the country is enormous. According to the National Rolling Plan (NRP) the national housing requirement is between 500,000 and 600,000 units considering the prevailing occupancy ratio of between three and four persons per room. If this estimated annual requirement was to be provided at an average of N500, 000 per unit the costs would be enormous and indeed unrealisable. The cost of providing housing alone would be between N250 Trillion and N300 Trillion (excluding the cost of infrastructural development). This is the macro perspective of the housing problem. This is to say that the Government and Mortgage Institutions will need this much as capital base to effectively tackle the housing situation. On the micro level, it has been observed that house ownership is one of the first priorities for most households and it represents the largest single investment tor most (between 50% and 70% of the household income). This observation becomes very significant when it is realized that per capital income in Nigeria has been on decline (currently N3, 000) as well as the real income of the average Nigerian. The rapid up-swing in the prices of building materials in the last five years has further reduced the affordabilities for most Nigerian. Relating annual requirements for housing with the Gross Domestic Product of N82.53 billion and N85.82 billion estimates for 1989, and over 88 billion in 1991 as well as per capital income N3,000, financing becomes a major factor of the property development especially long term funding. One may perhaps be tempted to ask why emphasis is being placed on housing. Firstly of all man's basic needs, arguably, constitutes and indeed poses the greatest challenge. Secondly, a vigorous and buoyant real property [housing] sector is an indication of a strong programme of national investment and is indeed the foundation of and first step to future economic growth and social development. The inability of the Government of Nigeria or a constant neglect by higher authority paved away for property development agency like Bolan1e Bamgbose &amp; Associates to take up the challenge of providing affordable homes for the masses and to exploit the profitability of the business of property development in Nigeria, At 30% and above, the rate of returns on real estate investments in the Nigerian cities of Abuja, Lagos, and Port- Harcourt is -much higher than the rate of returns from stock market investments in the US or Europe which is about 12%and also higher than returns on unleveraged property investments in the US which is about 18% which shows the prospect of property business if some certain measures are put in place by the Authority to properly reduce the difficulties developers face such availability of funds, the review of the Laws that govern land ownership in Nigeria for example according to the land use of act of 1978 there is no freehold land ownership in Nigeria. The highest form of ownership is a 99-year leasehold for which you get a certificate of occupancy (CoO). Land is vested in the state and governors are the ones who issue these certificates and even the process of this Certificate of Occupancy is so tedious especially in Lagos State that it takes an average of 6-8 months which means if developer took loan to acquire a property for example before he could do anything at all, he has obtain this CoO which will serve as key to getting approval for the property he wants to build be it for residential or commercial purpose What is Property Development? Is the carrying out any building, engineering, mining or other operation in, on, over or under any land or the making of any environmentally significant change in the use of any land demolition of building including the felling of trees and placing trees</p> <p>standing erections used for display of advert on the land and the expression to develop with its grammatical variations shall be construed accordingly. Land can be defined as the various non-human natural resources found on the earth. Nigeria has an overall Land Use Policy embedded in Land Use Act and prior to the Land use Act in 1978, the existing system was through Land Tenure system. The word tenure is derived from a Latin word \"Tenere\" meaning to 'to hold' a landed property.</p> <p><strong>Land Use Act Decree 1978</strong></p> <p>The Land Use Act was instrumental to the activities of property developers which saw a tremendous turnaround in the early 90s. Planning and control of land space dated back into medieval period as customary norms and ways of life of the people. Nigeria has a form of control in Planning, allocation, usage and development of land historically based on nature, norm and customs of the people vis-a-vis Customary Law. In modern times Nigeria planning laws are tools of environmental designing, planning and development are partly English received laws and local legislation. The Land Use Act 1978 ­An Act to vest all land comprised in the territory of each state (except] land vested in the Federal Government or its agencies solely in the Governor of the State, who would hold such land in trust for the people and would henceforth be responsible for allocation of land in all Urban areas to individuals resident in the State and to Organisations for residential, agricultural, commercial and other purposes while similar powers with respect to non-urban areas are conferred on Local Governments.

When a property is held as an investment, most costs associated with the property are deductable when incurred unlike development property which is subject to capitalisation.

Such estimation will be affected by uncertainties. Uncertainty in the comparable information available; uncertainty in the current and future market conditions and uncertainty in the specific inputs for the subject property. These input uncertainties will translate into an uncertainty with the output figure, the valuation (French, 2007).The terms ‘‘development valuation’’ or ‘‘development appraisal’’ refers to professional studies to determine the feasibility and viability of the proposed improvement on land. (Ajayi, 1996) described such appraisals as pre development feasibility/viability assessments which provide a client with a measure of the likely project costs revenues and profitability involved in undertaking a development scheme.</p> <p>It is generally agreed that uncertainty is due to the lack of knowledge and poor or imperfect information about all the inputs that can be used in the valuation analysis (Byrne, 1995). The terms risk and uncertainty are often used interchangeably. Risk is seen as a euphemism for uncertainty. However, this colloquial use of the words is unhelpful in identifying the principal issues involved. It is important to define these words more precisely. Definitions and discussion about risk and uncertainty are the cornerstone of a number of papers and books (Bryne, 1995; Hargitay and Yu, 1993; Pellat, 1972; Pyhrr, 1973;Robinson, 1987;Sykes, 1983;Whipple, 1988;Wooford, 1978).</p> <p>Baum and Crosby (1988) opined that risk/return is fundamental focus in modern investment analysis. Sophisticated investors, especially in more advanced property markets like those in the US and UK, are increasingly requiring downside risk analysis and adjustment from Valuers/appraisers in valuation and investment analysis. (Ogunba and Ajayi, 2007; Ogunba, 2008).Risk and uncertainty are inherent parts of the valuation process because the valuer is unable to specify and price accurately all current and future influences on the value of the asset (Adair and Hutchison, 2005). Valuation estimate has therefore been described as a “snapshot” in time that is meant to provide market price at a single point in time. It is an estimate and any estimate is uncertain (Joslin, 2005). Uncertainty comes up in property valuation due to imperfect information or lack of knowledge of all the inputs that will be required in the derivation of the estimate of value. Eliminating uncertainty from property valuation will therefore not be possible as no valuer has perfect information about all the circumstances that can impact on the outcome of the exercise at his disposal. Unless a property is actually sold to determine market price, any estimate is uncertain (Lorenz, Truck and Lutzkendorf, 2006). The role of the valuer is therefore to assess current market conditions and from a “sea of uncertainty” to produce a single judgement (Joslin, 2005; Lorenz, Truck and Lutzkendorf, 2006).</p> <p>Over four decade ago, Ratcliff (1965) When he remarked that the need to analyze risk in investment analysis; “we must recognize that the value of a property cannot be expressed in a single unchallengeable figure. The appraiser must frankly admit that his predictions are fraught with various degree of dependability. Thus, he is responsible for giving his client (the investor) the benefit of his opinion of the degree of certainty of his findings, expressed as a probability qualification to the value figure in his report”. The argument raised by (Ratcliff, 1965) has been gaining support from UK authors such as Baum et al (2000); Mallinson and French (2000); Dubben and Sayce (1991) and Enever (1981) There has been similar campaign for this in Nigeria too of late see Ajayi, (1994), Aluko (2000) and 2007; Bello and Babajide, 2005; Otegulu, Mohammed and Babawale 2011; Ajayi , 2014)</p> <p>Today there has been a remarkable structural changes in the economy. The erstwhile optimism of the 1970 and 1980’s has changed drastically. The development appraisal upon which decision-making in property development is based is fast becoming more difficult to make in our dynamic and unstable economic system (Bello and Babajide, 2005).</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of Research Problem</strong></p> <p>Property valuation profession in Nigeria has consistently failed to accommodate the new challenges of clientele in the country who are continuously attaining some higher level of sophistication (Ogunba and Ajayi, 2007). This is a dangerous trend bearing in mind that poorly prepared property valuations have had far reaching negative consequences across the globe. A classic instance is the Schneider Affair in Germany where the collapse of Jorgen Schneider’s business due to its indebtedness of DM5Billion to 40 banks exposed the prevailing poor valuation standard and education in Germany in the mid 1990s ( Gilbertson and Preston, 2005; Otegbulu and Babawale, 2011). The Savings and Loan Crisis in the United States and the Asian Financial crisis are other instances of where poor property valuation practices have wrecked far reaching havoc. The Asian crisis was triggered by the collapse of the Bank of Bangkok under the weight of property loans with globalization ensuring that a domino effect is experienced in other Asian economies as equity prices in these countries went bearish.</p> <p>While so many studies have been conducted in the area of valuation accuracy and rationality of property valuation carried out by practitioners in Nigeria, no known attempt has been made to examine risk and uncertainty in valuation reports. The extent to which uncertainties have been expressed by Nigerian valuers has been largely uninvestigated. While Oluwunmi et al. (2011), Aluko (2007), Ayedun et al. (2011) and Adetokunboh et al. (2012) all focused on the assessment of the satisfaction of lender clients with the quality of mortgage valuation reports in the country, Babawale (2012) had in the process of assessing the current standard of real estate valuation practice in the country examined the compliance of valuation reports with International Valuation Standards. No known study (to the best of my knowledge) had examined the incorporation of risk and uncertainty into Nigerian valuation and investment appraisal reports.</p> <p>Ogunba (2002) stated that risk and uncertainty problem is apparently not adequately recognized in the appraisal practice as it is presently been conducted. It draws more from the observation that against the background of unreliability, inadequate consideration of risk by the appraiser makes his profession lag far behind the field of general finance and might indeed lead to the profession being considered obsolete (Olaleye, Aluko and Ajayi, 2007).</p> <p><strong>1.3       Aim and Objectives</strong></p> <p>The aim of the study is to investigate how Nigerian Valuers account and communicate risk and uncertainty to client in property valuation and investment appraisal</p> <p><strong>Objectives</strong></p> <p>1.      To investigate the level of understanding/awareness and application of risk analysis</p> <p>2.      To identify the various types of risk affecting real estate investment in Nigeria</p> <p>3.      To examine the technique employed by Nigeria real estate Valuers, if any, in incorporating and reporting risk and uncertainty in real estate valuation and investment appraisal</p> <p>4.      To evaluate the adequacy of the techniques often employed  by Nigerian real estate  Valuers in incorporating and reporting risk and uncertainty in real estate valuation and investment Appraisal</p> <p><strong>5.</strong>To proffer appropriate techniques for incorporating and reporting risk and uncertainty in real estate valuation and appraisal in the light of the present economic realities in the country and best practices.</p> <p><strong>1.4            RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>1.      What is the level of understanding/awareness and application of risk analysis</p> <p>2.      What are the various types of risk affecting real estate investment in Nigeria</p> <p>3.      What techniques are employed by Nigeria real estate Valuers, if any, in incorporating and reporting risk and uncertainty in real estate valuation and investment appraisal</p> <p>4.      What are the adequacy of the techniques often employed  by Nigerian real estate  Valuers in incorporating and reporting risk and uncertainty in real estate valuation and investment Appraisal</p> <p>5.      What are the most appropriate techniques for incorporating and reporting risk and uncertainty in real estate valuation and appraisal in the light of the present economic realities in the country and best practices.</p> <p><strong>1.5       Significance</strong> <strong>of the Study</strong></p> <p>The importance of development/investment appraisal lies in the need to determine the viability of proposed development projects; to attract development finance; to attract and convince a joint developer on the profitability of investing in the development; to enable the developer  in making choice between two or more alternative investments; and to determine the type of development to which a particular piece of land could profitably be put as well as the intensity of use (Ogunba, 2004). Real estate investment valuation and appraisal is the careful estimation of all factors which make value. Therefore a project is viable or profitable if the value (benefit) in relation to the cost is positive (Okoh, 2008). According to Ajayi (2014) incorporating risk in real estate appraisal is very crucial in real estate development project because it guides the decision maker in the overall risk management process by identifying such factors that have potential impact on the conceived project which may likely affect the expected income, timely completion and successful execution of the project. Thus without the risk being assessed or analyzed, responding to it and controlling it will be impossible. Therefore the study is conceived to determine how property development appraisal can be improved upon to minimize the exposure of financiers and end users of development appraisal (estate surveyors &amp; valuers, developers, development financiers) from downside risk in property development.</p> <p>Financial appraisal of capital investment decision forms an important aspect of feasibility and viability studies especially for private investors whose main target is to maximize profit (Ibiranke, 1998). Risk occurrence in real estate valuation and appraisal must be considered and should not be under estimated as it affects the project management, financing and development process with regards to project management, delay project cost overrun and quality of product (Khumpaisal and Chen, 2010). Thus, the interaction of these actors coupled with the wide range of variables involved in the real estate investment requires sophisticated risk modeling which would also help developers to structure the decision making process(Khumpaisal,Ross and Abdulai, 2010).In real estate investment, decision once taken may be irreversible or at least costly to amend. Therefore, it is important for investment decisions to be appraised and the need for a reliable technique for appraising real estate investment cannot be over emphasized (Zakariyyah, 2012)</p> <p>Olaleye (1998) opined that much as the topics of development appraisal and risk analysis in real estate investment and development are of some academic interest, it is noticed that real estate practice in Nigeria has not embraced them fully. Hence, the need to carry out a study which incorporates risk and uncertainty into real estate valuation and investment appraisal.</p> <p><strong>1.6       Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study focused on selected real estate firms that operate in Lagos only. According to the directory of Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers (2014)  more than fifty (50) percent that is about 309 of registered firms in Nigeria have their headquarter in Lagos metropolis indicating that Lagos state has the highest population of Estate Surveyor and Valuers firms in Nigeria. This serves as a basis for choosing Lagos based practitioners as the study population which will reflect from the number of Valuation and Investment Appraisal that have been carried out by the Estate Surveyors and Valuers firms.  It did not attempt to investigate the thoroughness of market surveys or assess the accuracy of development appraisal and valuation report because there is need to first of all ascertain whether risk and uncertainty are incorporated in valuation and investment appraisal</p> <p><strong>1.7       Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>1.      There were problems retrieving past valuation and appraisal reports from firms due to the confidential nature of the reports.</p> <p>2.      The number of responses to questionnaire addressed to estate surveyor and Valuers  about the operation of their firms and experience on matter such as how they incorporate risk and report it in their valuation and investment appraisal report has become difficult to determine as the number of firms who actually carryout these type of reports are limited in number.</p> <p>3.      It was also observed that most firms don’t actually incorporate risk in their valuation and investment appraisal report. This posed a serious challenge because of the availability of very little evidence to prove the incorporation of risk in appraisal report and ascertaining the technique that has been used to incorporate these risks</p> <p>4.       It was discovered that appraisal reports are not frequently prepared due to the present economy situation in the country. The number of reports carried out has also reduced seriously over the year. Thus the findings of this study has to be based on limited reports that were available.</p>                                                            \n\nINCORPORATING RISK AND UNCERTAINTY INTO REAL ESTATE VALUATION AND INVESTMENT APPRAISAL<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INCORPORATING RISK AND UNCERTAINTY INTO REAL ESTATE VALUATION AND INVESTMENT APPRAISAL", "id": 92}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study examined the effect of information technology <em>on facilities management practices in some selected hotels in Lagos.

The hotel industry is a very competitive business in which customers place great emphasis on reliability and timely service delivery. The vision of all such businesses is to provide quality high class to customers in order to successfully thrive and achieve their mission. Top management can build high-performance cultures by their efforts to create organizational climate devoted to quality and their active involvement in promoting quality by engaging the workforce and establishing lasting relationships with customers (James, 2011)</p> <p>Maintenance is the effort in connection with different technical and administrative action to keep a physical asset, or restore it to a condition where it can perform a required function. Maintenance is also seen as restoring to or retain to a state in which an item can perform an initially specified function and all actions aimed towards this are maintenance activities Maintenance is an investment because resources are spent today to do maintenance in order to reduce cost or get higher benefits in the future as compared to if the resources are not spent. However despite this opinion maintenance is generally separated from true investment because it is a matter of restoring an old function or keeping up an old function.</p> <p>A decision maker for maintenance should think in terms of how to keep informed, how to take decision, and consideration of the fact that the future is uncertain, therefore there is need for future planning.</p> <p>The concept of maintenance favours minor changes and where it is possible to know in advance the rationale to do. It is also suitable for an industry characterized with more rapid changes on its specific building structure. Hotels need minor renovations because this industry is influenced by technological and societal changes.</p> <p>Generally, hotels are complex and costly when it comes to maintenance with various uses of spaces that have different schedules and uses for guest rooms, restaurants, health club, swimming pool, retail store and each has a functional engineering system required for its maintenance. Maintenance therefore has to be done throughout the year, requiring competent staff to undertake building services, operation and maintenance, supplemented by outsourced contractors. In the hospitality industry the maintenance of the engineering systems is important despite its complex processes as its effectiveness will directly affect the quality of hotel services, which have direct and significant effect on guests’ impression of the hotel. As such, the development of a suitable maintenance strategy is gaining publicity, greater reliance is placed on it to keep high system availability and achieve acceptable environmental conditions for the occupants.</p> <p>Of the three core consumer products in the hotel: accommodation and food and beverage, accommodation standard significantly affect the customer satisfaction and inclination to return. Maintenance management also plays a main role in improving energy efficiency and keeping the total costs optimal. The costs of operating and maintaining the engineering systems, in particular the in-house manpower, out-source contractors, energy consumption and equipment deterioration, must be properly monitored and controlled. Among the commonly adopted strategy in the hotel industry is outsourcing, which managers use to squeeze operating costs in a tough business environment. The purpose of such a strategy is to improve productivity, increase revenues; lower operating costs, and reduces risk. It allows hotel to focus efforts on its core competency and strengthen its ability to adapt in the ever-changing business environment.</p> <p>The trend in Nigeria today is that facilities maintenance and sustenance must be geared up in all the sectors of the economy, hotels inclusive Thus, in order for business to be conducted in any hotel, it is essential for constructed assets to be appropriately managed if the business is to maintain the capital invested, enhance its value and sustain reasonable return (NOUN, 2014).</p> <p>Facilities management (FM) has become a focus of attention for academics and practitioners. The former view it as a rapidly developing field that offers, amongst other things, rich sources of data that can be used to explain or develop new theories about how we manage buildings and other constructed facilities. The latter regard it as an opportunity for business or a means for controlling operational costs, depending on whether there is a primary interest in providing FM services or in procuring them. Common to both is the application of information technology (IT) as a means for obtaining, managing and exploiting data. Since FM is concerned with long term operations, as opposed to the medium term activities associated with the design and construction of the asset, there is both scope and motivation for improvement. Indeed, the concept of continual improvement can be more easily applied to long term, continuous processes than projects (Atkin and Leiringer, 2006).</p> <p>Technology for office automation and the arrival of the Internet has fundamentally altered the facility planning process (Roper and Beard, 2005). Nowadays the development of wireless devices is among the most dynamically improving areas of the Information Technology. With the new wireless IT solutions remote communication can be supported more efficiently and flexibly than earlier with only wired networks.</p> <p>It is clear that the IT hardware development has affected the Facility Management significantly from the first analog devices that were used for simple FM purposes. Digital wired devices and systems represent the next two milestones of the improvement. Later the wired remote sensing/controlling devices and their systems have become the most significant facility-related hardware improvement areas, but in the previous two decades the wireless system improvement has been in the middle of focus. Meanwhile the more available devices have been invented that could be used in Facility Information Systems (Boz´any, 2006).</p> <p>Facility Management is a special application area for these equipments where the demand for remote communication devices is extremely high because there might be long distances among together working people and devices. Facility Management and Automation Systems are mainly used to manage only buildings but in some cases the supported FM activity has been extended even for the not built, outer areas of the property. The application of wireless elements could be much more comfortable and cost-efficient than any wired solution for managing large facilities, but the FM service quality also can be increased extremely. The IT hardware development has affected the processes remarkably that belong either to the Facility or Building Automation Systems (Boz´any, 2006).</p> <p>Some specialists think that Facility- or Building Automation Systems (FAS, BAS) are parts of the Computer-Integrated Facility Management System (CIFM), while others are talking about two individual, independent systems, but in those networks these parts are usually integrated in the same information system, mostly via a shared database.</p> <p>In Nigeria, a good number of facts and incidents aid and abet the development of hotels. First is the public sector involvement, which had been predominant at least up to the late nineties. Hotels were established for providing accommodation for government visitors and patrons. In some cases, hotels were established for prestige and business reasons. Second, international occasions and requirements may warrant the establishment of the hotel. Examples are the defunct Durbar Hotels in Lagos and Kaduna, which came into existence as a result of Festac 77. There is also Nicon Noga Hilton Hotel at Abuja (now Transcorp Hilton). This came into being as a result of the establishment of Abuja as the capital city of Nigeria. Such hotels are owned and managed by the government appointed representatives on behalf of the public. However, many of these hotels are bedeviled by mis-management leading to facilities decay, which caused their gradual collapse Bode-Thomas (2003). Third, there are privately owned hotels but usually at a lower scale compared to government owned hotels. Even though they might have declined one way or the other due to age, level of use or effusion of time yet they are still thriving. The most interesting aspect of hotel development is the continued interest, which the private sector is showing in its development.</p> <p>Hotel from the Federal Government and the hotel is presently being renovated so as to revive its degenerated facilities. Despite the non-proactive nature of facilities maintenance in some of these hotels, other hotels in Nigeria are not left behind in the adoption of facilities management as strategic management principle to get hold of the market going by what are being published in the daily newspapers; for instance Sheraton Hotel and Towers, Ikeja Lagos, Le Meridien Hotel, Victoria Island Lagos and Nicon Hilton Hotel, Abuja (Bode-Thomas, 2003). If these colossal investments are to be retained, sustained and accelerated, there is the need to investigate what the thriving hotels are doing to sustain themselves in business with particular regards to the management of their facilities and property assets. </p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The tools of strategic management are used in many successful businesses while other businesses rarely attempt to use them even though they succeed for a while. Large organizations with many departments cannot succeed without long-range planning in a volatile environment (Arthur and Gamble, 2004). The gradual decline of many former large and successful hotels and restaurants in Lagos in the last decades points to a lack of knowledge on the impact of strategic management on sustainable high-performance of hotels and restaurants in the region. Would the declining sales and profits be a failure by senior management to manage the hotels strategically in a changing environment? An area that has a great potential yet to be exploited is the area of tourist hotel development.</p> <p>In a construction project, there are communication gaps between the various project participants such as the designer, builder, and owner. The gap is much more evident in the operation and maintenance of a facility. When a building is completed, the owner does not just obtain a new building, but also a plethora of project information in paper and electronic form. It is then up to the owner to make sense of it all at their own expense of time and money. Technology has the potential to fill in the communication gaps that exist, but it has been prevented by the industry’s resistance to incorporate technological innovations. Cellular phones and electronic mail have influenced business, education, and practically everything else in life, as well as the construction industry.</p> <p>Documents and drawings can be sent to someone in an instant, and people can talk to each other halfway around the world with wireless phones. Yet, the construction industry still has not fully benefited from the potential that technology has and lags behind other industries. This study therefore concerns the effect of information technology on facilities management practices in some selected hotels in Lagos.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>The general objective of the study was to assess effect of information technology on facilities management practices in some selected hotels in Lagos.</p> <p>Specific objectives are to</p> <p>1.      Explore the level of facility management practices carried out in hotels and restaurants and influence on hotel performance in Lagos.</p> <p>2.      Elucidate the key role modern information technology play in facility management in Lagos state</p> <p>3.      Examine the impact of facility management practices in service delivery in the hotel in Lagos</p> <p>4.      Highlight the major factors that facilitate or inhibit technology adoption and implementation in hotel industry</p> <p><strong>1.4 Research questions</strong></p> <p>1.       To what extent are facility management practices carried out in hotels and restaurants in Lagos?</p> <p>2.      Will information technology improve the facility management and maintenance practices of hotels?</p> <p>3.      What is the impact of facility management practices in service delivery in the hotel in Lagos?</p> <p>4.      What are the major factors that inhibit technology adoption and implementation in hotel industry</p> <p><strong>1.5 Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>1.      Information technology will not improve the facility management and maintenance practices of hotels.</p> <p>2.      Facility management practices will not have any significant impact on service delivery in the hotels in Lagos.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The tourist industry in Lagos state will through the findings of the study have a turn around since the facilities in the hotels will greatly be improved; more attractive and safer for visitors.</p> <p>The information from this study will acquaint the management of hotels in the state with the need for the adoption of information technology so as to compete favourably and meet up with the international standard as well.</p> <p>The customers of the hotels will benefit hence their satisfaction will be very much assured.   </p> <p><strong>1.7 Area of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study was conducted in some Hotels in Lagos state, Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.8 Limitations of the Study</strong></p> <p>Lack of accurate date on the number of registered hotels in Lagos and unwillingness of the managements of the hotels to provide informations on the nature of facility operations in the hotels were the major constraints to the study.</p> <p><strong>1.9 Operational Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Maintenance: </strong>activities carried out to ensure that facilities in the hotels are in good working condition.</p> <p><strong>Facilities: </strong>equipment and structures that aid service delivery in the hotel industry.</p>                                                           \n\nTHE EFFECTS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON FACILITIES MANAGEMENT PRACTICES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECTS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON FACILITIES MANAGEMENT PRACTICES", "id": 93}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Sustaining housing development especially to the medium/low-income group of the society has become a huge challenge particularly because of the huge capital outlay required to do so. Thus, acquisition of indigenous building materials by way of Compressed Stabilized Laterite Blocks (CSLBs) has been suggested as a way out. The aim of this research is to investigate the properties of stabilized laterite blocks at 5%, 15%, and 25% stabilization.</p> <p>The specific objectives are; to determine the compressive strengths of the stabilized laterite block samples at 5%, 15% and 25% cement stabilization; to investigate the water absorption capacity of the stabilized laterite block samples at 5%, 15%, and 25% cement stabilization, and; to assess the resistance to abrasion of the stabilized laterite block samples at 5%, 15% and 25% cement stabilization. Laterite samples were collected from the Otta area in Ogun State, Nigeria; based on previous work which stated that the samples obtained from this place produced good interlocking blocks that met minimum standards. These samples were stabilized with ordinary Portland cement using 0%, 5%, 15% and 25% by weight of the binder; 0% stabilization being the control. The stabilized samples were then used to produce stabilized blocks which were tested for strength and durability.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The importance of housing in human history cannot be overemphasized. Housing is seen as one of the best indicators of a person’s standard of living and of his or her place in society (UNCHS, 1993). Furthermore, Venkatarama (2004) is of the view that housing and building conditions also reflect the living standards of a society. Thus, the importance of access to adequate and affordable housing took the front burner in the mid 20th century. The low-income group whose population is on the increase due to rapid urbanization and population growth evidently became the most vulnerable in terms of lack of access to decent and affordable housing in developing countries. This has led to various researches into development of locally available building materials and construction techniques to enhance access to housing for all.</p> <p>In 1976, the Human Settlements conference in Vancouver gave new impetus to this approach, condemning the transposition of Western building techniques for low-cost housing and recommending the design of technologies suited to climatic, social and cultural contexts (Rigassi, 1985 cited in Alagbe, 2008). The conference also recommended the gradual reduction of imports of products and services linked to construction, and the drawing up of norms and regulations which covered the basic needs of end-users whilst taking account of their economic possibilities.</p> <p>The acquisition of local building materials and techniques to guarantee access to decent and durable housing for all by the year 2000 was adopted in December 1988 by the General Assembly of the United Nations with the slogan “Global Strategy for Housing to the year 2000”. The Assembly proposed relying on a vast formal and informal private sector participation in housing provision. This strategy was aimed at removing the dependence on the public sector for housing provision by exploring the erstwhile ignored wealth of existing human resources and their building cultures and social dynamics (UNCHS, 1993).</p> <p>The building culture of pre-independence Nigeria was an absolute dependence on earth building techniques such as use of adobe bricks (sun-dried bricks) and wattle and daub (mud wall construction). These techniques were predominant in major rural and semi-urbanized towns and cities in Nigeria. These techniques were durable, adequate and accessible enough for them to meet their housing needs. The techniques were also sustainable since they do not deplete the natural resources of the environment neither do their production processes lead to the emission of gases that causes global climate change.</p> <p>However, post-independence rural centres in Nigeria acquired new status as a result of independence on October 1, 1960. This period was immediately followed by the “oil boom” of the 1970 and 1980 which brought about an unprecedented prosperity and development of the nation. There were massive improvements on infrastructural development particularly in state capitals and major cities and towns. Thus, the towns became increasingly urbanized and became an urban-oriented society. The crave for Western building techniques led to the gradual extinction of the erstwhile earth building techniques. Thus, while other countries were developing various earth building techniques to meet the housing needs of their populace, the technique became associated with the poor in Nigeria and not fashionable for housing purposes.</p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Sustaining housing development especially to the medium/low-income group of the society has become a huge challenge particularly because of the huge capital outlay required to do so. Thus, acquisition of indigenous building materials by way of Compressed Stabilized Laterite Bricks (CSLBs) has been suggested as a way out (Alagbe, 2008).</p> <p>Despite the cost benefits of using stabilized blocks for building construction (Alagbe, 2008), the use of stabilized laterite blocks still appears to be on a low profile. It is opined that this could be due to the properties of stabilized laterite blocks. This research evaluates CSLBs as a building material for sustainable housing construction and investigates the properties of CSLBs. The study focuses primarily on evaluating its physical properties as a building material as well as a measure of its level of acceptability for housing construction among the populace.</p> <p><strong>1.3       AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research is to investigate the properties of stabilized laterite blocks at 5%, 15%, and 25% stabilization.</p> <p>The specific objectives are;</p> <p>i)                    To determine the compressive strengths of stabilized laterite block samples at 5%, 15% and 25% cement stabilization.</p> <p>ii)                  To investigate water absorption capacity of stabilized laterite block samples at 5%, 15%, and 25% cement stabilization, and</p> <p>iii)                To assess the resistance to abrasion of stabilized laterite block samples at 5%, 15% and 25% cement stabilization.</p> <p><strong>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The research questions are;</p> <p>i)                    What are the compressive strengths of stabilized laterite block samples at 5%, 15% and 25% cement stabilization?</p> <p>ii)                  What is the water absorption of stabilized laterite block n at 5%, 15% and 25% cement stabilization?</p> <p>iii)                What is the resistance to abrasion of stabilized laterite block samples at 5%, 15% and 25% cement stabilization?</p> <p><strong>1.5       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study has the following significance;</p> <p>It shows the compressive strengths of stabilized laterite blocks at 5%, 15% and 25% cement stabilization.

This technique consists of moulding laterite bricks without compaction and allowing them to dry in the sun, hence their also being commonly known as laterite blocks.</p> <p><strong>CEMENT -</strong> A mixture of limestone and clay heated at a temperature of About 15000C after which gypsum would be added and the resulting mix ground to a fine powder. It is indeed the addition of gypsum that prolongs the setting of limestone and clay when in use.</p> <p><strong>COMPACTION -</strong> This is a mechanical process aimed at increasing the density of the material, thereby reducing porosity as well as its characteristics. It also reduces its susceptibility to water.</p> <p><strong>COMPRESSED LATERITE BRICKS -</strong> This refers to the tampering of laterite in a mould where it is compressed using a press.</p> <p><strong>GYPSUM -</strong> This is a term used to refer to a soft mineral called hydrated calcium sulphate which is the source of plaster of Paris and other plasters. It is produced by heating gypsum rock to about 1700 C. At this temperature, about 75 percent of crystallization water would have been driven off, leaving a white powder. This powdery substance gets hard after mixing with water and settles over a short period of time.</p> <p><strong>HYDRATED LIME -</strong> The production of hydrated lime is carried out in two stages. The first stage requires the calcination of limestone in a kiln at about 9000 C. At this stage, carbon dioxide will be expelled and quick lime (calcium oxide) will be produced. Second stage involves slaking or hydrating quick lime with a certain volume of water which causes the production of hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide).</p> <p><strong>LATERITE -</strong> This is a term that is used to refer to formation of soil, particularly clay and silt, by weathering of rocks especially in a tropical climate, composed mainly of iron and aluminum hydroxides. It is the term used to describe all the reddish residual and non-residual tropically weathered soils formed from decomposed rocks through clays.</p> <p><strong>LIME -</strong> This is a term used to refer to a white caustic earth (calcium oxide, quicklime, caustic lime) which is got by calcining calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) got by adding water to quicklime.</p> <p><strong>OPTIMAL MOISTURE CONTENT -</strong> This is defined as the moisture or water content at which a specified amount of compaction would produce the maximum dry density.</p> <p><strong>SOIL STABILISATION -</strong> This is a term that refers to the process of obtaining a better quality soil by improving the characteristics of the local soil in order to create a perfectly suited material for construction works. It assists in reducing the volume of the spaces between the solid particles thereby reducing its porosity.</p> <p><strong>STABILISERS -</strong> These are complementary additions of products intended to enhance the qualities of the earth materials further, and above all, guarantee that the properties will endure over time. They are also referred to as stabilizing agents.</p> <p><strong>STABILISED LATERITE -</strong> Refers to the mixture of sandy clay, water and a given quantity of stabilizing agents such as lime, cement, bitumen emulsions etc. These stabilizers increase water resistance.

With time, the demand for green building will increased and the willingness to pay for the features of green building.</p> <p> <strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Over the past few years, the concept of sustainability has become increasingly popular in discussions with in the commercial property sector. According to the Investment Property Forum, (2009), this has been largely fuelled by a growing understanding that commercial buildings are major contributors to increased carbon emissions due to increased energy usage which most experts now acknowledge is a major cause of climate change, and that improving the energy efficiency of such buildings can help reduce emissions and the consequential strain on the environment.</p> <p>The change in energy use patterns and intensity in the built environment and the growing carbon footprint and other environmental concern has been attributed to the increasing demand for real estate and the changes in design and construction strategies, materials and product development which initiated the supply of more complex buildings with massive growth in energy, carbon and environmental footprint (U.S Department of Energy , 2010) and this, today has been the major reason for the increased drive for optimized use of energy resources and provision of green and sustainable buildings.</p> <p>Globally, the built sector is said to account for close to 40% of total end use of energy. (International Energy Agency, 2008).Developed countries are becoming more proactive and seeking alternative and sustainable means to encourage the responsible use of energy in the built sector. This has invariably led to various policy interventions by leading Governments worldwide and technological improvements all aimed at changing the pattern of energy usage in the built environment although developing nations and 3rd world countries notably lag behind.</p> <p>Sustainable building refers to a structure and using process that is environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building's life-cycle: from citing to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. In other words, green building design involves finding the balance between homebuilding and the sustainable environment. Studies show that many developed countries have embraced the concept of sustainability in construction of modern building and this phenomenon is gradually being imbibed by many developing countries as well (EPA, 2009).</p> <p>In recent years, sustainability has been used interchangeably with energy efficiency although sustainability covers a wider range of factors such as energy efficiency, water efficiency, waste reduction etc. The Global rise in energy cost is creating the drive for the adoption of energy efficient technology worldwide. TAC (2006) stated that “Owners of commercial office buildings today face energy costs that continue to rise, creating very difficult challenges managing the building operation costs; hence, there is a need for consideration of sustainability and energy efficiency in the design of new buildings while strategies and incentives should be created to make the existing stock of buildings more sustainable.</p> <p>The Understanding of the environmental impacts of buildings and their relative importance has been described as one of the major tools to help work towards the creation of sustainable development, Lehrer (2001), Buildings have the most impact mostly in the energy used in building operations most importantly lighting, air conditioning and other appliances and these put a huge effect on both environmental and energy resources in the form of emissions and pollutions. Sustainability however is a goal that allows for the continuing improvement of standard of living without reversible damage to resources we need to survive as species (Lehrer 2001).</p> <p>The issue of sustainability has however received lesser attention in most countries like Nigeria. Otegbulu(2011) in his study of the economics of green design and environmental sustainability, stated that in spite of the huge environmental and energy problem in Nigeria, designers have not seen the need for a shift from their traditional method of designing buildings. Such lack of supply of more sustainable buildings may be related to the lack of drive from users and occupants of these buildings or a general lack of awareness of sustainability concepts.</p> <p>It is important to note that putting up green features in building either by way of green design or retrofitting may raise the initial cost of construction but might impact positively on the future running cost of the building. Unless there is an effective demand for green features in office building which in turn will guarantee that developers recoup their investment, the concept of sustainable building and its benefit may continue to elude us, green building measures can lead not only to lower building operating expenses through reduced utility and waste disposal cost, but also to lower ongoing building maintenance cost ranging from salaries to suppliers</p> <p>There is a growing need for compliance with global standards in sustainable properties as these does not only create benefits such as reduced operating and maintenance cost for building owners but even creates reduction in cost of occupancy and increased comfort for building occupants. However, since sustainability features for buildings are always expensive both for new and old buildings, the level of awareness and demand for such features among  users can create incentive for developers and building owners to increase the supply of such features consequently providing all the benefits of sustainability to the local environment and users of office buildings in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>There has been a remarkable increase in the usage of both ecological and energy resources by the built environment in recent decades, this has been attributed to the increasing complexity of the built environment which continually evolves to meet contemporary social needs (U.S Department of Energy, 2008). This has continued to draw the attention of Governments, organizations and other concerned individuals worldwide to the strain on the environment and the notable consequences of irresponsible usage of energy such as environmental pollution at the societal level and cost of running buildings at the individual level.</p> <p>This has led to the growth of the green and sustainable building movement and governments around the world and ecological agencies are continuously promoting the concept of sustainability in the property sector. This drive for sustainability involves the renovating of existing buildings to become more sustainable while new buildings should be designed with sustainability in mind. According to Otegbulu (2011) embracing green or sustainable concept in design is aimed at reducing energy, operation and maintenance cost, reduced building related illness, increase the productivity and comfort of building occupants; reduce waste and pollution and increase building and component durability and flexibility. However it has been observed that in Nigeria, Green concept, sustainability and environmental issues are hardly put into consideration when designing a new building or renovating an old one (Otegbulu,2011).</p> <p>The lack of support or drive towards sustainability can be attributed to cost of integrating such features into new buildings or making existing building more sustainable. Also, existing demand for such features may also be considered one of the most important reasons for the shortage in supply of sustainable buildings. Otegbulu, Osagie, Famuyiwa, (2009) stated that the excitement of identifying an unfilled human need and creating a product to fill it in a project is the stimulus that drives development, quoting Miles, Berens, Eppli and Weiss, (2007) they further stated that the best idea is the one that results in a product, which serves the user adequately, adds value to the community and does so at a profit.</p> <p>Developers consider trends in the type of development, depth of the market and market perceived value in real estate development decisions since real estate value is largely determined by the utility derived by the users and also, effective demand for the services or amenities that real estate provides. (Shilling 2002) cited in Otegbulu (2009).</p> <p>According to Otegbulu (2011), some buildings in Nigeria embody one of the various verifiable characteristics of green design but developers are yet to open up to the idea of a holistic approach to green buildings design. In the light of this observation, this research aims at investigating the awareness and level of demand for sustainable features in office buildings in Lagos state and the willingness of prospective and existing users to pay for such features .luzkendorf, it. And Lorenz, (2005) argued that investors are the main driver for green building industry, however, client effective demand might be a major driver of the green building industry in a capitalist market as investors may only be willing to supply if there is an effective demand for sustainable features.</p> <p><strong>1.3 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The research seeks answer to the following questions’</p> <p>1) What is the level of awareness of office users of sustainable concepts in office buildings?</p> <p>2) What is the level of demand for various sustainable concepts within the study area; Lagos Island.</p> <p>3) What are the factors driving the demand for sustainable features?</p> <p>4)  What are users willing to pay for sustainable features?    </p> <p><strong>1.4 AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of the study is to investigate the level of users demand for green features in officebuildingswithin the study area.</p> <p>The objectives of this study include:</p> <p>1) To investigate the level of awareness of office users of sustainable concepts in office buildings?</p> <p>2) To investigate the level of demand for various sustainable concept within the study area; Lagos Island.</p> <p>3) To investigate the factors driving the demand for sustainable features?</p> <p>4) To determine what users are willing to pay for sustainable features?       </p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong> JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Many empirical studies which bother on sustainability in buildings tend to look at the importance of sustainable features in building and more  as theyaffect health of occupiers and  climate change. However, little has been said especially ina fast growing mega city like Lagos  on the level of awareness and demand for these assets.</p> <p>This study therefore will be justified on a number of grounds firstly, the fact that there is no known  green building certification standard in Nigeria speaks volume about the level of importance attached to the issue of green or sustainable building. Hence this study tends to bring to bring green building industry to the front burner of the construction industry by underscoring the need for more public awareness on green developments.</p> <p>Secondly, it is important to note to that many developers of office building in the recent past have little or no consideration for sustainability features when embarking on building project because they are not informed on the demand side of the equation which in turn is necessary to drive supply.  Therefore, this study tends to break the cycle of blame by determining the level of demand for them, which if found to be ineffective demand might prompt other stake holders to embark on green building delivery.</p> <p>Lastly, this study will create an avenue for future researchers to look more into the economics and cost elements of green designs in building with a view to making green building more affordable, viable and competitive against regular buildings.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong><strong>RESEARCH METHOD</strong></p> <p>A chapter was devoted to a detailed consideration on the methodology. The research methodology for this study will a random survey, aimed at reaching the target population for this study. It will involve the use of questionnaires to elicit answers from the target population to answer the questions raised in the research questions. This survey technique was adopted in order to obtain both similar and interesting differences from the population of study.</p> <p><strong>1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>According to Hammed (2010), studies are usually limited either empirically or explicitly inorder to guide the mind and expectation of the reader. This section therefore provides suchclarification of scope in precise terms.The scope of the study in this work is defined based on the geographical boundaries, theexact subject of study and existing related studies. It has been noted that wide and detailedstudies provide stronger basis for rigorous comparative analysis and more generalizable conclusions (Ajayi, 1990). However, for realistic reasons, the scope of the study is restrictedfor a single researcher, with the justification that what one loses in width of coverage, onegain’s in detail of coverage (Agbato, 2005).</p> <p>The subject of study hinges on the demand for sustainable features in office buildingsin Lagos metropolis. The choice of Lagos metropolis stems from the fact that roughly 70% ofReal estate developers operate in Lagos (Nubi, 2002) and owing to its mega city status thestudy finds it reasonable to adopt Lagos so as to achieve expedited conclusion at minimalcost. However the survey will cover the Lagos Island area ofLagos metropolis.</p> <p><strong>1.8       DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong><br/><strong>Green technology</strong> – technological innovations that do not contribute to greenhouse effects; technology which has renewable source.</p> <p><strong>Green building</strong> – buildings that generates all or most of its energy from renewable or alternative energy source.</p> <p><strong>Environmental pollution</strong> – emissions from industries and machines that pollute air, water etc and can generate unpleasant noise with negative environmental impact and health consequences.</p> <p><strong>Green features</strong> – renewable and alternative energy forms, like solar panels, wind turbine, bio fuels etc.</p> <p><strong>Office building</strong> – any property designed and constructed for official purposes; not intended for residential purposes.</p> <p><strong>1.9 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The outcome of a research might be dependent on various factors as analysed by Walker (1997), these factors include the choice of an appropriate research methodology, how reliable the data collected are and the application of appropriate statistical tools, if relevant.</p> <p>Firstly, getting literature on the subject matter appeared challenging as the area of research is relatively new in the Nigerian context and as such an over dependent on foreign literatures which are usually written in line with usually contrasting realities to what the ideal situations are in a developing country like ours.</p> <p>Secondly, the study encountered slow progress in eliciting responses from respondents as  most of the targeted population seemed not to really understand the concept of sustainable or green building and as such a great deal of effort was deployed to educate them on the subject matter in order to elicit the right responses from them.</p> <p>Needless to say that time and finance are of essence in any research work of this nature and are usually not friends of the researcher. Hence time and financial constraint are also limiting factors to this work.</p>                                                               \n\nAN ASSESSMENT OF THE DEMAND FOR SUSTAINABLE FEATURES IN OFFICE BUILDINGS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ASSESSMENT OF THE DEMAND FOR SUSTAINABLE FEATURES IN OFFICE BUILDINGS", "id": 95}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study examined the effect of location on the rental value of residential properties in Ikeja Local Government Area in Lagos State.</p> <p> Data used were derived mainly from secondary sources such as documents, including published literature, official documents, and media reports.

This would aid rapid valuation, help to improve housing quality and make possible mass evaluation of properties.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Residential properties are both consumption and investment good (Sratton, 2008). As consumption good it is acquired for owner occupation.</p> <p>Also, the investment (property) may be to maximize optimum return from outright sale or letting. If this is the case, the price of the residential property becomes very important to the landlord and the occupants.</p> <p>Hence investment in this type of property is regarded as a considerable source of wealth for many individuals.  The physical characteristics of the property such as number of bedrooms, age, size, various amenities and services have been noted to help determine the rental price for landlords as they set rental prices for residential properties.</p> <p>In addition, external factors such as population, income, traffic congestion, proximity to work, access to public transportation, proximity to higher institution and environmental characteristics may have significant impacts on rent (Oni, 2007).</p> <p>Therefore, any serious investigation into the nature and behavior of residential property price should recognize that property as a commodity is not a single good, but a complex bundle of services or potential services which operate in many dimensions (Oyebanji, 2003).</p> <p>Nigeria has a large real estate market that is untapped due to limited circulation of information about property characteristics, their actual value and their impact on market values, organizations, available properties and professional services available in various locations nationwide.</p> <p>As real estate consultants and practitioners market their properties, they recognize that in order to generate success, their information must be well circulated and this information should be available, accessible, reliable and affordable to the property buyers, sellers and investors with speed, precision, accuracy and at the magic moment when the client needs the information.</p> <p>The impact of location in housing market is very significant. Since housing units are fixed in location, they differ in terms of their surroundings, the kind of community in which they are located, and their nearness to employment and shopping places. Location also means that a dwelling's surrounding is possibly of great importance in affecting its value.</p> <p>For decades, real estate property was generally seen as a legacy a parent bequeaths to the offspring. However, with the realization that real estate is a major source of capital appreciation and a good hedge against inflation, the real estate market is coming close in popularity and importance to the money and capital markets.</p> <p>Today, real estate property constitutes a significant index in man’s wealth. As economic activities have achieved more sophistication over time, real estate has continued to play a central role in their development.</p> <p>In Lagos State ,  the  rental  values  of  residential  properties  has shown an upward pattern over the years. This is because Lagos is the largest city in Nigeria, located along the West African coast. The entire Lagos metropolis has 9,197 roads consisting of carriageways, cul-de-sac, lanes, streets, avenue, ways, and crescents (Lagos Street, Map, 2008).</p> <p> Besides, the huge financial transactions  involved, high property demand, the ever increasing population and the limited supply mainly in major cities  such as Lagos, Ibadan, Abuja and Port Harcourt has made the real estate sector susceptible to abuse by many dishonest  property developers, greedy landlords, unregistered agents and swindlers who engage in several illegal practices to the detriment of the practitioners, citizens, foreigners, stakeholders and the noble profession (Agunbiade, 2013).</p> <p>In recent past, investors have diverted their funds into real property development because of the security of returns and the profitability of the market (Kauko, 2003).</p> <p> In addition, because of the high competition in the residential property market, there has been expansion and improvement in the quality of residential properties provided by the investors to meet demand.</p> <p>A number of factors affect residential property values in Nigeria. These include location, demand and supply, accessibility, institutional, economic factor among others. Nevertheless, there is still a short fall in the market leading to increase in rent and capital values (Eriki &amp; Udegbunam, 2008).</p> <p> Regardless of these advantages, real estate practitioners, financiers and investors in residential properties are faced with dearth of data on the effect of location on the value of residential properties and what level of rental income a development project could reasonably be expected to realize in a transaction involving willing and able parties.</p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>    Real estate has contributed to the growth and development of the Nigerian economy despite that the sector has continued to face challenges such as poor funding, poor infrastructure, high cost of building materials, lack of government policies and unethical standards.</p> <p>The problem this study seeks to solve is to analyse and determine the relative roles of location and neighborhood characteristics in the determination of residential properties value in Ikeja L.G.A in Lagos State.</p> <p>  Another problem is to determine the practical model for the valuation of residential housing units in Nigeria property market.</p> <p>Also, this study will identify the property features that have significant influence on property market values using primary and secondary sources.</p> <p>In addition, this study will determine if location is a major factor in residential property valuation in Nigeria and the cumbersome bureaucratic delay associated with obtaining land and government approval in relation to property development.</p> <p>These will be achieved through the measurement of primary and secondary data with the aim of providing professionals, investors and stakeholders with valuable information.</p> <p><strong>1.3       AIM OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to analyze and examine the effect of location on the rental value of residential properties in Ikeja L.G.A in Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The following research questions were asked in order to provide scientific framework for this study:</p> <p>1.         What are the factors that affect residential properties in Ikeja?</p> <p>2          What role does location play in the determination of rent of residential properties in                  Ikeja?</p> <p>3.         What is the correlation between property market values and location?</p> <p>4.         What are the implications of these determinants and policy maker on investor’s decision?</p> <p><strong>1.5       OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objectives of this study are:</p> <p>1.   To determine various location factors affecting residential properties in the study area.</p> <p>2.   Examine rental values determinants of residential properties in the study area.</p> <p>3.   Examine relationship between location and residential property values in the study area.</p> <p>4.   Suggest how the real estate investors and policy makers can reap optimally from locational advantages.</p> <p><strong>1.6      SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will contribute to the body of knowledge that are available in both print and broadcast media.

These are Terrace building, Maisonette, Bungalow, Block of flats, Tenement.</p> <p>Due to the magnitude, terrain and complex nature of Lagos State, the study will focus on residential properties in Ikeja intra-city. Ikeja is the predominant component of Ikeja Local Government, which itself is one of four zones identified within the larger Lagos metropolis.

Research into the management of school hostels in Nigeria universities has been on the front burner in recent times as steady growth in the student population in tertiary institutions which has created the need for expansion in infrastructures including accommodation facilities. The aim of this research study was to examine the application of facilities management in school hostels with the objectives in examining the challenges in the facilities management of school hostels in the case study and the likely scenarios of maintenance in the management of school hostels in the case studies. A survey was conducted and data collection was done with the use of sample questionnaires administered to managers and students in the hostels used as case studies and the findings shows the operational factors that affects the provision of facilities in students’ hall of residence and presents the development of the operational framework for satisfaction in institutional halls of residence in the University of Lagos (UNILAG) which is the case study of this research. This research study presents a series of guidelines for use by facilities managers for the provision of good facilities. This will therefore be a framework for use by the authorities in charge of the facilities, the students in the halls of residence as well as the school in general. Finally, the research recommends various solutions in improving the school hostels with the application of facilities management that students and the facilities managers must be aware of the benefits of keeping the environment clean to make the facilities presents be in a good working condition always and students who live in residence halls will be held financially liable for restoration or replacement of facilities/items damaged or destroyed as the result of a fire and/or safety violation for which they are responsible.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Facilities management can be regarded as the process of planning, implementing, maintaining and accounting for the appropriate physical spaces and services for an organization while simultaneously seeking to reduce the organisation’s total cost. It involves the day to day administration and control of manpower of all the support services necessary to maintain business and allow for the achievement of corporate goals. Facilities management entails continued re-orientation of working space and environment, systems and services to support core operations and process of an organisation in order to achieve strategic objectives of the concerned organisation. It emphasises the management of peripheral services to allow the in-house manager to concentrate on core operations and processes. The facility manager’s broad education and training in construction, design, economics, law, technology and management, position him strongly to assimilate information technology and use it to broaden the scope of his profession and deepen the extent of his traditional services.</p> <p>According to Okoh (2004), Nigeria has the biggest university system in sub-Saharan Africa with 114 accredited tertiary institutions. Nigerian universities have experienced a significant rise in student enrolments over the past decades. However, the surge in students has not been matched by a corresponding growth in student accommodation and the available ones have not been properly managed. Figures from the National Universities Commission show that the provision of student housing is less than 30% of demand. The vast majority of students live in privately rented accommodation.</p> <p>Bulks of “first generation” universities in Nigeria have stopped funding student accommodation. Many of the newer universities have taken the private sector participation route, although the quality of accommodation varies widely. The student enrolment in tertiary institutions is growing at an average of 12% per annum and the provision of new purpose-built student housing is limited. This in itself creates opportunities for the development of student housing in many cities in Nigeria.</p> <p>Akpan (2000) suggests that developers could partner with universities in build-operate-transfer arrangements on new accommodation. There are also opportunities for better management of existing accommodation. “While the majority of institutions may be reluctant to give up control, the deteriorating condition of the majority of university-owned halls of residence indicates the need to manage these assets in a different way.” Student accommodation should also have a strong focus on innovation and sustainability. “Developers need to be innovative in their approach to design, supplying functional accommodation, which incorporates the basic needs of students and provides additional facilities and services including laundry, internet services, relatively constant electricity, water supply, shuttle services, etc. The university community should be at the forefront of sustainability issues; this should be reflected in development and management (FRN, 2008).”</p> <p>Okoh (2004) added that in the future, the availability, quality and cost of student accommodation on offer will be a vital component for universities to lure good quality students. The increasing number of students in tertiary institutions in several Nigerian cities has caused serious accommodation problems and campus hostels can no longer cope with demand. Establishment of private hostels off-campus was initially perceived as a solution but landlords have taken advantage of the high demand by upping rentals and students are reeling under the financial burden. They have turned to the government for help.</p> <p>There has been steady growth in the student population in tertiary institutions, most of which have been expanding their teaching, administrative and research infrastructures. But no effort has been made to provide more accommodation for students and staff.</p> <p>This has allegedly been a deliberate resource allocation policy, with tertiary institutions - at the regional and national level - uninterested in committing funding to accommodation (Akpan, 1998).</p> <p>Many tertiary institutions possess large amounts of land on which student hostels could be built. But it is claimed that private sector figures on university governing councils have discouraged government investment in building campus residences. Critics say that owners of houses and land near campuses made proposals to university authorities to build cheap and affordable accommodation for students. According to reliable sources, some university officials obtained bank loans to build hostels that are operated under holdings whose owners are often their relatives (Owen, 1993).</p> <p>\"The reason for this strange policy is not far-fetched. Members of the property class who have invested in the construction of these hostels would naturally want their investment to yield dividends,\" explained Akpan (1998).</p> <p>Today students are having a rough time at the hands of hostel owners whose primary obsession has been alleged, is to maximize profit with little concern for students' welfare. Students have also complained about the absence of a learning environment in private hostels. You get an impression that you are, at times, in a shopping mall when you enter most private hostels in Nigeria universities (Ubong, 2001). A portion of these hostels are transformed into mini markets with hawkers. At night and during the weekend the hostels are very noisy and movements in and out of the hostels are not restricted.</p> <p>However, this research study will provide an overview on applying facilities management in managing the school hostels in Nigeria using selected University of Lagos Hostels as case studies.</p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Research into the management of school hostels in Nigeria universities has been on the front burner in recent times as steady growth in the student population in tertiary institutions which has created the need for expansion in infrastructures including accommodation facilities. But no effort has been made to provide more accommodation for students and staff. The problems of managing institutional halls of residence ranges from financial implications, misuse of resources, lack of maintenance, etc. This research study is seeking to find out if this situation is a deliberate resource allocation policy, with tertiary institutions - at the regional and national level - uninterested in committing funding to accommodation even in the face of tremendous challenges faced by students due to this poor scenario. The evolution of off-campus hostels occurred as a result of poor management of the school owned hostels. This development has not been able to eradicate the management challenges relating to school hostels. The research study will however provide an analysis on the application of facilities management, problems and prospects of managing school hostels in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>i.                    What are the problems in the management of school hostels in the case studies?</p> <p>ii.                 What are the likely scenarios in the management of school hostels in the case studies?</p> <p>iii.               What are the ways by which management challenges in Nigerian universities hostel are curtailed by the facilities managers?</p> <p>iv.               What are the present condition of services in the case study?</p> <p>v.                  What are the likely actions necessary for improved facilities management on perceived key stakeholders?</p> <p><strong>1.4       AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research study is to examine the application of facilities management in school hostels with emphases to particular hostels in the University of Lagos.  The following objectives will be useful in achieving the above aim:-</p> <p>i.                    to examine the challenges in the facilities management of school hostels in the case studies;</p> <p>ii.                 to examine the likely scenarios of maintenance in the management of school hostels in the case studies;</p> <p>iii.               to find out ways by which facilities management challenges in Nigerian universities hostel are curtailed by the facilities managers;</p> <p>iv.               To find out the present condition of services in the case study hostels;</p> <p>v.                  To find out which facilities management costs are being used in the case study hostels;</p> <p><strong>1.5       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Findings from this study will enlighten the general public on the state of the hostel accommodation in Nigerian universities considering the problems and prospect. This study will encourage facility managers to emulate the use of facility management information systems or the computer aided facility management programs designed to  ensure that  an organisation’s asset are fully utilized at the lowest possible cost while providing benefit to every phase of a building’s lifecycle. This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied, it will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p><strong>1.6       SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will cover the overview of application of facilities management in managing school hostels in Nigeria using the University of Lagos student hostels as the case studies which are case studies of Moremi and New Hall hostels.</p> <p><strong>1.7       LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Financial constraint- Insufficient fund will tend to impede the efficiency of the research in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).</p> <p>Time constraint- The research will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

Therefore, this study examines the extent to which residential housing satisfaction are determined by the housing structural, environmental and socio-economic attributes.</p> <p>To conduct this research, the study adopted a survey design whereby 303 buildings were selected for the questionnaire administration. Using multi-stage sampling techniques, the study area was first identified and classified into zones, and buildings selected according to their types by simple random in the second stage. In the third stage, streets were selected in the chosen zones based on their conditions and finally questionnaires were systematically administered on the households in the selected building types of the classified zones for data collection. Data collected were analyzed using both descriptive (frequency, mean etc) and inferential (regression analysis) techniques.</p> <p>The results of the stepwise regression analysis showed that building type (R2 =0.132, P&lt; 0.05), Floor material type (R2 =0.109, P&lt; 0.05), number of gated streets (R2 =0.089, P&lt; 0.05) and security type (R2=0.112, P&lt; 0.05) are the most important determinant of the Residential housing satisfaction.</p> <p>The conclusion is that housing structural and neighbourhood attributes are more important factors that explain variations in residential housing satisfaction than the location factors.</p> <p>Therefore, it is recommended that government emphasis should be on provision of affordable bungalow buildings with plastered floors where there are no gated streets but must have effective vigilante security system.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The availability and quality of housing has a significant impact on people's lives, affecting choices of work and transport needs, as well as the quality of life. With rates of household formation continuing to increase, housing demand stimulated by the buy-to-let market, and housing supply remaining largely static, there are significant shortages of suitable housing in areas of population pressure.<strong> (</strong>Davis &amp; Everest, 2004).Market forces in housing are complex, driven by incomes and house prices, demographics and social change, and economic factors including employment and consumer confidence. Despite rising prices, the supply of new housing into areas of high demand has not increased significantly. House building is a high risk enterprise and developers will take a conservative approach, in order to avoid being exposed to a falling market.</p> <p>In Lagos State, house developers are faced with challenges like constraints on the supply of land, house builders and limited development capability in terms of finance and management resources. The dense mixed-tenure schemes promoted by planning policy and the need to optimize land value are more complex to develop, particularly in terms of planning, design and relationships with local authorities. Finance requirements are also greater, with significant upfront investment in construction not being recovered until relatively late in the development programme, further constraining development capacity. These constraints have affected the provision of low-cost housing estate for the residents of Lagos State. Provision of low-cost housing estates considers their closeness to the shopping centres (Opoku and Abdul-Muhmin, 2010). It pays proper attention to the management of support and public facilities to enhance residential satisfaction of the inhabitants and also adopt a policy to build different sizes of units to cater the needs of residents with large families in order to enhance quality of life of low-income urban community in the country.</p> <p>This research study will provide an assessment of public low-cost housing provision in Lagos State. The focus of the study is on determining what is actually required to have adequate supply of low-cost housing that is affordable and give resident’s satisfaction, with dwelling unit support services, followed by public and neighbourhood facilities than dwelling unit features and social environment. Findings from a study by (Mohammad, Mansor &amp; Yong 2010) on the assessment of residential satisfaction in newly designed public low-cost housing in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia revealed that residential satisfaction index like improved security management control, perimeter roads and proper waste management system has high positive correlations with dwelling unit features, social environment, support services and public facilities, and low positive correlation with neighbourhood facilities. Socio-economic attributes of the residents such as age, family size, working wives, previous residence are negatively correlated with residential satisfaction, whereas residents' race, employment type, floor level and length of residency are positively correlated with residential satisfaction.</p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEMS                                                              </strong>Residential satisfaction of public low-cost housing is enhanced through improving the management of security control, perimeter roads and proper waste management system. Despite the importance in low-cost housing delivery in Lagos State, there appears to be no framework within which this objective will be achieved. This development has caused emergence of informal city within Lagos metropolis due to incessant increase in population. The adoption of real estate is a counter-measure against the spread of the informal city in Lagos. The experience of Lagos in terms of urbanization can be compared to that of Mexico City with a population of nearly 18milliom inhabitants (Hamilton, 2006).  Although, Mexico city is reputed to have emerged as a major global services provider in accounting, advertising, banking, finance and legal services.</p> <p>The resultant effects of insufficient low-cost housing are slum settlements and informal areas of Lagos megacity. These poor urban dwellers have little access to urban land and therefore the attributes become squatters, living in shanty houses that are constructed from materials that are low-cost and hazardous e.g. bamboo, straw and polythene. Sijuwade (2008) describes other groups of urban poor as people who are used to living in single roomed housing. He claimed that more than five members of the households live in one congested room.</p> <p>The study by (Mohammad, Mansor &amp; Yong 2010) on the assessment of residential satisfaction in Malaysia has shown determinants of residential satisfaction. Therefore, this study will examine the extent to which residents’ satisfactions are determined by the structural, environmental and socio-economic attributes. This study will give answers to the following research questions;</p> <p>i.      How does structural and neighbourhood attributes influence residential satisfaction in the study area?</p> <p>ii.    Do the structural, neighbourhood and socio-economic attributes influence the rental value in the study area?</p> <p><strong>1.3       AIM AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p><strong>1.3.1    AIM                                </strong>                                                                                                                  The aim of the study is to assess the relative importance of structural, neighbourhood and socio-economic attributes as determinants of residents’ satisfaction in Shagari low-cost housing estate in Alimosho Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.3.2    OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The objectives are to;</p> <p>1.        Determine the socio-economic characteristics of the low-cost housing residents in Lagos State.</p> <p>2.        Examine the structural and neighbourhood attributes of the houses in the study area.</p> <p>3.        Examine the level of satisfaction of the residents to the rent paid in the study area.</p> <p>4.        Examine whether the rents paid are determined by the structural, neighbourhood and socio-economic attributes.</p> <p>5.        Examine the policy implication of the findings for public low-cost housing provision.</p> <p><strong>1.3.3    TEST OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong> – </strong>Rental value is not significantly determined by the structural, neighbourhood and socio-economic attributes of housing.</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>i</strong><strong> – </strong>Rental value is significantly determined by the structural, neighbourhood and socio-economic attributes of housing.,</p> <p><strong>1.4       SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will consider structural, neighbourhood and socio-economic attributes of low cost housing in Lagos State. The study will be carried-out on public low-cost housing estate at Shagari Housing Estate, Ipaja, Alimosho Local Government Area of Lagos State. It will cover the following low cost housing attributes; the building materials, location, neighbourhood characteristics, residents’ characteristics, dwelling units, rental value and dwelling unit features.</p> <p><strong>1.5       JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Data from this study will give structural, neighbourhood and socio-economic attributes of low-income housing as it will enable proper classification of housing types. This study will reveal challenges facing the adequate provision of low-cost housing estate (materials, location and administration). It will also relate which of these attributes is more important in the residents’ satisfaction.</p> <p><strong>1.6       STUDY AREA</strong></p> <p>Shagari Estate was a Federal Low-Income Housing Scheme established by the Federal Government during the First Republic by Alhaji Shehu Shagari between 1979 and 1981. It was originally meant to provide accommodation for the low income earners who were then predominantly artisans, craftsmen, and junior civil servants amongst others. Construction works for the Estate started in 1980 and was allocated to the target group (the low income earners) through a ballot system between 1982 and 1983. The Estate is located at Ipaja in Alimosho Local Government Council Area which was then in the outskirts of the city. It is divided into 4 zones, all properly networked into each other.</p> <p>Alimosho Local Government Area is located on the North-West of Lagos State. Which itself is situated at the south-western part of Nigeria, West Africa on the narrow coastal plain of the Bight of Benin. The Local Government covers land area of about 300 sq.km. (9km2) and has a growing population of over 3-4 million people/inhabitants. It shares borders with the following local governments; Agege, Ifako-Ijaiye, Ikeja, Oshodi-Isolo, Amuwo-Odofin and Ojo.  Lagos State is one of the 36 states that constitute the Federal Republic of Nigeria. It extends approximately from latitude 6°2'N to 6°4'N, and from longitude 2°45'East to 4°20'East. Out of its total area of 3,577sq.km, about 787sq. km. or 22 percent is water. The state is located on the South-Western part of Nigeria with the southern boundary of the state framed by about 180 kilometres along Atlantic coastline while the northern and eastern boundaries are framed by Ogun State. The Republic of Benin formed the western boundary. The state is the smallest state in Nigeria in land area with an area of about 358,861 hectares or 3577 sq.km (Odumosu, 1999). This represents only 0.4 percent of the entire area of Nigeria. This size accommodates about 10 percent of the entire140 million approximate population of the Nigeria. The state is also the most urbanized in Nigeria (Ayeni, 1979). Only about 5 per cent of the state total population live in rural areas. This has serious consequences on land use planning in the state especially in urban areas. It also has great implication on infrastructure. Ironically except for Abuja, Lagos stands out to be the best served with infrastructural facilities in Nigeria yet it is where these facilities are most inadequate due to the high population density. The state is also the most affluent in spite of its small size.</p> <p>Lagos metropolis lies generally on low lands, with about 18782 hectares of built-up area. The approximate population of this area is more than 18 million. The projected average population density of the built-up area of Lagos metropolis is about 20,000 people per square kilometre in an emerging African Megacity. Two dominant religious groups in Lagos are Christians which constitute, about 54.6%, while the Muslims constitute about 44.33% (Odumosu, 1999). The balance of 1.1% represents the percentage population of other religious groups. According to the Master Plan for Metropolitan Lagos (MPML) the urban land use was approximately 172 square kilometres in 1985. (Master Plan for Metropolitan Lagos, 1985). Current land use distribution of Lagos shows that residential areas occupied about 9669 hectares (52.1%) of the total built-up area of the city.</p>                                                           \n\nASSESSMENT OF RESIDENTS HOUSING SATISFACTION DETERMINANTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF RESIDENTS HOUSING SATISFACTION DETERMINANTS", "id": 98}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>The Oil and Gas industry continues to struggle in finding a balance between rising global demand, diminishing known resources and in maintaining manageable distribution and operating costs. While mergers and consolidation continue, oil and gas management are determining other approaches to recover their base lines. One particular measure is to include business process outsourcing (BPO) in their operational mix. The aim of this study is to assess the degree of effectiveness of outsourced facility management in Nigeria oil and gas firms of the downstream sector using user satisfaction indices. The specific objectives are among others; to identify FM services that are most outsourced in Nigeria’s Oil and gas firms; to identify the relative importance of factors that influence users’ satisfaction with outsourced facility management services in the Nigeria Oil and Gas firms; and determine the degree of effectiveness of outsourcing as a means of service delivery in the sampled oil and gas firms. Data for the research work was collected through self administered questionnaires and analyzed using Statistical Package for social scientist (SPSS 17). The respondents were the staff of the six major oil and gas downstream industry within the Facility management department and were chosen through purposive sampling technique. Findings revealed key services that are mostly outsourced; transportation and logistics coming first among others. Findings also revealed the importance of factors that influence users’ satisfaction with outsource services; service delivery was identified as the most important. It also that outsourcing is highly effective with the elements considered to be outsourced and is reliable for this sector. Users’ expectations of outsourced service is high; The outsourced facility manager must have experience in Oil and Gas, and understand the industry’s need and services and ensure that their services are structured to meet the industry’s increasing demand. They should also seek technological innovations with more cost effective methods for maintaining equipments and Platforms without compromising safety and environmental concerns.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Business processes and objectives operate and survive because they are primarily providing an effective and meaningful service to their customer (i.e. the user). For that service to be effective, the perceptions and expectations of the user must be met in order to provide a successful service delivery outcome. Conversely, the perceptions of the user to the initial input of the service delivery process of the organization is of equal importance, as it will determine the strategic and operational objectives of the organization, and consequently provide the added value needed in achieving the end product of customer satisfaction.</p> <p>Facilities management is a diverse profession, the main aim of which should be to provide quality environments, which are fit for the purpose for which they have been designed. For (Alexander, 1996) it “is a total quality approach to sustaining an operational environment and providing support services to meet the strategic needs of an organization”.</p> <p>FM is a constant balancing act between the competing pressures of time, cost and quality. However, with ever-decreasing budgets and competition in the market place, cost often becomes the prevalent consideration. However, (Wauters, 1995) has identified that reducing facilities costs does not automatically increase bottom line profits and points out that unless savings are affected without impairing the organization’s performance dependent on these facilities, the opposite may occur, i.e. profits will fall.</p> <p>It is possible to achieve quality whilst positively affecting the balance sheet. A quality workplace can induce productivity gains in the workforce, improve workplace satisfaction and act as a catalyst in attracting and retaining talented members of staff, thereby increasing profits. In a time of increasing numbers of the workforce deserting the traditional office in favour of home working, the provision of quality working environments is becoming increasingly important. However, it is the diversity of the profession that is one of the key barriers to the provision of quality working environments. Traditionally facilities managers have come from engineering backgrounds and may have a different focus to the new breed of facilities managers who come from many diverse backgrounds. A key challenge, therefore, is for facilities management to tailor itself to the needs of these diverse backgrounds. It should also be borne in mind that the facilities manager is not the key customer. The customer is the user of the facility.</p> <p>To provide a quality workplace, the customer must define their requirements clearly. However, requirements tend to be defined by facilities managers, largely without input from the building users. It appears that greater interaction is required with the users of the facility in defining requirements and desirables. It is also difficult to cater for individual needs in terms of the working environment. For example, while one building occupant may feel cold, another finds it too warm; one may want the light above their desk turned off, while their neighbour feels it is too dark. This is an inherent problem in open plan offices, which are now the norm. Therefore, in considering quality working environments, consideration must be given to how individual needs can be catered for and building occupants given greater control over their immediate environment.</p> <p>This study considers trends in outsourcing and how facilities management service providers can meet the requirements of the industry by implementing quality and performance management techniques into their processes.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>For more than a decade, the oil and gas industry has been reorganizing to function more efficiently and effectively, the business has changed dramatically as oil companies have sought to define and focus on their core business. The oil and gas sector tend to collaborate with the FM service providers to provide professional services and improve the holistic work environment by outsourcing. In order to maximize the value obtained from outsourcing, users intend to take a proactive role in the outsourcing process, taking initiative in management.</p> <p>Anshori and Langner, 2007 studied the importance of customer satisfaction and supreme service provision in the hotel industry using Surabaya Plaza Hotel in Indonesia with the aim of gaining  insight into the concepts regarding customer satisfaction in the hotel industry and to explore the very needs and wants of Surabaya Plaza Hotel’s guests. This was to discover the opportunities a hotel management has in improving the experience of current guests and in becoming more competitive in winning new customers.</p> <p>Durodola (2009) studied the management of hotel properties in south-western Nigeria using the facility management perspective with the aim to investigate the degree of beneficial application of facilities management principles in the management of hotel organizations in the study area.</p> <p>Abolade, Omirin and Dugeri (2013) carried out a study on users’ satisfaction with property management service in commercial properties in Lagos, Nigeria. The purpose was to examine users’ satisfaction with the management of commercial properties by Estate surveyors with the view to drawing a framework for more user friendly management of such properties.</p> <p>This study notes however that even though outsourcing is one of the most researched areas in facility management studies, its impact on facilities management services provision in oil and gas downstream sector is largely unclear. This is because although a wide range of services are being outsourced in the oil and gas sector in response to the emerging trends outlined above, there has been no comprehensive empirical based research reported in the literature to provide insights into such a relatively evolving and important concepts as outsourcing and users satisfaction in the oil and gas downstream sector. This therefore underscores the need for this research which is to make facilities management services delivery sustainable in oil and gas firms in Nigeria. In specific terms, this study proposes to address this by first identifying the drivers of outsourcing and then conduct an empirical survey of facilities management services being outsourced in the oil and gas downstream sector. It then assesses users’ satisfaction of outsourced facilities management services in the oil and gas sector.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Research Questions</strong></p> <p>This study is thus aimed at providing answers to the following research questions:</p> <ol><li>What are the services that are most outsourced in Nigeria’s Oil and gas firms?</li> <li>What is the relative importance of factors that influence users’ satisfaction with outsourced facility management services in the Nigeria Oil and Gas firms?</li> <li>What is the degree of effectiveness of outsourcing as a means of service delivery in the sampled oil and gas firms?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4       Aim and Objectives of the Research</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to assess the degree of effectiveness of outsourced facility management in Nigeria oil and gas firms of the downstream sector using user satisfaction indices, with a view to discovering ways of improving facilities management services provision in Nigeria oil and gas downstream sector. In order to achieve the above stated aim the following objectives are set to: -</p> <ol><li>identify FM services that are most outsourced in Nigeria’s Oil and gas firms.</li> <li>identify the relative importance of factors that influence users’ satisfaction with outsourced facility management services in the Nigeria Oil and Gas firms.</li> <li>determine the degree of effectiveness of outsourcing as a means of service delivery in the sampled oil and gas firms.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5       Significance of Study</strong></p> <p>Outsourcing is a strategic management option that has the potential to improve organizational efficiency and effective management of resources as well as increase users’ satisfaction about quality of services in oil and gas downstream sector. It is therefore worthy of research efforts. Theoretically, the study is justified in that lessons drawn from this research will aid in developing a body of knowledge on outsourcing of facilities management services in Nigeria. This is based on the fact that most research to-date on outsourcing and facilities management focus primarily on the experiences of developed countries in Europe, United States and Asia. Little or nothing had been written about the provision of outsourcing services in the oil and gas sector generally in Nigeria.</p> <p>Most of the current literature in Nigeria are therefore preliminary and pedagogic addressing issues such as definitions and scope [Odiete (1998), Ojo (2002)], facilities management tools [Mbamali and Adebayo (2006), Opaluwah (2005)] and which of the professionals within the environmental setting is best suited to serve as facilities manager or to handle what is within the facilities management field (Odiete, 1998, Ahmad, 1998 and Ojo, 2002). It is only recently that facilities management has come to be applied to specific sectors of the economy usually education and hospital sectors. Most of earlier studies have taken place in South Africa [Kotze and Nkado (2003)] and United Kingdom (Amaratunga and Baldry, 1999 and Amaratunga, 2000). Most of the studies in Nigeria have been devoted to clarifying what facilities management really entails and distinguishing it from the traditionally practiced property management and maintenance management. The present study will fill this gap by providing a pioneering application of facilities management to a major economic sector in Nigeria and that is the oil and gas sector. </p> <p>Oil and gas industry continues to struggle to find a balance between rising global demand, diminishing known resources, and in maintenance distribution and operating costs. While mergers and consolidation continue, oil and gas management are determining other approaches to recover their base lines. One particular measure is to include business process outsourcing in their operational mix. Much of this orientation has been caused by operational processes becoming progressively more complicated and more costly in terms of managing a variety of business functions; hence businesses are handing parts of their core work, such as engineering services apart from finance and accounting, to outside service providers. Identifying the relative importance of factors that influence users’ satisfaction with outsourced facility management services in the Nigeria Oil and Gas firms is a major justification for the study. The justification for this study is also further boosted by the fact that the knowledge gathered from this research will immensely assist government and stakeholders alike in the establishment and possible enactment of relevant laws, regulations and guidelines in the development of efficient framework for outsourcing and facilities management practice in Nigeria. The study reported in this thesis contributes to practiceby identifying factors associated with high levels of performance that stakeholders in the oil and gas sector should consider while making outsourcing decisions as regards facilities management services provision in the industry.</p> <p>Also the outcome of this study will assist the facility management industries to assess the feelings of users of its services about service quality. Finally, the service providers can know in more detail the expectations of their clients by understanding their relationships and the trust built can provide the platform for effective service delivery in the oil and gas downstream sector.</p> <p><strong>1.6       Scope and Delimitation</strong></p> <p>The scope of this study is limited to internal users i.e the management and staff of major oil and gas downstream companies in Nigeria; in particular Total, Oando, Forte-oil, Conoil, MRS and Mobil. It should have been ideal to cover both the major and independent marketers in Nigeria, however, the researcher opted to restrict the scope to major marketers in Nigeria because a study of both independent and major marketers would make conclusions unnecessarily wide varied and incapable of clear interpretations since the study is perhaps the first of its kind in Nigeria. Thus, a study restricted to major downstream oil and gas companies in Nigeria on the other hand, would allow the researcher to form definite conclusions, which may be more amenable to clear interpretations and create a pedestal for further research.</p> <p>Again, it would have been ideal to address the user satisfaction with outsourced facilities management to all sectors of the economy. However, this is unrealistic for the same reasons mentioned earlier. A study of the user satisfaction with outsourced facilities management to sectors as varied as banking, education etc with their differing problems and standards would merely result in generalized and shaky conclusions which may lead to varied implications of inadequate understanding. A study devoted to the oil and gas downstream sector, on the other hand, would afford the researcher a more concentrated study in a hitherto neglected area of the economy; also, the time frame allowed for the research as well as associated logistics make it imperative that the research be limited to the major oil and gas marketers of Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.7       Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Facility Management: </strong>Facility management is a profession that encompasses multiple disciplines to ensure functionality of the built environment by integrating people, place, process and technology</p> <p><strong>Outsourcing: </strong>Outsourcing allows companies to focus on other business issues while having the details taken care of by outside experts.

The planning regulations are the various town planning framework (technical and legal) put in place which are to be strictly adhered to in order to achieve the goals of orderly development within the society. The study therefore examined the effects of planning regulations and identified issues that could be resolved to enhance commercial property values in metropolitan Lagos using Ikeja and Victoria Island as case study. Respondents were Estate Surveyors and Valuers practising in Ikeja and Victoria Island areas of the metropolis. A total of one hundred and ten (110) structured questionnaires were administered on the respondents. Data collected were analyzed using frequency count and percentages, mean and standard deviation, Pearson’s correlation and linear regression. The study revealed that there was a significant relationship between planning regulations and commercial property values. It also revealed that there was a significant difference in the individual effect of various planning regulations on commercial property values as development control, zoning, setback/ air space, plot coverage and parking requirement that affected property values in the outlined descending order. It is therefore recommended that government should ensure proper land use planning and that people should be made to comply with all statutory regulations. There is also the need for the proper coordination of all government agencies responsible for land use activities.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Various authorities and scholars (Sukuran &amp; Ho, 2008; Owei et al., 2010; Nnah et al., 2007) have given different definitions of town and physical planning. According to Sukuran and Ho (2008), town planning system is principally a system of preventive control of various land uses patterns where the controlling authority would not allow any approval for development activity if adverse impact on surrounding environment was visualized. Town planning can be seen as a means of increasing the values of private and profitable uses of land. Yet fragmented and multiple private interests in land restrict private owners from altering radically or enhancing the overall  pattern of use, and multiple ownership simultaneously retards the transfer of  land to more profitable users and inhibits large –scale development. Therefore, in this context, town planning can be seen both as means of establishing complementarity of  land uses while keeping conflicting uses apart through such devices as zoning, and as a means of speeding up the transfer of land between uses. By creating a climate of greater certainty; the zoning and density control aspects of town planning eliminate some of the imperfections of the property market, and enable land to move more readily to its highest and best use (Balchin, et al., 1995)</p> <p>Owei et al. (2010) described physical planning as a process aimed at achieving orderly physical development with the overall aim of evolving a functional and live-able environment where individual and common goals can be achieved. The above definitions infer that planning is aimed at helping the society achieve various beneficial goals. Planning is regarded as a mechanism for the government to exercise its control on the urban development process.</p> <p> In Nigeria, Town Planning is interpreted in section 18 of the Town Planners Registration Council Decree No. 3 of 1988 (TOPREC), as the theory and practice of town and country planning by the ordering and control of the citing and erection of buildings and other structures and the provision of open spaces and such similar use of land, as the case may be, for the improvement of the human environment. Essentially, town planning is concerned with the spatial ordering of land use both in the urban and rural settings for the purpose of creating functionally efficient and aesthetically pleasing environment for living, working, circulation and recreation. For any system to work as expected there is always the need for control and, balance which is a form of regulation for necessary operation. According to Nnah et al. (2007),Planning seeks to guide the way our towns, cities and countryside develop.  This includes the use of land &amp; buildings, the appearance of buildings, landscaping considerations, highway access and the impact that the development will have on the general environment.</p> <p>Regulations are enforced as part of the planning strategy ‘to conserve and promote public health, safety convenience, and general welfare of the people and to provide for the future growth and improvement of the area’ (Booth, 2007).  The planning regulations are the various town planning framework (technical and legal) put in place which are to be strictly adhered to in order to achieve the goals of orderly development within the society.  To this end, it is the systematic assessment of land and water potential, alternatives for land use, and economic and social conditions in order to select and adopt the best land-use options. (Young, 1993).</p> <p>As mentioned by Dale and Mclaughlin (1999), there are two basic approaches to regulating how land is developed and used. This can be by way of Legislation applying to all properties uniformly: This includes a wide variety of rules governing the physical location of economic activities within jurisdictions; regulations governing the design, height, or capital intensity of commercial and industrial property and a permit system in which a property owner must make application at the time of a proposed development. Considering commercial property in Lagos metropolis, a commercial property is a bundle of goods. It refers to buildings or land intended to generate a profit, either from capital gain or rental income. Commercial property includes office buildings, industrial properties, hotels, malls, retail stores, warehouses, farm land and garages.</p> <p>As it is being experienced in Lagos metropolis, most areas are changing residential property to commercial use largely because they command high rental value and a property owner is always inclined to that use that will command highest and best value (Osagie et al., 2012). Various reasons have been given for this, part of which includes town planning regulation. It is against this background that this research examines the effectiveness of planning regulation in relation to commercial property values in the Lagos Metropolis to determine the effects that adherence to planning regulation has on commercial properties.</p> <p><strong>1.2. Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>Jaeger (2006) asserted that planning regulations could affect the market value of a property in a variety of ways. He also noted that while some of the effects might be straightforward; in most cases they are complex and can easily be misunderstood or misinterpreted. In correlation with the above assertion, it has been observed that different people have different perspectives about the level of positivity or negativity of planning regulations as regards commercial properties. For instance, when a regulation restricts the use of a particular commercial property due to strict adherence to zoning regulations, which is meant to control haphazard development in the city, such a plan may end up increasing the economic value of the property especially in the Central Business Districts (CBDs).</p> <p> In such a situation, the demand for commercial properties exceeds the supply in the vantage area and will resultantly inflate the value of such properties. This will have positive effects on the commercial property owners but can be seen in a negative manner by the end users of properties in such an area due to high rental values.            </p> <p>Further discussing likely problems that may arise from planning regulations, Jaeger (2006) stated that land-use regulations could cause a reduction in property value where the supply of land for an allowed use was higher than it would have been without the land-use regulation, while additional supply could cause a drop in the market price due to downward sloping demand. Thus the major problem of haphazard development in some planning regulation is that of abnormally high property values in some areas while lowering value in other areas. It is of pertinent that more studies are carried out to identify planning regulations that affect commercial property value for equal benefit of owner and tenants of the properties. Data on these issues are lacking and hence, this study is necessary to identify types of planning regulations affecting commercial property values in the Lagos metropolis. This study will resolve the following research questions.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong> Research Questions</strong></p> <p>This study focuses on the effect or impact of planning regulations on commercial property values in metropolitan Lagos. Some pertinent questions to enable the study attain its stated objectives are as follows:</p> <p><strong>1.</strong>What are the types of planning regulations that affect commercial property values in the study area?</p> <p><strong>2.</strong>Is there any relationship between planning regulations and commercial property values?</p> <p><strong>3.</strong>What are the effects of planning regulations on commercial property values in the study area?</p> <p><strong>4.</strong>What is the relative importance of various planning regulations on commercial property values?</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>Aim and Objectives</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research is to determine the effects of planning regulations on commercial property values in metropolitan Lagos. The objectives are to:    </p> <p>a.       To identify the types of planning regulations that affect commercial property values in the study area.</p> <p>b.      To investigate the relationship between planning regulations and commercial property values</p> <p>c.       To evaluate the effects of these planning regulations on commercial property values in the study area.</p> <p>d.      To analyze the relative importance of various planning regulations on commercial property values in the study area.</p> <p><strong>1.5   Research Hypothesis</strong></p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 1</strong></p> <p>There is no significant relationship between planning regulations and commercial property values in Lagos metropolis. </p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 2</strong></p> <p>There is no significant difference in the individual effects of various planning regulations on commercial property values</p> <p><strong>1.6 Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>Various studies have been conducted on the effects of planning regulations on property values.</p> <p>According to Jaeger (2006), the planning system can have a significant impact on land values.  He stated that for example, in the United Kingdom, a piece of property can be worth a few thousand pounds before the grant of permission and millions afterwards. Land-use regulations in one part of a city may cause downward value changes, but at the same time may increase the value of land in another locality where the regulations do permit development. Property owners tend to assume that if only planning regulations did not stand in their way, a lucrative type of development would “land” on their own plot of land (Moore, 2005).</p> <p> Ajibola et al. (2011) examined the relationship between urban planning and residential property values in some selected neighbourhoods within Agege Local Government council area of Lagos metropolis. He found out that there is significant level of difference in residential property values between the planned and unplanned residential areas. It has been assumed that land-use regulations invariably reduce property values when, in fact, they often have positive effects (Jaeger, 2006).</p> <p>It has also been observed that the relationship between land use regulations and property values has been the focus of many studies neglecting planning a service that provides a scheme that facilitate physical development in an urban area. Grout, Jaeger, and Plantinga (2009) examined how Oregon’s land use planning system affects land prices in the Portland metro area. Since Oregon’s land regulations are intended to guide and control the location of development rather than to limit the supply of developable land, they should not produce scarcity-induced price increases. Using data on land values for vacant parcels in and around the Portland Urban Growth Boundary (UGB), they employ a regression discontinuity design. The researchers concluded that, Oregon’s landmark land use planning system was designed to influence the location of development, but not to constrain the amount of development.</p> <p> According to Jeager and Plantiga (2007) when a land use regulation disallows or restricts a particular type of development or use of a property. If the restricted use of the property would yield higher profits to the landowner than its current use, the regulation would decrease the value of the property. If a property is essentially not feasible to develop then no decrease in value would result from a regulation that restricts development (Jeager and Plantiga, 2007).</p> <p>This study is vital as a means of assisting planners to have a full understanding of the market implications and as a means of plugging the gaps in academic research on the subject. It will also help government agencies in determining more fairly appropriate charges and taxes to levy in order to recapture value increments in commercial property arising from planning regulations.</p> <p><strong>1.7</strong><strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study focused on commercial properties in Metropolitan Lagos. Due to the magnitude, terrain and complex nature of Lagos State, the study was limited to Ikeja and Victoria Isalnd. Reason for this is that most estate surveyors and valuers are predominant in Ikeja and Victoria Island which itself are part of four zones identified within the larger Lagos metropolis. The four zones (Lagos Island, Apapa, Lagos Mainland, and Ikeja) represent commercial hubs of Lagos metropolis. Other studies reveal that there are five types of commercial properties in the study area. Viz, retail shop premises, banking spaces, office properties ware house and non-specific commercial properties.</p> <p>This research, however, focused on offices, shops, banking spaces, and other types of commercial uses in the study area to the exclusion of residential, industrial, and non-specific type of commercial properties. Some factors have dictated the choice of Victoria island and ikeja. Firstly, the property market in the study area is well developed and it is possible to identify and analyze variations. Comprehensive data are available on commercial property values in the study area which is one of the few cities in Nigeria offering opportunity for comprehensive survey of its commercial properties, with enlightened occupiers of commercial premises thereby making data collection possible. Secondly, a number of property magazines are in circulation in the city where estate surveyors and valuers advertise commercial properties available for sale or letting. This makes the property market very active and up-to-date with stakeholders, prospective tenants, property owners, and investors versatile and having a good knowledge about the goings-on in the market.</p> <p>Data on the values of commercial properties in Lagos metropolis would be gathered from practicing estate surveyors and valuers that operate in Victoria Island and Ikeja because large numbers of registered firms have their offices located in these locations and they also serve as the commercial hub in Lagos metropolis. According to NIESV (2014), more than fifty (50) percent of estate surveyors and valuers have their offices in the Lagos metropolis indicating that Lagos state has the highest population of practicing estate surveyors and valuers in Nigeria. This serves as a basis for choosing Lagos based practitioners as the study population.</p> <p><strong>1.8       Limitations of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study focused on the effects of planning regulations on commercial property values in Lagos metropolis. The study therefore analyzed the effects of planning regulations especially development control, building regulations, zoning, height restrictions and fencing on commercial property values in Victoria Island and Ikeja. The data were gathered through personal observation and opinions of Estate Surveyors and Valuers practicing in the study area  as elicited through the use of a structured questionnaire. The accuracy, or otherwise, of such opinions although not in doubt was not investigated. Apart from these, some challenges were encountered during the study. By virtue of the busy nature of estate surveying and valuation practitioners there was considerable reluctance on their part to volunteer information. Some of the respondents estate surveyors and valuers, delayed in completing the questionnaires and it took personal influence of the researcher (as their colleague) to obtain their eventual impressive responses. These limitations however neither affected the quality of data collected nor the conclusions drawn from it.</p> <p><strong>1.9 The Study Area                                                                                             </strong></p> <p>The study is limited to metropolitan Lagos which is home to many companies and industries.  The city is located in the south-western part of Nigeria. The city of Lagos was under the Lagos City Council. The regions of Ikeja, Agege, Mushin, Ikorodu were under the former Western Region. According to Oni (2001), the boundaries of metropolitan Lagos as consisting of the territory within Latitudes 6°34′60″N and Longitude 3°19′59″E along the West African coast. Lagos was the capital city of the country before it was replaced with Abuja on 12th December, 1991. However, Lagos remains the commercial nerve centre of Nigeria as more than half of Nigeria’s industrial capacity is located there. It is the largest metropolitan area in Nigeria (Ayeni, 1979). Lagos State is made up of twenty local government council areas out of which sixteen form the metropolitan Lagos. </p> <p>The state is the smallest state in Nigeria in land area with an area of about 358,861 hectares or 3577sq.km (Odumosu, 1999). This represents only 0.4 percent of the entire area of the country.  Lagos metropolis lies generally on low lands, with about 17500 hectares of built-up area. The population growth rate of Lagos has serious implications on the trend of urban land use and development. This has serious consequences on land use planning in the state especially in urban areas. The city is a typical example in the history of growth and development of urban areas in Nigeria. This has dictated the choice of Lagos metropolis to know the planning regulations that are in place and to also know their effects on commercial property value</p> <p><strong>Fig 1.1: Map of Metropolitan Lagos</strong></p> <p>Source: Department of Surveying and Geoinfomatics, University of Lagos (2014)</p>                                                             \n\nEMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECT OF PLANNING REGULATIONS ON COMMERCIAL PROPERTY VALUES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECT OF PLANNING REGULATIONS ON COMMERCIAL PROPERTY VALUES", "id": 100}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The study focused on examining the operational state of buildings in Corporate Organization in Lagos state. It also scrutinizes the factors affecting maintenance management and the types of building maintenance management strategies in use in Corporate Organizations in Lagos State. In achieving, these objectives, opinions of maintenance officers and users of some building in selected corporate organizations were sampled through structured questionnaires. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The analysis revealed the operational state of buildings of corporate organization in Lagos State as been above average. Maintenance officers and users of the buildings ranked complexity of design and non-involvement of maintenance experts during design and construction stage, attitude of users and misuse of facilities and inflation of cost of maintenance by the operatives, as the most significant factors affecting maintenance management respectively, both samples rated \"Insufficient fund for maintenance job\" as one of the most significant factor responsible for poor maintenance management of public hospital buildings in Lagos State. This however, is contrary to the claim of inadequate funding by the maintenance management as revealed by another analysis in the survey. The study also shows that preventive maintenance management is mostly practice in most organizations in Lagos state. The study recommends that maintenance personnel and users should form a synergy for a more efficient maintenance, government should enact law that enforce the incorporation of maintainability analysis in conception stage of project, developers should ensure availability of the overall maintenance fund and proactive and value based maintenance management strategy should be adopted.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In Nigeria, the practice of management of buildings in order to secure optimum returns from the investment made in the real estate sector has suffered servilely because of our insufficient funding, neglect, nonchalant altitude, poor maintenance culture etc.  </p> <p>There is unpardonable neglect and laxity in all spheres of our national life. Our buildings (both public and private) lack adequate maintenance care or attention. It is an unfortunate but glaring fact that our buildings are in a very poor and deplorable conditions of structural and decorative disrepairs. (Iyagba and Adenuga, 1991, 2004).</p> <p>As a result of this very poor habit, many structures both government owned and otherwise have become a shadow of their former selves and a far cry of what they used to be during the earlier stages of their construction. Notable among many others are the Nitel buildings across all the states of the federation. Even though this one time strong local mobile communication has been sold off, history will bear us witness that during the later stages of their operation, the nature of its structure and facilities across the federation, were begging for the succor of repair and maintenance practices in them.</p> <p>A building requires maintenance to ensure its’ optimal performance over its life cycle. Maintenance of the built environment impacts on the whole nations. The conditions of the surroundings in which we live and learn, are a reflection of the nation’s wellbeing. The condition and quality of buildings reflects public pride or indifference, the level of prosperity in the area, social values and behavior and all the many influences both past and present which combine to give a community its unique character’(Lee, 1987).</p> <p>Although all over the world investment in building maintenance has been very huge. In most countries, it represents almost 50 per cent of the total turnover of the construction industry. The value of buildings depends on the quality of the maintenance invested in them. International Facilities Management Association IFMA 2011 defines building maintenance as “the preventive and remedial upkeep of building components (HVAC, electrical, plumbing, elevators, carpentry and painting), excluding janitorial and grounds maintenance”. Building maintenance objective is to preserve the building in its initial state so that it continues to fulfill its functions. The role of building maintenance is mainly to keep the structure in a serviceable state on a continuous basis in a cost effective manner (Falade, 2001).</p> <p>Maintenance management involves obtaining maximum benefit from the investment made on the maintenance activities (Olanrewaju, 2008). Through value based maintenance management buildings values are preserved and enhanced to enable them perform efficiently and effectively. Value based Building maintenance management seek to plan,control,coordinate,organise and implement maintenance activities focusing on the efficient allocation of resources in order to improve the value of a building without undermining the users' perceptions and expectations. On the other hand, building maintenance management is geared towards enhancing the productivity, satisfaction and efficiency of activities taking place in and around the building. The requirements for good practice in maintenance management of building stock have been established over a considerable period, the achievement of good practice is by no means universal (Turrell, 1997).</p> <p>However, the foregoing notwithstanding, the trend have not been imbibed into the Nigerian system which has resulted to stunted growth of the practice in Nigeria. It is only big multinational companies and few others such as the telecommunication giants etc. that have taken to this maintenance culture, most other corporations leave theirs at the mercy of God and nature.</p> <p><strong>1.2 THE PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong></p> <p>Nigeria is one country where nothing works in the real sense of it, the dire need to do things outside the normal way of doing them, has become articles of faith in our national life and this downward trend like wild fire has continued to rage on, consuming the younger generation who grow into accepting such dilapidated way of doing things which is one reason why we are not going to leave the gutters of under development anytime soon.</p> <p>For Nigerian facilities to measure up with that of developed parts of the world there is need to pay adequate attention to the menace of poor maintenance which has eaten deep into the bone marrow of our nation. The issue is more obscure in public and government owned facilities because of our nonchalant altitude towards government and public owned facilities.</p> <p>Our lack of maintenance culture as a nation has been the major cause. “It is widely accepted that one of the banes of development in Nigeria is our lack of good maintenance culture for our infrastructure; be they roads, electricity/telephone infrastructure, educational/health facilities and public/private buildings, among others,” (Onaro.A, 2011).He further stated that there is the need for stakeholders in the built environment to facilitate the entrenchment of a culture of maintenance, protection and preservation of infrastructure. Most organizations have failed to achieve their objectives due to neglect of their built environment, which has resulted to most staff performing their duties in unfavorable condition leading to staff illness, absence from work, low productivity, retarded economic growth, loss of life and properties etc. However, some organizations who have imbibed this culture have not been able recognize the needs of the buildings users which should dictate the maintenance management processes in terms of policy, purposes and objectives.</p> <p>With these menace bedeviling the nations’ built environment, I consider it worthwhile to undertake this research to examine the challenges of building maintenance management in corporate organizations using appropriate analysis thereafter proffering solution to the identify menace with possible recommendations to see this socio—economic decadence contained.</p> <p><strong>1.3 AIM</strong></p> <p>To examine the challenges of building maintenance management in corporate organizations in Lagos State with a view of providing solutions to them. </p> <p><strong>1.4 OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>In achieving the aim the following objectives are being set out:</p> <p>-        To examine the operational state of the existing buildings in corporate organizations in Lagos state.</p> <p>-        To find out the factors affecting building maintenance management          practicein corporate organizations in Lagos state.</p> <p>-        To find out the building maintenance management strategies been used in corporate organizations in Lagos state.</p> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES:</strong></p> <p>The statement of the research hypotheses are:</p> <p>-There is no significant relationship in the perception of the maintenance    personnel and the users as to the operational state of buildings in corporate organizations in Lagos state.</p> <p> -There is no significant relationship between maintenance personnel and users in response to factors responsible for poor maintenance management of building in corporate organizations in Lagos state.</p> <p>-There is no significant relationship between maintenance personnel and users in response to maintenance management strategy in use in corporate organizations in Lagos state.</p> <p><strong>1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>-This is to pave way for a better tomorrow for further establishments both private and government owned, to be incorporated with maintenance units.</p> <p>-This work is also aimed at reinvigorating our lackadaisical attitude towards facilities however owned and managed. It is not always the duty and task of the management, but rather a food chain that has the management of the organizations at the helm of affairs at the top, and also the members of staff to rise to the oath of office taken upon assumption of office to the effect that they shall treat the facilities therein to the best of their ability.</p> <p>-It will also make an interesting read to potential entrepreneurs by acting as a guide to them when they are ready to become industrialists or storm the economic scene or in whatever establishment however corporate they intend going into.</p> <p>-It also creates a picture of: it is  one thing to set up a huge facility for business/ educational or whatever activities but then, it is yet another thing to set up a facility maintenance unit in the confines of the environment to see to the day to day running of the organization’s facilities (etc.) both internal and external therein.</p> <p>-The study will aid organizations know the health implications of lack of maintenance.</p> <p>-The result will provide the basis for policy formulation and structural framework for building maintenance management in Nigeria.</p> <p>-The results of the study would help improve productivity and future cash flows in corporate organizations.</p> <p>-It will also serve as an educational/research guide for student and other academicians who might go into similar study.</p> <p>-Finally, this research work, just like any other literal work seeks to be a mirror of the society (i.e.) allowing people from other academic disciplines to have knowledge of what is obtainable in the field of enterprising concerning setting up of corporate establishment both state owned and private owned.</p> <p><strong>1.6    SCOPE AND DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>The scope of this work is broad as it addresses soft and as well as hard issues involved in the topic of this research.</p> <p>The research will focus on selected corporate organizations within Lagos who have been in operation from up to five years and above with up to 20 staff strength and above.</p> <p>Let me state here unequivocally, that this research work also delves into the reason why Nigerians lack the maintenance culture on the overall. Despite the fact that most corporate organizations lack maintenance management units, the members of staff and the entire management lack the spirit of maintenance probably because it is not their place of residence or other reasons not separated from carelessness. This report attempts to address these challenges through studies from different corporate organizations both public and private owned that would be visited during the discourse of this work.</p> <p>As brought forth in the foregoing chapter, the underlying premise is that Nigerians do not appreciate the beauty of structures in their (places of work) rather they treat them with disdain</p> <p><strong>1.7    LIMITATION OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>Due to time constraints, confidentiality of some organizations, difficulties in retrieving some of the questionnaires, and also the huge financial costs involved, the study was limited to six (6) local government areas in Lagos state. The coverage was therefore focused on Lagos metropolis, the reason being the presence of large corporate organizations in the state and its housing of several of Nigeria’s large facilities.</p> <p><strong>1.8    CONCEPTUAL AND THEORETICAL DEFINITION OF TERMS:</strong></p> <p><strong>  1.8.1 BUILDING:</strong> According to the Oxford Advanced Learners English Dictionary, 7thedition, it is “a structure such as a house or school that has a roof and walls for protection”. The Encarta dictionary puts it succinctly as “a walled structure with a roof over it” the foregoing definitions scarcely share any dissimilarities.</p> <p><strong>1.8.2</strong> <strong>DEFECTS:  </strong>These are discontinuities that interfere with the usefulness of          a part of material or component.</p> <p><strong>18.3</strong>  <strong>DEGRADATION: </strong>The conversion of a component to a simple one due to   chemical changes.</p> <p><strong>1.8.4</strong> <strong>DETERIORATION:  </strong>The gradual lowering of the quality and strength of   building as a result, of fungi growth, cracks and weather conditions.</p> <p><strong>1.8.5 DILAPIDATION:  </strong>A situation in which the damaged parts of building are left uncared for. This often leads to further deterioration in terms of      quality, aesthetics and structure soundness.</p> <p><strong>1.8.6 FACILITIES:  </strong>According to the Webster dictionary, amplified edition it     “includes buildings, services, and equipment’s (etc) that are provided for a      particular purpose”. In the frame of this work, it will amount to an         installation, contrivance and other things which facilitate something or a         place for doing something. It may be a commercial, institutional building     such as a hotel, sports arena etc. in the context of this work,           facility/facilities form a great part of the issue that influence this     discourse in the sense that we are concerned with the reasons and/or  challenges why they have not been receiving the best of treatments in our        country.</p> <p><strong>1.8.7 MAINTENANCE:</strong> Maintenance is \"work undertaken to keep or restore       every facility to an acceptable standard at an acceptable cost\"(White,E.N. 1973).</p> <p><strong>1.8.8 MANAGEMENT: </strong>Management in all businesses and organizational activities is the act of getting people together to accomplish desired goals and objectives using available resources efficiently and effectively. Management comprises of planning, organizing, staffing, leading or directing and controlling an organization (a group of one or more persons or entities) for the purpose of accomplishing set out goals.</p> <p>            Since an organization can be viewed as systems, management can also be defined as human actions including design to facilitate the production of useful outcomes from a system.</p> <p><strong>1.8.9   BUILDING PERFORMANCE</strong>: The ability of building to behave according to designed criteria under given circumstances.</p> <p><strong>1.8.10  FACILITIES MANAGEMENT: </strong>The International Facilities Management         Association (I.F.M.A) has a broad definition for facilities management (FM) which is “the practice or coordinating the physical workplace with the people and work of the organization; integrates the principles of business administration, architecture, and the behavioral and engineering sciences”.</p> <p>          A more explicit definition is “an integrated approach to operating, maintaining, improving and adapting the buildings and infrastructure of an organization in order to create an environment that supports the primary objective of the organization”.</p> <p><strong>1.8.11 MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT: </strong>Maintenance management “involves   obtaining maximum benefit from the investment made on the      maintenance activities” (Olanrewaju, 2008).</p> <p><strong>1.8.12 PERFORMACE CRITERION:</strong> The quality of a component or material               required to ensure compliance with performance standards.</p> <p><strong>1.8.13 SERVICE LIFE OF BUILDING COMPONENTS: </strong>The period of installation          during which all properties exceed the minimum acceptable value</p> <p><strong>1.8.14 BUILDING MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT: </strong>Building maintenance management is a process of planning, directing, leading and coordinating organizational resources towards building maintenance so that the building will continue to serve its intended purposes effectively and efficiently (Olanrewaju, 2009).</p> <p><strong>1.8.15 BENCHMARKING: </strong>The continuous process of measuring products,    services and practices against the toughest competitors of those companies recognized as industry leaders (IFMA, 2011). </p> <p><strong>1.8.16 CORRUPTION:</strong> The abuse of entrusted power to personal gain, it hurts everyone whose life, livelihood or happiness appears to be shortened by it. In the context of this research, corruption since it turned from a vice to a virtue in government affairs has become the bane to must developmental strides. The radio Nigeria network news of Sunday 27th July 2012, in its commentary focused on its commentary the maintenance culture in Nigeria where it pointed out corruption as one of the major factors militating against setting up maintenance facilities in corporate organizations in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.8.17 NEGLIGENCE: </strong>This factor is another major one in which the government, the management of a public organization and its staff are all victims of. The height of Nonchalance on the part of these elements has also contributed to poor maintenance of facilities. How many times have we heard that a facility was burnt down to ashes as a result of a staff not turning off the electrical appliances in their offices before running out of office?</p> <p><strong>1.8.18 THE NIGERIAN FACTOR: </strong>This trend has always been and I am afraid may continue to be. Showing and exhibiting lackadaisical characteristics, all in the name of “it is not my father’s house, my duty is to do my job and get paid at the end of the day is an act, which has indirectly  spelt doom to the attainment of facilities maintenance.</p> <p><strong>1.8.20 VALUE ENGINEERING: </strong>Evaluation of construction methods and/or materials to determine which have the net result of reducing costs, consistent with specified performance, reliability, maintainability, aesthetic, safety, and security criteria(IFMA, 2011).</p>                                                          \n\nCHALLENGES OF BUILDING MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT IN CORPORATE ORGANIZATIONS <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CHALLENGES OF BUILDING MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT IN CORPORATE ORGANIZATIONS ", "id": 101}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong> BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>An investment in real estate development requires a huge sum of money, most at times exceeding six (6) figures as such only a hand full of individuals could venture into this form of investment.</p> <p>This financial insufficiency naturally turns investors to financial institution for possible credit advancement. Mbanefo (2002) observed that the importance of banks in our economy lies in their monopoly of the resources to provide loans for industrial and commercial developments. The provision of this loan however, carries the risk of default in repayment hence the need to take adequate, reliable and appropriate security for the purpose of insulating default risk associated with credit transactions in banks. According to CBN (1995) out of every N1.00 loan granted by Nigerian Banks only 57 kobo were capable of being realized representing 57%.</p> <p>Lending which may be on short, medium or long-term basis is one of the services that commercial banks do render to their customers. In other words, banks do grant loans and advances to individuals, business organizations as well as government in order to enable them embark on investment and development activities as a mean of aiding their growth in particular or contributing toward the economic development of a country in general. Commercial banks are the most important savings, mobilization and financial resource allocation institutions.</p> <p>Consequently, these roles make them an important phenomenon in economic growth and development. In performing this role, it must be realized that banks have the potential, scope and prospects for mobilizing financial resources and allocating them to productive investments. Therefore, no matter the sources of the generation of income or the economic Policies of the country, commercial banks would be interested in giving out loans and advances to their numerous customers bearing in mind, the three principles guiding their operations which are, profitability, liquidity and solvency. However, commercial banks decisions to lend out loans are influenced by a lot of factors such as the prevailing interest rate, the volume of deposits, the level of their domestic and foreign investment, banks liquidity ratio, prestige and public recognition to mention a few.</p> <p>Chodechai(2004) while investigating factors that affect interest rates, degree of lending volume and collateral setting in the loan decision of banks, says:“Banks have to be careful with their pricing decisions as regards to lending as banks cannot charge loan rates that are too low because the revenue from the interest income will not be enough to cover the cost of deposits, general expenses and the loss of revenue from some borrowers that do not pay. Moreover, charging too high loan rates may also create an adverse selection situation and moral hazard problems for the borrowers.”</p> <p>Therefore it is not an easy task for real estate investors’ to secure loan from either commercial bank or mortgage institution to finance their development, according to Agbola(1986) the procurement of necessary finance is sine-qua-non to the acquisition of adequate housing and the most probable source open to investor is through mortgage financing.</p> <p>This research work is set to appraise the perception of real estate investors’ on the lending requirement of commercial banks and mortgage institutions in Abuja metropolis</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The huge capital that is been require to kick start most real estate development and the high interest rate which is being use by commercial banks as lending criteria tends to leave most real estate investors’ flat footed.</p> <p>Chodechai(2004) asserted that “banks’ lending decisions are also influenced by the past relationship with the borrowers”. Past relationship according to him can help banks to obtain more private information, leading to a more accurate understanding of the borrower’s business and financial situation. Load demanded by financial institution in recent times is another major source of constraints in real estate development where the rate of inflation has a direct impact on interest rate.</p> <p>However, with respect to this research work, they are various challenges which are been faced by both parties involve, that is the financial institutions involve in real estate financing and the real estate investors, as the real estate investors depends on the financial institution for funds and most of them find it difficult to meet the requirement which is use by this financial institutions.     </p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong> JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>With regards to this research work which would appraise the perceptions of real estate investors towards the lending requirements use by commercial banks and mortgage institutions, this research would analyze particularly the several lending requirements use by the above mentioned financial institutions and determine how they affect real estate investors. As the use of financial leverage by real estate investors can significantly increase the rate of return investors earn on their invested equity.</p> <p>This expected magnification of return often induces investors to partially debt finance even if they have the accumulated wealth to pay all cash for the property.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong><strong> AIM AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to APPRAISAL OF THE PERCEPTION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTORS’ ON THE LENDING REQUIREMENTS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ABUJA, NIGERIA.</p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <ol><li>To ascertain the lending requirements of financial institutions.</li> <li>To examine the views of real estate investors on meeting-up with the lending requirements of financial institutions.</li> <li>To identify the problems being encountered by real estate investors’ when securing loan from financial institutions and recommend probable solutions.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <ol><li>What are the lending requirementsof financial institutions?</li> <li>What are the views of real estate investors in meeting the lending requirements of financial institutions?</li> </ol> <p><strong>3.</strong>What are the problems being encountered by real estate investors’ when securing loan from financial institutions?</p> <p><strong>1.7</strong><strong> SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p> The scope of this work would be within the purview of Abuja metropolis and    it would focus on the real estate investors’ within the following areas; Garki District, Wuse District and Central Area.

It is located in the Centre of Nigeria, within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Abuja is a planned city, and was built mainly in the 1980s. It officially became Nigeria's capital on 12 December 1991, replacing Lagos, which is still the country's most populous city. At the 2006 census, the city of Abuja had a population of 776,298, making it one of the top ten most populous cities in Nigeria. However, Abuja has witnessed a huge influx of people into the city which has led to the emergence of satellite towns such as Karu Urban Area, Suleja Urban Area, Gwagwalada, Lugbe, Kuje and smaller settlements to which the planned city is sprawling towards, the unofficial metropolitan area of Abuja is well over three million.</p> <p>According to Dermographia, the population Abuja's Urban Area as at 2012 is 2,245,000  making it the fourth largest urban area in Nigeria only surpassed by Lagos, Kano and Ibadan while PortHarcourt's urban area which is projected to be almost 2,000,000 is the fifth most populous urban area in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.9.1 GEOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE AREA</strong></p> <p>Abuja is located in the Centre of Nigeria and has a land area of 8,000 square Kilometers. It is bounded on the north by Kaduna state, on the west by Niger state, on the east and south-east by Nasarawa state and on the south-west by Kogi state. It falls within latitude 7 45' and 7 39'.</p> <p>One beautiful feature about Abuja which it derives from its central location is that it shares the savannah grass with the north. And the overall effect of this is that Abuja has rich soil for Agriculture and enjoys an equable climate that is neither too hot nor too cold all year round.</p> <p>The FCT experiences two weather conditions in the year. These are the rainy season which begins around March and runs through October, the dry season (usually characterized by bright sunshine) which begins from October and ends in March.</p> <p>Within these periods, there is a brief period of harmattan occasioned by the north east trade wind, with a resultant dusty haze and intense coldness and dryness. Nevertheless, the high altitude and undulating terrain of the FCT act as a modulating influence which makes the weather always clement.</p> <p><strong>1.9.2 HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENET OF THE STUDY AREA</strong></p> <p>The present Suleja was formally known as Abuja, a sparsely populated town with a population of about 500,000 people; it was completely rural with little or no infrastructure until the enactment of Decree No. 6 of 1976.</p> <p>Before the 1976 Decree, a committee ('The Aguda Panel')was commissioned to go round the country in search of a suitable location for the New Federal Capital with two major points of reference; a region that is sparsely populated and that is centrally located. And the region now known as Abuja met these requirements and hence became the recommended location for the New Federal Capital.</p> <p>The acceptance of the recommendation of the committee, led to the enactment of Decree No. 6, of 1976, the Federal Capital Territory Act, and this became the blueprint for the re-location of the new Federal Capital from Lagos to Abuja. The town originally known as Abuja was later renamed Suleja, while the name “Abuja” was reserved for the capital-to-be. In order to realize the objective of developing Abuja, the new Capital City, into a masterpiece on the African continent, the Federal Government established the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) as the sole agency vested with the responsibility of planning, designing and developing the city.</p> <p><strong>1.9.3 ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE</strong></p> <p>Administratively, the Federal Capital is structured into six area council namely, Abuja municipal, kuje, kwali, bwari, Abaji and gwagwalada. Each of the area council is administered as a local government under the general supervision of the FCT minister. The infrastructural planning and development of Abuja is handled by Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) with among others control the various development and maintenance units from 1992, when the federal government officially moved to Abuja from Lagos. The development has been so rapid and had to increase its manpower to meet the demand of housing, offices and infrastructural development required in the civil services workforce. During the precolonial period, the various ethnic groups in the area which now forms the FCT were administered as autonomous kingdom in their various locations. Such kingdom had some diverse interethnic, political and economic relations. Such external influences as slave trade, the jihad and colonial administration changed the pattern and structure of this indigenous administration. With the coming of the colonial administration, administrative heads were created for the various units. Under this set up, commonly referred to as the Native Authority (NA) system, emirates were established with emirs and chiefs as heads of the various administration units that were designated as emirates. These units were later broken into districts, Headed by districts heads.</p> <p><strong>1.9.4 ECONOMIC BASE OF ABUJA</strong></p> <p>Abuja has a GDP of $ 5.01billion and GDP per capital of $ 3,649 of the 2007 (estimate), it has one of the highest standards of living as compared to other cities in Nigeria. However, today the federal capital city economy is a public sector driven dominated economy which is driven by government patronage and the federal capital territory has attract serious business ranging from international firms to individual service provider.  </p> <p><strong>1.9.5 LOCATIONAL CHARACTERISTIC</strong></p> <p>Abuja is located just north of the confluence of Niger and Benue rivers. It is bordered by the state of Niger to the west and north, Kaduna to the northeast, Nassarawa to the east and south and Kogi to the southwest. Lying between latitude 8.25 and 9.20 north of the equator and longitude 6.25 and 7.35 east of Greenwich meridian, Abuja is geographically located in the Centre of the country. It is situated within the savannah region with moderate climatic condition.</p> <p>Figure 1.1: Map of Nigeria showing FCT</p> <p><strong>    Source:</strong> Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA), 2012</p> <p>Figure 1.2: Map of FCT showing Abuja</p> <p><strong> Source: </strong>Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA), 2012</p> <p>Figure 1.3: Map of Abuja showing Central Area District, Garki District and Wuse District, the study area.</p> <p><strong>Source</strong>: Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA), 2012</p>                                                          \n\nAPPRAISAL OF THE PERCEPTION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTORS’ ON THE LENDING REQUIREMENTS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " APPRAISAL OF THE PERCEPTION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTORS’ ON THE LENDING REQUIREMENTS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ", "id": 102}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Land is a national endowment that can be referred to as the said portion of the earth’s surface, while land use can be described as a way, manner or order in which land is used by people in an area for deterrent purposes. This rings about the need for the demand of commercial land acquisition for economic and business transaction.     </p> <p>Ogui urban is located in the capital city of Enugu state and has a typical urban environment, which is surrounded by major roads  and towns some at which include Oni – Asata, Holy Ghost, Ziks Avenue, Okpara Avenue and so on therefore making it accessible for which ever kind of business transaction. As a result, investors tend to exploit commercial land around these areas, which include, artisan, Edinburgh, independence layout new layout, onu-Asata, Obiagu etc. The unique attract a lot of investors who in turn refuse to abide to the enforced planning laws by the central authority. In other words, value in basic economics is detained as the utility or satisfaction which a good or seminar offers for the purpose of this write piece, value mean the worth of an interest in a land or building.</p> <p>Land use in Enugu was proposed earlier when Enugu was under Anambra state and the use of commercial lands by investors was properly monitored and up till date it is still being monitored but not effective like it used to be in the case investors who migrated into others areas that were not commercial proposed areas tailed to accept the fact that those areas were not purposively commercial proposed areas but were to support commercial activities. This therefore became a treat to the individuals residing in those areas. Ogui urban is a typical example of these areas. This work is to demonstrate the effects of commercial land use on land value, and I intend to sow this in this work piece.      </p> <p><strong>1.1       HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</strong></p> <p>Ogui urban is located in the capital city of Enugu state. She deviated from the Affar and got her first paramount Chief in the person of late Chief Augustine Nnamanni who died on the 30th day of October 1993. Ogui did have any chief until 2002 the chief was sworn in he was Chief Oko Michael Mmaduekwe.</p> <p>Ogui became or got her autonomous community on the 12th day of July 2003. Her culture in enriched with different dances and masquerade. Ogui urban is made up of five villages they include Umuokokwette, Umuabu, Onuatu Onu Asala and Onyke with two local government the Enugu North and the Enugu Central North. She shares a common boarder with her brother Abakpa Nike along the presidential road while the original Ogui dweller reside at Umunevo village. Now a town that accommodate a lot of investors and visitor and student.       </p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF GENERAL PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>For a long time now; it has been recorded that investors face the problem of investing blinding without knowing the effect on the land value. They do not know the effect of commercializing a land set out for federal values. As such most investors abuse the constitutional provision for land value and in time to come they will be victimized by the execution of government plan on an exploited land. The level of indiscriminate dumping of refuse that brings about environmental bleeder, the congestion of planned building by investors allowing space for the major road and eating into part of the pedestrian path.

This phenomenon of decay is manifested more on the structures and is characterized by acute shortages with demand always more than supply.  These result to cover crowding and rapid increase in rent levels. As a result of this, the urban poor who cannot afford the rent of decent structure is forced to live in shanty structures, thus the development of slum.</p> <p>Other social factors which triggers urban decay includes poor sanitary conditions, congestion and the general inadequacies of social services like water and electricity supplies recreational centres, health centres and so on.  According to Okeke D-C 2002, available facilities deteriorate fast and decay sets in due to over use, poor usage performance, lack of maintenance etc.</p> <p>Urban renewal scheme have continued to make massive impact in the improvement of urban slum in may parts of the World   (Anota, 1982). Urban renewal in its broadcast meaning is a form of reciperating change in the physical city by which the wornout or out modeled structures and facilities in an area are replaced in response to pressure of economic and social change.  Agreeing to this, Chapin 1965 therefore sees urban renewal as a process that has been going on as long as cities have existed. Urban Renewal strategies include that comprehensive clearance/ redevelopment, the rehabilitation and the conservation approach.  They can be used singly or in combination of one or two considering some criteria.</p> <p><strong>1.1       STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>The truth is that there is no town that has not its own share of problems.  In Nigerian, towns and cities are characterized by many problems. In Anambra State in general and Okpoko layout in Particular, one seems not notice that environmental degradation is the order to living.  The area is characterized by poor quality housing unmaintained streets, poor drainage systems and the absence or lack of public services and facilities.</p> <p>One of the major problems facing this community is the problem of poor road network. As a result of road network problem is the non mechanized road where passengers as well because of numerous pot holes.  Such factors and its combination results to high rate of transportation and constant hold ups. The present administration in Anambra State is really doing something about this problem. Another major problem facing Okpoko is lack basic infrastructural facilities and social utilities.  For example, open space which is a major facility in an urban area is not provided, the few place that were mapped out for an open space is used as a refuse dump.</p> <p>Presently, the Anambra environmental Protection Agency (ANSEPA) is working so hard to make Anambra State as a whole, clean. Another major problem of the study area that will be death with is housing, condition. Housing conditions will be groped into Good, fair and poor housing conditions according to some criteria.</p> <p><strong>1.2    RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>What is the general conditions of building in the study area?</p> <p>What is the population structure and characteristics of Okpoko?</p> <p>What is the general conditions of infrastructural facilities and social services in the study area?</p> <p>What ratio of car ownerships are there in the area?</p> <p>What is the income level educational level of Okpoko inhabitants?</p> <p><strong>1.3    AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to examine the general living conditions as well as assessing the basic conditions social services and infrastructural facilities of Okpoko with a view of making appropriate propovals of renewal strategies/ programmes that will provide decent living condition for the people. The objectives of the study includes:</p> <p>i. To address the problems of shortage of houses in Okpoko through renewal strategies by providing more housing units for the inhabitants of the study area.</p> <p>ii. To examine the environmental conditions, conditions improving them through renewal strategies.</p> <p>iii.   To examine the populations structure of Okpoko inhabitants.</p> <p><strong>1.3       RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>This is drawn in relation to the objectives.  Thus:</p> <p><strong>H0:    </strong>There is no significance relationship between the population of Okpoko residents and the general conditions of the basic social services and facilities.</p> <p><strong>HI:    </strong>There is a significant relationship between the population of Okpoko residents and the general condition of the basic social services and facilities in Okpoko.</p> <p><strong>1.5    KEY VARIABLES</strong></p> <p>In testing the above hypothesis, the dependent variable “Y” which is the condition of the basic social services and facilities depends on the independent variable “X” which is the population characteristics of the study are.</p> <p><strong>1.6       JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY </strong> </p> <p>From the planning point of view, the study is of great significance because it identifies the causes of urban decay and make proposal for its elimination or alleviation.  The study area, Okpoko to the precise is faced with the problems of overcrowding, over use of existing social services and community facilities, obsolent and sub-standard buildings.  Thus, the justification of this study is the propose a compressive approach for the alleviation of slum and the creation of an environment that is void of pollution, untidiness and eyesore.</p> <p><strong>1.6       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong> </p> <p>A study on urban Renewal for Onitsha with a particular reference to Okpoko in Ogbanu local Government Area, Anambra State is of immense importance for planning purposes, academic purposes, and developmental purposes.  Such research as this can enlighten the government, students, lecturer, and researchers on what could be obtained in Okpoko.</p> <p>        Such result can be information as well as education not just for the government but also for urban and regional planner who may apply the lesion and finding on their planning programme.</p> <p><strong>1.7       SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>For the purpose of this project and the time framework, this dissertation will be based on the housing conditions, transportation network, basic social services and infrastructural facilities obtainable in Okpoko.</p> <p><strong>1.8       OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS</strong></p> <p>The most research work, a lot of terminologies and / or professional jargons are often used to achieve comprehensive understanding of the work.</p> <p>Definition of terms in this sense becomes imperative more so when one considers the fact that the readers on such works might have their professional orientation in their disciplines. Such terms therefore, requires special definitions to give a clear cut meaning with regards to the context in which they are applied. In this work, the terms “urban’, Urban renewal’ ‘strategy” , ‘upgrading”, ‘blight”, “slum’ , neighbourhood” conveys specific meanings.  These are stated here under to avoid confusion while going through the work.</p> <p><strong>URBAN</strong></p> <p>Though, there is no agreement among experts as the most appropriate definition of what constitutes an urban area.  However, a more summarized definition of the term which suites out purpose here is that given by Mabogunje (1963), Using population index as a base, he definition an “urban” as any compact settlement with a population of 20,000 or more, which in addition will have to posses those other attributes of urban area such as large densely built up area, heterogeneity of population, specialization of economic activities and large portion of population in  non agricultural pursuits, sophisticated way of life much dives from rural norms and independent government within a large policy.</p> <p><strong>URBAN RENEWAL</strong></p> <p>The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English defined “renewal as to given new life and freshness.  The Chambers 20th Century Dictionary sees renewal as a process of renovating, transforming to new life, reviving, beginning again, making again, restoring, regenerating etc</p> <p>Synthesizing the two terms, “urban” and “renewal” urban renewal has therefore been described as a deliberate effort to change the environment through planned large scale of existing areas to meet present and future requirements for urban living and working (Grebler, 1965).</p> <p><strong>STRATEGY</strong></p> <p>The term “strategy’ as used here is a denoted plan of action for solving planning problems in our urban areas.</p> <p><strong>URGRADING</strong></p> <p>This is used in this work to mean raising the status, quality, value etc of the living conditions of the urban or city.</p> <p><strong>BLIGHT</strong></p> <p>The work ‘blight” is a term used to denote the deteriorating conations which have been renewed.  It is specifically referred to the deterioration of a dwelling unit below acceptable standard.</p> <p><strong>SLUM</strong></p> <p>According to the United States Housing Act of 1937, slum in defined as a an area where dwellings, predominate which by reason of dilapidation overcrowding, faulty, arrangement  or design, lack of ventilation, poor sanitation conditions, or any combinations of these factors is detrimental to the safety, health, welfare or morals of the people.</p> <p><strong>NEIGHBOURHOOD</strong></p> <p>Neighbourhood here implies a residential layout within an urban setting in which the resident have common and convenient access to a number of public services and facilities such as schools, plarygroudns, shopping centre etc. The development layout of this idea was first put forward by Clearance Perry (1910) which he explained in detail in one of his works.  “a neighbourhood is a primary school district.</p>                                                          \n\nHOUSING CONDITIONS AND OCCUPANCY RATIO IN OKPOKO URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " HOUSING CONDITIONS AND OCCUPANCY RATIO IN OKPOKO URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING", "id": 104}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p> <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p> <br/><br/></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Transportation and property are important in physical and economic development of towns and cities all over the world. Property and land values tend to increase in areas with expanding transportation networks, and increase less rapidly in areas without such improvements. Rapid and continued rise in housing and land prices are expected in cities with transportation improvements and rapid economic and population growth (Goldberg, 1970).</p> <p>Man, nations, regions and the world would be severely limited in development without transportation, which is a key factor for physical and economic growth (Oyesiku, 2002). Transportation systems and land use are interdependent. Indeed findings of earlier studies indicate compelling and consistent connections amongst them (Ewing and Cervero, 2001; Polzin, 2004). According to Bailey, Mokhtarian, and Littlel (2008), transportation route is part of distinct development pattern or road network and mostly described by regular street patterns as an indispensable factor of human existence, development and civilization. The route network coupled with increased transport investment result in changed levels of accessibility reflected through Cost Benefit Analysis, savings in travel time, and other benefits. These benefits are noticeable in increased catchment areas for services and facilities like shops, schools, offices, banks, and leisure activities.</p> <p>Road networks are observed in terms of its components of accessibility, connectivity, traffic density, level of service, compactness, and density of particular roads. Level of service is a measure by which the quality of service on transportation devices or infrastructure is determined, and it is a holistic approach considering several factors regarded as measures of traffic density and congestion rather than overall speed of the journey (Mannering, Walter, and Scott, 2004).</p> <p><br/></p> <p>1</p> <p><br/></p> <p>Access to major roads provides relative advantages consequent upon which commercial users locate to enjoy the advantages. Modern businesses, industries, trades and general activities depend on transport and transport infrastructure, with movement of goods and services from place to place becoming vital and inseparable aspects of global and urban economic survival. Developments of various transportation modes have become pivotal to physical and economic developments. Such modes include human porterage, railways, ropeways and cableways, pipelines, inland waterways, sea, air, and roads (Said and Shah, 2008).</p> <p>According to Oyesiku (2002), urbanization in Nigeria has a long history in its growth and development. Extensive development being a feature of the 19th and 20th centuries, with concentration of economic and administrative decision-making in Lagos, Ibadan, Kaduna, Jos, and Enugu, and high degree of specialization and larger population associated with greater specialization of goods and services. Wyatt (1997) states that urban areas have tendency to develop at nodal points in transport network and places with good road network will possess relative advantage over locations having poor network. Urban locations with such relative advantage are found where different transport routes converge with high degree of compactness, connectivity, density, length and accessibility exhibited within the intra- and inter- urban road networks.</p> <p>Ikeja is a typical example in the history of growth and development of cities in Nigeria. The city became capital of Lagos State in 1976 with improved road networks developed to cater for increase in concentration of pedestrian and vehicular movements. Similarly, commercial activities like banking, retail/wholesale businesses, and professional services congregated to take advantage of nearness to seat of governance. Concentration of activities attracted consumers and ancillary service providers. This partly caused increase in demand for commercial space and its concomitant effects on commercial property values along arterial roads in the metropolis.</p> <p>The present position concerning commercial properties in Ikeja is that majority are located along arterial roads that deliver much of the vehicular and pedestrian movements. There have been increases in rental values along the individual arterial roads although not at equal rates. It is against this background that this research analyzed the arterial roads, determined the levels of accessibility, connectivity, traffic density of the individual arterial roads, examined the pattern of</p> <p>2</p> <p><br/></p> <p>commercial property values and the relationship between the explanatory variables of the road network in Ikeja Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Research Problem</strong></p> <p>The relationship between transportation and urban property values has been the focus of many studies (for example, Dewees, 1976; Damm et al, 1980; Wolf, 1992; Singh, 2005). Some of the earlier studies returned positive relationship between transport and property values while others showed negative relationship. For instance, in a study on the relationship between rail travel cost and residential property values, a replacement of streetcar with subway increased site rent at a location that is perpendicular to the facility within a one-third mile walk to the station (Dewees, 1976); and there was positive influence of permanent transportation improvements on land values (Wolf, 1992). It was established that there was statistically significant relationship between distance of a parcel of land to the nearest Metro station and land price (Damm, Lerner-Lam, and Young, 1980), while there was evidence that residential property prices decrease immediately around the transport investment or station value uplift through changes in land values (Singh, 2005).</p> <p>The urban areas all over the world offer a number of advantages in terms of concentration of people followed by demand for commercial properties and transportation. Ikeja is a classical example of a city that has developed rapidly since 1976 when it became the Lagos State capital. Construction of roads increased substantially with the opening up of residential precincts that also benefitted from increasing demand for lettable spaces in commercial properties. Many private companies, retail stores, commercial banks aggregate in the metropolis to take advantage of opportunities afforded by locations near the seat of governance thus attracting complimentary services. This led to high concentration of vehicular and pedestrian movements especially along the access roads.</p> <p>The roads exhibit a number of nodes and linkages to form networks of both arterial and minor routes along which commercial properties locate. Commercial users displaced residential users, causing sites to be at highest and best uses with concomitant increases in the values of commercial properties. Accessibility within the road network is affected by the compact nature of various routes that sometimes</p> <p><br/></p> <p>3</p> <p><br/></p> <p>impede volume of traffic. The road network is made up of nodal points and links that determine the degree of connectivity and accessibility in the network.</p> <p>A number of factors affect values of properties. These factors may be intrinsic or extrinsic. The extrinsic factors include increase in demand for lettable space, location, condition of adjoining properties, nearness to park and leisure, local and national economic conditions. External factors are due to natural characteristics of the property which affect the city where the property is located. Intrinsic factors arise from within the nature of the property itself and relate to the physical attributes, including size of room, state of repair, decoration, and facilities. Other attributes that increase or decrease the amount that users are willing and able to pay in an open market transaction include physical characteristics of the structure, change in taste and demand, effect of adjacent activities, economic activities, inflation, and changes in legislation. The demand for commercial properties itself is affected by changes in population, planning and development schemes, legislation, and availability of good road networks (Hendon, 1971; William, Davies, and Johnson, 1980; Richmond, 1982; Millington, 1982; Olayiwola, Adeleye and Oduwaye, 2006).</p> <p>Earlier theorists (Burgess, 1925; Hoyt, 1939; Harris and Ullman, 1951; Lean and Goodall, 1977) generally believe that sites adjacent to main transport routes have relative advantages over those located some distance away, and other sites located at route intersections possess relative advantage with greater advantages belonging to sites located at focus of transport system. These advantages are determined in relation to accessibility, which has different characteristics in relation to individual sites thus differentiating between sites in terms of accessibility advantages.</p> <p>Many of the aforementioned studies emphasized the effects of the factors on values of properties generally with little consideration given to road network pattern and its effects on values of commercial properties. Possible relationships between road networks, location attribute, demand and supply, and accessibility and commercial property values have therefore elicited the interest of the researcher in this direction. The relationship cannot be determined without due consideration given to the explanatory variables on one hand and commercial property values on the other. The use of roads leads to a study of urban areas in relation to land uses, especially commercial properties. It is against this background that this study was conceived.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>4</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>1.3 Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The foregoing has elicited a number of questions in terms of road network analysis and values of commercial properties in Ikeja, Nigeria to which answers are to be proffered. The relationship between arterial road network and commercial property values cannot be determined without due consideration given to variables that make up the network, especially those that relate to arterial roads and other explanatory variables and values of commercial properties. Some pertinent questions to enable the study attain its stated objectives are as follows:</p> <p>1.    What is the pattern of arterial roads in Ikeja?</p> <p>2.    What are the spatial pattern and trend of commercial property values in the study area?</p> <p>3.    What are the relationships between commercial property values and arterial road network in the presence or absence of other explanatory variables?</p> <p>4.    What are the individual contributions of the explanatory variables to variability in commercial property values?</p> <p>5.    What are the models to explain and predict the relationship between the explanatory variables and commercial property values?</p> <p><strong>1.4 Aim and Objectives of the Research</strong></p> <p>The aim of this research is to analyze the network of arterial roads and other explanatory variables and commercial property values in Ikeja, while the specific objectives are to:</p> <p>a.        Analyze the arterial road network pattern in the study area;</p> <p>b.        Examine the spatial pattern and trend of demand, supply and values of commercial properties in the study area;</p> <p>c.         Determine the relationships between commercial property values and road network, in the presence or absence of other variables, in the study area;</p> <p>d.        Determine the contributions of individual explanatory variables to variability in commercial property values in the study area;</p> <p>e.        Derive models for predicting variability in commercial property values in relation to the explanatory variables.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>5</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>1.5 Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>Consequently, the following hypotheses were postulated:</p> <p>1.        There is no significant relationship between commercial property values and independent explanatory variables in the study area.</p> <p>2.        There are no differences in individual contributions of explanatory variables to variability in commercial property values in the study area.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Justification and Rationale for the Research</strong></p> <p>It is trite amongst earlier studies on accessibility in relation to property values that profitability and utility are determined by accessibility. The greater the accessibility of a location the greater the comparative advantage, and the greater the comparative advantages the greater the demand for property at the location. Lean and Goodall (1977), for instance, stated that urban areas naturally develop at nodal points in the transport network and those locations with good transport access to other areas have relative advantage over locations with poorer transport facilities and that urban locations having such relative advantages are likely to be where transport routes converge. Similarly, Estate Surveyors/Valuers and Planners believe that accessibility has great impacts on property values, with properties along major roads and at nodal points having greater values (Ogunsanya, 1986; Oduwaye, 2004; Omoogun, 2006). However, accessibility discussed in these studies was based on intuition without empirical basis to justify what relative accessibility advantages the locations have.</p> <p>This study borrows techniques found useful in other fields like operational research, geography, transportation and urban planning to explain and analyze road network for purpose of determining the relative accessibility of each of the arterial roads. It is believed that the techniques used in these fields can be extended to studies in estate management, thereby making cross-fertilization of research ideas across various fields possible. In this regard, this research has become relevant in determining the relationship between arterial road network and values of commercial properties in Ikeja.</p> <p>In addition, it is essential to establish a technique that may be useful for determining relative accessibility of locations in the network of arterial roads. Even when relative advantages are determined, there is need to develop models that will be useful for predicting commercial property values in Nigeria. The model may become</p> <p><br/></p> <p>6</p> <p><br/></p> <p>tool for professional Estate Surveyors and Valuers to change their practice of using intuition to determine relative accessibility of locations in a road network. Similarly, there is the need to predict the supply of, demand for, and fair market values of commercial properties by developers, Estate Surveyors and Valuers, and feasibility and viability appraisers in present day’s risks and uncertainty in property development. This has underscored the importance of this study.</p> <p>Based on complexity of commercial, industrial, real estate activities and degree of urbanization exemplified by the study area, deductions and findings from the study may be applicable to other cities in Nigeria. The study will also arouse the interest of researchers in estate surveying and valuation particularly along transportation valuation, an aspect that probably has not been explored in Nigeria.</p> <p>A review of literature showed that studies on Nigerian intra-urban road network using the graph-theoretic concept to determine accessibility effects on commercial property values are scanty, available ones were on USA and U.K. This study will therefore contribute to empirical studies on intra-urban road network and its influence on commercial property values in Ikeja, Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.7 Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>Roads may be classified as international, inter-city or intra-city. International and inter-city roads are usually major or arterial roads, while intra-city roads are routes within a city and may be minor or major (arterial). The study focused on arterial roads in the intra-urban network of Ikeja. There are ninety roads in Ikeja out which thirty-seven are arterial. From the thirty-seven arterial roads in the study area, only twenty traverse the commercial axes while others serve institutional, industrial, and residential neighbourhoods. This study therefore covered all major roads serving the commercial axis and inner areas of Ikeja to the exclusion of inter-city roads such as Lagos/Abeokuta Expressway, Oworonsoki/Apapa Expressway, Ikorodu Road, and Lagos/Ibadan Expressway that form rings around the study area.</p> <p>Preliminary study revealed that there are five types of commercial properties in the study area. These are retail shop premises, banking spaces, office properties, warehouses, and non-specific commercial properties. In respect of this research, focus was on offices, shops, banking spaces and other types of commercial users along the arterial routes to the exclusion of residential, industrial, and non-specific type of commercial properties.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>7</p> <p><br/></p> <p>Due to the magnitude, terrain and complex nature of Lagos State roads, the study was limited to Ikeja intra-city roads. Ikeja is the predominant component of Ikeja Local Government, which itself is one of four zones identified within the larger Lagos metropolis. The four zones (Lagos Island, Apapa, Lagos Mainland, and Ikeja) represent commercial hubs of Lagos metropolis, which as revealed by preliminary observation, shows activity areas where employment, commercial, transportation terminals, and other businesses are concentrated (Oni, 2008).</p> <p>Road network analysis was carried out to determine the levels of accessibility and connectivity of nodal points as well as road and traffic densities in the hope of predicting commercial property values along each arterial road. In doing so, only the arterial roads identified as commercial axes in the study area were the focus of the research to the exclusion of secondary connector roads, while the relationship between arterial roads and commercial properties in the study area were examined.</p> <p>Many factors have dictated the choice of Ikeja. First, it is the capital of Lagos State of Nigeria and a socially heterogeneous city with variety of local, state and federal government roads. Second, the property market in the study area is well developed and it is possible to identify and analyze variations. Comprehensive data are available on commercial property values in Ikeja, which is one of the few cities in Nigeria offering opportunity for comprehensive survey of its commercial properties, with enlightened occupiers of commercial premises thereby making data collection possible. Third, a number of property magazines are in circulation in the city where professional Estate Surveyors and Valuers advertise commercial properties available for sale or letting. This makes the property market very active and up-to-date with stakeholders, prospective tenants, property owners, and investors versatile and knowledgeable about the goings-on in the market. Fourth, judging from what is applicable in Nigeria, the Ikeja road network is one of the most complex in terms of linkages, human and vehicular movements with availability of computerized and up-to-date data and satellite images of the road network.</p> <p><strong>1.8 Limitations of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study focused on analysis of arterial roads and commercial property values in Ikeja. It did not attempt to investigate the structural stability of the arterial road network or assess the methods and accuracy of methods adopted by respondents in fixing the values of commercial properties in the study area. It simply analyzed</p> <p><br/></p> <p>8</p> <p><br/></p> <p>accessibility, connectivity, arterial road network, distance to most central place in the study area, demand and supply of commercial properties in relation to commercial property values in the study area. Graph theoretic technique was used to analyze the arterial road network while opinions of Estate Surveyors and Valuers practicing in the study area were relied upon. The accuracy, or otherwise, of such opinions although not in doubt was not investigated.</p> <p>Some challenges were encountered during the study. By virtue of the busy nature of Estate Surveying and Valuation practitioners and “carefulness” of occupiers of the sampled commercial properties, there was considerable reluctance on their parts to volunteer information. Some of the respondents, especially Estate Surveyors and Valuers, delayed in completing the questionnaires and it took personal influence of the researcher (as their colleague) and assistance of the Lagos State Branch Chairman of the Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers to obtain their eventual impressive responses. In addition, the researcher took time to allay the fears of Occupiers by educating them about the essence of the research, that it would in no way expose them to imposition of levies or charges or any liability to the Lagos State Government.</p> <p>The populations of commercial properties and occupiers in the study area were indeterminate. The study population was too large and there was no census available to ascertain them thereby making determination of their number somewhat tasking. The researcher however found a way out of the challenge by using a form of sampling based on estimated population of occupiers and adopting direct observation of the sampled properties to determine the average number of occupiers. These limitations however neither affected the quality of data collected nor the conclusions drawn from it.</p> <p>The various opinions of Estate Surveyors and Valuers were relied upon, in some cases, to the exclusion of those of occupiers especially in respect of questions that required a form of professional opinion. This was consequent upon the findings from the pilot tests earlier conducted which showed that the occupiers found such questions too technical. Hence, questions like rating of the roads in the study area in terms of accessibility, supply and demand of commercial properties were subsequently limited to the Estate Surveyors and Valuers.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>9</p> <p><br/></p>                                                          \n\n ARTERIAL ROAD NETWORK AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTY VALUES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  ARTERIAL ROAD NETWORK AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTY VALUES", "id": 105}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This research work emphasized on the analysis of the impact of parks and open spaces on residential property values in Independence Layout. The focus of this study was to analyze the impact of pack and open spaces on residential property values.

Some information and findings were made; these findings are statistically analyzed and resulting in some conclusions and recommendations. </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Open spaces, such as public parks, natural areas and golf courses provide numerous amenities for nearby residents including recreation opportunities and attractive views.</p> <p>Residents who live in close proximity to these resources, however, may also experience dis-amenities such as traffic congestion and noise.In light of the declining condition of many state and local budget situations throughout the nation, the need for parks and open space agencies to prove their worth in order to attain continued funding for their services and facilities is essentially crucial. While the many impacts that parks and other open spaces imbue upon residential property value are easy to describe, they are typically harder to quantify.</p> <p>Therefore, a need exists for park and open space professionals to develop means of placing values on the contributions of open spaces to society.</p> <p>In a previous issue of parks &amp; recreation, Crompton (2001) outlined what he calls the proximate principle the increase in value of properties surrounding such open space amenities. In addition, he summarized results of approximately two dozen early studies into this hypothesis. However, as Crompton noted, some of these studies, ranging in year of publication from the 1870s to the 1980s, exhibited methodological inadequacies and inconsistencies that limit their credibility for current researchers. Using an economic method known as the hedonic pricing technique, in combination with the spatial analyses made possible by the advent of geographic information system (GIS) technologies, it is now possible to conduct far more detailed and accurate analyses of the impacts of open spaces on surrounding property values.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Like many places across the country, Independence Layout, Enugu State is rapidly losing open space to urbanization. This was the fastest-developing part of the State.</p> <p>Independence Layout, Enugu, the highbrow section of Enugu, the coal city, was carved out by the post-independence administration of the legendary late Dr. Michael Okpara, the former premier of Eastern Region. Okpara, after Nigeria’s Independence, expanded Enugu with further acquisitions for physical development.</p> <p>Past population growth has translated into steep land conversion rates throughout the area. The area region increased with population. This indicates a land-consumptive, low-density pattern of growth. As of 2010, over 41% of Independence Layout had been developed, while only 9% of the total land mass had been protected as open space. Given the current rate of growth and development, if the Area does not begin to emphasize land conservation policies and programs, an estimated 78 percent of the area will be developed by the year 2020.</p> <p>Parks and open space will provides numerous benefits to the Area which will be lost or compromised if current development patterns continue unaltered. These benefits include water purification and protection of drinking water supplies, provision of wildlife habitat, and human health and recreation benefits.</p> <p><strong>1.3 AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this project is to study the impact of parks and open spaces on residential property values in Independence Layout, Enugu State.</p> <p>The idea is to present a report based on indebt research to achieve the following objectives which include:</p> <p>a. To identify the location of parks and open spaces in Independence Layout, Enugu</p> <p>b. To ascertain  if parks and open spaces have any influence on the rental and capital values of residential buildings in Independence Layout, Enugu.</p> <p>c. To analyze the merits and demerits of parks and open spaces in tandem with the welfare and satisfaction of the residents.</p> <p>d. To suggest ways of improving open space and parks conservation in the study area.</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1. Where are the locations of parks and open spaces in Independence Layout, Enugu?</p> <p>2.

It is common knowledge to see newly completed government properties dilapidate very fast, thereby causing economic waste. Investigations revealed the poor condition of public properties is caused by various act backs there re a member of management, problems, such as insufficient funding poor facility management, political influence, bureaucracy, personal interest and lack of professionalism. Nigeria Railway corporation properties include undeveloped land and landed properties. The landed properties are residential building shops, catering services, office and guesthouses. Management of these properties by the Railway property company limited, under the control of Nigeria Railway Corporation Board had led to the unhealthy nature of these properties. Management of pubic properties by a board is usually characterized by some difficulties such as bureaucracy, political influence, insufficient funding in the management system of the Nigerian Railway Corporation properties to enhance effectiveness and efficiency. In view of the above negative management tendencies by a board of directors, it is necessary to privatize management of properties of the Nigeria Railway Corporation in order to inject prudent Management in the system. Privatization of management system of public properties has been advocated by professional bodies such as the Nigeria Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers as the only viable option to turn around the dilapidation of public properties in this country. Privatization encourages prudent management of public properties. In this direction round pegs should be put in round holes. Incapacitating of public properties in Nigeria needs. To be transformed in order to reduce huge economic waste in pubic properties in this country hence  the institution of Estate surveyors and Valuers and other related professional bodes in bodies in Nigeria should rise up to advocate private partnership participates in the management of public properties.  Management of pubic properties by a board of directors calls for a change. There is the need to join the rest of the civilized world in their style of management of public properties. Private partnership participation in management brings about profitability and it should encourage especially in the Nigeria Railway corporation properties.                                 </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.9</strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.10 Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Estate surveying and valuation in Nigeria is a child of the British system. The theoretical bases and professional curricula for the local training in Nigeria have been molded after the system established in the united Kingdom by Rics/Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. It remained a natural fact that Estate surveyor and valuer in Nigeria took after from the practice in United Kingdom.</p> <p>Valuation may be defined as the art and science of estimating the value of a particular property at a particular time at a particular place taking into consideration all the factors that bear direct and indirect influence on the property market. Valuation as regards to the assets of any organization is usually given much attention because an assets of any organization is the bedrock of such organization.</p> <p>However assets valuation is an important thing in any organization both public and private because it helps to discover the :Going concern” of the organization, which aimed at discovering whether the organization is growing (improving) or decreasing to avoid liquidation.</p> <p>The public properties on the other hand can be seen as properties established by the government to serve the public. The state of public properties in Nigeria is a source of worry to well meaning Nigeria. Investigation revealed that poor performances and conditions of public properties is caused by various set back.</p> <p>Nigeria Railway corporation properties includes undeveloped land and landed properties. Landed properties are residential buildings, shops, catering services, office and quest houses. As one of the public corporation, Nigeria railways corporation was established by law in 1912 by the British colonial masters to provides rail transportation services in the nation. The organization was structured according to the policy objectives establishing it. The headquarters was located  at Ebute meta, now in Lagos state and its districts headquarters were located at Ibadan, Enugu, Kaduna, Bauchi and Kafanchan. The district headquarters in turn have their area offices to enhance implementation of management policies, hence the intention of the colonial masters to transport people, products and materials to different parts of the country.</p> <p>However, it is with great regret that the cooperation have failed to live up to its expectation in all ramification.</p> <p>It is against this background that the researcher seeks to examine the problem and prospects of the valuation of Assets of public bodies                                                  </p>                                                          \n\nAN EXAMINATION OF PROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF VALUATION OF ASSETS OF PUBIC BODIES <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN EXAMINATION OF PROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF VALUATION OF ASSETS OF PUBIC BODIES ", "id": 108}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The ground rent has of course become an established part of modern leasing practice, but is only as recently as the as the 1950’s that landoners were granted leases at a fixed rents by the government without review.

The priority accorded the issue of housing is immense; to most governments, the availability of sufficient but basic housing for all is often stated as a priority for enhancing the social needs of the society. In Nigeriaalone there is a shortage of 150,000 units annually (National housing policy, 2004), the government alone with its public housing initiatives cannot curb this problem hence the need for private investors in the real estate market.</p> <p>Habitable housing contributes to the health, efficiency, social behavior and general welfare of the population. Apart from providing man with shelter and security, housing plays a major role serving as an asset. For any typical home-owner, the house is a major asset that adds onto his portfolio and for many households; the purchase of a house represents a lifelong investment and a store of wealth. Provision of housing services depends mostly upon a wellfunctioning housing finance system. The consideration of constructing or acquiring a house is influenced by the cost and various government economic policies which could be fiscal or monetary (Giussani and Hadjimatheou, 1991) and even depends on the economic system adopted in a country.</p> <p>Housing is a major purchase requiring long-term financing, and the factors that are associated with well-functioning housing finance systems are those that enable the provision of longterm finance. It is evident that countries with stronger legal rights for borrowers and lenders through collateral and bankruptcy laws, credit information systems that are well informed, and a stable macroeconomic environment have more developed housing finance systems (Warnock 2008). These factors also help explain the variation in housing finance across emerging market economies.</p> <p>1.1 Statement of the Problem</p> <p>In line with the government’s effort in achieving Vision 2020 and the overall development of the economy, provision of housing is essential. With an acute shortage of 150000 units annually and the ever-increasing population, a housing problem arises and consequently social and economic problems. Housing here is not the only problem, but adequate housing that can allow for the comfort ability levels sort by mankind. . The importance attached to housing problems by the government has resulted in the adoption of the housing policy; its implementation and effectiveness has not been adequate as is depicted by the current state of housing in Nigeria.</p> <p>Fallis (1994) noted that housing problem might be focused on the causes, for example; the housing problem might be described as being caused by an underdeveloped mortgage market which leads to the loss of simple rental housing. There were various reasons deduced as causes of housing problems. The most important reason has been the variation between the price of habitable and decent accommodation and the number of individuals that can afford it. In the long term, market forces and government intervention determine the specific size of each of the housing tenures (Warnock 2008)</p> <p>A large gap exists between the demand and supply of housing finance. Critical analysis and clear understanding of the money market and the current financial system in the country is required to effectively relate housing finance and house delivery. The purchase or construction of housing in many countries is inhibited because individuals cannot borrow funds. The available loans are channeled to high and middle-income families. The problem is how do we avail the loanable funds to the low income earners? Finding measures to address this problem and subsequent implementation will provide for adequate affordable housing for the low-income earners.</p> <p>The lack of finance has been caused by the intermittent sources of income and low income from the informal employment. UN Habitat (2003) puts forward that the informal sector, which provides for the bulk of employment to the low income group, has not been generating regular and enough income to undertake the expensive housing construction and improvement. Consequent to this, those in the low income group need to save for many years if ever they are to realize a dream of living in an adequate house.</p> <p>The problem again is how do we avail funds to the low income earners who have no collateral to act as security and not risk bursting the real estate bubble? Can the available financial models allow it? If so, how do we avoid a scenario like that in the USA in 2007.Too much borrowing and an assumption that the prices of homes would only go up led to the mortgage crisis. According to Dean Baker (2008), before the mortgage crisis, banks offered easy access to money.  One could qualify for mortgages with little or no documentation. Even individuals with bad credit could qualify as subprime borrowers. Stringent measures on Mortgage applications were not applied to check for accuracy as well as it should have been. When the mortgage crisis began, home prices stopped rising, borrowers who bought more houses than they could afford stopped paying the mortgage, monthly payments increased on adjustable rate mortgages as interest rates rose. This led to the banks repossessing the houses leaving most in a state of homelessness.</p> <p>Critical evaluation of the factors that influence financing for housing in the country could lead to the formulation of models that if well assimilated into the existing financial system could yield effective and efficient results.</p> <p>1.2 Research Hypothesis</p> <p>The supply of housing delivery is influenced by factors other than demand, hence inaccessible by the low-income earner.</p> <p>1.3 Research Objectives</p> <p>To identify the factors that influence housing delivery.</p> <p>To establish their impact to the provision of housing.</p> <p>To analyze housing supply characteristics in developing economies.</p> <p>To identify direct and indirect sources of housing finance and the avenues that can avail funds for the low-income earner.</p> <p>1.4 Research Questions</p> <p>What are the main factors that influence the supply and demand for loanable funds for property development in Kebbi State, Nigeria?</p> <p>What is the impact of socio-economic and financial factors and government policies in housing development/real estate investment?</p> <p>What are the main sources of housing finance for households and what strategies can avail the funds to low income households?</p> <p>1.5 Area and Scope of Study</p> <p>This study focuses on Nigeria, a developing country; the development of its built environment has been described as vibrant. This research will aim at both rural and urban areas, real estate development takes place in all parts of the country, and this research will be able to find out whether the factors that affect housing finance in one part of the country are uniform or vary with that in another part.</p> <p>Nigeria offers both a macro and microeconomic platform enabling critical evaluation of all factors available in both economic environments. The impact on the country’s money market due to macroeconomic shocks for example, volatility of interest rates consequent to inflation, unemployment rate vs. employment rate among other factors. The microeconomic environment attempts to depict the attitude of households in the demand and supply of housing finance.</p> <p>The scope of this study will be restricted to conventional financial institutions and households that attempt to access funds for housing development. The study will examine how different factors affect the supply of funds by lenders and the demand of the funds by households. The research will also highlight the housing finance system employed in the country, its characteristics and role in housing delivery.</p> <p>1.6 Significance of the Study</p> <p>The findings on the study will be useful to the stakeholders and players in the real estate industry. It will reveal that the availability of housing finance is not determined only by the interplay of supply and demand but also other factors such as socio-economic factors, financial factors and the government policies play a part as to this. The study will assist individuals in decision making processes and assessing the different avenues that can avail funds for housing development.</p> <p>The supply of housing is governed by supply and demand factors. Real estate development requires time to plan, permit and build hence supply is very inelastic. Housing demand is fairly predictable as it varies with income level. The level of income correlates to the availability of mortgage finance. Mortgage finance is an important factor in generating housing demand. Boleat (2008) postulated that there is a strong connection between economic development and the size of the mortgage market. It is also important for one to identify the various financial options available and assess the costs of such finance.</p> <p>Over the years, different policies and strategies have been used in Nigeria to improve the housing delivery system and quality of housing to the low-income group. However, most of the policies developed have been slow and ineffective; this could be attributed to the limited resources to fund the low- income group and their access to housing finance. The study is therefore important to the Nigerian housing policy formulation process as it will identify the major issues in housing finance. The study will also provide useful background information for those institutions involved in housing finance initiatives to understand the types and characteristic of housing finance loan products required in the market.</p> <p>housing delivery process, what is housing delivery, what is housing delivery system, housing delivery in nigeria pdf, housing delivery definition, housing delivery strategies, nigerian housing policy between 1990 and 2013, literature review housing quality</p>                                                          \n\nFACTORS AFFECTING HOUSING DELIVERY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FACTORS AFFECTING HOUSING DELIVERY", "id": 110}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.0 INTRODUCTION</p> <p>The impact of inflation on the value of assets is considered one of the primary financial concerns of long term investors. While actual and expected inflation have slowed considerably since the early 1980’s, concern over future increases is still a consideration for long term investors. Ibbotson and Siegael (1995) conclude that real estate compensates the investor for inflation risk. When real estate is added to a mixed-asset portfolio, the inflation risk of the expanded portfolio is substantially below that the original portfolio (expanded real estate). In recent years, during which we have inflation seen the incidence of inflation falling to low levels and fairly static property markets, the conventional wisdom has means low, or no growth in property values. There are many benefits from investing in property in a low inflation environment and particular risks in investing in a high inflation environment.</p> <p>The key to understand the impact inflation on property values is found in two factors in particular. Firstly, the benefit from real estate is maintaining a hedge against inflation and over</p> <p>and above that, increasing the purchasing power of capital by having it increase in value ahead of the rate of inflation, any change in value for a given period above or below the rate of inflation is called the “real” growth rate. Parkin, J. Micjeal (1975) Historically Kwara houses prices have increased over the long term at around 10% per annum compound. Inflation during the same period has averaged around 7% per annum growth, that is, the growth above the inflation rate which is increasing the purchasing power of our capital and therefore our “real “ wealth, has averaged around 3% per annum. If in every year inflation was 12% and prices increased by 15% giving us a 3% real increase, this will be telling us that the property market is booming. Chris and Ola (2001) Why then, when inflation is saying 2% and values increases 5%, again giving us a 3% real increases do they adopt a negative view? The result is virtually the same.</p> <p>The second key to understand the impact of inflation on property values is on the aspect of homeowners’wealth in housing is currently the largest part of Nigeria households’ investment portfolios. After stock prices collapsed in 2009 and mortgage rates hit historically low levels,</p> <p>investment in residential housing picked up. This increase, coupled with higher home prices, boosted household wealth in real estate from $6.6 trillion in 2000 to $10.5 trillion in the second quarter of 2005 and an increase of more than 58 percent. Over the same period, household</p> <p>wealth in corporate equities lost a fourth of its value, falling from $8 trillion to $6 trillion.</p> <p>Housing price bubbles occur when home prices grow at a rate exceeding the inflation rate in an area, especially the inflation rate for construction materials and labor. In such situations, higher home prices generally reflect increased demand.Chris and Ola (2001)</p> <p>For world economic markets, Inflation is a fairly new experience as for much of the pre-twentieth century there had been little upward pressure on prices. These limit governments’ abilities. Inflation reflects a situation where the demand for goods and services exceeds their supply in the economy (Hall, 1982). It causes could be triggered by the private sector and the government spending more than their revenues, or by shortfalls in output. Price increases could also be triggered by increases in costs of production. For instance increases in prices of imported raw materials will cause inflation if not managed. Whatever the initial cause, inflation will not persist unless accomplished by sustained increase in money supply. In this case, inflation is monetary phenomenon. But what effect does inflation have on property values. Inflation causes many distortions in the real estate market. It hurts people who are retired and living on a fixed income. When prices rise these consumers cannot buy as much as they could previously. This discourages saving due to the fact that the money is worth more presently than in the future. This expectation reduces economy needs a certain level of savings to finance investments which boosts economic growth.</p> <p>1.1 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p> <p>Inflation is one of the challenges facing property values any urban areas in the World. The first is through increased costs: higher wages for construction labor, higher construction material costs and higher land prices. When the prices of new houses and old houses are compared, new houses are more expensive on average than old houses, and the price difference to a great extent reflects higher construction labor and material costs.</p> <p>Inflation as affected property values in terms of rent. Irving Fisher (1998), a noted American economist, put forth a theory about the relationship between interest rates and inflation rates that can be applied to housing market rents.</p> <p>According to Fisher, when lenders loan money, they consider the expected inflation over the term of the loan and add that expected inflation rate to the interest rate they charge. If lenders want to charge 2 percent interest and expect a 3 percent rate of inflation, they charge 5 percent interest on the loan.</p> <p>A similar process takes place in housing markets. When landlords rent housing units, they consider recent inflation rates as well as expected inflation rates over the terms of rental contracts. They increase rents to meet their inflation expectations. Higher rents translate into higher home prices because the price of a home is equal to the present value of future streams of actual or imputed rents (gross rentsminus maintenance costs, taxes, depreciation and so forth). Thus, inflation impacts house prices through increased rents.</p> <p>1.2 RESEARCH QUESTION</p> <p>In other to have a deep insight about the impact of inflation on the property values in the study area. The following issues must be properly addressed;</p> <p>1.What type of properties are in the study area?</p> <p>2.What are the types and causes of inflation?</p> <p>2. How does inflation affect property values?</p> <p>1.3 AIM AND OBJECTIVES</p> <p>The aim of this study is to examine the impact of inflation on property values in Ilorin, Kwara State. To this end, the study shall focus on the following specific objectives;</p> <p>1. To identify the different types of properties in the study area</p> <p>2.To identify the types and causes of inflation</p> <p>3. To examine the effects of the inflation on property values.</p> <p>4. To recommend probable solutions to the problem.</p> <p>1.4 JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Glenn R. Mueller (1993) examines real estate performance during and low inflation periods in U.S. The results show that real estate does provide an inflationhedge. Second, real estate returns are broken down by major property type categories (office and industrial) to determine if any property type differences exist. A major difference is found between the inflation hedging</p> <p>effectiveness of office and industrial properties. Third, the industrial are further analyzed in relation to vacancy rates in the two property types. A structural imbalance in the office market is evidenced by high vacancy rates. Therefore, the relative impact of vacancy rates upon office and industrial property performance is examined and found to be a significant factor in explaining</p> <p>returns, thus affecting inflation hedging characteristics.</p> <p>Anari and Kolari (2002), they examined the long-run impact of inflation on homeowner equity in South Africa by analyzing the relationship between house prices and the prices of non-housing goods and services. There are two reasons for this methodological departure:</p> <p>(i) The total return on housing is fully reflected in house prices even when it</p> <p>cannot be measured accurately, and (ii) Valuable long-run information can be captured by using prices rather than using returns, since differencing house prices and non-housing CPI lead to a loss of long-run information contained in the series, Moreover, unlike previous studies, to avoid potential bias in estimating how inflation affects housing prices, we exclude housing costs from our measure of the consumer price index of goods and services.</p> <p>Irving Fisher (1998), a noted American economist, put forth a theory about the relationship between interest rates and inflation rates that can be applied to housing market rents. The inflation hedging characteristics of property prices have been examined in both developed and developing countries: Australia (Brown, 1990), Canada (Newell, 1995), New Zealand</p> <p>(Newell&amp; Boyd, 1995) and Switzerland (Hoesli, 1994). The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of inflation on property values. Unlike previous studies, such an analysis has never been attempted in Kwara State and this is where the uniqueness of this study lies.</p> <p>1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>A study of an impact of inflation on rental values which will covers all issues relating to the effect, solution and methods adopted in reducing it impact on the populace in the study area.

Construction projects in the Gaza Strip suffer from many problems and complex issues in performance, such as cost, time and safety (Shaban, 2008). Client satisfaction is therefore a fundamental issue for construction participants who must constantly seek to improve their performance if they are to survive in the global marketplace. However, client satisfaction has remained an elusive issue for a majority of construction professionals (Cheng, Fleming, Proverbs&amp;Oduoza, 2005).</p> <p>Due to the demand for built products from foreign investors and the growing economy, Vietnam’s construction industry, experience strong growth. While some of the construction projects are successfully executed, others faced difficulties (Bui &amp;Ling, 2010). Despite the availability of various control techniques and project control software many construction projects still do not achieve their cost and time objectives (Oluwale&amp; Sun, 2010).</p> <p>Most third world countries face acute endemic housing problem that over the years has raised both national and international concerns. Habitat and World Bank, for example, fund many housing schemes worldwide in addressing the housing issue. Likewise, governmental and non-governmental institutions foster and orchestrateself-help campaigns directed at reducing inherent housing deficiency in these poor nations. However, a growing number of unfinished buildings in such countries seem to overshadow the efforts and thus pose many questions as to what is behind the failure in providing such a highly needed commodity. One may wonder whether such a failure has anything to do with architecture, attitudes and practices of the people or is it just a thing to be pegged on socio-economic platform of the society (Mirema &amp; Mhando, 2005). Construction cost is one of the most important criteria of success of projects throughout the lifecycle of the project and is of high concern to those who are involved in the construction industry. In order to manage construction project successfully various procurement strategies have been introduced. In spite very rarely projects are completed within estimated budget (Abdullah, Aftab,Azis&amp;Rahman, 2010). Maintaining steady cost projection on construction projects had been until recently an issue of serious concern, both to the client and project contractors. Cost deviation from initial cost plan, had been prevalent on construction sites (Amusan,n.d). Every year, large companies spend large sums on the research and development about the most optimum combination of production or the most optimum function and feature of their products and services. The impact of poor quality on the price of products and organization earnings and the amount of cost should be paid for high quality has raised many important issues affecting cost accounting, quality control, repairs and maintenance, supply chain, production management, stores, safety and health, education and improvement and so forth (Amin, 2011).</p> <p>One of the most important facets of managing a construction company is leadership. Although the issue of leadership has been widely covered in management or business school, little attention has been given to the study of managerial behavior or style of the leaders in construction projects (Bresnen et al., 1986). Learning from high performance projects is crucial for construction improvement. Therefore, we need to identify outstanding projects or role models.</p> <p>A minimum prerequisite for identifying such projects is the ability to measure the performance. Unfortunately, two issues complicate the measuring task: i) diseconomies or economies of scale and ii) multidimensional inputs and outputs (Myrtveit&amp;Stensrud, 2005).</p> <p>In view of key performance indicators, the construction industry is generally considered to have underperformed compared to other industries. Not only that, the UK construction industry has been criticized for not performing at the same level as that of other developed countries. In relation to this, the UK working groups on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have identified ten parameters for benchmarking projects, in order to achieve a good performance, in response to Egan’s report. These consist of seven project performance indicators, namely: construction cost, construction time, cost predictability, time predictability, defects, client satisfaction with the product and client satisfaction with the service; and three company performance indicators, namely: safety, profitability and productivity (Akintoye&amp;Takim, 2002).</p> <p>Ankrah and Proverbs (2005) showed that despite the inherent benefits of performance measurement in helping identify unnecessary causes of waste so that remedial actions can be taken, performance measurement is not extensively implemented because of the inadequacy of measures, complexity of measurement, time consuming and costly nature of performance measurement, and project-oriented nature of the industry. Where performance measurement is implemented, various frameworks are available, some targeting project performance whilst others focus on overall business performance.</p> <p>Construction has emerged among the top performing sectors in the period alongside financial services and transport and communication. The sector contributed Sh12.6 billion to the GDP in the period supported by the massive road infrastructure projects currently in progress across the country (Waithaka,2011). Public entities, private firms and individuals continuously engage in acquiring physical assets in different forms such as commercial buildings, residential buildings, schools, hospitals, development infrastructure like roads, water dams, telecommunication and electricity. These projects involve major capital investments driven by market demand or perceived needs. To remain competitive in either profit or non-profit engagements, you need to focus on procedures that offer competitive advantage and value. You need to understand the needs of the customer and correctly deploy the available resources in meetings the expectations of the client by maintaining a competitive edge over your competitors. For residential houses, a Nigerian family will value the luxury of privacy and safety. Time and cost overruns on infrastructure development projects during implementation continue to pose great challenges to developing countries (Kigari &amp; wainaina, n.d).</p> <p>Ideally, projects designed and managed by highly trained construction professionals and executed by qualified contractors selected on the basis of their capability should meet the project performance goals. These goals are in terms of the contract period, budget, quality, environmental sustainability and client satisfaction. However, there is evidence that despite the high quality of training of consultants in the building industry in Nigeria and regulation of the industry in major urban areas, construction projects do not always meet their goals. This is manifested by myriad projects that have cost overrun, delayed completion period and poor quality resulting to collapsed buildings in various parts of the country, high maintenance costs, dissatisfied clients and even buildings which are not functional (Kibuchi &amp; Muchungu, 2012).</p> <p>1.2. Statement of the Problem</p> <p>Nigeria as a country has witnessed a substantial increase in the number of stalled projects due to inappropriate project organization structures and ineffective leadership. There is evidence that the performance of the construction in Nigeria is poor as time and cost performance of projects are to the extent that over 70% of the projects initiated are likely to escalate with time with a magnitude of over 50% and over 50% of the projects likely to escalate in cost with a magnitude of over 20% (Nyangilo, 2012).</p> <p>Kibuchi and Muchungu (2012) discovered that despite the high quality of training of consultants in the building industry in Nigeria and regulation of the industry in major urban areas, construction projects do not always meet their goals. This is manifested by myriad projects that have cost overrun, delayed completion period and poor quality resulting to collapsed buildings in various parts of the country, high maintenance costs, dissatisfied clients and even buildings which are not functional.</p> <p>Previous studies: Nyangilo, 2012; Lepartobiko, 2012; Kibuchi&amp;Muchungu, 2012; Takim&amp;Akintoye, 2002; Mhando &amp; Mrema, 2005, indicate that the failure of any project is mainly related to the problems and failure in performance. Generally, past industry experiences show that, medium to large size projects have high failure rate. The consequences can be costly and lengthy, with the worst outcomes often leading to undesirable litigation engagements. Developing Countries have higher rate of low project performance than developed countries (Lepartobiko, 2012).</p> <p>This research therefore, investigated the factors affecting the performance of construction projects in Nigeria in order to assist owners, consultants and contractors to overcome performance problem and to improve performance of their construction projects. Hence, performance of any construction projects can be evaluated according to key performance indicators.</p> <p>Objective of the study</p> <p>The objective of this research was to investigate the factors affecting the performance of construction projects in Nigeria, a survey of low-rise buildings in Nairobi Central Business District.</p> <p>To determine the influence of cost of materials on the performance of construction projects in Nigeria.</p> <p>To establish the influence of quality management on the performance of construction projects in Nigeria.</p> <p>To examine the influence of time management on performance of construction projects in Nigeria.</p> <p>To establish the influence of leadership style on performance of construction projects in Nigeria.</p> <p>1.4. Research Questions</p> <p>Does cost of material influence the performance of construction projects in Nigeria?</p> <p>To what extent does quality management influence the performance of construction projects in Nigeria?</p> <p>How does time management influence the performance of construction projects in Nigeria?</p> <p>What effect does the leadership style have on the performance of construction projects in Nigeria?</p> <p>1.5. Significant of the Study</p> <p>Construction industry contains large number of parties as clients, contractors, consultants, stakeholders, shareholders, regulators and others. Construction projects in Nigeria suffer from many problems and complex issues in performance because of many reasons and factors. This research was very important to investigate the main factors affecting the performance of construction projects. The practices concerned with the KPIs such as time, cost, quality and leadership styles was analyzed in order to know the main practical problems of project performance in Nigeria and then formulated recommendations to improve performance of construction projects in Nigeria.</p> <p>Because of performance problem in Nigeria as shown previously and because previous studies in Nairobi CBD about this topic do not deal with all aspects of construction project performance; this study was required and very important to be considered. In this study, it was studied the factors affecting the performance of construction projects in Nigeria. These factors can be said as key performance indicators (KPIs). These KPIs can be used to measure performance in construction projects and can then be used for benchmarking purposes. This will be a key component of any organization move towards achieving best practice in order to overcome performance problem in Nairobi CBD.</p> <p>1.6. Scope of the study</p> <p>The study focused on selected low-rise building construction projects situated in Uyo local government. Other buildings were left out because it could have been uneconomical to study all buildings locate in Uyo. Uyo was selected because of proximity to the researcher. The study examined the cost of materials, quality management, time management and leadership style as the independent variable and performance of a construction project as the dependent variable.</p> <p>1.7. Limitations of the Study</p> <p>Inadequate previous information on the factors affecting the performance of construction projects for comparison purposes as well as the twenty two building sample size may not be a good ground for extrapolation or generalization of a study finding.</p>                                                          \n\nASSESSMENT OF FACTORS AFFECTING COST PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF FACTORS AFFECTING COST PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IN NIGERIA", "id": 112}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>This dissertation is model that examine residential property investment in Osun State and its associated problems. The main objective of the dissertation is to examine the means of satisfying additional housing unit requirement in Osun State, particularly Osogbo. The methodology that was adopted or employed in gathering information was the questionnaire method, through which necessary information were collected. This project work was based on the residential property investment in Osun Sate which various literature were reviewed, new ideas and findings. Pertaining to study topic was added to the existing body of knowledge. The study topic of this research work was ease and carried out with the help of aments housing estate Osogbo. The information which was collected was also presented in bar chart after the analysis of the data. The findings of the dissertation was also stated in cleaned terms so as to avoid any doubtful, also useful recommendations were made for the government, the private developers (both individuals and corporate bodies). Advice was also given to the financial institution on how they could possibly come into help in the provision of housing units.</em></p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0       BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY </p> <p>            The benefit derived in the residential property investment can not be over emphasized likewise the problem encounter in the management of such investment.</p> <p>Thus residential property investment involves making a current commitment of fund in order to obtain an uncertain future returns, the study will examines various investment in the property with emphasis on the residential property investment.</p> <p>However, the appreciation in property value depends upon the location of the property, its demands and supply, the uses to which it can be put in the local market place, because of its appreciation potential, real estate is viewed as a good hedge against inflation. The tendency of construction cost makes it escalate faster than general inflation.</p> <p>The problem of the residential property investment in Osun State (a case study of Amorite Estate Osogbo) is particularly dealt with and the solution will be preferred for all the problems identified in this study.</p> <p>This study shall also deal with the other types of investment that are available in the in the property market, like industrial, commercial and Agricultural property investment and also in stock market,</p> <p>The various ways of financing such project shall also be considered.</p> <p>Amorit Housing Estate which is also refers as “living spring homes” is one of the housing Estates that provide adequate accommodation in Osogbo Osun State. The Estate is situated along Ede road Abere, opposite state Secretariat Osogbo, Osun State which had a total land area of 7.9 hectares with a good land leveled surface. The Estate is sharing boundary with an uncompleted housing Estate on the ring side (west ward), a large expanse of land on the left side (East ward) and delineated in the North by an express road.</p> <p>Amorit housing Estate started construction in the early 2007 in Osogbo with the aim of providing about 100 housing units consisting of two (2) and three (3)</p> <p>bedrooms respectively for convenience and full accommodation to reduce housing problem in Osun State. The construction of the Estate is divided in to two phase’s i.e phase one and two. The phase one consist of two (2) and three (3) bedroom bungalow of over forty – five (45) housing unit which was the first part to be completed, the buildings were all suited with adequate space for relaxation. Amorit Housing Estate was officially commissioned on the 24th of April, 2009 by Amorit International Limited in partnership with the Federal Ministry of works, housing and urban development and was occasioned by the then Honorable Minister of State for Work, Housing and urban development Chief (Mrs) Grace Ekpewhre (jp) with royal father HRM Oba Munirudeen Adesola Lawal (Laminisa) Timi of Ede Land.</p> <p>However, the Estate Started the construction of the second phase immediately after the completion of the first phase, the second of three (3) bedroom bungalow with duplex on request all ensuit with adequate space. The housing Estate has a conducive environment with aesthetic view with different flower and trees for beautification of the Housing Estate. The Estate has varies facilities to improve standard of living of the residents which includes laws tennis court, shopping mall, swimming pool for relaxation of the residents and constant supply of water and electricity supply and adequate security for the Estate.</p> <p>Further more, the administration work is headed by the director in person of Mr. Kayode Oyewole, assistant of the housing Estate. There are various departments that contribute to the administrative work of the estate which includes:</p> <p>Marketing department</p> <p>Accounting department</p> <p>Maintenance department and</p> <p>Engineering department</p> <p>For proper administration of the housing estate.</p> <p>Finally, the process for holding a unit in the estate can be gained by purchasing of the application for form #5,000 fees non-refundable and one can be issued with the application form which must be completed by the applicants and must be submitted with the applicant passport.</p> <p>The mode of payment for the allocation of the housing unit includes the following:</p> <p>outright payment</p> <p>Installmental payment</p> <p>However, Amorite Housing Estate has really established a home for people of Osun state that is measurably the best.</p> <p>AIMS AND OBJECTIVE</p> <p>This study aim at analyzing and examining the residential property investment in Osun state and its associated problems using Amorite Estate Osogbo as a case study.</p> <p>In order to achieve the aim, the following objectives shall be adopted.</p> <p>To examine various means of satisfying additional housing investment in the state.</p> <p>To determine the viability of residential property investment and realization of the target income.</p> <p>To identify those risks (problems) involves in residential property investment as well as proffering solution and recommendation to the problems identified.</p> <p>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>It has been observed that the available residential accommodation in the state is grossly inadequate to cater for the population of over 3.2 million in the state. This warrant the need for public private partnership in the provision of residential housing accommodation for people.</p> <p>Closely associated with the housing provision as an investment are the income and the risk attached to it.

These projects range from the Liberty Stadium, Ibadan (now called the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium) to the National Stadium Lagos, Universities, hospitals, schools and the refineries which got oil displacing agriculture as the mainstay of the economy to mention a few.</p> <p>But having been built and made to serve the immediate purpose they were meant to serve, they ended up in most cases forgotten, abandoned and at its best given very little attention, leading to its poor maintenance and management. The million dollar question to draw from the aforesaid is if these projects were actually made available in the short term or long term. It is expected that the latter would be the answer. Nevertheless over the years, most laudable projects in Nigeria fault this notion.</p> <p>Nigeria is not meant to be where she currently is for she is a blessed nation, one that is palpably so richly endowed with the best of resources; “human and material” to spur her towards having the best facilities when she deems it necessary and most appropriate. Nigeria as against the so called world economies, developed nations, world powers or whatever phrase used to describe the most powerful States of the world is immensely blessed with natural resources as earlier mentioned, that only if Nigeria was properly managed by the best hands in leadership, she would have easily stimulated herself towards being not just a real giant of Africa (as against what is perceive to be the current self acclaimed status) but among the world powers in all ramifications most importantly, socioeconomically.</p> <p>Nigeria has had over the years on its once upon a time very laudable projects that are right now in the most deplorable state ever imagined which are definitely threats to the social economic and infrastructural advancement of Nigeria. This is with respect to the issue of maintenance of public facilities and capital projects that are worthy of proudly making one a Nigerian, though for a short while, no thanks to the “extinction” of the beauty that once upon a time greeted such projects.</p> <p>In line with the national development goals for improving the quality of services in the public sectors to become “The Developed Countries by the year 2020” have a first class infrastructures on the agenda for Nigeria. Apart from this, many facilities such as buildings and public infrastructures are built to fulfill administrative and social needs as well as economic responsibilities to the general public. The government assets and facilities should be managed properly with maintenance work to ensure the functioning assets, minimum cost of repairing and providing a safe environment for the user. Maintenance culture is defined the combination of technical and administrative actions to be taken to preserve or protect a structure, system or equipment to function properly (British Standards Institute, 1974). It as a work process or work activity programmed by an individual or group to be undertaken to protect, preserve and maintain the function of a facility</p> <p>Maintenance culture defines the values, way of thinking, behaviour, perception, and the underlying assumptions of any person or group or society that considers maintenance as a matter that is important (priority) and practices it in their life. When a person or group has maintenance culture, they would have the attitude to maintain, preserve and protect the public facilities. The attitude in question is towards the maintenance work, which is embedded in each individual or group, although in practice, the maintenance tasks have been programmed, planned and scheduled, it is only when one understands the responsibility entrusted to implement it that creates a proper awareness of maintenance work and whereby it is done automatically, spontaneously without any direction and thought (Suwaibatul et. al, 2012). Maintenance culture is not universal in nature, it is usually derived or learned through a person making maintenance a natural daily practice that can be followed and emulated by others (Florence, 2011). These cultures are not easy to develop. It takes time and occurs in response to changes to the individual himself/herself. Thus, it is not something that is impossible to implement if the method made the maintenance culture is known to be performed. When the determinant factors of maintenance of development are identified, the maintenance will be a daily practice that is understood by each individual about what their duties are.</p> <p>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>Maintenance culture development in Nigeria can be achieved through the implementation of the leadership factors that should be done by someone who was called leaders toward culture maintenance practices among all his followers. Maintenance tasks will not be regarded as a burden, but as a good practice that should be implemented for the next stake. This is where the need of the leadership qualities in a leader by showing a serious commitment to the work done by providing a work plan that can be easily understood and followed by everyone. However, this study analyses the maintenance culture employed in public infrastructure in Nigeria.</p> <p>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <p>To examine the level of maintenance culture employed in public infrastructure in Nigeria.</p> <p>To identify the determinants of maintenance culture of public infrastructure in Nigeria.</p> <p>To determine the attitude of Nigerians to maintenance culture.</p> <p>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>What is the level of maintenance culture employed in public infrastructure in Nigeria?</p> <p>What are the determinants of maintenance culture of public infrastructure in Nigeria?</p> <p>What is the attitude of Nigerians to maintenance culture?</p> <p>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The following are the significance of this study:</p> <p>The results from this study will educate the Nigerian general populace on the need for the adequate maintenance of public infrastructure.</p> <p>This research will be a contribution to the body of literature in the area of the effect of personality trait on student’s academic performance, thereby constituting the empirical literature for future research in the subject area.</p> <p>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This study will cover the maintenance culture employed in public infrastructure in Nigeria and the determinants of maintenance culture in Nigeria.</p> <p>LIMITATION OF STUDY</p> <p>Financial constraint– Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).</p> <p>Time constraint– The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work. This consequently will cut down on the time devoted for the research work.</p> <p>REFERENCES</p> <p>Suwaibatul Islamiah A.S., Abdul Hakim M., Syazwina F.A.S., Eizzatul A.S. (2012).

The major brokerage houses have branches in most communities.<br/> Furthermore there are usually commercial banks and savings institutions as well as microfinance banks and many communities, regardless of their various sizes. Infact, financial transaction can take place almost anywhere there is no need to go to a commercial bank. All you need is two or more populace.<br/><strong>Chika E Udechwuku</strong> (2008) says real estate financing is the process of acquiring funds or capital generally for the purpose of development in order to gain control over the property or assets there are two ways of classifying estate finance which tend to overlap themselves<br/> 1.         Whether the financing is internal or external to the real estate owners or developer.<br/> 2.         The above two depend on the third which is the duration of estate in question.<br/><strong>Sherman J. Maise</strong> (1987) also says real estate finance is concerned mainly with the decisions by which many resources are raised for the purpose of owing or developing real estate. Although all decision could be sometimes are made by a single person two or three separate are usually active in a financing transaction.<br/> In addition most of the cash is borrowed from financial institution such as Mortgage Banks. Moreover financing of real estate or real estate finance involves evaluating the situation adjourning the transaction and deeding the best method of financing of real estate given the risk and certainty of situation. Given many ways in which financing can be structured professionals must understand how the alternative differ in their ability to increase potential gains and raise or lower the risk of failure.<br/> New pressures have altered traditional mortgage lending in years back, most mortgage money came from local lenders. Every loan was treated differently, and once made loans were held until the debt was paid off. Today mortgage are traded in national market. In 1987 <strong>Sherman J. Maise</strong>also stated that:<br/> 1.         A users of capital developers and owners of real Estate must obtain financings in order to build own operate properties. Very different  financial analysis i.e. behind decisions made by the largest group of users, those who wish to own home compare top the decisions made in buying income properties or land.<br/> 2.         Funds are supplied by a variety of individuals. Firms institutions and government. Some of these institutions will be discussed. Government and their agencies have become increasingly important sources of funds as have foreign investors. However the importance of serious groups has been growing mortgage and real estate brokers helps to locate funds and advice users about the best sources of funds.</p> <p><strong>1.2       AIM</strong><br/> The main aim is to carry out the study on the impact of depressed economy on real estate financing</p> <p><strong>1.3       OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>1.    To examine the impact of depressed economy on real estate financing.</p> <p>2.    To observe how finance can be acquired and the variety of financing that is appropriate to real estate development.</p> <p>3.    To examine the tool used in financing of real estate and steps to take to sourcing for real estate finance.</p> <p>1.    <strong>      STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Financing of real estate has a lot challenges faced by particular investors in Real Estate finance whether it is a home owner seeking a loan, someone planning to sell or invest in real property an employee of a financial institution active in lending and building a mortgage portfolio, or a mortgage or investment banker developing new ways to raise money on securities require certain basic knowledge to function well.<br/> In line with this, this project will see to what determine interest rate level, who lends on mortgage and how can home buyers obtain affordable financing even when the economy is depressed.</p> <p><strong>1.5       RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong><br/>The procedure followed in the selection of information and data for the work include both primary and secondary sources of information.<br/> Primary source include the procurement of some vital information interview, personal observation and the use of questionnaire.<br/> Secondary source of information were through the use of textbooks relating to real estate finance in Nigeria.

In carrying out this study there is need to investigate some various theories of financing and how these have an effect on the efficiency of real estate.<br/> This study also covers the activities of government on housing finance. This dissertation limited itself to those what being found in Osogbo.</p> <p><strong>1.7       JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong><br/> Financing real estate especially in a depressed economy is a big task to individual investor, government and cooperate bodies. It is however important to carryout a study on this topic in order to ameliorate the fear being exercised by real estate investors during the period when economy is depressed. The study will equally bring out various issues and problems that may be encountered in financing real estate in a depressed economy hence one may need to prepare and take precautions for such entilalitie. In addition various sources of financing real estate shall be made known to people in the course of the study.</p> <p><strong>1.8       LIMITATION OF THE STUDY </strong><br/> During the course of the study some problem were encountered, which however gave limitation to the study such problem are as follows financial constrains and time factors.</p>                                                           \n\nTHE IMPACT OF DEPRESSED ECONOMY ON REAL ESTATE FINANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF DEPRESSED ECONOMY ON REAL ESTATE FINANCE", "id": 115}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE<br/> INTRODUCTION<br/> 1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The term real estate is commonly used interchangeably with real property to refer to land and all things permanently attached to it. Property in itself consists of valuable rights held to the exclusion of others (Betty and Ely,2008). The definition of real estate typically includes land, fixtures (attachment) to land, anything incidental or appurtenant to land that benefits the land owner and anything which is immovable by law. Real estate is a readable commodity with a specialized market due to its unique characteristics of geographical immobility, heterogeneity, fixity, indivisibility and indestructibility. In addition, investment in real estate requires a large capital outlay and is surrounded both by many legal factors and government regulations (Ventollo and Martha, 2001).</p> <p>The decision to invest in real estate is fast becoming the preferred choice for most Nigerian investors who consider it one of the most stable forms of investment. In addition, the rapid increase in the price of Nigerian real estate has made many investors venture into real estate as a source of income. In recent years, the Nigeria real real estate market has seen a new breed of investors who are targeting capital growth/ appreciation as the most important source of return for real estate investment through their sale.</p> <p>Nigeria in recent years has been flooded with developers bringing property into market for sale, rather than for the purpose of obtaining a stream of income in the form of rent. Ventollo (2001) simply defines a market as a place where buying and selling takes place. Due to the unique characteristics of related estate, the market for real estate all over the world does not conform to the definition of an efficient market. An efficient goods market is one where the products have close substitutes, many buyers and sellers who have perfect knowledge of prices and goods exist there is little government interference and the product is easily transferable. Real estate requires professionals who possess an understanding of the processes to mediate between the concerned parties who include but are not limited to financiers, developers, sellers and purchasers. The rapid increase in the prices of rel estate has made many investors and unregistered agents ve tire into real estate as a source of income.</p> <p>1.2  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>The practice of estate agency is not a new concept in Nigeria. However, it has for a long time been associated purely with the commercial transaction of letting properties for landlords, buying and selling land, factories, houses, commercial premises, businesses as going concerns hotels and the ownership rights associated with them. The agents acts on behalf of the seller or on behalf of the buyer for a commission. In this regard, in addition to the firms registered to carry out this practice, there have also been a large number of estate agents practicing without any background knowledge and/or understanding of real property as a commodity and the real estate market as a special one. Hence there is need to assess the proliferation of unregistered estate agent in real estate market.</p> <p>1.3  OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p> The major objective of the study is proliferation of unregistered agents in real estate market.</p> <p>1.4  RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>(1) what is real estate?</p> <p>(2) what is real estate market?</p> <p>(3) who are real estate agent?</p> <p>(4) what is the rate of proliferation of unregistered agents estate market?</p> <p>1.5  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The study gives a clear insight into the proliferation of unregistered agents in real estate market. The need for this study arise because estate agency as a profession in this country has seen an influx of numerous unqualified persons because there exists a conflict between professionalism and commercialism in the practice. These people come in to provide agency services in the real estate market yet they have no knowledge of either real estate or the market within which it is traded. As a result, the real estate market, is plaques by inefficiency and lack of transparency due to unregistered agents. The study also emphasizes on the need. to enforce a law that will govern the real estate agent.</p> <p>1.6  SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The research focuses on the proliferation of unregistered agents in real estate market.</p> <p>REFERENCES</p> <p>Betty and Ely (2008) Basic Real Estate Appraisal: Principles and Procedures, (7th end) Thomson South Western, U.S.A.</p> <p>Ventollo, L. and Martha, R.(2001) Fundamentals of Real Estate Appraisal, Dearborn Real Estate Educator, Chicago.</p>\n\nPROLIFERATION OF UNREGISTERED ESTATE AGENT IN REAL ESTATE MARKET<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROLIFERATION OF UNREGISTERED ESTATE AGENT IN REAL ESTATE MARKET", "id": 116}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE<br/> INTRODUCTION<br/> 1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The construction industry in Nigeria is upcoming industry; the sector is regarded as a catalyst for growth while its performance serves as an indicator of the nations economy (Akanni et al.,2014). It us supported by the association of construction players, which encompasses developers, contractors, building material and equipment suppliers, manufacturers, financiers, regulators and others in the value chain.</p> <p>Building material have been playing an important role in the construction industry. They are those materials put together in erecting or constructing structures, no field of engineering is conceivable without their use (Akanni, 2006; Udisen and Akanni, 2010). Building materials contribute immensely to the quality and cost of housing, from what is used in the foundation to the materials for roofing and finishes, while the building material industry us an important contributor to the national economy of any nation as its output governs both the rate and the quality of construction work.</p> <p>The cost of building materials poses a significant threat to both the construction industry and people aspiring to own houses (Anosike, 2009; Mekson, 2008; Mohammed, 2008; Njoku, 2007). For example a bag of cement is valued at N1350 in 2006 goes as high as N1850 in 2009 (Anosike,2009) depicting about 37% increment; the bag goes as high as N2000 in 2012 during peak season (Field survey 2012). Supporting this view, Jagboro and Owoeye (2004) earlier established that increase in prices of building materials has multiplier effects on the industry while Idoro and Jolaiya (2010) affirmed that many projects were not completed on time due to the cost of materials, which have been on the increase. Besides timely completion, high prices of building materials form a crucial constraint to improving housing conditions in the low income earning countries, Nigeria inclusive (United Nations Center for Human Settlement (UNCHS),1993).</p> <p>1.2  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>Inspire of the past studies on the cost of building materials in Nigerua , little us publicized about the effects of the rise in cost on property development; most literature (Jagboro and Owoeye,2004; Meckson,2008; Njoku,2007; Oladipo and Oni,2012) has concentrated on identifying the causes with little emphasis on the implications, hence, the research seeks to provide information on effects of the rising cost of building material by examining its influence on property development.</p> <p>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The major objective of the study is the effects of rising cost of building materials on property development.</p> <p>1.4  RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>(1) What are Building Material?</p> <p>(2) what is property development?</p> <p>(3) what are the factors that can increase cost of building materials?</p> <p>1.5  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE QUESTIONS</p> <p>This study gives a clear insight into the effects of rising cost of building materials on property development.

There is a direct relationship between projects, projects portfolio, programs and the organizational strategy. Projects, as the main way of creating and dealing with change (Cleland, Gareis, 2006), are used to implement strategies. Meskendahl (2010) refers to projects as the central building block used in implementing strategies, therefore business success is determined by the success of the projects. A project is an individual or collaborative enterprise, possibly involving research or design that is carefully planned, usually by a project team, to achieve a particular aim New York Time (2009). A project is also temporary because it has a defined beginning, end time, and defined scope and resources (Cathy, 2009). A project is unique because it is not a routine operation, but a specific set of operations designed to accomplish a singular goal. Based on these characteristics, carefully it is imperative to plan to achieve targeted outcome. Thus; Project planning can be defined as a part or branch of project management, which relates to the use of schedules to plan and subsequently report progress within the project environment.</p> <p>Dubois and Gadde (2002) described the construction industry as decoupled and McKinsey (2017) confirmed that it is still true. The lack of coupling is present both between the construction project and its subcontractors as well as between the project and the parent company and other projects. This hampers the possibility to have a successful coordination of resources on a portfolio level within the contractor, as resources are in many cases utilised from a common resource pool (Engwall and Jerbrant 2003).The construction industry therefore embraces a wide range of loosely integrated organizations that collectively construct, alter and repair a wide range of different building and civil engineering projects. Individuals, organizations and government need to carry out some form of project planning for building and civil engineering project before embarking on whatever activity they are engaged to do. According to Lock (2002), the principal identifying characteristics of a project is its novelty, it’s a step unknown fraught with risk and uncertainty. No two projects are ever exactly alike and even a repeated project will differ from its predecessor in one or more commercial, administrative and physical aspect.</p> <p>Construction is also characterized by time and cost intensive production processes which make it prone to project risks and failure, mainly in terms of time and cost. In practice, this means, that the performance of construction projects is usually low. In particular, construction projects are very often delayed and over budget. This is not just due to problems faced during project scheduling, but also during related processes.</p> <p>Laryea and Hughes (2009) attempted to find how contractors’ in Ghana include financial risk in their bid prices. The research showed that besides having risk allowances as lump sums or percentage allowances, the method used is neither scientific nor informed by any empirical evidence. Ojo (2010) found that design changes, financial losses and inadequate specifications were the risk factors with most impacts on construction sites but the study did not highlight any Project project planning (PRM) technique used by Contractors to respond to such risks.</p> <p>Another research carried out in Nigeria on this subject was on the evaluation of key risk factors and the measures to mitigate their effects on construction projects (Dada, 2010). Though the research found financial, political and physical risks as the most significant, the use of contingency sum and insurance cover were adjudged to be the most effective means of mitigating risk.</p> <p>However, no study has reported on the PRM practices used by Nigerian Contractors in redevelopments projects, with their attendant problems and challenges in terms of scoping.</p> <p> <strong>1.1.2 ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE</strong> </p> <p>Julius Berger Nigeria Plc is a Nigerian construction company, headquartered in Abuja FCT, located at 10 Shettima A.

They use either no water or one to three liters per flush with pour-flush pit latrines. When properly built and maintained they can decrease the spread of disease by reducing the amount of human feces in the environment from open defecation. This decreases the transfer of pathogens between feces and food by flies. These pathogens are major causes of infectious diarrhea and intestinal worm infections. Infectious diarrhea resulted in about 0.7 million deaths in children under five years old in 2011 and 250 million lost school days. Pit toilets are the lowest cost method of separating feces from people. <br/>A pit toilet generally consists of three major parts: a hole in the ground, a slab or floor with a small hole, and a shelter. The shelter is often known as an outhouse. The pit is typically at least 3 meters (10 feet) deep and 1 m (3.2 feet) across. The World Health Organization recommends they be built a reasonable distance from the house balancing issues of easy access versus that of smell. The distance from groundwater and surface water should be as large as possible to decrease the risk of groundwater pollution. The hole in the slab should not be larger than 25 centimeters (9.8 inches) to prevent children falling in. Light should be prevented from entering the pit to reduce access by flies. This may require the use of a lid to cover the hole in the floor when not in use. When the pit fills to within 0.5 meters (1.6 feet) of the top, it should be either emptied or a new pit constructed and the shelter moved or re-built at the new location. The management of the fecal sludge removed from the pit is complicated. There are both environment and health risks if not done properly.<br/>A lot of public toilets poses very serious problem to the people of Udi Local Government Area of Enugu state and also to other places across the country. The problem of open defecation which some people often refer to as going to the bush or bush shitting has persistently been difficult to address in Udi Local Government Area of Enugu state and Nigeria because of the unavailability of good public and home toilets both in the cities and local communities or villages. A lot of people live without proper sanitation in Udi and these people have to decide on daily basis how to organize defecation without feeling ashamed or fear.<br/>Pit latrines may or may not be an enjoyable experience to use. Problems may occur when the pit latrine is shared by too many people, is not cleaned daily and not emptied when the pit is full. In such cases, flies and odour can be a massive nuisance. Also, pit latrines are usually dark places which are difficult to keep clean. Often, hand washing facilities are missing. For these reasons, shared pit latrines can be quite uncomfortable to use in developing countries. Also, there might be cultural preferences for open defecation and these may be difficult to overcome with unattractive toilet designs.<br/>Statement of the problem<br/>Pit toilets are one of the most common human excreta disposal systems in low-income countries and their use is on the rise as countries aim to meet the sanitation-related target of the Millennium Development Goals. There is concern however that the discharges of chemical and microbial contaminant from pit toilets to underground water may negatively affect human health.<br/>1.3   Significance of the study<br/>The study aims to quantify the impact of pit toilet on the residents of Udi Local Government Area of Enugu state, interpret findings, analyze implications, and convey high level results and implications to national decision-makers for sustainable and better environment of Udi residents and other communities where pit toilets trend in Nigeria.<br/>Objectives of the study<br/>The goals of this study are:<br/>To systematically review empirical studies of the impacts of pit toilets on the residents of Udi Local Government Area of Enugu State.<br/>To evaluate public pit toilets siting standard.<br/>To identify knowledge gaps regarding the potential for and the consequences of public pit toilets on citizens of Nigeria.<br/>1.5   Research questions<br/>1.

And it’s also closely tied to geography and mapping system the GIS,<br/>Evaluation is the distinguishing factor for topography maps. In GIS, we use digital elevation model for terrain. Ten out of ten topography maps shows contour lines which are just lines of equal elevation. The narrow definition of topography is specific to the arrangement of land forms. <br/>But in a loader sense, it incorporates natural and artificial features. For example: <br/>Topography maps often tie in administrative boundaries, cities, hydrographic parks, transportation and buildings, contour lines (Iso-lines) connect points of equal elevation by reading contours. We interpret height slope and shape in topography maps.<br/>If contours are close together the slop is steep. But when contours are spread apart the slope is more gradual. We use contours for mountains valleys and bathymetry. For example, Mount Fuji stands at 3,776 meter spacing each contour lines represents equal elevations. Almost at the place of mountain Fuji. It is a 3750 meter contour line. <br/>There is no “World Authority” in topography mapping instead each country set their mapping agency designs their own topography maps with a specific goal in mind. For example constructing a meal high way might drive a topographic ma to feature wood land cover, soil types or rock classification along the route, overtime topographic map series often het periodic updates, but the true is that they can be complex and take years to create. In the United States, the first USGS topographic map was surveyed in 1892. Since then, map revision have continued for over 125+ years. The USGS procedure topo maps at 1:250,000, 1:100,000, 1:63, 360, 000 and 1:24,000. The most common is the 7:5 minute quadrangle series where one inch in the map representing 24,000 inches on the ground.<br/>Another good example of topographic map is the USGS topes fug of time and terrain this colorful map, its overlays topography (hill shade) with understanding rock formations. This helps unravel the geologic history of the continent such as mountain building events. <br/>Topography Application and Uses<br/>Topography maps show how rivers flow, how high mountain rise and how steep valleys descend. They lay out the land such as in these examples.<br/>Engineering use topographic maps to plan a road, construct a called tower or plan a hydro electric dam. <br/>Geologist Use Topography to Understand telboric activity .

But talking about time management or organization problem, instead the vast amount of time some owners hold there properties can precut challenge for the surveyor. In short, a property that has been in a family for generation has undergone change that are not reflected in the original deeds and streams change channels the physical evidence upholding the legal land transcoption has simply vanished into the most of time on top of vanished makers. Accommodation for neighbors and other understandings that were never formally documented can blur the property lines, sometimes catching the current owners ny surprise.

The perfect environment for a survey is really to be found. Land surveyors could wish that all the tics were bare have this ground clear of leaves, with comfortable transperature and the night light you client often have this luxury. Bright sunlight creates deep shadow which masks features. They make surface wet and even when the rain stops water drop from the trees.

Study is significant as it add to the body of literature on the topic under study, to direct the, four research questions and hypothesis were formulated. The research was carried out using a sample of 44 questionnaire were gathered from Idah, Kogi state. The data collected were analyze using simple percentages and correlation analysis which was used to test the hypothesis. From the analysis of the data collected, the following findings were made. That, obsolescence of the staff quarter has no significant effect on the properties within the study area. It is also discovered from the findings that there is no significance influence on the strategies adapted to ameliorating obsolescence in the study area. It is revealed from the study that the current condition of the staff quarter at federal polytechnic Idah needs urgent attention and this can be observed as majority of the respondents strongly that the factors responsible for the staff quarter obsolescence is both human and environmental factors. It was also discovered from the findings that the effect of obsolescence on properties within the study area generates different environmental risk and therefore needs to be fixed or attended to. From the findings the following recommendation were made that the current condition of the staff quarter at Federal Polytechnic Idah should properly looked into and consider a means of ameliorating it . that those factors that lead to the obsolescence of the staff quarter such as human, environmental and other factors should be given more attention to, and in doing this will g a long way in reducing the cost of livelihood in the staff quarter.<br/>\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>\r\nCHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION<br/>\r\n1.1 Background of the study<br/>\r\n2.2 Statement of the problem<br/>\r\n1.3 Aim and objectives<br/>\r\n1.4 Research hypothesis<br/>\r\n1.5 Significance of the study<br/>\r\n1.6 Scope of the study<br/>\r\n1.7 limitation of the study<br/>\r\n1.8 Brief description of the study area<br/>\r\n1.9 Definition of terms and acronyms used in the study<br/>\r\nCHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>\r\n2.1 The concept of housing obsolescence<br/>\r\n2.2 Causes of building obsolescence<br/>\r\n2.3 Forms of housing obsolescence<br/>\r\n2.3.1 Economic obsolescence<br/>\r\n2.3.2 Functional obsolescence<br/>\r\n2.4 Sustainability and obsolescence<br/>\r\n2.4.1 Perceiving Sustainability as new form of obsolescence<br/>\r\n2.5 Strategies of dealing with building obsolescence<br/>\r\n2.6 Maintenance strategy for ameliorating housing obsolescence<br/>\r\nCHAPTER THREE:RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY<br/>\r\n3.1 Source of data<br/>\r\n3.2 Data collection techniques<br/>\r\n3.3 population of the study<br/>\r\n3.4 Sampling size<br/>\r\n3.5 method of data analysis<br/>\r\nCHAPTER FOUR: PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF DATA<br/>\r\n4.1 Data Presentation and analysis<br/>\r\n4.2 Discussion of results<br/>\r\nCHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSION<br/>\r\n5.1 Summary of findings<br/>\r\n5.2 Recommendations<br/>\r\n5.3 Conclusion<br/>\r\nReference<br/>\r\nAppendix<br/>\n</p><p>CHAPTER ONE<br/>\r\nINTRODUCTION<br/>\r\n1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY  <br/>\r\nThe concept of ‘obsolescence’ is an essential consideration during the assessment of value (Reed 2007). Although there has been an increased attention placed on the demand for sustainable buildings such as via the use of rating tools, the future income stream of sustainable properties including capital expenditure may be misunderstood if obsolescence is not adequately recognised and dealt with in property management. Although there are many forms of obsolescence, arguably the physical, functional and economic impairments remain the core types observed in property and result in depreciation, which in turn is a loss in property value. Obsolescence may affect the land and/or building component in varying degrees, as well as commencing at different times and affecting the highest and best use (Lipscomb, 2012). For example obsolescence may commence in the initial design phase and deterioration may start before construction has even started (Bole et al. 2009). Understanding exactly what obsolescence is and how it affects a property asset is critical although arguably not fully understood either inside and/or outside the property field (Laronge, 2011).<br/>\r\n    Obsolescence simply means an old fashioned and no longer useful, it is not necessarily age, however, change that is the chief cause of obsolescence.<br/>\r\n    The oxford Advanced  Learner’s Dictionary(6th edition),  defines the adjective obsolete as no longer used or practiced outmoded or worn away effaced, eroded, worn out, dilapidated, atrophied and the non obsolescence as the process or fact of becoming obsolete or out dated or of falling into disuse or more specific the process whereby or states at which machinery consumer goods become obsolete as a result of technological advances and changes in demand.<br/>\r\n    Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary (7th edition, 2007) adds to the adjective, no longer current old fashioned.<br/>\r\n    Cowan and Bryon (2005) see obsolescence as a significant decline in the competitiveness usefulness or value or value of an article.<br/>\r\n    Obsolesces occurs generally due to change or due to changes in user preference requirements or styles it is distinct from fall in value (depreciate) due to physical deterioration or normal wear and tear.<br/>\r\n    Obsolescence is a major factor in generating risk and may require write off the value of the obsolete. Items against earnings to comply with the accounting principle of showing inventory at lower cost or market value.<br/>\r\n    This article explores the characteristics and causes of obsolescence resulting in a conceptual model of causes of obsolescence and effects; it distinguishes between the hard physical and behavioral factors. It shows the inverse relation between the increase of complexity of types of obsolescence and the decrease of possibilities to manage it. Obsolesces as a process to described as the growing divergence between the declining performance of buildings and the rising expectations of users and properties. Obsolescence is often regarded as the start of the end of life phase of building. However, obsolescence is not an inevitable natural phenomenon, but a function of human action reads decision making, it does not necessarily read demolition as demolition is not always preceded by obsolescence.<br/>\r\n    Obsolescence is a serious threat for built property given it’s immobile, long lasting and capital significance; minimizing obsolescence is important for the presentation of the change of physical, economical and societal investment involved.<br/>\r\n    However, facing the paradigm change from new construction of maintenance and adoption and the resulting huge task to improve the performance of the existing stock. The knowledge about the management of obsolescence is insufficient further research about the cause of obsolescence and about decision making about life cycle extension or demolition is therefore required(Bryon, 2005).</p><p>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>\r\n    The major problem of this study is to access different stages on residential property. The lack of maintenance is one of the major problems of obsolescence; maintenance is required to maintain a building initial performance capacity. Without maintenance, the performance will not meet the demand and eventually drop below the limit of acceptance of users of residents and the expected service life will not be reached resulting in serious loss of efficiency.<br/>\r\n    Ageing is one of the problems of obsolescence which in turn influences the life expectancy of a building.<br/>\r\nThe problem of housing is not only limited to inadequacy in terms of the number provided or available, but also their current or possible future condition with a view to proper habitability and possibility of becoming obsolete. Indeed building houses at an increase rate can never eliminate the problem of obsolescence, although it may satisfy certain portion of the population which can afford to take advantage of such dwellings, it will at the same time undertake the relative deprivation of those who are forced to occupy the older housing which have non of the advantages of the ones constructed recently, (Hendry, 20008).<br/>\r\nLike every other institutions, Federal Polytechnic Idah has many residential buildings, publicly owned staff houses and owner – occupier houses distributed to the polytechnic environ. These houses were constructed years ago, most of which are apparently in deplorable conditions. Due to this, many occupants are currently living under unacceptable standard conditions which eventually lead many to vacate their accommodations. This had and is still exposing many houses to vandalization and dilapidation thereby causing loss of revenue to the institution and negate the aim and objective of such housing scheme. Ironically, similar conditions have befallen many houses which were briefly occupied or not occupied at all after commissioning. These problems among other prompted this research. To achieve the objectives of this work, the researcher is intended to ask this pertinent questions: What is the current condition of the staff quarter at federal polytechnic Idah?</p><p>1.3    AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>\r\n Aim     <br/>\r\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the strategies to be adopted in obsolescence at staff quarters of the Federal Polytechnic Idah.<br/>\r\n Objectives<br/>\r\nThe objectives of this study are as follows;<br/>\r\n1. To evaluate the current condition of the staff quarter at federal polytechnic Idah<br/>\r\n2. To identify factors that leads to the obsolescence of the staff quarter.<br/>\r\n3. To assess the effect of obsolescence on properties within the study area.<br/>\r\n4. To investigate strategies that will aid ameliorating obsolescence in the study area.</p><p> RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS     <br/>\r\nH1:  Obsolescence of the staff quarter has no significant effect on the properties within the study area.<br/>\r\nH2:  There is no significance influence on the strategies adapted to ameliorating obsolescence in the study area.</p><p>1.5  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>\r\n    The study will be significant to students of real estate profession as a reference source to and their academic work.<br/>\r\nIt will also be of immense benefit to real estate practitioners in their practices, most essentially,<br/>\r\nIt will add to exiting literatures on obsolescence and serve as a reference material for researchers in the built environment.</p><p>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>\r\nThis work is strictly restricted to the federal polytechnic Idah staff quarters and strategies to solving the problem of obsolescence.  <br/></p><p>1.7 Limitations of the study<br/>\r\nThis researcher faced some challenges in course of carrying out this study these included:<br/>\r\nDifficulties in obtaining certain documents and as most of the documents are considered to be very important to the organization, thus preventing the researcher from getting them.<br/>\r\nA work of this nature requires much money for financing the materials and sourcing information needed. Also collation prolonged leaving little time for presentation and analysis of data since the researcher was given schedule time of completion.<br/>\r\nAlso the time allocated to this research work was inadequate and insufficient for the researcher to get all the required information for the topic.<br/>\r\nAnother limitation was the non-availability of relevant and vital documents in the school library, which could have be useful in making an extensive research work and the library did not keep any special manuals for the topic which the researcher could make reference to.<br/>\r\nThis research work was undertaken when the writer was fully engaged in the class work. This has greatly constrained the research work because the researcher has to pay attention to normal class activities.</p><p>1.8 Brief Description of the Study Area<br/>\r\nIdah is chosen as a case study for this research work, Idah is a town in Kogi State, Nigeria, on the eastern bank of the Niger River in the middle belt region of Nigeria. It is the headquarter of the Igala Kingdom, and also a smaller Local Government Area with an area of 36 km² around the town, with a population of 79,815 at the 2006 census.</p><p>1.9    DEFINITION OF TERMS AND ACRONYMS USED IN THE STUDY<br/>\r\n    According to Bryon (2005) obsolescence is significant decline in the competitiveness usefulness or value of an article or property.  Deterioration is a downgrading of the effectiveness or physical characteristics (Colour, Consistency e.t.c) of a substance due to faulty packing or abnormal storage conditions. It is also the falling apart, something once in good condition is now weakened, worn out or otherwise in decline.<br/>\r\nDEPRECIATION<br/>\r\nDepreciation is a permanent and containing diminution in the also a less valuable over a period of time (Bryon, 2005).  It is the method of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life.<br/>\r\nRESIDENTIAL PROPERTY<br/>\r\n    This is the type of leased property containing either a single family, a multi family structure that is available for occupation for non business purposes (Bryon, 2005).<br/>\r\nOBSOLETE<br/>\r\n    Obsolete simply means no longer appropriate for the purpose it was obtained due to either the availability of better alternatives in user requirements. It is also said to be something no longer used by anyone.<br/>\r\nACRONYMS  USED IN THE STUDY<br/>\r\nHVAC: Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning<br/>\r\nAPI: Application programming interface<br/>\r\nDCF: Discounted cash flow<br/>\r\n PPM: Planned Preventive Maintenance \r\n </p>\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR AMELIORATING OBSOLENCENCE OF STAFF QUARTER AT FEDERAL POLYTECHNIC IDAH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STRATEGIES FOR AMELIORATING OBSOLENCENCE OF STAFF QUARTER AT FEDERAL POLYTECHNIC IDAH", "id": 121}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p></p><div align=\"center\"><b>THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN THE PROVISION OF HOUSING: A CASE STUDY OF EDO STATE DEVELOPMENT AND PROPERTY AUTHORITY</b><br/></div><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>1.1            BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>Housing provision policies and approaches have long been implemented in many developing nations in a bid to ensure its affordability as an inevitable human need (Teck-Hong, 2012). Thus, public housing was born out of the clamour for improved and decent living conditions dated back to 1929, in the Bubonic Wave of 1928 – 1929 of Nigeria National Housing Planning (NHP) 1991 (Ademiluyi, 2010). Housing was treated as a basic necessity in line with other facilities as; good roads, hospitals, adequate water, electricity, school etc. One of the primary functions of public housing is to be used to redistribute income and correct imperfections of market situation. In order to increase housing stock in Nigeria, the government had used initiatives to create diverse strategies in both state and Federal Housing Corporations which included direct construction, establishment of the National Housing Fund, setting up of mortgage organization to mobilize fund etc. Despite all these efforts, the problems of inadequate funding, quality and acute shortage persisted (Ajakaiye and Fatokun, 2000; Ibem, 2010).<p></p><p>Ibem and Amole (2012) observed that, although housing is an integral part of human settlement that fulfils basic need, and has a profound impact on the quality of life, health, welfare as well as productivity of man; large proportion of urban residents in less developed countries do not have access to decent housing at affordable cost. As a result of this, inadequate housing condition has become an intractable challenge that has continued to receive attention from governments, professionals, developers and individuals in most developing countries. As part of human tradition which seeks to investigate, describe, understand, proffer solutions and take actions to ameliorate defects in living conditions, and enhance individual and collective well-being; both public and private sectors have continued to take actions aimed at addressing social and economic challenges posed by inadequate housing provisions in most countries of the world. These actions are in the form of legislations, policies, strategies and reforms, which most often have culminated in different housing programmes.</p><p>STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM<br/>Nigeria as a developing nation with so much resources at its disposal should place much more emphasis on Housing because there can be no increase in the level of education, health and production when there is no provision of adequate Housing for the people.</p><p>Public housing programmes have been criticized for failing to provide quality, affordable and adequate housing units to target population in most developing countries. Ibem and Amole (2010), indicate that governments in developing countries are not relenting in their efforts at addressing the problem of providing adequate, affordable and sustainable housing. This is probably in recognition of government’s social responsibility in providing housing for its citizens and the fact that adequate housing provision is a key component of sustainable development. However, in more recent time, it is observed that the outcome of government efforts in addressing the housing challenge in many developing countries such as Nigeria is not well understood. According to the 1991 Nigerian National Housing Policy (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1991), lack of adequate monitoring and evaluation of housing policy implementation have contributed to failure of public housing programmes in this country.</p><p>Against this backdrop, the following research questions are raised:<br/>1.   Does adequate housing provision a key component of sustainable development?<br/>2.   Does public housing estates equipped with adequate supply of utilities and social infrastructures?<br/>3.   Does lack of adequate monitoring and evaluation of housing policy implementation contributed to the failure of public housing programmes in Nigeria? </p><p>1.3            OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The broad objective of this study is to examine the role of government in the provision of housing in Nigeria.<br/>The specific objectives are:  <br/>1.   To determine whether adequate housing provision is a key component of sustainable development.<br/>2.                 To examine whether public housing estates equipped with adequate supply of utilities and social infrastructures.<br/>3.                 To verify whether lack of adequate monitoring and evaluation of housing policy implementation contributed to the failure of public housing programmes in Nigeria.</p><p>1.4            RESEARCH HYPOTHESES<br/>The following hypotheses have been formulated to serve as a base for this research.<br/>Hypothesis I<br/>Ho:      Adequate housing provision is not a key component of sustainable development.<br/>H1:      Adequate housing provision is a key component of sustainable development.<br/>Hypothesis II<br/>Ho:      Public housing estates are not equipped with adequate supply of utilities and social infrastructures.<br/>H1:      Public housing estates are equipped with adequate supply of utilities and social infrastructures.<br/>Hypothesis III<br/>Ho:      Lack of adequate monitoring and evaluation of housing policy implementation did not contribute to the failure of public housing programmes in Nigeria.<br/>H1:      Lack of adequate monitoring and evaluation of housing policy implementation contributed to the failure of public housing programmes in Nigeria.</p><p>1.5            SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study is undertaken to examine the role of government in the provision of housing in Nigeria.<br/>The population of the study consists of all the Development and Property Authority in Nigeria, while sample size is restricted to some selected staff of the Edo State Development and Property Authority.<br/>The time frame of this study is six (6) years i.e. (2006 – 2012).</p><p>1.6            SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>It is expected that this study would consolidate existing literature on the issues surrounding the relationship between the government and housing in Nigeria. The study would also facilitate the examination of the role of government in the provision of housing in Nigeria and thus boosting the empirical evidence from Nigeria.<br/>Furthermore, given the empirical nature of the study, the outcome of this study would aid policy makers and regulatory bodies and policy simulation with respect to the selected variables examined in the study.<br/>The result of the study would be of benefits to education analysts, and institutions in examining the effectiveness of the provision of housing in Nigeria.<br/>It will also be useful in stimulating public discourse given the dearth of empirical researchers in this area from emerging economies like Nigeria.<br/>Finally, it would also add to the available literature on the areas of study while also providing a platform for other researchers who may want to further this study.<br/></p><p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>\r\n <w:WordDocument>\r\n  <w:View>Normal</w:View>\r\n  <w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom>\r\n

STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>It is estimated that over 4.6 billion people will live in the world's urban areas by 2030. In Nigeria, 48 per cent of the population currently lives in urban areas. Low income population are indeed the most vulnerable concerning issues of accessing land for housing. This is because they often lack a regular income and savings to comply with the required conditions for formal purchase and occupation of land.<br/>More than 40 per cent of population in Mgbidi, Oru West LGA, Imo State lives below poverty line. In some of the city's districts it has even exceeded 50 per cent. The struggle by this poor population for shelter has manifested in a variety of ways, ranging from residing in unsafe tenement compounds to multi-purpose shops (business and residence).<br/>Among the presidents' 7 point agenda is a proposal for amendment of the Nigerian land tenure law (the Land Use Act - which vested the ownership of all lands in a state in the governor of that state). The sections proposed for amendment include the section 5 of the act which empowered the governor to grant rights (in leasehold), demand and revise rents on such lands, and also powers to wholly or partly waive the conditions attached to acquisition of rights in special circumstances.<br/>This paper tries to show that the section 5 of the existing land tenure law and the current compensation procedures has a potential for improving access to land by low income.<br/>The paper suggested the utilisation of the community-driven land tenure systems in conjunction with the provisions of the section 5 of the land use act and the existing land acquisition and compensation process as a proactive approach to foster positive urban development rather than the conventional reactive approach to informality. This will as well serve as a security for the low income against potential market temptations. Also, the role and capacities of NGOs (Non Governmental Organizations) in this respect should be promoted because the NGOs appeared to be the bridge in all the reviewed cases between the low income communities, land owners and policy makers.<br/>Tenure arrangements, Land Use Act, Community mortgage, Mgbidi, Oru West LGA, Imo State, Access to land<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>The majority of people on earth are now living in cities and towns. By 2030, over 4.6 billion people will live in urban areas (Wish 2009). For this urban population, access to secure shelter is a precondition for access to other benefits such as livelihood opportunities, public services and credit (Payne 2002). Tenure therefore forms the foundation on which any effort to improve the living condition for the poor has to be built. There is however counter arguments to this: Recent reviews of urban tenure policy suggest that titling has not achieved its objectives and is of doubtful benefit to the poor (Angel 2001 and Fernandes 2001, in Payne 2002 (9)). Similarly, Oswald (1999) argues that the higher a nations level of home ownership the higher its level of unemployment. Oswald cited an example with Switzerland as having the lowest rate of home ownership in the industrialised nations and only 1% unemployment, while in Spain 80% of population own their homes and 13% unemployment rate. Oswald concluded that home ownership levels restrict labour market mobility and thereby increase unemployment. The subject is not one that can easily be defined or delivered according to universally agreed norms. This is because tenure has many historical, cultural, legal and economic associations that affect people's perception and behaviour.<br/>In 2008, 48% of Nigeria's population lives in urban areas. Also, Nigeria is ranked 158 out of 177 on the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human Poverty Index in 2007. People living in relative poverty declined from 65.6% in 1996 to 54.4% in 2004 (UNDP 2007). According to UN Habitat however, poverty rate in Nigeria has skyrocketed to 76% in 2009 (This Day 2009). In the same vein, close to 77% of Nigerian city dwellers are living in urban slums, while 99% of problems expected to be addressed under the MDG are located in urban settlements. People living in poverty are often the most vulnerable as regards access to land. This is because they usually lack a regular income source and savings to apply for credit and meet the stringent building codes and other conditions required for formal purchase and occupation of land (Smolka and Damasio 2005).<br/>1.1 THE PROBLEM<br/>In a similitude of what is obtained at the national level, more than 40% of the population in Mgbidi, Oru West LGA, Imo State lives below poverty line (URP 2008). In some districts it has even exceeded 50% (Mgbidi, Oru West LGA, Imo State district). The struggle by this poor population for shelter has manifested through a variety of ways, ranging from residing in unsafe tenements compounds to multi-purpose shops (business and residence).<br/>In 2008, the federal government of Nigeria proposed amendments to the 1978 Land Use Act under the president's 7 point Agenda. Among the sections of the Act proposed for amendment is section 5 which vested all land in the state under the governor of that state, and accorded the governor with powers to grant statutory rights (in leasehold), demand and revise rents on such lands. The powers of the governor according to the proposal should be reduced. However, those powers could be utilized in providing access to land particularly to the low income, considering the fact that meagre amounts are required to acquire land for development. According to Uwakonye and Osho (2007), land reform is concerned with changing the institutional structure governing man's relationship with the land, involving intervention in the prevailing pattern of land ownership, control and usage in order to change the structure of holdings, improve land productivity and broaden the distribution of benefits. It is the intent of this paper therefore to describe the existing coping strategies of low income in Mgbidi, Oru West LGA, Imo State in gaining access to land and examine how the powers of the governor under the Nigeria's land tenure law (the Land Use Act) could be used to improve access to land by low income. The focus will be on the section 5 which presents a potential within the existing act to improve access to land for low income.<br/>1.2 AIM<br/>To examine the various tenure arrangements under which the low income residents of Mgbidi, Oru West LGA, Imo State are gaining access to land. This is with a view to raise the profile of understanding that would serve as a means of encouraging supportive policy intervention.<br/>1.3  OBJECTIVES<br/>To review the concept of land tenure in developing economies, and access to land by low income groups.<br/>To examine the land tenure system in Nigeria before the Land use Act.<br/>To describe the existing practice of land administration in Mgbidi, Oru West LGA, Imo State and examine the powers of the governor under the Land Use Act as a tool for providing the low income with access to land.<br/>To suggest ways for improvement of the status quo through the lessons learned from reviewed case studies.<br/> 1.4    JUSTIFICATION<br/>Studies have shown that, effect of regulations have historically proved to be restrictive to informal sector, which operate as a medium of access to land not only for low income but the majority of the population (Acioly 2007). Similarly, although most spatial planners position themselves as promoters of social and ecological issues, they often neglect the relationship between the poor and the land. Does it suffice for instance to provide space for social housing? Although housing is critical for the poor, Davy (2009) argued that the current global discourse on poverty and property is not confined to social housing, but includes the vulnerability of land uses by the poor. The paper is therefore timely in view of the current global discourse on poverty and property as well as the increasing awareness in its relationship to land policies particularly in the developing world. The need for reform strategies to accommodate specific interest of the low income is evident in a number of developing countries. South Africa and the Philippines are some examples.<br/>1.4    METHODOLOGY<br/>Existing literature on land tenure systems f will be reviewed to form the framework for discussion. The study will also make use of available data from existing empirical studies as regards the existing land administration procedures in Mgbidi, Oru West LGA, Imo State and also the various tenure arrangements that exist in the different districts of the city. The city is divided into five administrative districts usually for data collection convenience, and in response to their differing socio-economic characteristics (Mgbidi, Oru West LGA, Imo State city, Tudun wada, Sabon gari, GRA, and Samaru).<br/>The discussion would be from general to specific relating the apparent characteristics to possible explaining factors in descriptive terms.<br/><br/>\n\nLAND TENURE SYSTEM AT MGBID, ORU WEST L.GA, IMO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " LAND TENURE SYSTEM AT MGBID, ORU WEST L.GA, IMO STATE", "id": 123}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE IMPACT OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN OYO<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    Background of the Study<br/>The term environmental is better appreciated as perceived. Thus, the term defined a universally acknowledge method of description or definition. For instance, environment has been conceived as a system within which living organism interact with physical element (Sada, 2001). This means that, environment can be conceived as the condition, circumstances and influences of organism (Strahler and Strahler, 2007).<br/>    In addition, the environment is made of a number of spheres which include the hydrosphere, atmosphere, lithosphere and biosphere. Within these spheres are a number of interrelate activities in operation. Consequently, t he environment is perceived in this work as the general surrounding where a number of interrelate activities take place within the environment system and between man the environment.<br/>    Man‘s relationship with his environment has always changed with time depending  on his understanding and knowledge of physical environment. However, the natural environment is generally endowed with the space (Simons, 1981). Thus, man has come to regard his environment as a depot housing his needs and is a therefore resources within it.<br/>    According to Jimoh, (2000), environmental degradation has become a major problem facing people in most societies of the world. This includes pollution, climate change, causing drought and excessive rainfall, deforestation and desertification among others.<br/>    Environmental degradation increases the vulnerability of the societies. It affects and contributes to the scarcity of resources, climate change will lead to increase the intensity and frequency of weather extremer’s such as heat waves, food, droughts and tropical cyclonic (Faniran, 2002). The area is facing a lot of problems. As rural settings, harmful materials like faces, urine and disposal of non-degradable materials into the areas has led to the degradation of the area (Miller 2002).<br/>    Environmental degradation is the disintegration of the earth or deterioration of the environment through consumption of assets, for example, air, water and soil: the destruction of environments and the eradication of wildlife. It is characterized as any change aggvation to nature’s turf seen to be pernicious or undesirable. Ecological effect or degradation is created by the consolidation of an effectively substantial and expanding human populace, constantly expanding monetary development or per capital fortune and the application of asset exhausting and polluting technology. It occurs when earth’s natural resources are deflated and environment is compromised in the form of extinction of species, pollution.<br/>    Environmental degradation is one of the largest threats that are being looked at in the world today. The United Nation International Strategy for Disaster Reduction characterizes environmental degradation as the lessening of the limit of the earth to meet social and environmental destinations and needs. Environmental degradation can happen in a number of ways. At the point when environments are wrecked or common assets are exhausted, the environment is considered to be corrupted and harmed. There are a number of different techniques that are being used to prevent this, including environmental resources protection and general protection efforts Amicus journal staff (2000).<br/>    Environmental issue can be seen by long term ecological effect, some of which can demolish whole environment. An environment is a unique unit and incorporates of the living and non-living components that live inside it plants and creature are evident part of the environment, but it also includes the thing on which they depend on. For example, stems, lakes, and soil. Environmental surroundings get to be divided when technology advancement splits up areas of land. Chernoff, P.A (2004).<br/>    Some example of these include street which may include through woods or even trails which wind through prairies. While it may not should all teribles on the surface, there are bad results. The biggest of the result are felt by particular animal and plant group, the vast majority of which are specific for their bio-region or need a large area in order to make sure that genetics line are kept intact. Chardwick, D.H (2001).<br/>    Environment degration is one of the ten threats officially cautioned by the High-level panel on threats. Challenges and change of the United Nations. The United Nation international strategy for disaster reduction defines environment as ‘the reduction of the capacity of the environment to meet social and ecological objectives and needs environment degradation is of many types. When natural habit are destroyed or natural resources are deflected, the environment is degraded. Efforts to counteract this problem include environmental protection and environmental resource management. Environment working group staff (1999).<br/>1.2    Statement of the Problems<br/>    There are number of problems associated with impact of poverty on housing condition in traditional area of Atiba Local Government Area of Oyo State which have deplorable and constituted total nuisance to the environment, housing deterioration, facilities overload, slum creation, squatter housing overcrowding and socio-spatial disorderliness among others.<br/>Therefore, this research is to examine how poverty can be reduced in other to improve housing condition in traditional landscapes, the physical or natural environment indicated that the environment include rivers and cultural that the environment includes rivers and water bodies, trees, hill or mountain, minerals resources such as iron ore, gold, diamond and petroleum among other. Thus, every organism see the environment as a resources store which he can convenient fall back on for all his needs (Faniran and Ojo, 2009)<br/>     However, effect made by man to harness those environment basic resource have translated in to environment degration.

As a result, there is an urgent need to address the high cost of these products which is said to have slowed down the growth of the building and construction sector in Nigeria. Building materials constitute the largest single input in housing construction. While Adedeji (2010) observed that about sixty (60) per cent of the total housing expenditure goes for the purchase of building materials, Arayela (2005) averred that the cost of building materials constitute about 65 percent of the construction cost.<br/>Ogunsemi (2010) opined that building materials form the main factors that restricts the supply of housing and ascertained that they account for between 50-60 percent of the cost of buildings. Thus, Adedeji (2002) rightly observed that one main barrier to the realization of effective housing in Nigeria as revealed in successive government efforts has been the cost of housing in the country. He argued that in the early periods, shelter in Nigeria was easily affordable as building materials were sourced from the immediate environment at affordable costs. Technology also was readily available with commensurate simple techniques. But contact with the outside world through interregional and international training of professionals in foreign countries as occasioned by colonization, brought changes to tastes and hence outlook to house forms. These changes rendered the undeveloped local building materials inadequate while there was an increased demand for exotic ones. Accordingly, Arayela (2002) posited that the modern building industry lays much emphasis on sophisticated building materials and techniques that are expensive and energy consuming. Though, housing delivery efforts have evidently been inhibited by prohibitive costs of building materials, this problem cannot be reasonably and reliably overcome by merely resorting to the use of locally available materials without due considerations to the applicable initiative, the cost of processing and sustainability of the local materials. One of the most important components of a sustainable building is the material efficiency. Correct selection of building materials can be performed by taking into account their complete life span and by choosing products with the minimal environmental impacts. For instance, González and Navarro (2006) estimated that the selection of building materials with low environmental impacts can reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by up to 30%. The use of renewable and recycled sources is widely encouraged as the life-cycle of a building and its elements can be closed (Chwieduk, 2003). The major factor that greatly affect the selection of building materials are their costs and social requirements such as thermal comfort, good mechanical properties (strength and durability), aesthetic characteristics and an ability to construct quickly. Ideally, the combination of all environmental, economic and social factors can give a clear description of a material, and thus helps in a decision making process regarding the cost of the materials suitable for buildings (Abeysundara, et, al.,2009) .  Nigerians would continue to pay more for accommodation in major cities until the cost of building materials is subsidized through probably through tax reduction. The instability in the price of building materials was posited as a direct result of high taxes which in turn impacts on the cost of accommodation in major cities across the country. According to Arayela (2002), many completed housing estates had remained unoccupied because of the high rental and sale prices attached to them as against the meager income of the average Nigerian workers. He also added that if government can revitalise our industrial base, the cost of building materials will come down and many more people would be able to build houses. He therefore  urged the Federal Government to provide tax relief for local manufacturers and importers of building materials in order to reduce the high cost of accommodation in major cities.<br/>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Building materials have been playing an important role in the construction industry—they are those materials put together in erecting or constructing structures, no field of engineering is conceivable without their use (Akanni, 2006; Udosen &amp; Akanni, 2010). Building materials contribute immensely to the quality and cost of housing, from what is used in the foundation to the materials for roofing and finishes, while the building materials industry is an important contributor to the national economy of any nation as its output governs both the rate and the quality of construction work.<br/>The cost of building materials poses a significant threat to both the construction industry and people aspiring to own houses (Anosike, 2009; Mekson, 2008; Mohammed, 2008; Njoku, 2007); for example, a bag of cement, which is valued at Ν1,350.00 in 2006, goes as high as Ν1,850.00 in 2009 (Anosike, 2009) depicting about 37% increment; the bag goes as high as Ν2,000.00 in 2015 during peak season (field survey 2015). Supporting this view, Jagboro and Owoeye (2004) earlier established that increase in the prices of building materials has multiplier effects on housing development while Idoro and Jolaiya (2010) affirmed that many projects were not completed on time due to the cost of materials, which have been on the increase. Besides timely completion, high prices of building materials form a crucial constraint to improving housing conditions in Nigeria (United Nations Centre for Human Settlement [UNCHS], 1993).<br/>In spite of the past studies on the cost of building materials in Nigeria, little is publicized about the implications of the rise in cost on the construction industry; most literature (Jagboro &amp; Owoeye, 2004; Mekson, 2008; Njoku, 2007; Oladipo &amp; Oni, 2012) has concentrated on identifying the causes with little emphasis on the implications; hence, the research seeks to provide information on the effect of cost of building materials on housing development in Nigeria.<br/>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The following are the objectives of this study:<br/>1.  To examine the effect of building materials cost on housing development in Nigeria.<br/>2.  To determine the factors responsible for high cost of building materials in Nigeria.<br/>3.  To proffer solutions that will reduce the cost of building material to ensure adequate housing development in Nigeria.<br/>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.  What is the effect of building materials cost on housing development in Nigeria?<br/>2.  What are the factors responsible for high cost of building materials in Nigeria?<br/>3.  What are the solutions that can reduce the cost of building material to ensure adequate housing development in Nigeria?<br/>1.5   HYPOTHESIS<br/>HO: Cost of building materials does not affect housing development in Nigeria.<br/>HA: Cost of building materials does affect housing development in Nigeria.<br/>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The following are the significance of this study:<br/>1.  Findings from this study will educate the general public on the current market cost of building materials in Nigeria and its effect on sustainable housing development in Nigeria.<br/>2.  The results of this study will sensitize the policy makers and the government on the need to make and implement policies that will reduce the cost of building materials in Nigeria thereby encouraging massive housing development all over the country.<br/>3.  This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.<br/>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY<br/>This study on the effect of building materials cost on housing development in Nigeria will cover the current prices of building material in Nigeria focusing on how it has influenced the provision of affordable housing for the Nigerian populace.<br/>LIMITATION OF STUDY<br/>Financial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<br/> Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

It is a common knowledge that the Land Use Act has since its inception, provided answer to the socio-economic problem of making land readily available for desired objectives especially in the area of landed property development which is retarded in Enugu. This study which adopted the survey research approach, analysed the effects of the Land Use Act of 1978 on property development as measured in terms of ease of accessibility, ease of acquisition and security of title with a view to formulating a workable proposal for an improvement on the existing land policy which will improve the rate of property development. Data were sourced through primary and secondary sources, which included questionnaires, interviews, and review of published and unpublished scholarly work. These data x-rayed the opinion of various land operators on the effects of the Land Use Act on Property Development in Enugu Urban. A sample size of 368 was selected from the study population of 4,650 made up of 250 staff of Redan, 400 Registered Estate Surveyors and 4,000 Landlords. Three hundred and fifty (350) or 95% of the 368 questionnaires randomly administered on the samples were retrieved. The data generated were analysed in tables to answer the research questions formulated using frequencies and percentages. Three hypotheses which tested the three major effects of Land Use Act namely; lack of ease of accessibility to land, difficulty in land acquisition and lack of security of title to land were tested using the Non parametric Binomial test of proportions and Chi-square technique. The results of the test in which the X2 table value at 0.05 level of significance, 2df and 3df confirmed the reality of insecurity of title to land, inaccessibility and difficulty in land acquisition by the rejection of the Null Hypothesis. The study finally recommended that the Land Use Act be retained but with amendments of some sections, in order to accelerate the speed with which land is made available at reduced fees.<br/>        TABLE OF CONTENTS                                     <br/>Chapter One: Introduction    -                            <br/>1.1    Background of the study                            <br/>1.2    Statement of the problems                            <br/>1.3    Aim of the study                                <br/>1.4    The objectives of the study                            <br/>1.5    Research question                                <br/>1.6    Research hypothesis                                <br/>1.7    Significance of the study                            <br/>1.8    The scope of the study                            <br/>1.9    Limitation of the study                            <br/>Chapter Two: Literature Review                            <br/>2.1    Land Tenure system in Nigeria before the Act                <br/>2.1.1    Northern States    -    -    -    -                <br/>2.1.2    Western States        -    -    -    -                <br/>2.1.3    Eastern States        -    -    -    -                <br/>2.2    The Land Use Act of 1978    -    -    -                <br/>2.2.1    Powers of the Governor and the Local Government under the Act        <br/> 2.2.2    Rights and privileges of holders    -    -    -            <br/>2.2.3    Method of acquiring land under the Act    -    -            <br/>2.2.4    Revocation of rights of occupancy and compensation            <br/>2.2.5    Implementation of the Act    -    -    -    -            <br/>2.2.6    Effects of the Land Use Act on property development            <br/>Chapter Three: Research Methodology    -    -    -            <br/>3.1    Re-statement of problem    -    -    -    -            <br/>3.2    Study area settings        -    -    -    -            <br/>3.2.1    Historical origin and growth of Enugu    -    -            <br/>3.2.2    Geographical Local/Communication        -    -            <br/>3.2.3    Physical Features    -    -    -    -    -            <br/>3.2.4    Climate and Vegetation    -    -    -    -            <br/>3.2.5    Neighbourhoods and occupation    -    -    -            <br/>3.2.6    Services    -    -    -    -    -    -            <br/>3.2.7    Population    -    -    -    -    -    -            <br/>3.3    Research design and methodology    -    -    -            <br/>3.4    Population of Study    -    -    -    -    -            <br/>3.5    Sample Size/Sample Techniques    -    -    -            <br/>3.6    Data Collection    -    -    -    -    -            <br/>3.6.1    Data Sources    -    -    -    -    -    -            <br/>3.7    Research Instruments -    -    -    -    -            <br/>3.7.1    Administration of Instrument -    -    -    -            <br/>3.7.2    Validity and Reliability of the Instruments    -    -            <br/>3.8.0    Methods of Data Analysis    -    -    -    -            <br/>Chapter Four: Presentation and Analysis of Data    -    -            <br/>4.1    Analysis of Returns    -    -    -    -    -            <br/>4.2    Analysis of Personal Data    -    -    -    -            <br/>4.3    Analysis of (Data) Responses        -    -    -            <br/>4.3.1    Awareness of the Land Use Act and its objectives    -            <br/>4.4    Problems generated by the Land Use Act to property development -    <br/> 4.5    Socio-economic problems generated by the Land Use Act<br/>to property development   -    -    -    -    -    <br/>4.6    Effect of Land Use Act to land acquisition, ease of accessibility,<br/>    and security of title to land for property development in Enugu        <br/>4.7    Test of hypotheses    -    -    -    -    -    -        <br/>4.8    Further test of hypotheses    -    -    -    -    -        <br/>4.9    Improvement of property development in Enugu    -    -        <br/>4.10    Approaches for remedying the problems of Land Use Act<br/>    on property development    -    -    -                <br/>Chapter Five: Discussions and Implications, Findings, Conclusion and Recommendation<br/>5.1    Discussions and Implications -                        <br/>5.2    Summary of Findings -    -                        <br/>5.3    Conclusions    -    -    -                        <br/>5.4    Recommendations    -    -                        <br/>    References    -    -    -                        <br/>    Appendix    -    -    -                        <br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>Land is a natural resource which is physically fixed. It is the most fundamental<br/>basic resource around which our social structure revolves. Every activity requires the use of land and this makes land the most valuable asset of man.<br/>There is an intimate relationship between man and land. Man has maintained a close contact with land which provides him with virtually all he needs for his sustenance. The survival of man depends on the availability of land and his ability to acquire and exploit it to satisfy his seemingly endless needs. This ability to acquire land is sometimes limited or hindered by social, legal, environmental and technological constraint both in the public and the private sectors of the economy.<br/>For the fact that individuals, governments and organizations need land, there has been great demand for the acquisition, use and development of land and it has not been easy to meet this demand.<br/>In the same vein, Real Estate Development and use of land are prompted primarily by the products and satisfaction that could be derived therefrom. The problem of real estate development in Nigeria started during the Colonial period and was inherited by the Post Colonial Nigerian Government. Inspite of the efforts of both the colonial and the post colonial governments to solve the problem of Real Estate Development in the country, they remained unresolved till date.<br/>Government all through the ages has recognized that land is an indispensable resource in a nation’s economic and social development. Over the years, different communities have made enactments respecting how land should be owned, developed and managed. In other words the use to which land should be put, the nature and extent of development to be carried out thereon and indeed all decisions affecting land are dictated by the land laws of the country.<br/>Property Development on the other hand is one of man’s most crucial needs, in that it represents man’s most tangible asset both to the private and the public investors. However before any development is carried out on a parcel of land, property rights must  first be exercisable over that piece of land. These property rights are defined by the existing land laws of the village, community or nation.<br/>It must, therefore, be understood that the land law of any country is always intrinsically interwoven with the economic cum socio-political development of the community. In order words, the land cannot be divorced from the general history and development of any society.<br/>Above all, the continued increase in the population of Nigeria, the desire for individual self-sustenance, increased economic activities and the inherent encumbrances in the customary land law obviously demanded a land reform policy that would refine if not abolish entirely these problematic aspects of the customary land tenure.<br/>The Land Use Act of 1978 happened to be one of the legislations enacted in response to the yearnings and aspirations of most of the Nigerian people. This was greeted with ovation in Nigeria by the unthinking masses with high expectations that it will uplift Nigeria into one of the World’s Powers in Development. How much the Land Use Decree (Now Act) has gone in boosting development of the nation is yet to be seen. It is upon this background that this study seeks to find out the extent to which the Act has impacted on property development.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM:<br/>The Land Use Decree (Now Act) of 1978 was promulgated purportedly to enable Nigerians have quality access to land and to be able to enjoy not only the land itself but the natural fruits thereon. The fact however is that there is no certainty as to the extent to which the Act has affected property development in Enugu Urban.<br/>The Act aimed at assisting in the acquisition of land by individuals for development of properties of all categories which will help in boosting the economy of the country. It seems however that the government’s promulgation of the Land Use Act has impacted negatively on the development of properties in the country as exemplified by the situation in Enugu the study area. This has resulted in the acute shortage of housing for various purposes, state of inertia in the property market, high rents in housing accommodation and several other social tensions.<br/>The debut of Land Use Act destroyed security of title to land and the ease of acquisition. A landowner needs security for his use and enjoyment of the land and may also require to protect whatever dealing the desires to have on that land. It has become clear that the processes of accessing land presently characterized by procedural delays and red tapeism.<br/>1.3 AIM OF THE STUDY:<br/>The aim of the study is to examine the effects of the Land Use Act of 1978 on property development in Enugu Urban in terms of ease of accessibility, ease of acquisition and security of title.<br/>1.4    THE OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY:<br/>To achieve the aim of the study, the following objectives were pursued: -<br/>i.    To determine the extent to which the objectives of the Land Use Act has been achieved;<br/>ii.    To identify the various socio-economic problems generated by the Land Use Act on property development;<br/>iii.    To determine the effect of the Land Use Act on land accessibility, acquisition and security of title on property development; and<br/>iv.    To recommend better area of study on the Act with respect to property development as a means of providing effective strategy for increasing property stock.<br/>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTIONS:<br/>To achieve the aim and objectives of the study the following questions and<br/>hypotheses were raised:<br/>1.    Has the objective of the Land Use Act in making land readily and easily accessible for Nigerian been achieved?<br/>2.    What are the problems prompted by the Land Use Act to property development in Enugu?<br/>3.    Has property development in Enugu witnessed any socio-economic problems?<br/> 4.    Has the Land Use Act enhanced land acquisition, ease of accessibility and security of title for property development or has it retarded them.<br/>5.    How can the development of properties be encouraged in Enugu?<br/>6.    What is the best approach to tackle the controversial problems generated by the Land Use Act with respect to property development?<br/>1.6    RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS:<br/>HYPOTHESIS 1:<br/>Null Hypothesis (Ho) – The Land Use Act did not create any problem to the ease of accessibility to land for property development in Enugu.<br/>Alternative Hypothesis (H1) – The Land Use Act has created problems to the ease of accessibility to land for property development in Enugu.<br/>HYPOTHESIS 2:<br/>Null Hypothesis (Ho) – The Land Use Act has not imposed any difficulty in land acquisition for property development in Enugu.<br/>Alternative Hypothesis (H1) – The Land Use Act has imposed some difficulties on land acquisition for property development in Enugu.<br/>HYPOTHESIS 3:<br/>Null Hypothesis (Ho) – The Land Use Act has promoted security of title to land for property development in Enugu.<br/>Alternative Hypothesis (H1) – The Land Use Act has not promoted security of title to land for property development in Enugu.<br/>1.7    THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:<br/>The significance of the study lies to a great extent in setting a stage for a more<br/>urgent and more comprehensive appraisal of the effects of Land Use Act on private property development in Nigeria particularly in Enugu Urban. In addition to this the study will also go a long way in educating the government on whether to review the Land Use Act or not in order to accelerate the development of properties in the country. <br/>This work will also be of importance to all those who may carry out further<br/>studies on Land Use Act among whom are:<br/>a.    Research students for whom it will open an avenue for further research work.<br/>b.    Land administrators and policy makers to whom it will give a general view of the problems and thereby pave way of reviewing the Land Use Act in order to facilitate development in the country.<br/>c.    Property Developers, for whom it will raise great hope for better future access to land which will promote the development of more property stock.<br/>d.    The indigenes of Enugu State who may now find it easier to participate in land matters for more effective property and overall development of the state.<br/>1.8    THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY:<br/>This research work is limited to Enugu since it will not be possible to cover all the<br/>towns in the country in a study of this nature due to time and financial constraints.<br/>In examining the effect of the Land Use Act on property development, attention was therefore focused on Enugu Urban. This has the singular but important advantage of ensuring a more detailed investigation especially when the time limit for accomplishing the work is considered. In doing this however, recourse was had to the general problems of property development, and Pre Land Use Legislation in Nigeria. This will act as a prelude to a proper understanding and appreciation of the effect of the Land Use Act on property development in the study area.<br/>1.9    THE LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY:<br/>Data collection proved the most difficult aspect of this research work not only as a<br/>result of the uncooperative attitude of many respondents sampled but because of repeated journeys made to administer the instruments due to absence in the house of the samples when visited.<br/>Recourse to secondary data was also affected to an extent by non-availability of appropriate study materials. The greatest problem was however posed by finance.<br/><br/>\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF THE LAND USE ACT OF 1978 ON PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA: A CASE STUDY OF ENUGU URBAN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF THE LAND USE ACT OF 1978 ON PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA: A CASE STUDY OF ENUGU URBAN", "id": 126}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>RATING ADMINISTRATION IN NIGERIA <br/>(A CASE STUDY OF NNOBI IN IDEMILI SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA IN ANAMBRA STATE) <br/>ABSTRACT </b><br/>            Property rating in Nigeria is a major contribution of knowledge in the area of rating administration in Nigeria has not been accorded the priority it deserves as an important item of re  venue for local government authorities which rely mainly on funds from the federation account. <br/>            In developed countries of the world, local government authorities depend to a large extent on the revenue from property rating to finance their programmers. <br/>            Because most local governments are cash strapped and indigent.

In Nigeria the owners of landed property are taxed while in the United Kingdom the occupiers are taxed. <br/>The purpose of rating valuation is to arrive at a figure termed ratable value on which rates are levied upon the rate payer at so much in the naira in order to defray the expenses of the local government. <br/>In Nigeria proceeds from property rates are expected to be used for specific projects like water supply, refuse disposal, street lighting community halls, roads and markets and maintenance of infrastructural facilities at local levels. <br/>This thesis aims at reviewing rating administration in Nnobi, in Idemili South local government area in Anambra State. <br/>1.2              BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>It was difficult not to see the local government groaning under it liabilities while little or nothing was coming in from the Federal and State government the fourth Republic took a turn for the worse for local governments with the zero allocation syndromes. It behooves local governments; therefore generate their own revenue to maintain their sustainability. <br/>This study looks into the present system of administration of property rating in local government. <br/>1.3              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>A study of this nature can be all encompassing but this particular one seeks to look at all the statements made in favour and against property rating in Nnobi Idemili South Local Government Area. <br/>Supporters of the system say administration and implementation has been the bane of its failure. <br/>The unsatisfactory state of affairs is looked at to improve on this service. The problems I wish to solve in this research work are:- <br/>i.                    Personnel problems <br/>ii.                  Ignorance and landlord’s absenteeism<br/>iii.                Lack of adequate materials <br/>iv.                Lack of proper records <br/>v.                  Lack of interest towards Rating <br/>vi.                Poor Street naming and housing numbering. <br/>1.4       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY    <br/>1.         To examine the administration machinery in Idemili South Local Government Area.<br/>2.         To make comparative analysis of the revenue sources in Idemili South Local Government Area with other local government areas. <br/>3.         To evaluate the performance of the rating system and practice, and see if it can be make better. <br/>4.         To make recommendations as to better ways of administering property rating.  <br/>5.         The procedure for the implementation of rating the system. <br/>6.         To identify some of the problems that are militating against effective and efficient property rating in Idemili South Local Government Area.   <br/>1.5      SCOPE OF STUDY <br/>This study is a result of the inspection of hereditament in three of the fourteen (14) zones in Idemili South Local Government Area.<br/>For cost and time constrains, a sample of the three zones covered the fourteen is taken as a guide in the analysis of the revenue pattern of Idemili south Local Government Area better machinery has been put in place to collect the rate. As the dividends of democracy began to reach the people in the form of good roads, electricity supply, security, etc. the property owners/occupier are normally compelled to pay their rates. <br/>Without rating administration there will be problems on arriving at a figure termed to be levied on people. <br/>1.6      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY   <br/>This study will highlight grounds for reforms in current property rating administration system in the state. <br/>It will also advice on how to make the system and practices of property rating in Idemili south Local Government Area. <br/>More effective and efficient and eliminate the current dependence on Federal Allocation which these days are unreliable and insufficient. <br/>Idemili South local Government Authority in particular and other local government departments charged with rating administration responsibility are equally to benefit from this study.      <br/><br/>\n\nRATING ADMINISTRATION IN NIGERIA \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF NNOBI IN IDEMILI SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA IN ANAMBRA STATE) \r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RATING ADMINISTRATION IN NIGERIA \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF NNOBI IN IDEMILI SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA IN ANAMBRA STATE) \r\n", "id": 127}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECT OF SLUM ON PROPERTY VALUES  <br/>(A CASE STUDY AGUOWA IN ENUGU, ENUGU STATE) <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            The aim of this dissertation is to evaluate the effects of slum on property values at Aguowa via Trans-Ekulu and confirm that slum was responsible for the low property value in the area.

By and large, the rural settlement experienced rapid population growth and since it was at the outskirt of Enugu central, it was not subjected to building regulations and codes, hence houses constructed of handy materials sprang up all over the settlement. Thus the area was crowded with poor housing structures most disorderly located. The settlement has grown and developed in an unplanned manner resulting in the decline of property values and social status of the estate environment. While the dwellers show no indifference to the poor conditions of the urban environment, the city government agencies responsible for planning and managing the urban environment and regulating urban life displayed a mark of ineffectiveness in the discharge of their duties. <br/>This condition consequently brought a spontaneous development of sub-standard dwelling, deriod of essential amenities, estate roads, drainage, ventilation, recreational facilities, refuse disposal facilities etc. lack of all these eventually both the available infrastructures and building consign obsolescence and subsequently the slum. Due to this burning issue of slum, the researcher is set to evaluate the effect on property values at Aguowa, its states of evaluation in the study area taking note of both its immediate and remote causes. In other to established and the effect of this slum on property values the researches reduces the population of study which is it properties in the two 92) residential neighbourhoods of Aguowa (namely Trans – Ekulu and Federal Housing Estate). <br/>            Stratified random sampling method was used to collect data for the study. <br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF STUDY <br/>            Aguowa area is the native home land of the Nike people. The land is the freehold property of the people, as a result of this, some families were able to lease or sell land to non indigenous when the expansion of the Enugu urban centre aught up with the area sometime in 1955. Some of the none indigenes erected houses while others employed the services of licensed surveyors to demarcate the portion of their land in anticipation of erecting structures which would comply with the building bye laws as approve by the municipal council. <br/>            Unfortunately, the native authority could not control development in this area, until Enugu was declared as planning area, on 14th September, 1958. Even with the declaration, development continued haphazardly in total disregard of town planning regulation. Uncontrolled development within the area and increases urban population in Enugu led to the blighting of the neighbourhood. <br/>            The environmental conditions are considered very poor and dangerous to health. This is partly due to the public attitude towards waste disposal and to the inefficiency and ineffectiveness.                              <br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS <br/>            “Aguowe Jungle” is characterized by slum condition like blighted structure, over crowding, high occupancy ratio mostly by low income group, under supply of public amenities, bade roads etc. This observation made the researcher interested in trying to examine the effect of this condition (slum) on property values and hence the research work. <br/>1.3              OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY      <br/>The objective of this study is as follows: - <br/> a.                   To identify the causes of slum in the study area as well as the indicator of slum environment. <br/>b.                  To find out whether the property value including rental and captial values of landed properties are low or high in Aguowa as a result of slum condition. <br/>c.                   To establish whether the slum has a negative or positive effect on property value in the study area. <br/>d.                  To establish whether slum environment makes investment in real estate and property market transactions, a viable venture.     <br/>e.                   To recommend the best strategy towards eradicating the slum of Aguowa area and hence create a suitable environment that will enhance the property value in the area.   <br/>1.4              RESEARCH QUESTION <br/>To investigate the research problem earlier stated and to rightly address the focus of this study more objectively, certain questions have been raised. It is believed that obtaining the right answers to these questions have been raised. It is believed that obtaining the right ensures to these questions will led to the achievement of the objectives of the study. The questions are as follows: <br/>1)         Is there any significant manifestation of slum in the study area when compared with other surrounding layouts.  <br/>2).        Does slum have any significant impact (positive or negative) on property values in Aguowa. <br/>3).        If positive urban planning strategy is applied to the slum area, will thee be any significant effect on real estate values within the slum area/ <br/> 1.5      THEATRICAL FOUNDATION OF THE STUDY <br/>            This work is based on the theory of the highest and best use of land. This is meant to mean the optimum use of land and land resources (Baco 1932). This is the use of land in such a manners a manner as to provide and optimum return to their owners, or to society. Aguowe area  is not being put to its highest and best use and that calls for he significance of this study. <br/>1.6       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>            The study identifies the types of slum in the study area and elsewhere and has clearly portaged the need for an urban planning policy and also a determined resolve to clear a slum environment so as to enjoy the benefits of real estate environment through the enhanced property values.     <br/>            The study will also be of very relevance to the practicing estate surveyors and the banking institutions who might need real estate as collateral for providing credit facilities for the conditions of the properties and neghbourhoods when carrying out mortgage and insurance valuations as well as other valuation purposes. Of course a property located in a slum environment will not make for a good collaterals for a bank loan because of low returns. The study will also be benefited to the residents of Aguowa because  to the recommendations are implemented, they will enjoy a clean and healthy environment. <br/>1.7       SCOPEOF STUDY      <br/>            This study is restricted to the development of slum in Aguowe of Enugu Central local government area. The investigation will consider the environmental, socio economic demographic, transportation, infrastructureal and housing amenities conditions relevant to enhance estate setting as well as property values.        <br/>1.9       OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY <br/>            the study starts with an introductory chapter on the research problem and other related issues.

A possible explanation of their reluctance is that a large expenditure of effort is required before even quite manor contribution can be established. This study will therefore seek to identify and analyze the various ways or methods through which the government, private develops and individual finance the development of real estate in Nigeria in order to bring house ownership within the reach of the people. These ways or methods will be critically appraised in order to determine their short comings and recommendation will be advanced in order to eliminate the short comings and make the method more feasible and viable, do away with non feasible and unprofitable methods and to suggest new methods of achieving the descried goal. <br/>1.1       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>As we all know Ebeano Estate, which is located in the northern zone of New Haven Enugu some years back had mainly consisted of detached houses during the military regime. Government workers and officers were very few and he value of property development was not appreciated. Obviously, the residents of Ebeano Housing Estate had not been informed of he need for and essence of real Estate developments. <br/>However, with the coming of democracy the population of government workers or civil servants increased more government offices were opened and the inhabitants Enugu began to see and appreciate the value of Estate development. There were more and more civil servants with low income and Asaba became both a commercial and an administrative centre.<br/>During the military regimes, one would realize that there was not a genuine effort towards real estate finance it could not be said of Onitsha in Anambra state and Warri as they are much renowned commercial cities. During this period he effort made by government in real estate finance had not gone beyond building office apartment for its workers and perhaps the building of residences for members of staff or the particular ministry concerned with the above one could simply say that the inhabitants of real estate finance and when any effort was made in that regard they had to resort to borrowing since they had never been business included. <br/>1.2              BACKGROUND OF STUDY <br/>Real Estate Development is a fundamental and essential feature in the urban environment. Adequate provision of real estate development has a great deal of positive impact on both the economic and social life of urban citizens. Its adequacy has the reverse effect. <br/>The shortage of real estate development is one of ht major problem facing the urban centres especially in the developing countries. This could be attributed to scarcity of finance for real project development. Real estate development involves large amount of money. It is usually not within the capability of most urban dwellers particularly the medium and low-income groups. The rate of real estate development constriction often lends to be small and generally depend on financial resources.<br/>This situation of financial security is made worse by the rigid attitude of financial institutions towards lending for real estate development. Their system of granting loan makes it very difficult for the medium and low-income groups to benefit from the available facilities. The bulk of the mortgage loans go to the upper class.     <br/>1.3              OBJECTIVES OF STUDY <br/>This study is aimed at identifying and anglicizing the various ways of methods through which the government of Enugu state finance real estate in Enugu. Ebeano to be prescribe in order to bring housing ownership within the reach of the common man. These ways will be critically appraised to determine their shortcoming and recommendation will be advanced to eliminate the shortcomings. <br/>1.4              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>A study on real estate development financing of Ebeano is very important for planning purposed. The appraisal of real Estate development finance is valuable and could be utilized to achieve certain academic objectives. It can enlighten government, students, and researcher on the importance of real property development financing. <br/>The general result obtained from this study is expected to broaden the awareness of the public on current sources of real Estate development financer in Enugu metropolis.  <br/>1.5              DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>The Corporation: This referees to the Enugu state housing, development corporation. The enabling edict: This refers to the Enugu state Housing finance corporation edict no 10 of 1976, which established the corporation housing markets. The formal housing market for sale or for rent, is that market in which housing is available a acceptable space, environmental and health standing, which has full title and an adequate provision for infrastructure. A junior mortgage: Any mortgage, which is subordinate, is a mortgage or mortgages on the same property are a mortgage. <br/>Extension and compositions: An extension is an agreement to delay the payment of a debt for some period of time, while a composition involves reduction in the size of the claim of creditors where there are more than two creditors. These agreements are entirely voluntary and individual creditors are not bound by the agreements of the other creditors. The agreements may be reached as a result of legal actions under the jurisdiction of a court but are more likely to be the result of private negotiation. <br/>Financial Intermediaries: Financial intermediaries can be seen as institution or economic units that intermediate can be seen as institutions or economic units that intermediate between surplus economic units and deficit economic units. They mobilize the savings from the surplus units and make the savings available to those units that have need for the funds for either investment or consumption purpose. They are usually classified into bank and non-bank financial institutions.<br/>Housing Estate: The definition of “Housing Estate” as a compound word has not attracted much attention from authors. Rather “Housing” and “Estate” has been separately defined as an area of land upon which houses to be built are readily planned, designed and controlled using development control and usually geared towards a certain goal and managed as a single entity. <br/>Real Estate: This refers to immovable property consisting of land and buildings. <br/>Disposal: With regard to housing. It is the change of ownership or transfer of occupation, which may or may not be accompanied by monitory considerations. <br/>1.6              RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>After fully analyzing the nature of this study much diligence was exercised in the collection of all relevant data and information from the Estate surveyor and value and Ebeano housing estate Enugu and also in the liberty. A huge proportion of the information concerning this study was collected through oral personal interviews with all persons and authorities of relevance in the corporation.                                <br/><br/>\n\nFINANCING OF REAL ESTATE IN NIGERIA \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF EBEANO HOUSING ESTATE ENUGU)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FINANCING OF REAL ESTATE IN NIGERIA \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF EBEANO HOUSING ESTATE ENUGU)\r\n", "id": 129}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE CAUSE OF ABANDONED PUBLIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN THE FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY ABUJA<br/>CASE STUDY FCDA<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The continues abandoning of public projects at various levels of development all over the country is of great concern not only to the governments themselves but more to civil servants who are too inadequately accommodated.<br/>In this research work efforts have been made to identify, analyzed and discuss the basic causes of abandonment federal capital development Authority (FCDA) projects.<br/>Chapter one serves as an introduction which outlines the background of the study, statement to the problems, aims / objectives of the study, research questions, significance of the study, scope of and limitations of the study plus overview of the study of the federal capital territory (FCT) Abuja.<br/>Chapter two serves as literature reviews definition of special terms and also into introduces the reader to some housing policies in Nigeria.<br/>The third chapter serves as research methodology where all the sources and method of data collection used in this work are explained.<br/>Chapter four is the core of the research work where data collection from the filed are presented and analyzed.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0       Introduction<br/>1.1       Background of the Study<br/>1.2       Statement of the Problem<br/>1.3       Aims / Objectives of the Study<br/>1.4       Research Questions<br/>1.5       Significance of the Study<br/>1.6       Scope and limitations of the study<br/>1.7       Overview of the study<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0       Literature Review<br/>2.1       Abandonment<br/>2.2       Development<br/>2.3       Development Process in Building Industry<br/>2.4       Project<br/>2.5       Public Sector Involvement in Housing Development<br/>2.6       Types of Public Property<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0       Methodology<br/>3.1       Data Primary Sources<br/>3.2       Secondary Data<br/>3.3       Limitations<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.0       Data Analysis<br/>4.1              Respondents Views on Causes Abandonment<br/>4.2              Respondents Views on the Effect of Abandonment<br/>4.3       Respondents Views on the Possible Solution Abandonment<br/>4.4       Discussion the Findings<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>5.0       Summary Recommendations and Conclusion<br/>5.1       Summary <br/>5.2       Recommendation<br/>5.3       Conclusion<br/>5.4       References<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0        INTRODUCTION<br/>Only little portion of government projects are executed by direct labour, while most of the development projects are awarded to contractions.<br/>Public structures have been known to be abandoned in the cause of construction or left to dilapidate after being practically completed.<br/>      Incidents of abandoned projects are rampant all over the country e.g. from Enugu to ILorin, port Harcourt to sokoto and Lagos to Maidugwi. Projects of high capital cost. Such as residential buildings, office buildings and even road constructions.<br/>1.1       HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE FEDERAL CAPITAL TARRITORY VIZ – AVIZ FEDERAL CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY ABUJA (FCDA)<br/>            The federal capital territory Abuja was created in 1976 by Decree No6 of that year which was established the federal capital development agency responsible for the design, construction and administration of the territory.<br/>            The decree also vested ownership and control for all land in the territory in the federal government of Nigeria. The territory which is located at the centre of the country covers an areas of 8000sqkm.<br/>            It is therefore more than twice the land area of Lagos state (93535sq.km) about two-thirds the size of Imo state (13032sq. km).<br/>            The federal capital territory itself is designed to cover an area of 256sq. Km or 3% of the total land area of the territory and at full development the city is expected to have a total population of 3.2 million.<br/>            In the FCT the duration of sunshine range from 6-8 hours per day in the south and 8-10 hours per day in the North from January to April / may. There is however a steep drop to a mean of about 4 hours per day in the month of July / August largely due to increase in cloud cover it starts again in the month of September. <br/>            Abuja, a virgin land with virtually no amenities of any sort before 1976 even where the pioneer civil servants would stay became a test case. Therefore Civil Servants had to stay in scattered level hotels in Suleja for residential accommodation and a borrowed Niger State Housing Estate had to be used as the Head Quarters of the FCDA.<br/>            The only road from Suleja to the Linther land of the territory was a colonial narrow tarred road.<br/>            FCDA is a parastatals under the Ministry for the Federal Capital Territory (MFCT) responsible for the physical development f the territory.<br/>            Under FCDA is the Development of Public Building and Engineering. The development of Public Building is in charges of designing and supervising f buildings while the Engineering Development, takes charge of road, dams and Electrical Services and bridges.<br/>            Most projects are executed through contractors while little is done by direct labour. <br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEMS <br/>            It has been observed that inspite f the effort put by government to brings to actualization the conception of its projects, public projects are still massively abandoned at different stages of construction.<br/>            What are the factors responsible for the abandonment of public projects?<br/>            This study is therefore geared towards examining the factors that cause abandonment of public sector development especially FCDA projects.<br/>1.3              AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>            The aims of this project are to examine the causes and effect f abandoned Public Development Projects in the Federal Capital Territory Abuja.<br/>            The above aim was drafted with the following objectives in mind.<br/>(i)                 To establish and identify the cause of Abandoned public developmeent project in the Federal Capitals Territory Abuja.<br/>(ii)               To investigate the effect of the abandoned public development projects on the livs of the citizens.<br/>(iii)             To investigate its effects also on the environment.<br/>(iv)             To suggest possible solution to causes of abandonment of public development projects in the Federal Capital Territory Abuja.<br/>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>(i)                 What are the possible causes of abandonment of Federal Capital Development Authority Project?<br/>(ii)               What are the possible effect of abandonment of such projects?<br/>(iii)             How can abandonment of public development projects be minimized in the Federal Capital Territory Abuja<br/>(iv)             What are the possible solutions to abandonment of public development projects in the Federal Capital Territory Abuja.<br/>1.5       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>(i)                 It will assist public sector development to avoid abandonment projects.<br/>(ii)               It will assist researches on similar topics.<br/>(iii)             It will educate the public on abandonment of projects and brief historical background of the FCT.<br/>1.6       OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY<br/>            The aim of the project is to examine the causes and effect of abandoned public development project in the Federal Capital Territory Abuja. Some of the causes which include inadequate funding or Bankcrupcy, lack of payment, high interest rate, inflation, improper planning, political reasons, delay in payment, corruption, bureacracy and back of special materials having its effect on lowering of living standard of the populace and as well making the environment look ugly among other effects. The chapter two made a reviews of related and relevant literature.<br/>            In the chapter three which is the methodology, both primary and secondary sources of data where used the percentage method. In chapter four the data acquired were presented on tables were analysed accordingly. <br/><br/>\n\nTHE CAUSE OF ABANDONED PUBLIC DEVELOPMENT\r\nPROJECTS IN THE FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY\r\nABUJA\r\nCASE STUDY FCDA\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE CAUSE OF ABANDONED PUBLIC DEVELOPMENT\r\nPROJECTS IN THE FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY\r\nABUJA\r\nCASE STUDY FCDA\r\n", "id": 130}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT IN OGBETE MAIN MARKET, ENUGU <br/>ABSTRACT</b> <br/>            It is always known that cleanliness is next to godliness and health is wealth Good health is achieved if there is good management of the environment. <br/>            The need for a good management of the environment cannot be over emphasized since there is a continuing environmental decay as a result of increased urbanization. <br/>            Pollution is a major problem of urbanization of which most of the causes have been identified as industrial combustion, solid waste generation, oil spillage disposal etc. since these causes are inevitable; there is need for a good control of them. In this project there will be a critical look at solid waste management situation with special focus on Ogbete main market Enugu.        <br/>            The project, which is required for the attainment of ND programme, will be divided into five chapters. <br/>            The chapter one, which is the introductory part of the project, the statement of the problem is intended to be those associated with solid waste management problems, which may include health hazard, ditty environment, blockage of drainage system etc. In the main study, all those problems will be discussed intensively.<br/>            The purpose of this project which will be treated in the main project will center on identifying the importance of such management and all the various strategies of checking excessive solid waste generation and management in the market in particular and Enugu city in general. <br/>            The background and need for the study will focus on past experiences of solid waste of management and problems associated with it so as to know how to improve subsequent situation.

These are expected to be extracted from library and other sources.<br/>            The chapter three will deal mainly on research methodology and design. Here the sources of data i.e. Primary and secondary sources will be highlighted.<br/>            Primary sources have to do with questionnaires, direct interview etc which secondary sources have to do with information from libraries, books, journals and magazine etc. Some statistical models such as bar chart, pie chart, and histogram will be used to present this data in a specific manner.  <br/>            The chapter four has to do with data presentation and analysis. Here field data collected are analysis and presented in a format to achieve analytical conclusion.

This phenomenon is predicted on her over increasing population complied with sophistication in taste and demand for domestic and industrial goods by her urban population. The uncontrolled generation and disposal of these wastes have deteriorated our otherwise conducive urban environment. Virtually all cities in Nigeria are characterized by helps or mounting of solid wastes. The health implications of this development on our urban streams, health and socio-economic development leave much to be desired. <br/>The realization of good health, hygiene and sustainable development in any society is practically impossible when pollution by way of solid wastes impact strongly on hers socio – economic, cultural and environmental settings. <br/>Policy markers, leaders of though and political office holders are daily confronted with endemic problems of what to do with mounting heaps of solid wastes in our urban environment. Many choice properties by virtue of their proximity to dump sites have deteriorated significantly and this has serious negative effect on their rental and capital values. <br/>The present scenario depicts a state hopeless as virtually all Agencies of government entrusted with managing the wastes especially ENSEPA seems to be at cross road on what to do.       <br/>1.1       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS <br/>Solid waste management is a very difficult task, as we all know. It creates a lot of problems to people which include:- drainage blockage (flooding), traffic jam, health hazard and unsightly environment. <br/>In addition, environmental pollution in urban centers due to solid wastes is a matter of serious concern to the international community, for pollution in any form interferes with our good chain, health, comfort, amenities, properties values and living standards. <br/>Today, all businesses are affected by both environmental changes and government effort towards controlling these changes. <br/>1.2       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY      <br/>The main purpose of this study is to access solid waste situation in the citizen of Nigeria, more especially in Ogbete main market Enugu. More over the research aims at finding out what should be done in order to reduce the health hazards and of the increasing menace of solid wastes in our market and cities.     <br/>1.3       BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR THE STUDY <br/>Urbanization, which is the purpose of people’s aggregation in cities, has witnessed tremendous increase in recent times. Most cities now in Nigeria have grown to full-scale urban status. The implications of urbanization is manifested in the areas of unemployment, inadequate social amenities due to undue pressures on the available ones by teaming population, increase in crime wave, sophistication and changes in demand and taste complied with high consumption on industrial and domestic goods leading to large volumes of solid wastes. <br/>The presence of the solid wastes in our city environment without effective waste collection and disposal machinery has left most of these cities in solided state and their implications on the health of urban. It leaves much to be desired hence the need for this study. <br/>1.4       THEORETICAL FOUNDATION OF THE STUDY <br/>This study is based ion W. Wilkie, Jodan’s Topical hygiene and sanitation theory, which state “that the collection and disposal of refuse and waste matter is any integral part of effective sanitation exercise. <br/>From the above view and theory, any effective waste management packaged for proper address of our solid waste hydra headed problems benefit all individual main market. <br/>1.5              RESEARCH QUESTION <br/>The following research questions wee formulated to guide the study. These include: <br/>1.                  How do you dispose your solid waste? <br/>2.                  Are there any waste bins in your shops? <br/>3.                  How often is waste evacuated from your day? <br/>4.                  Do you sort your waste before disposal? <br/>5.                  Are there sufficient equipment and manpower?<br/>6.                  Are the storage, collection and transportation in Ogbete main market dumps from individual shops?  <br/>7.                  How far are waste dumps from individual shops? <br/>1.6              SCOPE OF STUDY <br/>The study is therefore restricted to solid waste management in Ogbete main market. The scope of study is created into two sections:-   <br/>a.                   Delimitation <br/>b.                  Limitation <br/>1.7       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>1.                  The major significance of this study is that it will help in no small measure to maintain efficient and effective waste management system of the study area. <br/>2.                  Furthermore, it will help in improving the environmental condition of Ogbete main market. <br/>3.                  The findings of this study will also form the basis for further investigations in this study area. <br/>4.                  Finally, it will help in the prevention, reduction and control of the disease associated with solid wastes and food poisoning. <br/>1.8       OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY <br/>For effective coverage of this research it is divide into five (5) chapters made up as follows: <br/>Chapter one deals with the statement of the problem, purpose of the study, background and need for the study, the theoretical foundation of the study, research question, scope of study, significance of the study and overview of the study. <br/>Chapter two is the literature review.

This phenomenon of decay is manifested more on the structures and is characterized by acute shortages with demand always more than supply.  These result to cover crowding and rapid increase in rent levels. As a result of this, the urban poor who cannot afford the rent of decent structure is forced to live in shanty structures, thus the development of slum.<br/>        Other social factors which triggers urban decay includes poor sanitary conditions, congestion and the general inadequacies of social services like water and electricity supplies recreational centres, health centres and so on.  According to Okeke D-C 2002, available facilities deteriorate fast and decay sets in due to over use, poor usage performance, lack of maintenance etc.<br/>        Urban renewal scheme have continued to make massive impact in the improvement of urban slum in may parts of the World   (Anota, 1982). Urban renewal in its broadcast meaning is a form of reciperating change in the physical city by which the wornout or out modeled structures and facilities in an area are replaced in response to pressure of economic and social change.  Agreeing to this, Chapin 1965 therefore sees urban renewal as a process that has been going on as long as cities have existed.<br/>        Urban Renewal strategies include that comprehensive clearance/ redevelopment, the rehabilitation and the conservation approach.  They can be used singly or in combination of one or two considering some criteria.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS<br/>The truth is that there is no town that has not its own share of problems.  In Nigerian, towns and cities are characterized by many problems. In Anambra State in general and Okpoko layout in Particular, one seems not notice that environmental degradation is the order to living.  The area is characterized by poor quality housing unmaintained streets, poor drainage systems and the absence or lack of public services and facilities.<br/>        One of the major problems facing this community is the problem of poor road network. As a result of road network problem is the non mechanized road where passengers as well because of numerous pot holes.  Such factors and its combination results to high rate of transportation and constant hold ups. The present administration in Anambra State is really doing something about this problem.<br/>        Another major problem facing Okpoko is lack basic infrastructural facilities and social utilities.  For example, open space which is a major facility in an urban area is not provided, the few place that were mapped out for an open space is used as a refuse dump.<br/>        Presently, the Anambra environmental Protection Agency (ANSEPA) is working so hard to make Anambra State as a whole, clean.<br/>        Another major problem of the study area that will be death with is housing, condition. Housing conditions will be groped into Good, fair and poor housing conditions according to some criteria.<br/>1.2    RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>What is the general conditions of building in the study area?<br/>What is the population structure and characteristics of Okpoko?<br/>What is the general conditions of infrastructural facilities and social services in the study area?<br/>What ratio of car ownerships are there in the area?<br/>What is the income level educational level of Okpoko inhabitants?<br/>1.3    AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The aim of this study is to examine the general living conditions as well as assessing the basic conditions social services and infrastructural facilities of Okpoko with a view of making appropriate propovals of renewal strategies/ programmes that will provide decent living condition for the people.<br/>        The objectives of the study includes:<br/>To address the problems of shortage of houses in Okpoko through renewal strategies by providing more housing units for the inhabitants of the study area.<br/>To examine the environmental conditions, conditions improving them through renewal strategies.<br/>To examine the populations structure of Okpoko inhabitants.<br/>1.3       RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS <br/>This is drawn in relation to the objectives.  Thus:<br/>H0:    There is no significance relationship between the population of Okpoko residents and the general conditions of the basic social services and facilities.<br/>HI:    There is a significant relationship between the population of Okpoko residents and the general condition of the basic social services and facilities in Okpoko.<br/>1.5    KEY VARIABLES <br/>In testing the above hypothesis, the dependent variable “Y” which is the condition of the basic social services and facilities depends on the independent variable “X” which is the population characteristics of the study are.<br/>1.6       JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY  <br/>From the planning point of view, the study is of great significance because it identifies the causes of urban decay and make proposal for its elimination or alleviation.  The study area, Okpoko to the precise is faced with the problems of overcrowding, over use of existing social services and community facilities, obsolent and sub-standard buildings.  Thus, the justification of this study is the propose a compressive approach for the alleviation of slum and the creation of an environment that is void of pollution, untidiness and eyesore.<br/>1.6       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY  <br/>A study on urban Renewal for Onitsha with a particular reference to Okpoko in Ogbanu local Government Area, Anambra State is of immense importance for planning purposes, academic purposes, and developmental purposes.  Such research as this can enlighten the government, students, lecturer, and researchers on what could be obtained in Okpoko.<br/>        Such result can be information as well as education not just for the government but also for urban and regional planner who may apply the lesion and finding on their planning programme.<br/>1.7       SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>For the purpose of this project and the time framework, this dissertation will be based on the housing conditions, transportation network, basic social services and infrastructural facilities obtainable in Okpoko.<br/>1.8       OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS <br/>The most research work, a lot of terminologies and / or professional jargons are often used to achieve comprehensive understanding of the work.<br/>Definition of terms in this sense becomes imperative more so when one considers the fact that the readers on such works might have their professional orientation in their disciplines. Such terms therefore, requires special definitions to give a clear cut meaning with regards to the context in which they are applied.<br/>        In this work, the terms “urban’, Urban renewal’ ‘strategy” , ‘upgrading”, ‘blight”, “slum’ , neighbourhood” conveys specific meanings.  These are stated here under to avoid confusion while going through the work.<br/>URBAN<br/>Though, there is no agreement among experts as the most appropriate definition of what constitutes an urban area.  However, a more summarized definition of the term which suites out purpose here is that given by Mabogunje (1963), Using population index as a base, he definition an “urban” as any compact settlement with a population of 20,000 or more, which in addition will have to posses those other attributes of urban area such as large densely built up area, heterogeneity of population, specialization of economic activities and large portion of population in  non agricultural pursuits, sophisticated way of life much dives from rural norms and independent government within a large policy.<br/>URBAN RENEWAL <br/>        The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English defined “renewal as to given new life and freshness.  The Chambers 20th Century Dictionary sees renewal as a process of renovating, transforming to new life, reviving, beginning again, making again, restoring, regenerating etc<br/>        Synthesizing the two terms, “urban” and “renewal” urban renewal has therefore been described as a deliberate effort to change the environment through planned large scale of existing areas to meet present and future requirements for urban living and working (Grebler, 1965).<br/>STRATEGY<br/>The term “strategy’ as used here is a denoted plan of action for solving planning problems in our urban areas.<br/>URGRADING<br/>        This is used in this work to mean raising the status, quality, value etc of the living conditions of the urban or city.<br/>BLIGHT<br/>        The work ‘blight” is a term used to denote the deteriorating conations which have been renewed.  It is specifically referred to the deterioration of a dwelling unit below acceptable standard.<br/>SLUM<br/>According to the United States Housing Act of 1937, slum in defined as a an area where dwellings, predominate which by reason of dilapidation overcrowding, faulty, arrangement  or design, lack of ventilation, poor sanitation conditions, or any combinations of these factors is detrimental to the safety, health, welfare or morals of the people.<br/>NEIGHBOURHOOD<br/>Neighbourhood here implies a residential layout within an urban setting in which the resident have common and convenient access to a number of public services and facilities such as schools, plarygroudns, shopping centre etc. The development layout of this idea was first put forward by Clearance Perry (1910) which he explained in detail in one of his works.  “a neighbourhood is a primary school district.<br/><br/>\n\nHOUSING CONDITIONS AND OCCUPANCY RATION IN OKPOKO URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING \r\nCASE STUDY ENUGU STATE UNIVERSITY\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " HOUSING CONDITIONS AND OCCUPANCY RATION IN OKPOKO URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING \r\nCASE STUDY ENUGU STATE UNIVERSITY\r\n", "id": 134}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE EFFECT OF COMMERCIAL LAND USE ON AND VALUE <br/>A CASE STUDY OF OGUI URBAN <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            Land use can be described as a way, manner or older in which land is used by people in an area for different purposes. Commercial land itself is one set aside the local authority for legal economic activities and business transactions. It account for by far the largest proportion of the total area that has more economical value.     <br/>            Commercial activity is one of the indices for appraising urbanization provision of commercial land for such activities of Ogui – urban become very important as the population of Ogui urban grew and this in turn affects the value of land. This effect t of commercial land and it’s concomitant effect on the land values are the main text of this paper. <br/>            This research embodied the documentation and analysis of such relevant factors as prices of commercial lands passing in Ogui – urban respectively. Was analysed in graph form and in turn determines the effect of commercial land use on land value which is the main problem of this reseach solving. The result proved that there was a positive affect on well used and planned commercial lands and reactive effect on the unplanned. Good planning and monitoring was recommended. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT <br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>1.0              Introduction <br/>1.1       Historical background <br/>1.2              Geographical problem <br/>1.3              Objectives of study <br/>1.4              Scope of study <br/>1.5              Limitation of study <br/>CHAPTER TWO <br/>2.0              Literature Review<br/>2.1       Introduction <br/>2.2              What is land <br/>2.3              Land use plan n Enugu<br/>2.4              Commercial land use <br/>2.5               Classification of commercial land use <br/>2.6              Nature of commercial land use <br/>2.7              Factors that affect land value <br/>2.8              Effect of commercial land use on land value <br/>2.9              Distinction of important terms <br/>CHAPTER THREE <br/>3.0              Research methodology <br/>3.1       Introduction <br/>3.2              Research design <br/>3.3              Source of data <br/>3.4              Primary source <br/>3.5              Secondary source <br/>3.6              Population and sampling size <br/>3.7              Data collection techniques <br/>3.8              Data analysis and presentation technique <br/>CHAPTER FOUR      <br/>4.0              Data presentation and analysis <br/>4.1       Introduction <br/>4.2              Presentation <br/>4.3              Central business district <br/>4.4              Edimbug<br/>4.5              Average percentage of sampled commercial land in Ogui urban <br/>4.6              Conclusion  <br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>5.0              Findings, recommendation and conclusion <br/>5.1       Findings <br/>5.2              Recommendation <br/>5.3              Conclusion <br/>LIST OF TABLES <br/>Table 1:           Monetary value trend and sampled commercial land in the central <br/>business district (4.03) <br/>Table 2:           Monetary value trend on sampled commercial land in Edinburgh (4.04) <br/>Table 3:           Recharge percentages of sampled commercial land in the     Central Business District and Edinburgh in Ogui urban (4.05) <br/>  LIST OF FIGURE <br/>Figure 1.          Graphs showing the monetary value of sampled commercial lands in the central business district <br/> Figure 2:          The land use map of Central business district of Ogui urban <br/>Figure 3;          Graphs showing the monetary value of sampled commercial lands in Edinburgh in Ogui – Urban <br/>Figure 4:          Proposed urban land use plan of Enugu <br/>Figure 5:          Map showing the central business district in Enugu  <br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>1.0              INTRODUCTION<br/>Land is a national endowment that can be referred to as the said portion of the earth’s surface, while land use can be described as a way, manner or order in which land is used by people in an area for deterrent purposes. <br/>This rings about the need for the demand of commercial land acquisition for economic and business transaction.      <br/>Ogui urban is located in the capital city of Enugu state and has a typical urban environment, which is surrounded by major roads  and towns some at which include Oni – Asata, Holy Ghost, Ziks Avenue, Okpara Avenue and so on therefore making it accessible for which ever kind of business transaction. As a result, investors tend to exploit commercial land around these areas, which include, ………… artisan, Edinburgh, independence layout new layout, onu-Asata, Obiagu etc. The unique attract a lot of investors who in turn refuse to abide to the enforced planning laws by the central authority.      <br/>In offer words, value in basic economics is detained as the utility or satisfaction which a good or seminar offers for the purpose of this write piece, value mean the worth of an interest in a land or building. <br/>Land use in Enugu was proposed earlier when Enugu was under Anambra state and the use of commercial lands by investors was properly monitored and up till date it is still being monitored but not effective like it used to be in the case investors who migrated into others areas that were not commercial proposed areas tailed to accept the fact that those areas were not purposively commercial proposed areas but were to support commercial activities. This therefore became a treat to the individuals residing in those areas. Ogui urban is a typical example of these areas. This work is to demonstrate the effects of commercial land use on land value, and I intend to sow this in this work piece.       <br/>1.1       HISTORICAL BACKGROUND<br/>            Ogui urban is located in the capital city of Enugu state. She deviated from the Affar and got her first paramount Chief in the person of late Chief Augustine Nnamanni who died on the 30th day of October 1993. Ogui did have any chief until 2002 the chief was sworn in he was Chief Oko Michael Mmaduekwe. <br/>            Ogui became or got her autonomous community on the 12th day of July 2003. Her culture in enriched with different dances and masquerade. Ogui urban is made up of five villages they include Umuokokwette, Umuabu, Onuatu Onu Asala and Onyke with two local government the Enugu North and the Enugu Central North. <br/>            She shares a common boarder with her brother Abakpa Nike along the presidential road while the original Ogui dweller reside at Umunevo village. Now a town that accommodate a lot of investors and visitor and student.        <br/>1.2       GEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEM <br/>            For a long time now; it has been recorded that investors face the problem of investing blinding without knowing the effect on the land value. <br/>            They do not know the effect of commercializing a land set out for federal values. As such most investors abuse the constitutional provision for land value and in time to come they will be victimized by the execution of government plan on an exploited land. <br/>            The level of indiscriminate dumping of refuse that brings about environmental bleeder, the congestion of planned building by investors allowing space for the major road and eating into part of the pedestrian path. <br/>            The increase in the movement of investors accommodates the vandalization of electrical cables, blocking of drainages with refuses.      <br/>1.3              OBJECTIVE OF STUDY <br/>The aim of this research is to make the government the land use allocation authority and the private investor, realize the effect of commercial land use on land value in Ogui urban. <br/>1.4              SCOPE OF STUDY <br/>The development of Ogui Nike was divided into two stages “urban Ogui and Rural” <br/>Ogui at the moment rural – Ogui has suffered trickling development while the urban Ogui has been effectively development. <br/>The urban Ogui include the control business district (Atesian, Ogbetle) this scope in focused mainly on the effect of commercial land use.  <br/>1.5              LIMITATION OF STUDY <br/>This research work is limited to some extent by the inconsistency of records as the urban and regional planning authority of Ogui. Some of the officials were not always available to provide or give out the necessary map diagram. It was also limited to some extent by inadequacy of finance.    <br/> SCOURS OF DATA <br/>Data used for this study were obtained from both primary and secondary source primary data were obtained by filed survey while the secondary data were procured from previous relevant literatures, textbooks, published and unpublished journals and very good students from Ogui – urban who gave the researcher the historical background of the study area. Also maps were gotten from the town-planning officer.   <br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF COMMERCIAL LAND USE ON AND VALUE \r\nA CASE STUDY OF OGUI URBAN \r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF COMMERCIAL LAND USE ON AND VALUE \r\nA CASE STUDY OF OGUI URBAN \r\n", "id": 135}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>RATING ADMINISTRATION IN NIGERIA <br/>(A CASE STUDY OF NNOBI IN IDEMILI SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA IN ANAMBRA STATE) <br/>ABSTRACT</b> <br/>            Property rating in Nigeria is a major contribution of knowledge in the area of rating administration in Nigeria has not been accorded the priority it deserves as an important item of re  venue for local government authorities which rely mainly on funds from the federation account. <br/>            In developed countries of the world, local government authorities depend to a large extent on the revenue from property rating to finance their programmers. <br/>            Because most local governments are cash strapped and indigent.

In Nigeria the owners of landed property are taxed while in the United Kingdom the occupiers are taxed. <br/>The purpose of rating valuation is to arrive at a figure termed ratable value on which rates are levied upon the rate payer at so much in the naira in order to defray the expenses of the local government. <br/>In Nigeria proceeds from property rates are expected to be used for specific projects like water supply, refuse disposal, street lighting community halls, roads and markets and maintenance of infrastructural facilities at local levels. <br/>This thesis aims at reviewing rating administration in Nnobi, in Idemili South local government area in Anambra State. <br/>1.2              BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>It was difficult not to see the local government groaning under it liabilities while little or nothing was coming in from the Federal and State government the fourth Republic took a turn for the worse for local governments with the zero allocation syndromes. It behooves local governments; therefore generate their own revenue to maintain their sustainability. <br/>This study looks into the present system of administration of property rating in local government. <br/>1.3              STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>A study of this nature can be all encompassing but this particular one seeks to look at all the statements made in favour and against property rating in Nnobi Idemili South Local Government Area. <br/>Supporters of the system say administration and implementation has been the bane of its failure. <br/>The unsatisfactory state of affairs is looked at to improve on this service. The problems I wish to solve in this research work are:- <br/>i.                    Personnel problems <br/>ii.                  Ignorance and landlord’s absenteeism<br/>iii.                Lack of adequate materials <br/>iv.                Lack of proper records <br/>v.                  Lack of interest towards Rating <br/>vi.                Poor Street naming and housing numbering. <br/>1.4       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY    <br/>1.         To examine the administration machinery in Idemili South Local Government Area.<br/>2.         To make comparative analysis of the revenue sources in Idemili South Local Government Area with other local government areas. <br/>3.         To evaluate the performance of the rating system and practice, and see if it can be make better. <br/>4.         To make recommendations as to better ways of administering property rating.  <br/>5.         The procedure for the implementation of rating the system. <br/>6.         To identify some of the problems that are militating against effective and efficient property rating in Idemili South Local Government Area.   <br/>1.5      SCOPE OF STUDY <br/>This study is a result of the inspection of hereditament in three of the fourteen (14) zones in Idemili South Local Government Area.<br/>For cost and time constrains, a sample of the three zones covered the fourteen is taken as a guide in the analysis of the revenue pattern of Idemili south Local Government Area better machinery has been put in place to collect the rate. As the dividends of democracy began to reach the people in the form of good roads, electricity supply, security, etc. the property owners/occupier are normally compelled to pay their rates. <br/>Without rating administration there will be problems on arriving at a figure termed to be levied on people. <br/>1.6      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY   <br/>This study will highlight grounds for reforms in current property rating administration system in the state. <br/>It will also advice on how to make the system and practices of property rating in Idemili south Local Government Area. <br/>More effective and efficient and eliminate the current dependence on Federal Allocation which these days are unreliable and insufficient. <br/>Idemili South local Government Authority in particular and other local government departments charged with rating administration responsibility are equally to benefit from this study.      <br/><br/><br/>\n\nRATING ADMINISTRATION IN NIGERIA \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF NNOBI IN IDEMILI SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA IN ANAMBRA STATE) \r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RATING ADMINISTRATION IN NIGERIA \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF NNOBI IN IDEMILI SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA IN ANAMBRA STATE) \r\n", "id": 136}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>A CRITICAL EXAMINATION ON LAND USE AND ALLOCATION PROCEDURE<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF OWERRI)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>        The aim of this project is to examine and evaluate the physical, social and economic effects of the present location of land use activities the Owerri Urban and recommend solution to the problems identified.

This growth has been accompanied with an ever increasing physical social and the technological changes as well as complex Urban Pattern of development.<br/>This fast development with its attendant sprawling effects on the original settlement and town out skirted always cause some land use congestion. Personal and political pressures etc. within and around the area involved.<br/>In 1976, Owerri became the capital of the then creates Imo State. Almost immediately,  the original settlement which were more or less residential / agricultural areas became engulfed with the fast sprawling development in Owerri.<br/>However the morphology of these land activities in the area was observed not be the function of only the original settlement patten, but also a function of the government policies so in relation to the development of the area. These policies so in relation to the development of the area. These policies and their subsequent implementation in no small measure, contributed to the Owerri Urban with their resultant effects on the indigenous other inhabitants of the area, as the existing facilities in the area. <br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>The main problem of this study was to examine and evaluate the physical, social and economic effect of land use activities in its present location in Owerri Urban and recommend solution to the problems identified, because there has been series of criticism against the manner by which land was allocated to people in Owerri Urban <br/>1.3    AIM AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>This research work aimed towards recognizing the existing land use situation in Owerri Urban and thus high lighting the implications and results of previous development programmes and their implications. This will then severs as basis for formulating a more functional and efficient planning programmes for the area. <br/>THE OBJECTIVES ARE<br/>1.     To evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the allocation procedures.<br/>2.     To identified the achievements and shortcoming of the procedure.<br/>2.     To suggest possible means of implementing better land used and allocation procedure.<br/>1.4       POSSIBLE RESEARCH HYPOTHESES <br/>The postulation of this study was that conflicts of interest often arise between political planners and the physical planners in the planning and executive of land use activities therefore and allocation procedure in Owerri is defective. <br/>1.5    RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY <br/>In this study, case study research method was to be used. Important information were get through the use of primary and secondary sources like interviews questionnaires observation, journals and books on related topic. These will be distributed to Estate surveyors, lawyers, town planners, civil servants and residents of government layout. Data collected will be analyzed statistically with percentage and chi – square..<br/>1.7    SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY <br/>The significance of study was to serve as a guide to land experts v12 Estate surveyors, lawyers etc. on the land for efficient utilization of the available land in Owerri urban. It will also help in educating the public.

A property manger gets involved with managerial problem solving and decision making. He also performs several activities and tasks involving planning, organising, directing and controlling with respect to the portfolio of real estate assets being managed on behalf of his clients.<br/>This is important since one of the features of real property that distinguishes it from other investment media is its requirement to be managed.<br/>Because of the increasing pace of technological development or innovations resulting particularly in the construction of high rise and high technological structures in our cities, there is need for a trained manager who is able to cope effectively and efficiently with management problems arising from the latter.<br/>Multi – tenanted properties such as office blocks and residential houses present the greatest management challenge to the surveyor.<br/>The author’s experience of non-challant attitude of a good number of property investors regarding the management of the property prompted the choice of this topic<br/>1.2       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY  <br/>The study will examine the problems of property management, and proffer solutions towards rectifying these problems<br/>1.3       SCOPE <br/>This project will be limited to a few selected property in Abuja metropole, which includes.<br/>1.                  Shelter House<br/>2.                  Alaji M.D. shitus property on Plot 801 Malumfashi Close Area 11, Gariki Abuja<br/>3.                  C.O.C. Enterprises property in Karmo, Abuja<br/>4.                  Mrs. Nwankwo’s property on Plot 118 Tunis Street Zone 6 Wuse, Abuja<br/>1.4       STUDY METHODOLOGY  <br/>This study is based on data collected by the following methods<br/>1.                  Primary method<br/>2.                  Secondary method<br/>Primary Method:      Primary data collection involves the distribution of questionnaires among some practicing Estate surveyor value’s as well as some land lords.<br/>It involves the personal interview of professional.<br/>Secondary Method:   Secondary data are those collected from previously published works (e.g.) Journals, newspapers, magazines etc.<br/>1.5       DEFINTIION OF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT <br/>Michael Thorncraft defined property management as the direction and  supervision of an interest in landed property with the aim of securing the optimum return. This return, which may not always be financial may also be in the form of social benefit, status, prestige, political strength etc.<br/>John P. Macey and  Charles Baker defined property management as the application of skill in caring for property. Its surrounding and amenities, and in developing a sound relationship between tenants themselves, in order that the Estate, as well as t he individual house may give the fullest value to both the land lord and the tenants, from the land lords point of view it is desirable that the property should be efficiently and economically maintained and managed as much as possible, while from the tenants point of view, the house should provide a home, the focal point of full and happy life for the family. <br/>1.6       PROPERTY MANAGEMENT APPROACH <br/>There are two types of property management approaches used in this study.<br/>(i)                 Active management approach<br/>(ii)               Passive management approach <br/>Active management approach: This type of management encompasses both long term and short time strategies. This involves constant attempt by the property manager is involved in all issues concerning improvement maintenance, repairs, conversion, extension, of e property etc. The advantage of this system of management is that it enables the property manager to be aware of all problems concerning the property. Since his attention is required at any time matters regarding the property comes up. This provides him with an opportunity to asses the state of the property and determine all necessary actions needed t obtain maximum return.<br/>            It also makes it possible for the manger to detect defects, and remedy them at an early stage to prevent it from degenerating into a more complex one, there by prolonging the life of the property.<br/>Passive Management Approach<br/>            This is a system of management where the manager takes little or no part in the management of the property.<br/>            This approach has a disadvantage especially in a situation where the tenant exhibits a non – chalalant attitude towards the maintenance of he property, the property manager may also loose grip of what goes on in ht e property and may discover the damage done to the property when it is already later and require more funds to undertake repairs. <br/><br/>\n\nPROBLEMS OF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND SOLUTIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS OF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND SOLUTIONS", "id": 138}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>RURAL MANAGEMENT AS A STRATEGY FOR REDUCING RURAL – URBAN MIGRATION IN NIGERIA <br/>(A CASE STUDY OF ISHIELY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EBONYI STATE)<br/>ABSTRACT</b> <br/>Rural resources have a lot of potential which needed to be brought into full production as to uplift the values. These values can only be achieved when other resources like times, money, infrastructure, expertise an d the like are applied. The high demand of products is expected to propel the application of the said resources into maximum production which in turn increase the value of rural environment, confirming value to be a function of profit.<br/>Unfortunately, government policies and programmes in the year past failed to reflect the need for balance rural and urban development. Thus, most development polices and programmes are urban – oriented. As a result rural dwellers have been subjected to poverty, unemployment, poor infrastructure, economic and social defects.

With an estimated current population of over nine hundred and twenty four thousand (924, 000) square kilometers, Nigeria is easily the most populous in African and one of the largest in terms of geographical area. About seventy percent of the population depend on agricultural activities for their livelihood and live in rural communities.<br/>Currently, over forty million out of the total population of over one hundred million people live in urban area. Therefore, the rural area within the geographic entity of the country is whereby majority of the population is found.<br/>Some of the government officials fear of the belief held that urban areas constitute the development potential of the state, the rural areas, have been neglected in terms of development opportunities.<br/>Following the moribund attitudes that existed  in the rural areas the rural dwellers are attracted to the urban areas to benefits from better paying jobs qualitative supply of basic amenities, highs level of commercial, recreational and industrial activities. Arising from the rapid. Urban population growth and physical expansion are very serious physical planning problem such as poor physical layout like Ajegunle, Gwagwa,, Abakpa in Lagos, Abuja, Abakalike and Enugu respectively. Also in the list include mass transit problem inadequate supply of housing, water and other basic social services.<br/>Hence, it is expected that various governments policy maker rural dwellers, planning team and the general public should involve in harnessing the capture and build in preference of the rural dwellers at anytime.<br/>1.1       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>Generally in Nigerian, there have been uneven development and glaring inequality of opportunities between the rural and urban area. In spite of the fact that the majority of Nigerian are rural dwellers rural areas still have little or no opportunities for education and employment. No doubt rural areas in Nigeria are characterized by poverty, malnutrition, poor communication, illiteracy unproductive agriculture with the use of traditional implement, general low per capital income. Also includes lack of health facilities, public electricity, borne whole water and motorable roads which hinder them from evacuating foods and industrial raw materials.<br/>Rural development proper should module all and sundry, unfortunately lack of sufficient fund for progamme execution, high cost of building materials and labour, failure to incorporate people affected in planning and in more serious note, the rural dwellers level of understanding is too low that instead of attracting government attention by initiating a project, they expect the government to do every thing for them which is impossible. All these factors problems act as a push against the rural dwellers in the study area to the urban areas, where they can enjoy social amenities and infrastructure such as water supply, electricity, health facilities, tarred roads, and abundant job opportunities. At the end of this study, we shall know how the rural development can be effective means (strategy) for reducing rural – urban migration in Nigerian generally and Ishielu Local Government Area of Ebonyi State particular. The preceding sentence, therefore, form the focus of this research. <br/>1.2       AIMS OF OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>Maris system of life is dynamic coupled with his insatiable nature which demands better food, shelter and clothes. These are usually achieved through verity of good jobs efficient use of human and natural resources.<br/>The extensive area of land in the rural area can be put to various industrial and agricultural activities, thereby improving the lots of rural dwellers and urban dweller alike Agriculture provide us with food, medicine, firewood, timber and other raw material to the industries as well as employment and foreign exchange. Unfortunately the rural dwellers and farmers which constitute the largest population in the rural areas have not been properly taken care as regards development and as a result the rural dwellers rush to the urban areas to find alternative jobs and social amenities that abound in the urban areas.<br/>This study therefore, is aimed at carrying out a research as follows <br/>(i)                 To identify rural development programmes /projects available in the study area.<br/>(ii)               To identity reasons/factors responsible for rural – urban migration.<br/>(iii)             To examine the extent of rural urban – migration.<br/>(iv)             To suggest and make feasible  recommendation on reducing migration in the study area. <br/>1.3       BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR THE STUDY <br/>The advent of civilization brought about urbanization or urban settlement. Civilization is the climax of man’s inventions as a means of raising his standard of living. Man believes in hedonism and indeed obtain much pleasure in the company of other fellow men. No doubt, this is why if one had to give one word the raison d’etre for a city it would surely be “communicated”. People come together in cities to be able to communicate person to person, person to firm person to government.<br/>In the pre-history of urban evolution when technology was large and archaic, people had to search for fertile lands for abundant for harvest. These fertile land occurred in Abakaliki division now in  Ebonyi State. Settlements in these areas were promoted as a result of fertile land. The oldest organized settlement known today as the cradle of civilization such as settlement at alluvial plains of Rive Nile, Tigris, Euphrates, Indus and Yangtze – kiang were equally as a result of fertile land.<br/>The discovering of limestone and the establishment of Cement Company at Nkalagu in Ishielu Local Government Area in 1957 attracted many investors and offered employment to the people. During this era there were considerable notice of immigrants in Nkalagu and its neighbouring communities. As a result of failure of the cement company to produce satellite town thereby extending its social amenities to the surrounding communities, the dwellers in the said communities like Nkalagu, Amazu, Umuahuli, Nkalaha, Obeagu started rushing to the urban areas in middle seventies. It is at this period that rural urban – migration gathered much momentum in the study area.<br/>Generally, cities or urban areas apart from fertility of land discussed already started growing as a result of goods site for defence like Ibandan, mineral deposit such as in Enugu for Coal and Port Harcourt for crude oil, other include religious activities like Elele in Nigeria Jerusalem and Mecca. More recently, political tranquility influence of royal courts, holiday attraction and be antiful sceneries as well as economic activities, coastal orientation mineral deposit and traffic junction are the prevailing factors for the growing of cities. The level of standard of living which most of the cities or urban areas provide compel rural dwellers to more to urban areas and settle. It is in the light of rapid growth of urban over rural communities that form the bedrock of this study.<br/>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTION <br/>The following research questions were formulated to guide the study.<br/>(i)                 What kind of rural development programmes/projects are being / have been executed in your rural area?<br/>(ii)               Does lack of integrated rural development responsible for rural – urban migration in your area or not?<br/>(iii)             In what way(s) have the absence of integrated rural development affected the standard of living in your rural area?<br/>(iv)             In your own opinion what are the factors militating against rural development in your area?<br/>1.5              RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS <br/>HO       Lack of integrated Rural Development is not responsible for Rural – Urban migration.<br/>Hi        Lack of integrated Rural Development is responsible for Rural Urban Migration.<br/>1.6              SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>1.6.1        SCOPE<br/>This study concentrates more on the rural development as a strategy for reducing rural – urban migration in Nigeria with a particular reference to Ishielu Local Government Area of Ebonyi state.<br/>Ishielu local government area with Ezillo as its headquarters has a total population of one hundred and twenty eight thousand seven hundred and twenty persons according to the result of 1991 population census (see table I). The communities that form the local government area are as follows Agba, Amazu, Azumyaba, Ezillo, Ezzagu, Iyonu, Nkalagu, Nkalaha, other are Nkezi, Obeagu, Ohafia, Okpoto and Umunuali.<br/>1.7       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>This research is an attempt to highlight the various development imbalance existing in the rural and urban areas which resulted rural urban migration. The rapid acceleration of the urban areas as a matter of urgency need to be redressed through the propagation of well articulated rural development programmes or strategies. Therefore, the problem is on how to inculcate adequate planning development in rural areas to fit the overgrowing migratory demand without sacrificing any of the migrants motives and objectives.<br/>Rural dwellers seen to be most beneficiary, government and the general public will also in one way or the other be benefited, if my suggestions and recommendation are adhered to.<br/>1.8       THEORETICAL FOUNDATION OF THE STUDY <br/>1.8.1    ECONOMIC GROWTH MODEL AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT DUAL ECONOMY MODEL<br/>The dual economy model classifies the economy of less development countries in two. The modern sector and the subsistence section. These are also referred  to as  the urban and rural sector respectively (Olayide et al 1981). According to the model the modern (urban) sector is both capital and technological intensive which the subsistence (rural) sector is less capital intensive. The model believes that while the urban sector is market orientated, the rural sector produces for family consumption and relies on non-purchased inputs like labour and -----. The model accuses the rural sector of lack of savings and capital formation.<br/>The problems with this model is that its adoption as a development strategy will lead to outflow of resources from rural to the urban area. there will be a rural neglect which creates a gap in earning. Also there will be migration to cities and consequently unemployment and increased demand for urban social services like water, electricity and so on. Moreover thee is no economy where the rural sector is characterized by absence of saving and capital formation, rather savings are small. It assign a restrictive role to agriculture as a mean of providing cheap foods and raw materials for industrialization. That is the rural urban migration as a result of lack of saving and capital formatting in the rural areas.<br/>The congestion in the urban areas, unemployment and social are the out come of rural – urban migration which is brought about by the neglect of rural development. The government should realise that for a balance economic growth and development, the rural area have to be developed along side the urban areas. <br/>This models attempts to explain the existence of substantial productivity difference among farmers in the same economics and geographic region. The model attributes the difference in production to difference in the adoption of new varieties of seeds mechanical and chemical inputs, by farmers (Olayide et al 1981)<br/>This model of great relevance to rural development in the less developed countries like Nigeria. It introduces the idea of agricultural extension services, experimental stations and demonstration farms / farm settlements. <br/>The model of some relevance in the development of the study area. the idea of farms settlement and demonstration farm have been experimented upon in Ezillo community the headquarters of the study area.<br/>The problem associated with this model is that the same people are not willing to adopt modern method of farming and organization. They are skeptical about the use of fertilizer and insecticides due to ignorance in farming, there is the need to educate the farmer on the use and profitability of the new techniques. The works successfully where the farming population is educated and enlightened.<br/>1.8.3    BASIC RESOURCE  THEORY <br/>This theory state that economic growth and development depends on the availability of natural resource in a region. This model holds that the development of these resources attract investment capital to these areas and bring about increase in income and employment. One of the limitation of the theory is that mere availability of basic resources are not enough for economic growth to occur in a region. There has to be appropriate technology and expertise to exploit these resources.<br/>The relevance of this model in the study area n that the government should realised the need for education and man power training for a self – reliance and economic development. The dependence of imported machinery and equipment as well as the personnel to operate these equipment does not make for a self – reliance. This goes to show why in spite of abundant natural resources in the study area hunger and disease have continued  to threaten the survival of the rural population. The prices of locally produced goods have remained higher than their imported counterparts.<br/><br/>\n\nRURAL MANAGEMENT AS A STRATEGY FOR REDUCING RURAL - URBAN MIGRATION IN NIGERIA (A CASE STUDY OF ISHIELY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EBONYI STATE)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RURAL MANAGEMENT AS A STRATEGY FOR REDUCING RURAL - URBAN MIGRATION IN NIGERIA (A CASE STUDY OF ISHIELY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EBONYI STATE)", "id": 139}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PROBLEMS OF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND SOLUTIONS<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Property management is a vital aspect of read estate profession.

A property manger gets involved with managerial problem solving and decision making. He also performs several activities and tasks involving planning, organising, directing and controlling with respect to the portfolio of real estate assets being managed on behalf of his clients.<br/>This is important since one of the features of real property that distinguishes it from other investment media is its requirement to be managed.<br/>Because of the increasing pace of technological development or innovations resulting particularly in the construction of high rise and high technological structures in our cities, there is need for a trained manager who is able to cope effectively and efficiently with management problems arising from the latter.<br/>Multi – tenanted properties such as office blocks and residential houses present the greatest management challenge to the surveyor.<br/>The author’s experience of non-challant attitude of a good number of property investors regarding the management of the property prompted the choice of this topic<br/>1.2       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY  <br/>The study will examine the problems of property management, and proffer solutions towards rectifying these problems<br/>1.3       SCOPE <br/>This project will be limited to a few selected property in Abuja metropole, which includes.<br/>1.                  Shelter House<br/>2.                  Alaji M.D. shitus property on Plot 801 Malumfashi Close Area 11, Gariki Abuja<br/>3.                  C.O.C.

This return, which may not always be financial may also be in the form of social benefit, status, prestige, political strength etc.<br/>John P. Macey and  Charles Baker defined property management as the application of skill in caring for property. Its surrounding and amenities, and in developing a sound relationship between tenants themselves, in order that the Estate, as well as t he individual house may give the fullest value to both the land lord and the tenants, from the land lords point of view it is desirable that the property should be efficiently and economically maintained and managed as much as possible, while from the tenants point of view, the house should provide a home, the focal point of full and happy life for the family. <br/>1.6       PROPERTY MANAGEMENT APPROACH <br/>There are two types of property management approaches used in this study.<br/>(i)                 Active management approach<br/>(ii)               Passive management approach <br/>Active management approach: This type of management encompasses both long term and short time strategies. This involves constant attempt by the property manager is involved in all issues concerning improvement maintenance, repairs, conversion, extension, of e property etc. The advantage of this system of management is that it enables the property manager to be aware of all problems concerning the property. Since his attention is required at any time matters regarding the property comes up. This provides him with an opportunity to asses the state of the property and determine all necessary actions needed t obtain maximum return.<br/>            It also makes it possible for the manger to detect defects, and remedy them at an early stage to prevent it from degenerating into a more complex one, there by prolonging the life of the property.<br/>Passive Management Approach<br/>            This is a system of management where the manager takes little or no part in the management of the property.<br/>            This approach has a disadvantage especially in a situation where the tenant exhibits a non – chalalant attitude towards the maintenance of he property, the property manager may also loose grip of what goes on in ht e property and may discover the damage done to the property when it is already later and require more funds to undertake repairs. <br/>   <br/>\n\nPROBLEMS OF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND SOLUTIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS OF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND SOLUTIONS", "id": 140}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE ROLE OF CO-OPERATIVES SOCIETIES IN HOUSING DELIVERY <br/>(A CASE STUDY OF ENUGU STATE) <br/>ABSTRACT </b><br/>        A profession is a vocation whose practice is founded upon an understanding of the theoretical structure of some departments of learning and upon the capabilities accompanying such as understanding.

The operation of co-operative societies was first regulated by the coming into being of the co-operative societies ordinance of 1935. But even before the above stated period, there were successful attempts by indigenous groups at the traditionally styled co-operative societies commonly known as “Isusu”. The success of co operative in Nigeria is such that, by 1965 there were about 5,5000 co-operative societies with a total of 358,000 members. To further assist in the smooth operation of co- operatives, specialized banks have long been established across the country to cater for their banking needs. <br/>One school of thought said that a co-operative society is a group of people organized to provide housing to members of he group. The co-operative may cover financing of the project by group contribution actual participation. The government or any institution may provide finances and materials, while the individual member of the co-operative society will provide the labour. <br/>FUNCTIONS OF HOUSING CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES<br/>Provision of loans and credit facilities to member:<br/>Housing co-operative society links co-operative members to financial institutions. Banks government and other institution find it easier to deal with group interested in housing development instead of individual basis. The housing co-operative society scrutinizes individual members credit wordiness for housing loans negotiates better terms for loans and undertakes to generate such housing loans. Supervises or monitors the use of the housing loans/credit o avoid diversion, mismanagement or misapplication etc. in most cases, the problem is checked through the provision of building materials in kind to members by their housing co-operative society. <br/>ii.      Refund or Repayment of Housing Loans.                   <br/>Co-operative society involved in housing scheme ensures that loans credits with interest are timely repaid to financial institutions that made it available by members. The society ensures this through early notification of beneficiary member of the due/maturity date.    <br/>1.1    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>The housing problem in Nigeria is more pronounced in the urban areas, which have been growing in he member of housing units available for occupation. <br/>Low and middle-income earners constituting over 95% of urban work force wee the most affected. The role of housing co-operatives in housing delivery and established ways of using the co-operative societies to increase the number of residential houses for low and middle income dwellers in our urban center. The Nigeria building and road research those of its study institute (NBRRI) made in Nigeria a prototype houses that can be funded by urban housing co-operatives. <br/>The role of co-operative societies was first regulated by the member of the co-operative societies. The group forms what might be regarded as the traditional styled co-operative society commonly known as “Isusu”. <br/>May definition have been proffered for co-operative by scholars and researcher but perhaps the most encompassing is by Savage and Volkin (1965) which states that co-operative society is a voluntary contractual organization or persons having a mutual ownership interest in providing themselves a need service (s) on a non profit basis. In a co-operative, the investment and operational risk, benefits gained or losses incurred are shared equitably by its members in proportion to their use of the co-operative services. <br/>The definition applies generally to any co-operative society, but when a society serves the purpose of constructing owning managing dwelling and also for common and acquisition or for maintenance of completed houses, it can be refereed to a housing co-operative (Levin 1981). <br/>Some of the problems include<br/>1.           Galloping inflation, which led to every increase in price of building materials. <br/>2.           Low in disposable income available, its members to contribute.         <br/>3.           In adequate release of funds due to bottle need in the parent company by The National Housing Programme (NHP) 1994/95, imitated by the immediate paste minister of works/housing Alhaji (Dr) Lateef Kayode. <br/>1.2       BACKGROUND AND NEEDS FOR THE STUDY <br/>In most developed countries, the housing (shelter) sector contributes significantly to the performance of their economics. An increase in the housing market activities usually indicates a strong economy while a decrease in the market shows weakness in the economy. Most countries have often increased, investment in the housing sector as a way of boosting domestic economic growth, and as a tool to fight domestic recession. <br/>Over the past decade the potential of the housing sector in enhancing the social and economic development of developing countries have become very apparent. Housing construction is labour intensive. It creates employment, especially of unskilled and semi-skilled labour. The construction of low – income housing in particular, relies, most of its inputes on locally produced materials, while crating demand for other good and services. This is in addition to developing the necessary infrastructure required for economic expansion and healthy living environment of the people. <br/>However, the seeming intractability of the housing problem in Enugu shows clearly that as a state, we are yet to commit our selves to a purposeful and consistent housing delivery system. <br/>This is dispute the irritation and application of many innovative laws and policies at federal and state levels and the setting up of numerous agencies charged with the responsibilities of implementing various aspects of the national housing policy. The state earlier but federal and state government had established agencies and enacted legislation armed at establishing a sustainable basis for providing housing for low – income families in particular and other income groups. At the federal housing authority (FHA), the housing division of the federal ministry of works and housing (FMWH) and the urban development bank of Nigeria (UDBN) Plc have been established, similarly policies such as mortgage institutions Decree No 53 of 1992, urban and Regional Planning Decree, as well as the land use were enacted. At the state level, most have established, Housing Corporation, Housing development in ministries of works and housing and more recently, has come to the promulgation of rent edicts. However, despite all the effort, the housing problem has remained seemingly intractable.<br/>1.3       AIMS AN OBJECTIVES<br/>The aimed ways of using the co-operative to increase the number of residential house available for low and middle level income urban dwellers. The stated aim is to be achieved through the following objectives. <br/>1.   To highlight the advantages of housing co-operative based on self-help. <br/>2.   To study the low and middle level income earners responses to the idea of housing co-operatives.<br/>3.   To enumerate the various types of housing co-operatives and identify the one(s) most viable in Enugu. <br/>4.   To relative urban low and middle level income to appropriate proto type lowest residential accommodation that can be funded by the co-operatives and <br/>5.   To produce a useful data for the drafty of the proposed housing co-operative decree.      <br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>Government, in this project has tried to point out the enormity of housing facing Nigeria. It is in agreement with the fact that finance represents the hallmarks of an efficient housing policy. It also agreed that the current National Housing Policy is very comprehension enough to take the nation to year 2010, but with some modification. <br/>Effective housing finance coupled with sound management and cheap building material with undoubtedly help in the implementation of other aspects of the policy. <br/>The research has through this project highly lighted certain issues and problem that effects housing delivery general, and the disbursement of the national House Fund (NHF) in particular. The researcher is of the opinion that, if we channel all our efforts of the National housing Fund (NHF) will be more effective. <br/>Low – income earners. The development of local production of building materials has been examined in this project. It is geared towards achieving self-sufficiency in the materials, and bring them within the economic reach of most Nigeria the low income earners especially. The project takes an inclusive look at strategies of achieving this with the contention that the development of local production of building materials will significantly influence housing development. <br/>1.5       SCOPE OF STUDY <br/>Enugu the capital of Enugu state was chosen as case study. It focused on middle and low – income earners in Enugu East and Enugu West local government councils. <br/>Trans – Ekulu and Abakpa Housing Co-operation were chosen.   <br/>1.6       RESEARCH QUESTION <br/>1.           What are the advantages of housing co-operatives based on self –help. <br/>2.           How do the low and middle level income earners, respond to the idea of housing co-operatives.   <br/>3.           Relate the urban low and middle level income to appropriate profit types low cost residential accommodation that can be founded by co-operatives.  <br/>4.           What is the useful data for the drafting of proposed housing co-operative? <br/>1.7       DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>1.8.1 Low Income Group <br/>Low income group is defined as al wage earners and a self employed people whose annual income is five thousand naria (5, 000.00) or below as at 1988 or whose arrival income is 20% or below of the maximum annual income of the highest salary grade level within the civil service structure, which ever is high. <br/>1.8.2 Middle Income Group <br/>Middle-income group is also hereby defined as workers whose annuals income is above 20% and below 50% of the maximum annual income of the highest salary grade level.    <br/>1.8.3 Housing co-operative <br/>The definition of housing co-operative was agreed to be “a formal association of members physical, social and economic living condition, utilizing self – help principles.  <br/>1.8.3.1     The “PHYSICAL” aspects may include; Slum and squatter up grading programmes, site and services programme core housing project, home improvement, progrmmes or new construction on private land. <br/>1.8.3.2     The “SOCIAL” Components may be defined as community facilities and social activities, including such things as daycare centers, religious centers, school community centers, health, and sanitation facilities, communication and transportation network.    <br/>1.8.3.3     The “ECONOMIC” aspects may include building materials productions centers, employment generation activities, promotion of small and shopping areas (e.g. co-operative consumer stores).<br/>1.8.3.4     The “SELF - HELP” Part includes, but is not limited to self – construction or sweat equity. Also self – help encompasses a variety of beneficiaries impute such as participation, acting as the general contractor responsible for the hiring and managing of architects and small builders he reactivation and arrangements for service the exchange of labour and skills (mutual self –help) and the management of the co-operative it self through democratic process. <br/> <br/>\n\nTHE ROLE OF CO-OPERATIVES SOCIETIES IN HOUSING DELIVERY (A CASE STUDY OF ENUGU STATE) <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF CO-OPERATIVES SOCIETIES IN HOUSING DELIVERY (A CASE STUDY OF ENUGU STATE) ", "id": 141}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE ROLE OF FEDERAL MORTGAGE FINANCE LIMITED IN HOUSING FINANCE <br/>CASE STUDY THE FEDERAL MORTGAGE FINANCE LIMITED MAIDUGURI <br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>1.0       INTRODUCTION<br/>Shelter is universally accepted as a basic and second most essential human need coming next to food. However, housing in all ramifications is more than mere shelter since it embraces all the social services and utilities that goes to make a community or neighbourhood a liveable environment. In Nigeria, the problems of housing are enormous and complex, and effective solutions to them are yet to be found. The search however continues. It is in the process of this search that Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria was established under FMBN Decree Number 7 of 1977 as fully owned Federal Government Housing Development Finance agency. The Nigerian Building Society (NDS), the forerunner of Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria was established in 1956. Inheriting the assets and liabilities of the Nigerian Building society, FMBN had commenced operations on July 1st, 1977 as a fully owned Federal Government agency for housing finance.<br/>For a long time, the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria remained largely the major provider of long-term funds in the housing finance sector. The role of the commercial and Merchant Banks in this sector remained mainly peripheral as they find lending long-term unprofitable because of the short-term source of their funds. Specifically, the bank is mandated by Decree No. 7 of 1977 to: -<br/>-                      Provide long-term credits to individuals, estate developers and to mortgage institutions for housing and property development.<br/>                        -           Encourage and provide the establishment of mortgage institutions as well as supervise and control their activities; the legal framework is prescribed in Decree No. 53/89<br/>            -           To mobilize savings and financial assets<br/>                        -           Assist the operations of companies engaged in the production of building materials.<br/>                        -           Undertake and support applied research to improve its activities and the operations of the sector.<br/>-                      Provide technical assistance services on the various aspects of the sector.<br/> The National Housing Policy, which was launched by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 1991, recognises housing finance as a centrepiece of any credible housing service. It will be recalled that the National Housing Policy itself was a subject of National debate from 1984 to 1986. The debate became necessary to ensure that wide range of opinions was taking into considerations in fashioning out the policy.<br/>The National housing Fund was established by Decree No. 3 of  1992 to facilitate the continuous flow of low-cost funds for long-term investment in housing for benefits of all Nigerians. The fund is to be managed and administrated by Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria essentially to provide long term housing loan to individuals through wholesale lending to primary mortgage institutions.<br/>   -           To any Nigerian earning an income of =N=3000.00 and above per annum should contribute 2.5% of his or her basic monthly salary or income to the fund.<br/>  -           If you are self employed or you own your own business, whether as trader, Professional or Businessperson, etc you are expected to contribute to the fund.<br/> In addition, commercial and merchant banks, Insurance companies and the Federal Government will also contribute to the fund. All potential contributors to the fund are to be registered by FMBN. A registration form will be issued by FMBN to an employee through his/her employer. Each employer is to be similarly registered to facilitate the deduction and remittance of their contributions. A participation number will be allocated to you and you should remain the same, even when you change your place of employment. If you are self-employed, you are also expected to register. You are to collect a form from any branch of FMBN. Your employee (if any) should be equally registered. Following your registration with the funds, your employer is expected to deduct 2.5% from your salary monthly and remit to FMBN. If you are self-employed, you pay directly to any of the FMBN. A passbook shall be issued to subscribers to record his monthly contributions. This passbook must be securely kept as it will be required for every transaction, and a yearly statement of one’s contribution shall be sent to him.<br/>The pool of contribution is to provide housing loans for every Nigerian at relatively low rate of interest. To borrow from the fund, you must be a contributor. The housing loan will assist either to buy or build or improve one’s house. Should contributors want to borrow from the fund, all he needs to do is to apply to any mortgage institution, where he will receive further information and assistance. The interest rate applicable at the time you take the loan will remain fixed until the loan is fully repaid; and the repayment period is over a period of twenty-five years. Whether the contributor borrows or not from the fund, his contribution shall attract interest. Refund of contribution shall be made with the accrued interest to the contributor when he is sixty years old or retired or can no longer continue in employment due to ill health. It behaves greatly to understand that the promulgation of the mortgage institutions Decree of 1989 (Decree 53/89) provides the legal framework guiding the operations of primary mortgage institutions in Nigeria. The Decree empowers every institution to:<br/>                        -           Grant loan and advance to any person for the improvement of or extension of a dwelling house;<br/>                        -           Accept savings and deposits from the public a87nd to pay interest thereon. By its establishment, the FMBN is divested of its retail banking and mortgage operations so that the FMBN could concentrate on its rightful role as the nations’ apex mortgage lending agency.<br/>The primary functions of the Federal Mortgage Finance Limited (FMFL) are: -<br/>                        -           To ensure equitable distribution of mortgage lending activities all over the country.<br/>                        -           To operate as an efficient and effective mortgage institution which will be a role model for the private mortgage institutions.<br/>                        -           To dictate the level and pace of growth of mortgage finance industry and;<br/>-                      To minimise avoidable and fraudulent losses, and ensure a timely and adequate loan recovery performance, in order to create opportunities for structured expansion in the provision of housing finance.<br/>1.1       AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The objectives of this study are to be enumerated below: -<br/>                        -           Review of the operational financial intermediaries in housing sector especially Federal Mortgage Finance Limited by taking Maiduguri Branch as a case study.<br/>                        -           Identify the problems impairing its effective performance, and to re-examine some of the fundamental principles and objectives of its existence.<br/>                        -           To proffer solutions in the light of changing sceneries under which it has been compelled to operate.<br/>                        -           Cast a forward glance at the future of the institution and sector in which it operates.<br/>1.2       RELEVANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The importance of the study lies on the Federal Government of Nigeria ‘s recognition of the imperative to divest the old Federal Mortgage Cooperation; and subsequently established the Federal Mortgage Finance Limited with the corporate mission of providing responsive and credible housing Finance service that will facilitate housing delivery to all segments of the Nigerian population. Therefore it is apposite to mention here that this research work has the following as its importance: -<br/>      -   To what extent the Federal Mortgage Finance Limited ensure equitable distribution of mortgage lending activities.<br/>     -    Has the institution been able to operate as an efficient and effective mortgage institution that would qualify it be leader of other private primary mortgage institutions.<br/>   -    Has it been able to dictate the level and pace of growth of mortgage finance Industry came to create opportunities for structure expansion in the provision of housing finances.<br/>1.3       RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>In carrying out this research work, three methods were used to collect data. Data collected from customers and staffs of Federal Mortgage Finance Limited of Maiduguri branch, questionnaire was distributed to customers and members of staff of (FMFL) under the supervision of Branch Mortgage Officer.<br/>The second method use is personal interview with the Bank Mortgagors officer; Branch Manager Maiduguri, Branch Solicitor and Branch Estate Surveyor. The third method is the consultation with “Mortgage News” Quarterly in-house journal of the Federal Mortgage Finance Limited Volume 1 number 1 and 2, other congenial texts were consulted to put this research work in good perspective.<br/>  <br/>\n\nTHE ROLE OF FEDERAL MORTGAGE FINANCE LIMITED IN HOUSING FINANCE WITH THE FEDERAL MORTGAGE FINANCE LIMITED MAIDUGURI AS CASE STUDY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF FEDERAL MORTGAGE FINANCE LIMITED IN HOUSING FINANCE WITH THE FEDERAL MORTGAGE FINANCE LIMITED MAIDUGURI AS CASE STUDY", "id": 142}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE ROLE OF CO-OPERATIVES SOCIETIES IN HOUSING DELIVERY <br/>(A CASE STUDY OF ENUGU STATE) <br/>ABSTRACT </b><br/>        A profession is a vocation whose practice is founded upon an understanding of the theoretical structure of some departments of learning and upon the capabilities accompanying such as understanding.

The operation of co-operative societies was first regulated by the coming into being of the co-operative societies ordinance of 1935. But even before the above stated period, there were successful attempts by indigenous groups at the traditionally styled co-operative societies commonly known as “Isusu”. The success of co operative in Nigeria is such that, by 1965 there were about 5,5000 co-operative societies with a total of 358,000 members. To further assist in the smooth operation of co- operatives, specialized banks have long been established across the country to cater for their banking needs. <br/>One school of thought said that a co-operative society is a group of people organized to provide housing to members of he group. The co-operative may cover financing of the project by group contribution actual participation. The government or any institution may provide finances and materials, while the individual member of the co-operative society will provide the labour. <br/>FUNCTIONS OF HOUSING CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES<br/>Provision of loans and credit facilities to member:<br/>Housing co-operative society links co-operative members to financial institutions. Banks government and other institution find it easier to deal with group interested in housing development instead of individual basis. The housing co-operative society scrutinizes individual members credit wordiness for housing loans negotiates better terms for loans and undertakes to generate such housing loans. Supervises or monitors the use of the housing loans/credit o avoid diversion, mismanagement or misapplication etc. in most cases, the problem is checked through the provision of building materials in kind to members by their housing co-operative society. <br/>ii.      Refund or Repayment of Housing Loans.                   <br/>Co-operative society involved in housing scheme ensures that loans credits with interest are timely repaid to financial institutions that made it available by members. The society ensures this through early notification of beneficiary member of the due/maturity date.    <br/>1.1    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>The housing problem in Nigeria is more pronounced in the urban areas, which have been growing in he member of housing units available for occupation. <br/>Low and middle-income earners constituting over 95% of urban work force wee the most affected. The role of housing co-operatives in housing delivery and established ways of using the co-operative societies to increase the number of residential houses for low and middle income dwellers in our urban center. The Nigeria building and road research those of its study institute (NBRRI) made in Nigeria a prototype houses that can be funded by urban housing co-operatives. <br/>The role of co-operative societies was first regulated by the member of the co-operative societies. The group forms what might be regarded as the traditional styled co-operative society commonly known as “Isusu”. <br/>May definition have been proffered for co-operative by scholars and researcher but perhaps the most encompassing is by Savage and Volkin (1965) which states that co-operative society is a voluntary contractual organization or persons having a mutual ownership interest in providing themselves a need service (s) on a non profit basis. In a co-operative, the investment and operational risk, benefits gained or losses incurred are shared equitably by its members in proportion to their use of the co-operative services. <br/>The definition applies generally to any co-operative society, but when a society serves the purpose of constructing owning managing dwelling and also for common and acquisition or for maintenance of completed houses, it can be refereed to a housing co-operative (Levin 1981). <br/>Some of the problems include<br/>1.           Galloping inflation, which led to every increase in price of building materials. <br/>2.           Low in disposable income available, its members to contribute.         <br/>3.           In adequate release of funds due to bottle need in the parent company by The National Housing Programme (NHP) 1994/95, imitated by the immediate paste minister of works/housing Alhaji (Dr) Lateef Kayode. <br/>1.2       BACKGROUND AND NEEDS FOR THE STUDY <br/>In most developed countries, the housing (shelter) sector contributes significantly to the performance of their economics. An increase in the housing market activities usually indicates a strong economy while a decrease in the market shows weakness in the economy. Most countries have often increased, investment in the housing sector as a way of boosting domestic economic growth, and as a tool to fight domestic recession. <br/>Over the past decade the potential of the housing sector in enhancing the social and economic development of developing countries have become very apparent. Housing construction is labour intensive. It creates employment, especially of unskilled and semi-skilled labour. The construction of low – income housing in particular, relies, most of its inputes on locally produced materials, while crating demand for other good and services. This is in addition to developing the necessary infrastructure required for economic expansion and healthy living environment of the people. <br/>However, the seeming intractability of the housing problem in Enugu shows clearly that as a state, we are yet to commit our selves to a purposeful and consistent housing delivery system. <br/>This is dispute the irritation and application of many innovative laws and policies at federal and state levels and the setting up of numerous agencies charged with the responsibilities of implementing various aspects of the national housing policy. The state earlier but federal and state government had established agencies and enacted legislation armed at establishing a sustainable basis for providing housing for low – income families in particular and other income groups. At the federal housing authority (FHA), the housing division of the federal ministry of works and housing (FMWH) and the urban development bank of Nigeria (UDBN) Plc have been established, similarly policies such as mortgage institutions Decree No 53 of 1992, urban and Regional Planning Decree, as well as the land use were enacted. At the state level, most have established, Housing Corporation, Housing development in ministries of works and housing and more recently, has come to the promulgation of rent edicts. However, despite all the effort, the housing problem has remained seemingly intractable.<br/>1.3       AIMS AN OBJECTIVES<br/>The aimed ways of using the co-operative to increase the number of residential house available for low and middle level income urban dwellers. The stated aim is to be achieved through the following objectives. <br/>1.   To highlight the advantages of housing co-operative based on self-help. <br/>2.   To study the low and middle level income earners responses to the idea of housing co-operatives.<br/>3.   To enumerate the various types of housing co-operatives and identify the one(s) most viable in Enugu. <br/>4.   To relative urban low and middle level income to appropriate proto type lowest residential accommodation that can be funded by the co-operatives and <br/>5.   To produce a useful data for the drafty of the proposed housing co-operative decree.      <br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>Government, in this project has tried to point out the enormity of housing facing Nigeria. It is in agreement with the fact that finance represents the hallmarks of an efficient housing policy. It also agreed that the current National Housing Policy is very comprehension enough to take the nation to year 2010, but with some modification. <br/>Effective housing finance coupled with sound management and cheap building material with undoubtedly help in the implementation of other aspects of the policy. <br/>The research has through this project highly lighted certain issues and problem that effects housing delivery general, and the disbursement of the national House Fund (NHF) in particular. The researcher is of the opinion that, if we channel all our efforts of the National housing Fund (NHF) will be more effective. <br/>Low – income earners. The development of local production of building materials has been examined in this project. It is geared towards achieving self-sufficiency in the materials, and bring them within the economic reach of most Nigeria the low income earners especially. The project takes an inclusive look at strategies of achieving this with the contention that the development of local production of building materials will significantly influence housing development. <br/>1.5       SCOPE OF STUDY <br/>Enugu the capital of Enugu state was chosen as case study. It focused on middle and low – income earners in Enugu East and Enugu West local government councils. <br/>Trans – Ekulu and Abakpa Housing Co-operation were chosen.   <br/>1.6       RESEARCH QUESTION <br/>1.           What are the advantages of housing co-operatives based on self –help. <br/>2.           How do the low and middle level income earners, respond to the idea of housing co-operatives.   <br/>3.           Relate the urban low and middle level income to appropriate profit types low cost residential accommodation that can be founded by co-operatives.  <br/>4.           What is the useful data for the drafting of proposed housing co-operative? <br/>1.7       DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>1.8.1 Low Income Group <br/>Low income group is defined as al wage earners and a self employed people whose annual income is five thousand naria (5, 000.00) or below as at 1988 or whose arrival income is 20% or below of the maximum annual income of the highest salary grade level within the civil service structure, which ever is high. <br/>1.8.2 Middle Income Group <br/>Middle-income group is also hereby defined as workers whose annuals income is above 20% and below 50% of the maximum annual income of the highest salary grade level.    <br/>1.8.3 Housing co-operative <br/>The definition of housing co-operative was agreed to be “a formal association of members physical, social and economic living condition, utilizing self – help principles.  <br/>1.8.3.1     The “PHYSICAL” aspects may include; Slum and squatter up grading programmes, site and services programme core housing project, home improvement, progrmmes or new construction on private land. <br/>1.8.3.2     The “SOCIAL” Components may be defined as community facilities and social activities, including such things as daycare centers, religious centers, school community centers, health, and sanitation facilities, communication and transportation network.    <br/>1.8.3.3     The “ECONOMIC” aspects may include building materials productions centers, employment generation activities, promotion of small and shopping areas (e.g. co-operative consumer stores).<br/>1.8.3.4     The “SELF - HELP” Part includes, but is not limited to self – construction or sweat equity.

During the 1st century with industrial revolution rapid population growth in the develop world and the volume of waste produce was relatively small. Today in developing nations, like, Nigeria, solid waste accumulate in every city causing serious health and environmental hazard.<br/>The practice of dumping waste on streets, roads, streets and unapproved sites lead to breeding to rats, flies and out break of plagues as well as ecological impacts, such as water and air pollution. This is because the capacity of nature to dilute, disperse or absorb or dispose of its unwanted residues in the atmosphere, water way and land is limited. It is against this background that the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA) was established in 1988 manage and protect the environment. The decree establishing the agency also provided for the establishment of State Environment Protection Agencies (SEPA) in all the States of Federation.<br/>However, the prevailing economic condition in the country coupled with negative attitude of the citizens made it difficult for proper solid waste management and environmental protection solid waste consists of biodegradable (that is substance that can be broken down by bacteria) and non biodegradable (that is substance that cannot be broken by bacteria) materials and these are usually deposited at refuse dumps and other unapproved sites. They pile up in heaps blocking road and drainage, road, network thereby consisting environmental hazards. The inhabitants of the neighborhood sometimes set the heaps of refuse ablaze in an attempt to reduce the size. This practice further deteriorate the environment since people are exposed to danger of air pollution.<br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM  <br/>Changes in Technology brings about changes in the consumption habit of the citizenry and therefore the composition of waste materials.<br/>Thus a lot of non-biodegradable waste (that is substance that cannot be broken by bacteria) are generated and since non-biodegradable are not easily absorbed or diluted naturally such waste accumulate in heaps along major streets. The stinking odour and blackish liquid effluence emanating from such heaps especially during the rainy season constitute environmental hazards and degrade the aesthetic values of our environment.<br/>They as well encourage breeding of mosquitoes and communicable diseases. Therefore the rate of generation of solid waste is not matched with the rate of evacuation as a result of problems ranging from lack of funds and professional experience staffs of bureaucracy and redtapism. <br/>1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of this study is to <br/>(i)                 To determine the composition of solid waste in campus III<br/>(ii)               To examine the different management strategies being adopted in solid waste management by the institution as well as ENSEPA. Enugu State environmental Protection Agencies.<br/>(iii)             To identify problem militating against solid waste management in campus III IMT Enugu Institute of Management and Technology.<br/>(iv)             To suggest appropriate and effective measures that will ensure efficient solid waste management in campus III IMT Institute of Management and Technology Enugu.<br/>1.4              RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>In an attempt to identify the approaches and problems of solid waste management in campus III IMT with a view of finding appropriate management strategies, the following research questions were formulated:<br/>(i)                 What are the major components of solid waste generated in campus III IMT.<br/>(ii)               To what extent does the composition of waste influence  the management practices?<br/>(iii)             What are the reasons for the inadequate as well as inefficient collection and disposal of solid waste by (ENSEPA).<br/>(iv)             What measure are likely to improve the existing situation constraints or management techniques.<br/>(v)               What is the level of public awareness of poor solid waste management.<br/>1.5              HYPOTHESIS<br/>In order to ascertain the opinion of the public on the major constraints of solid waste management in. campus III IMT the following hypothesis are formulated. <br/>Null Hypothesis <br/>HO       The opinion of ENSEPA staff and the general public indicate and lack of management personnel that militate against proper solid waste management in campus III IMT.<br/>Alternative Hypothesis<br/>Hi        The opinion of (ENSEPA) staff and the general public indicate that it is the problem of equipment, fund and lack of management personnel that militate against proper solid waste management in campus III IMT.<br/>1.6              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>The finding of this study will be of great significance to both the students and staff and indeed, every body that has a stake in the affairs and proceedings in IMT campus III.<br/>This is because the recommendation of this study will prefer sustainable solid waste management strategies. Moreover, the study will go along ways in revealing to industrialists, the practical ways to minimize waste recycling.<br/>Finally, the out come of this research will be an asset to environmental researcher and planners for effective planning and management of solid waste.<br/>1.7              SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The consequences and various types of waste are of global significance but the research decided to limit the study to.<br/>(i)                 The nature of solid waste generation and problems in campus III IMT Enugu.<br/>(ii)               Testing the level of awareness and review of the activities of the (ENSEPA) in solving the problem of solid waste in campus III.<br/>(iii)             The possible measures to improve the management techniques in the area.<br/>   <br/>\n\nTHE PROBLEM OF SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT IN ENUGU METROPOLIS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROBLEM OF SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT IN ENUGU METROPOLIS", "id": 144}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE CAUSE OF ABANDONED PUBLIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN THE FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY ABUJA<br/>CASE STUDY FCDA<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The continues abandoning of public projects at various levels of development all over the country is of great concern not only to the governments themselves but more to civil servants who are too inadequately accommodated.<br/>In this research work efforts have been made to identify, analyzed and discuss the basic causes of abandonment federal capital development Authority (FCDA) projects.<br/>Chapter one serves as an introduction which outlines the background of the study, statement to the problems, aims / objectives of the study, research questions, significance of the study, scope of and limitations of the study plus overview of the study of the federal capital territory (FCT) Abuja.<br/>Chapter two serves as literature reviews definition of special terms and also into introduces the reader to some housing policies in Nigeria.<br/>The third chapter serves as research methodology where all the sources and method of data collection used in this work are explained.<br/>Chapter four is the core of the research work where data collection from the filed are presented and analyzed.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    Introduction<br/>1.1    Background of the Study<br/>1.2    Statement of the Problem<br/>1.3    Aims / Objectives of the Study<br/>1.4    Research Questions<br/>1.5    Significance of the Study<br/>1.6    Scope and limitations of the study<br/>1.7    Overview of the study<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0    Literature Review<br/>2.1    Abandonment<br/>2.2    Development<br/>2.3    Development Process in Building Industry<br/>2.4    Project<br/>2.5    Public Sector Involvement in Housing Development<br/>2.6    Types of Public Property<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0    Methodology<br/>3.1    Data Primary Sources<br/>3.2    Secondary Data<br/>3.3    Limitations<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.0    Data Analysis<br/>4.1        Respondents Views on Causes Abandonment<br/>4.2        Respondents Views on the Effect of Abandonment<br/>4.3    Respondents Views on the Possible Solution Abandonment<br/>4.4    Discussion the Findings<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>5.0    Summary Recommendations and Conclusion<br/>5.1    Summary <br/>5.2    Recommendation<br/>5.3    Conclusion<br/>5.4    References<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0                INTRODUCTION<br/>Only little portion of government projects are executed by direct labour, while most of the development projects are awarded to contractions.<br/>Public structures have been known to be abandoned in the cause of construction or left to dilapidate after being practically completed.<br/>    Incidents of abandoned projects are rampant all over the country e.g. from Enugu to ILorin, port Harcourt to sokoto and Lagos to Maidugwi. Projects of high capital cost. Such as residential buildings, office buildings and even road constructions.<br/>1.1    HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE FEDERAL CAPITAL TARRITORY VIZ – AVIZ FEDERAL CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY ABUJA (FCDA)<br/>        The federal capital territory Abuja was created in 1976 by Decree No6 of that year which was established the federal capital development agency responsible for the design, construction and administration of the territory.<br/>        The decree also vested ownership and control for all land in the territory in the federal government of Nigeria. The territory which is located at the centre of the country covers an areas of 8000sqkm.<br/>        It is therefore more than twice the land area of Lagos state (93535sq.km) about two-thirds the size of Imo state (13032sq. km).<br/>        The federal capital territory itself is designed to cover an area of 256sq. Km or 3% of the total land area of the territory and at full development the city is expected to have a total population of 3.2 million.<br/>        In the FCT the duration of sunshine range from 6-8 hours per day in the south and 8-10 hours per day in the North from January to April / may.

Therefore Civil Servants had to stay in scattered level hotels in Suleja for residential accommodation and a borrowed Niger State Housing Estate had to be used as the Head Quarters of the FCDA.<br/>        The only road from Suleja to the Linther land of the territory was a colonial narrow tarred road.<br/>        FCDA is a parastatals under the Ministry for the Federal Capital Territory (MFCT) responsible for the physical development f the territory.<br/>        Under FCDA is the Development of Public Building and Engineering.

An individual can satisfy this need by either occupying his own (owner’s occupier) property or renting another persons property. In our traditional society, the need for shelter is mainly met through the first alternative, that is owner occupation. With the emergency of urban centres, the situation has changed. Many people are no longer about to own property because of the difficulty in the acquisition of land and the high cost of building construction. Therefore, they are left with the alternative of renting other people’s properties in order to satisfy their need for shelter. Consequently two classes of urban resident have emerged, the landlord and the tenant under this arrangement the tenant pays to the landlord a certain amount of money in consideration for his use of the landlord’s house. This amount is popularly known as rent.<br/>During the civil war the Nigeria that is 1966 to 1970 many landed properties in the urban areas of the former Eastern Region of Nigeria, including Enugu, were destroyed. Consequently, there was a sharp decline in the supply of landed properties after the war. Furthermore, the post – civil war period witnessed an unprecedented number of the rural population trooping into the urban centres due to the conspicuous prosperity brought about in the urban area by the oil boom. This resulted to high demand for the existing limited supply of landed properties. Consequent upon these, rent for landed properties increased considerably. <br/>This trend has continued with the effect that “the average worker is paying between 30% to 40% of his salary as rent ” (Oshadiya, 1985). Thus the increase in rents on the properties has led to the variation of rent on properties.<br/>In urban area due to location advantage (for example prime location) which some properties offer above others for commercial and residential uses, rent tend to very on account of the type of use which a property can offer.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>Location of economic properties has been a difficult concept to understand. Although the primary objective of commercial properties is the derivation of financial gains, while that of residential properties is for habitation, shelter and comfort, the demand for land is a refection of the profitability or utility derivable from it use. The greater the benefit to be obtained from a particular use, the higher the rent that the user will be willing to pay for it. <br/>There appear to be wide ranging differences in the levels of rent passing on residential and commercial properties in Enugu and Nigeria generally.<br/>This research is seeking among other things to find out the causes of rental variation in commercial and residential properties in Nigeria, Ogui New Layout as a case study.<br/>1.3       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>The main purpose of this research is to examine the reasons for rental variation in commercial and residential properties with a view to provide tool to be used in catching issues related to rent on these properties in Enugu and Nigeria generally. <br/>In order to achieve the standard goals, the following objective are to be undertaken;<br/>i)                    To identify the current level of rents for commercial and residential properties in the study area.<br/>ii)                  To ascertain and examine the factors influencing the rents being commanded by these properties.<br/>iii)                To specify the implications of rental variation on decisions to acquire those properties.<br/>iv)                To determine the trend in rental values for residential and commercial properties in the study area.<br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>The finding of this study will be of benefit to the following;<br/>Firstly, tenants who are charged rents based on different reasons, especially when the properties are of the same nature (physically). This will again enable the investors not only to understand how occupier thinks, but also why and the things they consider before acquiring properties for certain uses. For example residential and commercial use.<br/>Secondly, the generality of the public can now understand the reason why the rents being commanded by these properties have to differ.<br/>Lastly, this research work will help to determine the factors influencing, commercial and residential properties which is an essential pre-requisite to successful development as well as stimulating interest in the students to carryout out further research on the topic.<br/>1.5       SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>The study covers a period of three years (2002 to 2004) and it is restricted to selected properties (Residential and commercial) comprising blocks of flat and tenements in Ogui New Layout, Enugu.<br/><br/>\n\nA COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF RENTAL VARIATION IN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES IN NIGERIA \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF OGUI NEW LAYOUT ENUGU)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF RENTAL VARIATION IN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES IN NIGERIA \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF OGUI NEW LAYOUT ENUGU)\r\n", "id": 146}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>RURAL MANAGEMENT AS A STRATEGY FOR REDUCING RURAL – URBAN MIGRATION IN NIGERIA <br/>(A CASE STUDY OF ISHIELY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EBONYI STATE)<br/>ABSTRACT </b><br/>Rural resources have a lot of potential which needed to be brought into full production as to uplift the values. These values can only be achieved when other resources like times, money, infrastructure, expertise an d the like are applied. The high demand of products is expected to propel the application of the said resources into maximum production which in turn increase the value of rural environment, confirming value to be a function of profit.<br/>Unfortunately, government policies and programmes in the year past failed to reflect the need for balance rural and urban development. Thus, most development polices and programmes are urban – oriented. As a result rural dwellers have been subjected to poverty, unemployment, poor infrastructure, economic and social defects. Incidentally, rural dweller a stick to migration.<br/>Therefore, this study on Rural Development. As a strategy, for reducing Rural – Urban Migrations in Nigeria, a case study of Ishiehi Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, seek to identify rural development programmes/projects extent of rural urban migration and factors responsible for rural urban migration in the study area.<br/>From the findings based on the analysed data, integrated Rural Development Strategy has been pin-pointed and recommended as a feasible and viable measure toward minimizing the rate of rural – urban migration in Nigeria at large and Ishielu in particular. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0        Introduction<br/>1.1    Statement of the Problem<br/>1.2    Aims and Objectives of the Study<br/>1.3    Background and Need for the Study<br/>1.4    Research Question<br/>1.5    Research Hypothesis <br/>1.6    Scope and Limitation of the Study<br/>1.6.1 Delimitation Scope<br/>1.6.2  Limitation <br/>1.7 Significance of the Study <br/>1.8 Theoretical Foundation of the Study<br/>1.8.1 Economics Growth Model and Rural Development Dual Economic Model.<br/>1.8.2 Diffusion Model of Rural Development <br/>1.8.3 Basic Resource Theory.<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0        Literature Review<br/>2.1    Meaning of Development <br/>2.2    Rural Area and Rural Development <br/>2.3    Classification of Rural Development Programme<br/>2.3.1 Local (Community Programmes)<br/>2.3.2 Government Programmes<br/>2.4    Strategy<br/>2.4.1 Rural Development Strategies<br/>2.4.2 The Basic Weeds Approach<br/>2.4.3 The Infrastructural Approach<br/>2.4.4 The Minimum package or Sub-Sectorial Approach<br/>2.4.5 The New Technology Approach<br/>2.4.6 The Functional or Sectorial Programme Approach <br/>2.4.7 The Industrialization Approach<br/>2.4.8 The Community Approach<br/>2.4.9 The Integrated Approach<br/>2.5 General Concept of Integrated Rural Development in Nigeria<br/>2.6 Urban Growth and Migration<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0        Research Designs and Methodology<br/>3.1        Re-Statement of the Problem <br/>3.2         Design and Methodology of the Study <br/>3.3        Sampling Technique and Procedure Employed<br/>3.4        Description of the Study Area<br/>3.5        Method of Data Collection<br/>3.5.1 Primary data Collection <br/>3.5.2 Secondary Data Collection<br/>3.6        Description of Data Collection <br/>3.7        Description of Statistics for Analysing Data <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.0        Data Presentation and Analysis <br/>4.1        Personal Characteristics of the Respondents<br/>4.2    Identification of Rural Development Programmes in the study Area.<br/>4.3        Reasons or factors Responsible for Rural Urban Migration <br/>4.4        Extent of Rural – Urban Migration in the Study Area<br/>4.5        Testing of Hypothesis <br/>CHAPTER FIVE  <br/>5.0        Findings, Recommendations and Conclusion <br/>5.1        Findings<br/>5.2        Recommendation<br/>5.2.1  Strategy’s Institutional Framework<br/>5.2.2   Programmes Under the Strategy<br/>5.2.3 Policies, Principles and Philosophy in the Strategy<br/>5.2.4 Funding the Strategy<br/>5.2.5 Suggestion for further study<br/>5.3        Conclusion<br/>References<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>Nigeria, a country in West African sub-region is blessed with abundant natural and material resources. With an estimated current population of over nine hundred and twenty four thousand (924, 000) square kilometers, Nigeria is easily the most populous in African and one of the largest in terms of geographical area. About seventy percent of the population depend on agricultural activities for their livelihood and live in rural communities.<br/>Currently, over forty million out of the total population of over one hundred million people live in urban area. Therefore, the rural area within the geographic entity of the country is whereby majority of the population is found.<br/>Some of the government officials fear of the belief held that urban areas constitute the development potential of the state, the rural areas, have been neglected in terms of development opportunities.<br/>Following the moribund attitudes that existed  in the rural areas the rural dwellers are attracted to the urban areas to benefits from better paying jobs qualitative supply of basic amenities, highs level of commercial, recreational and industrial activities. Arising from the rapid. Urban population growth and physical expansion are very serious physical planning problem such as poor physical layout like Ajegunle, Gwagwa,, Abakpa in Lagos, Abuja, Abakalike and Enugu respectively. Also in the list include mass transit problem inadequate supply of housing, water and other basic social services.<br/>Hence, it is expected that various governments policy maker rural dwellers, planning team and the general public should involve in harnessing the capture and build in preference of the rural dwellers at anytime.<br/>1.1    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>Generally in Nigerian, there have been uneven development and glaring inequality of opportunities between the rural and urban area. In spite of the fact that the majority of Nigerian are rural dwellers rural areas still have little or no opportunities for education and employment. No doubt rural areas in Nigeria are characterized by poverty, malnutrition, poor communication, illiteracy unproductive agriculture with the use of traditional implement, general low per capital income. Also includes lack of health facilities, public electricity, borne whole water and motorable roads which hinder them from evacuating foods and industrial raw materials.<br/>Rural development proper should module all and sundry, unfortunately lack of sufficient fund for progamme execution, high cost of building materials and labour, failure to incorporate people affected in planning and in more serious note, the rural dwellers level of understanding is too low that instead of attracting government attention by initiating a project, they expect the government to do every thing for them which is impossible. All these factors problems act as a push against the rural dwellers in the study area to the urban areas, where they can enjoy social amenities and infrastructure such as water supply, electricity, health facilities, tarred roads, and abundant job opportunities. At the end of this study, we shall know how the rural development can be effective means (strategy) for reducing rural – urban migration in Nigerian generally and Ishielu Local Government Area of Ebonyi State particular. The preceding sentence, therefore, form the focus of this research. <br/>1.2    AIMS OF OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>Maris system of life is dynamic coupled with his insatiable nature which demands better food, shelter and clothes. These are usually achieved through verity of good jobs efficient use of human and natural resources.<br/>The extensive area of land in the rural area can be put to various industrial and agricultural activities, thereby improving the lots of rural dwellers and urban dweller alike Agriculture provide us with food, medicine, firewood, timber and other raw material to the industries as well as employment and foreign exchange. Unfortunately the rural dwellers and farmers which constitute the largest population in the rural areas have not been properly taken care as regards development and as a result the rural dwellers rush to the urban areas to find alternative jobs and social amenities that abound in the urban areas.<br/>This study therefore, is aimed at carrying out a research as follows <br/>(i)          To identify rural development programmes /projects available in the study area.<br/>(ii)         To identity reasons/factors responsible for rural – urban migration.<br/>(iii)        To examine the extent of rural urban – migration.<br/>(iv)       To suggest and make feasible  recommendation on reducing migration in the study area. <br/>1.3    BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR THE STUDY <br/>The advent of civilization brought about urbanization or urban settlement. Civilization is the climax of man’s inventions as a means of raising his standard of living. Man believes in hedonism and indeed obtain much pleasure in the company of other fellow men. No doubt, this is why if one had to give one word the raison d’etre for a city it would surely be “communicated”. People come together in cities to be able to communicate person to person, person to firm person to government.<br/>In the pre-history of urban evolution when technology was large and archaic, people had to search for fertile lands for abundant for harvest. These fertile land occurred in Abakaliki division now in  Ebonyi State. Settlements in these areas were promoted as a result of fertile land. The oldest organized settlement known today as the cradle of civilization such as settlement at alluvial plains of Rive Nile, Tigris, Euphrates, Indus and Yangtze – kiang were equally as a result of fertile land.<br/>The discovering of limestone and the establishment of Cement Company at Nkalagu in Ishielu Local Government Area in 1957 attracted many investors and offered employment to the people. During this era there were considerable notice of immigrants in Nkalagu and its neighbouring communities. As a result of failure of the cement company to produce satellite town thereby extending its social amenities to the surrounding communities, the dwellers in the said communities like Nkalagu, Amazu, Umuahuli, Nkalaha, Obeagu started rushing to the urban areas in middle seventies. It is at this period that rural urban – migration gathered much momentum in the study area.<br/>Generally, cities or urban areas apart from fertility of land discussed already started growing as a result of goods site for defence like Ibandan, mineral deposit such as in Enugu for Coal and Port Harcourt for crude oil, other include religious activities like Elele in Nigeria Jerusalem and Mecca. More recently, political tranquility influence of royal courts, holiday attraction and be antiful sceneries as well as economic activities, coastal orientation mineral deposit and traffic junction are the prevailing factors for the growing of cities. The level of standard of living which most of the cities or urban areas provide compel rural dwellers to more to urban areas and settle. It is in the light of rapid growth of urban over rural communities that form the bedrock of this study.<br/>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTION <br/>The following research questions were formulated to guide the study.<br/>(i)          What kind of rural development programmes/projects are being / have been executed in your rural area?<br/>(ii)         Does lack of integrated rural development responsible for rural – urban migration in your area or not?<br/>(iii)        In what way(s) have the absence of integrated rural development affected the standard of living in your rural area?<br/>(iv)       In your own opinion what are the factors militating against rural development in your area?<br/>1.5       RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS <br/>HO     Lack of integrated Rural Development is not responsible for Rural – Urban migration.<br/>Hi      Lack of integrated Rural Development is responsible for Rural Urban Migration.<br/>1.6       SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>1.6.1 SCOPE<br/>This study concentrates more on the rural development as a strategy for reducing rural – urban migration in Nigeria with a particular reference to Ishielu Local Government Area of Ebonyi state.<br/>Ishielu local government area with Ezillo as its headquarters has a total population of one hundred and twenty eight thousand seven hundred and twenty persons according to the result of 1991 population census (see table I). The communities that form the local government area are as follows Agba, Amazu, Azumyaba, Ezillo, Ezzagu, Iyonu, Nkalagu, Nkalaha, other are Nkezi, Obeagu, Ohafia, Okpoto and Umunuali.<br/>1.7    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>This research is an attempt to highlight the various development imbalance existing in the rural and urban areas which resulted rural urban migration. The rapid acceleration of the urban areas as a matter of urgency need to be redressed through the propagation of well articulated rural development programmes or strategies. Therefore, the problem is on how to inculcate adequate planning development in rural areas to fit the overgrowing migratory demand without sacrificing any of the migrants motives and objectives.<br/>Rural dwellers seen to be most beneficiary, government and the general public will also in one way or the other be benefited, if my suggestions and recommendation are adhered to.<br/>1.8    THEORETICAL FOUNDATION OF THE STUDY <br/>1.8.1 ECONOMIC GROWTH MODEL AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT DUAL ECONOMY MODEL<br/>The dual economy model classifies the economy of less development countries in two. The modern sector and the subsistence section. These are also referred  to as  the urban and rural sector respectively (Olayide et al 1981). According to the model the modern (urban) sector is both capital and technological intensive which the subsistence (rural) sector is less capital intensive. The model believes that while the urban sector is market orientated, the rural sector produces for family consumption and relies on non-purchased inputs like labour and -----. The model accuses the rural sector of lack of savings and capital formation.<br/>The problems with this model is that its adoption as a development strategy will lead to outflow of resources from rural to the urban area. there will be a rural neglect which creates a gap in earning. Also there will be migration to cities and consequently unemployment and increased demand for urban social services like water, electricity and so on. Moreover thee is no economy where the rural sector is characterized by absence of saving and capital formation, rather savings are small. It assign a restrictive role to agriculture as a mean of providing cheap foods and raw materials for industrialization. That is the rural urban migration as a result of lack of saving and capital formatting in the rural areas.<br/>The congestion in the urban areas, unemployment and social are the out come of rural – urban migration which is brought about by the neglect of rural development. The government should realise that for a balance economic growth and development, the rural area have to be developed along side the urban areas. <br/>This models attempts to explain the existence of substantial productivity difference among farmers in the same economics and geographic region. The model attributes the difference in production to difference in the adoption of new varieties of seeds mechanical and chemical inputs, by farmers (Olayide et al 1981)<br/>This model of great relevance to rural development in the less developed countries like Nigeria. It introduces the idea of agricultural extension services, experimental stations and demonstration farms / farm settlements. <br/>The model of some relevance in the development of the study area. the idea of farms settlement and demonstration farm have been experimented upon in Ezillo community the headquarters of the study area.<br/>The problem associated with this model is that the same people are not willing to adopt modern method of farming and organization. They are skeptical about the use of fertilizer and insecticides due to ignorance in farming, there is the need to educate the farmer on the use and profitability of the new techniques. The works successfully where the farming population is educated and enlightened.<br/>1.8.3 BASIC RESOURCE  THEORY <br/>This theory state that economic growth and development depends on the availability of natural resource in a region. This model holds that the development of these resources attract investment capital to these areas and bring about increase in income and employment. One of the limitation of the theory is that mere availability of basic resources are not enough for economic growth to occur in a region. There has to be appropriate technology and expertise to exploit these resources.<br/>The relevance of this model in the study area n that the government should realised the need for education and man power training for a self – reliance and economic development. The dependence of imported machinery and equipment as well as the personnel to operate these equipment does not make for a self – reliance. This goes to show why in spite of abundant natural resources in the study area hunger and disease have continued  to threaten the survival of the rural population. The prices of locally produced goods have remained higher than their imported counterparts.<br/>    <br/>\n\nRURAL MANAGEMENT AS A STRATEGY FOR REDUCING RURAL - URBAN MIGRATION IN NIGERIA (A CASE STUDY OF ISHIELY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EBONYI STATE)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RURAL MANAGEMENT AS A STRATEGY FOR REDUCING RURAL - URBAN MIGRATION IN NIGERIA (A CASE STUDY OF ISHIELY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EBONYI STATE)", "id": 147}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>MANAGEMENT OF COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES IN NIGERIA<br/>(A CASE STUDY AT AWKA METROPOLIS)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>            In this recent times there has been inflationary trend in the Nigerian economy this has also effected different sectors of the economy including the financial affairs as long as one registers he becomes a management of commercial properties.

The demise of same commercial properties in Nigeria did not discourage further investment in the development of commercial properties in Nigerian. Obviously the “big” names served the need of the whole of Awka metropolis when few investors considered the development of commercial properties (shopping complexes) as a worthwhile problem and the idea of a Central Business District was accorded a high respect.<br/>Recently the management is not an easy idea to conceive for real estate especially with such development  are in use by  the  owners. The lack of trained professional in handle the management of commercial properties constitutes the first major obstacle to management of commercial properties with in general.<br/>Basically maintenance is a vital aspects of property management this aspect guarantees the physical life span of a property in order that a property may last for ages ad does not  become economically obsolete, it must be maintained.<br/>1.1       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS <br/>Lack of proper maintenance has gone way to effect the image of some commercial properties many commercial properties failed due to ineffective handing of the properties which manifests in the physical deterioration.<br/>When non-professional are entrusted with the task of property management, failure is easily result.

This payment is on the increase n modern times due to several factors which includes increase in the price of goods, inflation and greed on the part of landlords. Similarly, the collection of rent is limited by a lot of problems which often results to rifts between landlords and tenants. However, these problems of rent collection can be solved successfully, thereby promoting a cordial landlord –tenant relationship. This study therefore seeks to achieve this by identifying the problems of rent collection in residential properties in Enugu, and make recommendations on how to solve these problems. <br/>The government overtime have put up measures to help ensure that the process of rent collection is less cumbersome. These measures have come in form of rent control edicts and recovery of premises edicts, as well as the setting up of rent tribunals. These laws have been adopted by various states of the federation, and modified to address the problems of rent collection peculiar to their state. States such as Cross-River, Kwara, Anambra and Lagos State have done this. These laws will be reviewed in this study, in order to arrive at a better understanding of how these laws canbe used to address the problems of rent collection in residential properties in Enugu metropolis. <br/>Three neighbourhoods have been selected for this study. They include: new Haven, Obiagu and Achara Layout all in Enugu metropolis.   <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0                                   INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY    <br/>        Housing is one of the most basic needs of man second to food and followed by clothing. As man continues to undergone changes from one stage to another, the need for decent housing keeps arising. Increasing human population and advancing technology have increased the need for housing. This need overtime have been addressed through the provision of residential property by developers who in turn collect rent from the tenants. Increasing demand for housing which keeps rising above the available supply has given rise to hike  in rental price of housing, especially residential housing. <br/>        Housing as a basic need is being provided by the public and the private sector. The private sector which is a major provider of housing do so at exorbitant prices and employs various methods in collecting rents. However, the process of rent collection in residential properties is marked by problems which often lead landlords to take extreme measures to ensure that rent is collected. Sometimes too, landlords and tenants do engage in long legal battles which often times linger  on over a long period of time. <br/>        Measures to address the problems of rent collection have been adopted by the public and private developers. The government have enacted rent control edicts and rent tribunals to help to ensure that rent collection issues are properly handled with minimal disagreements. <br/>        Rent collection is a method of residential property management for both the public and private providers of housing. It involves the collection of an agreed sum of money after a specified period of time which could be monthly, annually or bie-annually as the case may be. Rents collected on residential property are used to manage the property and rehabilitate the property if necessary. This helps to increase the life span of the property. Rent to be collected on a property is usually subject to increment after an agreed period of time in order to accommodate inflation.<br/>        Rent collection in Nigeria as well as in Enugu metropolis is the principal duty of the provider of the housing. However, this duty most times is delegated to other parties who collect rent on behalf of the owner. Such delegation is usually made to Estate Agents, caretakers or any other representative who engage in contractual agreements on behalf of the landlord both for rent collection and admittance of new tenants. Estate Agents when acting on behalf of landlords charge monthly or yearly fees for their services. These fees are added tot eh rent payable by the tenant, further increasing it. <br/>        The government as a provider of housing have made several attempts to address the issue of rent collection in Nigeria. Laws such as the rent control and recovery of premises edict and other similar laws found in various states are some of the measures taken by the government. The rent control edict has been adopted by various states of the federation to reflect their peculiarities. These laws cover areas such as fixing of rent, mode of collection and increment. <br/>        Rent collection on government owned residential property has lesser problems than that of private individuals. This is often the case because tenants perceive the government as having the power and right to eject them from their houses more than private individuals. Therefore, they easily comply with the payment of rent without delay whether the price is high or not. The mode of collecting rent from tenants by the government which is usually through government agencies also help to reduce the problems of rent collection  on government owned residential property. <br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM <br/>        The process of rent collection on residential property has a lot of challenges. One of such challenges is delay in the payment of rent. Some tenants fail to meet u ewitht he agreed dealine for payment. This could be asa result of delay in the payment of wages by their employers, increase in rental price, the effects of inflation, among other factors. Delay in the payment of rent often results to the tenant being penalized by paying extra on the agreed rent. It could also lead to legal battles between the landlord and the tenant, which may lead to the forceful eviction of the tenant. <br/>        Another challenge of rent collection is in the area of regular increment. This condition may arise when the interval for rent increment is not specified in the ‘Tenancy Agreement’. This leaves the tenants at the mercy of shylock landlords who increase rent at will. Similarly, when property owners delegate their rights as landlords to agents who act on their behalf, these agents charge service fees which are added to the rent price. This is usually perceived as rent increment by tenants. In addition, most landlords do not give enough time  or even formal notice of increment to tenants. These problems leads to delay in payment or even refusal to pay. <br/>        A third challenge is the absence of any signed document of agreement between landlords and tenants. Such a document which should contain details on the amount to be paid, when to pay, and whom to pay to, when absent can result to problem when rent collection is due. The absence of a ‘Tenancy Agreement’ may bring disagreements between the landlord and the tenants on whether rent should be paid annually or monthly as the case may be.  <br/>        Rent collection becomes problematic when the property in question belongs to  a family and the members are having disputes as to who rent should be paid to. In addition, when the landlord and the tenant are engaged in legal battle, the tenant may likely decline from paying rent until the matter is determined. To achieve this, the tenant may device a means of making the case to linger, during which rent is forfeited. <br/>        Other problems of rent collection arise from continuous inflation and increase in the cost of raw materials which in turn increases the cost of rent. <br/>1.3    AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>        The aim of this study is “To evaluate the problems of Rent collection as an aspect of residential property management in Enugu”, with a view to making recommendations on how to address these problems; <br/>        The following objectives will help in achieving the aim of the study: <br/>1)   To determine the methods of rent collection by residential property owners in Enugu metropolis. <br/>2)   To determine the contribution of the government in rent collection. <br/>3)   To identify the problems of rent collection in residential properties in Enugu metropolis. <br/>4)   To make recommendations on possible ways to solve the identified problems of rent collection in Enugu metropolis. <br/>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>        The following research questions will be answered during the study: <br/>1.   What are the methods of rent collection in residential properties in Enugu? <br/>2.   In what way has the government contributed to rend collection in Enugu? <br/>3.   What are the problems of residential property rent collection in Enugu? <br/>4.   How can the problems of residential property rent collection in Enugu be solved? <br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>        This study on the evaluation of the problems of rent collection in Enugu metropolis is especially significant considering the rising wave of tenancy cases in law courts. This study will help to reduce tenancy cases by identifying the problems of rent collection and proffering solutions to address these problems. By reducing the number of rent-related suits in court, the burden on the courts will be reduced and enough time devoted to other more important cases. <br/>        The significance of this study can also be found in the area of reduction in forceful eviction of tenants. This will result from a better understanding between landlords and tenants. Furthermore, since rent collection is an important aspect of property management, this study will enable property owners to assess the best possible way of collecting rent. This will help to save time spent on litigations and as well save resources which are scarce.    <br/>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The scope of this study covers the problems of rent collection as an aspect of property management in Enugu. However, emphasis will be placed on residential properties in Enugu metropolis alone. This is because rent collection covers a wide range of property types, and delving into these will make the study too broad. Also, the study will cover the methods of rent collection in residential properties in Enugu. Doing so will help in identifying the problems inherent in them. <br/>        Furthermore, this study covers the contribution of the government to rent collection in form of the various edicts, bye-laws and acts. Attempts will be made to figure out areas where these contributions by the government to rent collection can be employed to solve the problems of rent collection in Enugu metropolis. Finally, recommendations on how to solve the problems of rent collection in Enugu metropolis will be made based on the findings of the study. <br/>1.8    OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY <br/>        This study deals with an evaluation of the probes of rent collection as an aspect of residential property management in Enugu metropolis. In other words, attempts will be made to  identify the problems of rent collection as it affects residential property. During the study, the methods employed by landlords in the collection of rent for residential property will be aanlysed with a view to determining the effectiveness of thee method. To achieve this, the researcher will interview selected landlords, tenants and agents. <br/>        Furthermore, this study will evaluate the contribution of the government to  rent collection by looking at the various rent control edicts and other laws on rent control. The main aim of the study is to evaluate the problems of rent collection as an aspect of property management in Enugu metropolis. Objectives such as; determining the methods of rent collection in residential property, determining the contribution of the government to rent collection, identifying the problems of rent collection were drafted to help in achieving the aim. <br/>        Finally, this study is presented in five chapters. Chapter one contains the background of the study,  chapter two has the literature review and chapter three contains research methodology. Chapter four deals with data presentation and analysis, while chapter five covers the recommendations and conclusion. <br/>   <br/>\n\nEVAULATING THE PROBLEM OF RENT COLLECTION AS AN ASPECT OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY COLLECTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EVAULATING THE PROBLEM OF RENT COLLECTION AS AN ASPECT OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY COLLECTION", "id": 149}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EFFECTIVE SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AS A BOOSTER TO NIGERIA ECONOMY <br/>Proposal</b><br/>This paper is a presentation of the problems of solid waste management in Nigeria and certain important issues that must be addressed in order to achieve success. At the core of the problems of solid waste management are the absence of adequate policies, enabling legislation, and an environmentally stimulated and enlightened public. Government policies on the environment are piecemeal where they exist and are poorly implemented. Public enlightenment programs lacked the needed coverage, intensity, and continuity to correct the apathetic public attitude towards the environment. Up to now the activities of the state environmental agencies have been hampered by poor funding, inadequate facilities and human resources, inappropriate technology, and an inequitable taxation system. Successful solid waste management in Nigeria will require a holistic program that will integrate all the technical, economic, social, cultural, and psychological factors that are often ignored in solid waste programs.KEY WORDS: Solid waste; Management; Problems; Solutions; Nigeria<br/>ABSTRACT <br/>        It is always known that cleanliness is next to godliness and health is wealth Good health is achieved if there is good management of the environment. <br/>        The need for a good management of the environment cannot be over emphasized since there is a continuing environmental decay as a result of increased urbanization. <br/>        Pollution is a major problem of urbanization of which most of the causes have been identified as industrial combustion, solid waste generation, oil spillage disposal etc. since these causes are inevitable; there is need for a good control of them. In this project there will be a critical look at solid waste management situation with special focus on Cities Enugu.        <br/>        The project, which is required for the attainment of-------- programme, will be divided into five chapters. <br/>        The chapter one, which is the introductory part of the project, the statement of the problem is intended to be those associated with solid waste management problems, which may include health hazard, ditty environment, blockage of drainage system etc. In the main study, all those problems will be discussed intensively.<br/>        The purpose of this project which will be treated in the main project will center on identifying the importance of such management and all the various strategies of checking excessive solid waste generation and management in the market in particular and Enugu city in general. <br/>        The background and need for the study will focus on past experiences of solid waste of management and problems associated with it so as to know how to improve subsequent situation. From all those information one can make some hypothesis, which can be either positive or negative at the end of he study. <br/>        In the chapter two, the project is intended to review some literatures on the subject matter, which takes the form of books, paper, journals, etc. here there will be a though review on some related topics such as solid waste management, policies on solid waste management, generation, classification and importance of solid waste management. These are expected to be extracted from library and other sources.<br/>        The chapter three will deal mainly on research methodology and design. Here the sources of data i.e. Primary and secondary sources will be highlighted.<br/>        Primary sources have to do with questionnaires, direct interview etc which secondary sources have to do with information from libraries, books, journals and magazine etc. Some statistical models such as bar chart, pie chart, and histogram will be used to present this data in a specific manner.  <br/>        The chapter four has to do with data presentation and analysis. Here field data collected are analysis and presented in a format to achieve analytical conclusion. Statistical analytical methods are to be used here to arrive at scientifically conclusions. <br/>        Chapter five deals on findings of the reseach, recommendation he prefer to tackle solid waste management problems in the study area and conclusions. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT <br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>Introduction                                                                <br/>1.1        Statement of the problem                             <br/>1.2        Purpose of the study                                            <br/>1.3        Background and need of the study                         <br/>1.4        Theoretical foundation of the study                                <br/>1.5        Research question                                               <br/>1.6        Scope of study                                            <br/>1.6.1  Delimitation                                                <br/>1.6.2  Limitation                                           <br/>1.7        Signification of the study                              <br/>1.8        Overview of the study                                          <br/>CHAPTER TWO: <br/>LITERATURE REVIEW                                                         <br/>2.1        Definition of solid waste                                                <br/>2.2        Solid waste                                                         <br/>2.3        Characteristics of solid waste                                 <br/>2.4        Urbanization and solid waste generation      <br/>2.5        Solid waste management strategies                <br/>2.6        Importance of solid waste management          <br/>2.7        Problems of solid waste management                     <br/>CHAPTER THREE <br/>Methodology                                                       <br/>3.1        Introduction                                                <br/>3.2        Re-statement of the problem                 <br/>3.3        The study area                                            <br/>3.4        Populations and sample size                  <br/>3.5        Sources of data                                   <br/>3.6        Method of data collection                              <br/>3.7        Libraries                                                     <br/>3.8        Validity/reliability test of instrument        <br/>CHAPTER FOUR <br/>Data Presentation and Analysis                                              <br/>4.1        Data on respondent                                             <br/>4.2        Rate of solid waste generated by the respondents    <br/>4.3        estimation of daily, weekly, monthly <br/>and annual generation of solid waste <br/>in akwata area of cities                        <br/>4.4    Solid waste storage system by the respondent         <br/>4.5    Information about ENSEPA                            <br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>5.0        Findings, Recommendation and conclusion       <br/>5.1    Findings                                                             <br/>5.2        Recommendation                                                <br/>5.3        Recommended treatment                             <br/>5.4        Conclusion                                                  <br/>Bibliography                                                       <br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Empirical evidence ranks Nigerian as one of the countries world that produces high qualities of solid waste. This phenomenon is predicted on her over increasing population complied with sophistication in taste and demand for domestic and industrial goods by her urban population. The uncontrolled generation and disposal of these wastes have deteriorated our otherwise conducive urban environment. Virtually all cities in Nigeria are characterized by helps or mounting of solid wastes. The health implications of this development on our urban streams, health and socio-economic development leave much to be desired. <br/>The realization of good health, hygiene and sustainable development in any society is practically impossible when pollution by way of solid wastes impact strongly on hers socio – economic, cultural and environmental settings. <br/>Policy markers, leaders of though and political office holders are daily confronted with endemic problems of what to do with mounting heaps of solid wastes in our urban environment. Many choice properties by virtue of their proximity to dump sites have deteriorated significantly and this has serious negative effect on their rental and capital values. <br/>The present scenario depicts a state hopeless as virtually all Agencies of government entrusted with managing the wastes especially ENSEPA seems to be at cross road on what to do.       <br/>1.1    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS <br/>Solid waste management is a very difficult task, as we all know. It creates a lot of problems to people which include:- drainage blockage (flooding), traffic jam, health hazard and unsightly environment. <br/>In addition, environmental pollution in urban centers due to solid wastes is a matter of serious concern to the international community, for pollution in any form interferes with our good chain, health, comfort, amenities, properties values and living standards. <br/>Today, all businesses are affected by both environmental changes and government effort towards controlling these changes. <br/>1.2    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY      <br/>The main purpose of this study is to effective of solid waste management as a booster to Nigeria Economy.  More over the research aims at finding out what should be done in order to reduce the health hazards and of the increasing menace of solid wastes management in urban areas.<br/>1.3    BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR THE STUDY <br/>Urbanization, which is the purpose of people’s aggregation in cities, has witnessed tremendous increase in recent times. Most cities now in Nigeria have grown to full-scale urban status. The implications of urbanization is manifested in the areas of unemployment, inadequate social amenities due to undue pressures on the available ones by teaming population, increase in crime wave, sophistication and changes in demand and taste complied with high consumption on industrial and domestic goods leading to large volumes of solid wastes. <br/>The presence of the solid wastes in our city environment without effective waste collection and disposal machinery has left most of these cities in solided state and their implications on the health of urban. It leaves much to be desired hence the need for this study. <br/>1.4    THEORETICAL FOUNDATION OF THE STUDY <br/>This study is based ion W. Wilkie, Jodan’s Topical hygiene and sanitation theory, which state “that the collection and disposal of refuse and waste matter is any integral part of effective sanitation exercise. <br/>From the above view and theory, any effective waste management packaged for proper address of our solid waste hydra headed problems benefit all individual main market. <br/>1.5       RESEARCH QUESTION <br/>The following research questions wee formulated to guide the study. These include: <br/>1.           How do you dispose your solid waste? <br/>2.           Are there any waste bins in your shops? <br/>3.           How often is waste evacuated from your day? <br/>4.           Do you sort your waste before disposal? <br/>5.           Are there sufficient equipment and manpower?<br/>6.           Are the storage, collection and transportation in Cities dumps from individual shops?  <br/>7.           How far are waste dumps from individual shops? <br/>1.6       SCOPE OF STUDY <br/>The study is therefore restricted to solid waste management in Cities. The scope of study is created into two sections:-   <br/>a.           Delimitation <br/>b.           Limitation <br/>1.7    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>1.           The major significance of this study is that it will help in no small measure to maintain efficient and effective waste management system of the study area. <br/>2.           Furthermore, it will help in improving the environmental condition of Cities. <br/>3.           The findings of this study will also form the basis for further investigations in this study area. <br/>4.           Finally, it will help in the prevention, reduction and control of the disease associated with solid wastes and food poisoning. <br/>1.8    OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY <br/>For effective coverage of this research it is divide into five (5) chapters made up as follows: <br/>Chapter one deals with the statement of the problem, purpose of the study, background and need for the study, the theoretical foundation of the study, research question, scope of study, significance of the study and overview of the study. <br/>Chapter two is the literature review. This chapter deals with the view of relevant literature by authorities in environmental and solid waste management. <br/>Chapter three is the research design and methodology, which gives the step-by-step procedure adopted in carrying out the study. <br/>Chapter five is the finding, recommendation and conclusion of the study. <br/><br/>\n\nEFFECTIVE SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AS A BOOSTER TO NIGERIA ECONOMY <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTIVE SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AS A BOOSTER TO NIGERIA ECONOMY ", "id": 150}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PROBLEM OF COMPULSORY ACQUISITION AND COMPENSATION UNDER THE LAND USE ACT OF 1978  <br/>(A CASE STUDY OF AKURE AIRPORT)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The word land means different things to different people and in different context.

Land is of tremendous importance to man because it is basic of all his endeavours. People look to land for their physical environment, for the food they eat and other materials needed to clothe their bodies and to provide housing and manufactured goods, for building sits, for recreational activities and for scenery and open space1.<br/>“Also, it is the very foundation and framework upon which social, political and economic activities of a nation function”2. The explains why there are emotional, spiritual and financial attachments to land in Nigeria. <br/>“The word land means different things to different people and in different contexts”3 has been variously defined by different disciplines. An ordinary person may regard land as a piece of the earth’s surface and its sub – soil. From economic point of view; it is a key factor in production and an economic good characterised by scarcity, utility and transferability. Land to the lawyer on the other hand is not the virgin, rent – bearing soil and other natural resources of economic theory, it is much more. “It includes all corporeal things subjacent and superjacent to the soil and annexed there to”4. The  legal view of land does not only include, visible and tangible structures and object (corporeal hereditaments), but also includes intangible and abstract objects (incorporeal hereditaments ). Land, in the language of the property and conveyancing law of Western Nigeria includes.<br/>Land of any tenure, building or part of building, whether the division is horizontal, vertical or made in any other way, and other corporeal hereditament; and also a rent an d other incorporeal hereditaments, and an easement, right privilege or benefit in, over or derived from land.<br/>Human life and society as we know cannot exist without land because it is the base of all human activities as no development takes place without it. For centuries, most wars were taught for the possession of land, and the average with the soil, field, forest and fishing gro----- that provide him with sustenance. This, right in land were often the key factor that determined an individuals economic, social and political status. “It is also regarded as the link between the dead, living and the unborn of a family hence its inalienability”5. “As a result it is regarded as a taboo to sell land acquired through inheritance”6. Therefore, where the motive of a land owner is spiritual, the loss of property cannot be adequately compensated for by cash payment or offer of an alternative land.<br/>It is an obvious fact that compensation for land compulsory acquired is not always paid on time. When cash payment are made such payments prove inadequate to compensate for the property compulsory acquired.<br/>However, this can be redressed by removal of unnecessary bottle – necks in the procedure, and the setting up of effective appeal machinery  to lubricate the wheels of compulsory acquisition and compensation machinery in Nigeria.<br/>1.1    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>Land is of tremendous importance to man because it is basic to all his endeavours – all economic and human activities ultimately depend on land. that is to say land is a special natural resource that forms the foundation of all human activities as no development takes places without it.<br/>In Nigeria, acquisition of and compensation for interest in property is statutorily controlled in accordance with the provisions of the land use Decree (1978) among others. In acquiring land for developmental project, there are bound to  be problems which in some cases affect the rate of development in the area.<br/>In practices, there is evidence especially in remote village that the natives grumble because compensation for land is no more paid to them as was the case before the promulgation of the land use Decree. So, they do not even known that the land is now vested in the government.<br/>Compensation for the properties compulsory acquired are not promptly paid by some acquiring bodies. They delay in compensation payment greatly subjects the occupiers or owners to serious financial problems and  inconveniences. Even the puzzling basic of compensation has given rise to legal actions and disturbance of activities at the Akure Airport.<br/>In such cases, negotiations is struck between  the two parties and the amount agreement is deposited. Disputes also rose over ownership of economic trees. <br/>In addition, t her is the problem of threat to the lives of the field employees during acquisition.<br/>1.2    AIMS OF OBJECTIVES <br/>The aim of this study is to explore:<br/>1.           The evolution of compulsory acquisition ---- in Nigeria with a detailed discourse on the provisions of the land use Decree on acquisition and compensation for privately owned lands.<br/>2.           To resolve the conflicts surrounding the acquisition and compensation of land in the Akure Airport through suggestions and recommendation in this work.<br/>3.           The problem associated with the acquisition and compensation of this study.<br/>4.           Draw inference from available primary and secondary data to alleviate these problems encountered during acquisition of land and compensation.<br/>1.3    SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY <br/>Research involves investigation. The outcome of which is knowledge. The knowledge could be on addition or a new idea. The significance of a research work in man’s search for knowledge and understanding is so basic that it seems necessary to stress its importance in the field of eminent domain. This study covers areas of land acquisition, payment of compensation, land resources.<br/>This work therefore, will be of some interest and relevance to the Nigeria land owner and potential and owners. Professional in environmental fields; and students of Estate Management, Urban and Regional Planning and law will find this work useful.  This study will be of importance to the policy makers in public and private sectors. The government and oil companies will not be left out in benefiting from this study.<br/>1.4    RESEARCH METHODOLOGY <br/>The data used in the production of this dissertation are derived from two broad sources; VIZ –<br/>Primary Sources:      These are original sources of raw data collected in the process of investigation. The necessary data or information required for this study were collected under this source.<br/>The ministry of land and housing which is the government agent responsible for the exercise of power of compulsory acquisition, was interviewed.<br/>Secondary Sources:   Information derived from this sources are basically form text books, government publication, maps and newspaper were used in this study.<br/>1.5    LIMITATION AND SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>Research on compulsory acquisition and compensation is a length and complicated process that cannot be dealt with exhaustively in such a limited space like this dissertation.<br/>In the light of this, the study is limited to compulsory acquisition and compensation of Akure Airport, Ondo State and inference made there is also about Nigeria as a whole.<br/>Compulsory acquisition and compensation is a very broad subject. Its practice spans throughout  the country. But for purposes of detailed interview this study is restricted to Akure Airport. For purpose of this study, analysis is limited to economic tress and houses.<br/><br/>\n\nPROBLEM OF COMPULSORY ACQUISITION AND COMPENSATION UNDER THE LAND USE ACT OF 1978  \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF AKURE AIRPORT)\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEM OF COMPULSORY ACQUISITION AND COMPENSATION UNDER THE LAND USE ACT OF 1978  \r\n(A CASE STUDY OF AKURE AIRPORT)\r\n", "id": 151}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF THE PROVISION OF HOUSING ESTATE ON RESIDENTIAL HOUSING DELIVERY<br/>(A CASE STUDY OF WORLD BANK HOUSING ESTATE OWERRI)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This dissertation deals chiefly with an analysis of the effect of the provision of housing estate on residential housing delivery with a case study of world bank housing estate Owerri.  <br/>            The key impetus for this research on the analysis of the effect of the provision of housing estates on other residential house in this particular area of study arises from its sudden changes in states. <br/>            This study examines the effect of this changes on the physical environment and the population of the study area with particular emphasis on the area of provision of residential units and the provision of basic social amenities and infrastructures as be pithy the advancement in the status of the world bank housing estate. <br/>             This also examines the sole aim of provided housing estate and the its effect on other residential houses in the area study.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>1.1    Introduction<br/>1.2    Statement of problems<br/>1.3    Aims and objectives of the study <br/>1.4    Research questions<br/>1.5    Significance of the study the scope of study <br/>1.6    The scope of study <br/>1.7    Limitation of the study <br/>1.8    Over-view of the study<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.0 Literature review <br/>2.1 Definition of terms<br/>2.2 Factors affecting housing demand<br/>2.3 Factors affecting housing supply<br/>2.4 Housing finance<br/>2.5 Effects of the provision of housing estate on residential housing.<br/>2.6 Efforts to the state federal government to housing delivery system.<br/>CHAPTER THREE <br/>3.1 Research design and methodology<br/>3.2 Sources of data collection<br/>3.4 Sample of size<br/>3.5 Method of data collection<br/>CHAPTER FOUR <br/>4.1 Data presentation and analysis <br/>4.2 Analysis dare collected from the d <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>5.0 Findings recommendation, summary and conclusion <br/>5.1 Findings<br/>5.2 Recommendation <br/>5.3 Summary and conclusion<br/>Bibliography appendix<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>Housing is seen as one of the most important for the physical survival of man after the provision of food. It contributes to the physical and moral hearth of a nation and stimulates the social stability, the work efficiency and the development of the individuals. But in spite of these facts there is on doubt that housing in quantitative terms is still one of the major problems facing the Nigerian Urbanities and governments beside the characteristic slums and conditions it is becoming increasingly difficult for average Nigerians to own houses. Also it is very difficult to procure decent accommodation at reasonable rent in the market. The rent are high in each state and fairly high in the other state capitals, but still not commensurate with the monthly in comes of all categories of low, middle and upper wage earners and the self-employed.<br/>            The major cause of high rent is that the supply of housing is fair less than demand. The recommended 20 percent of the monthly income on rent. The problems are more acute in those cities and towns where ad commercial and industrial activities have long been established, fast growing and concentrated cities. To find houses to rent is a big problem and if such houses are eventually found, they are let out at very exorbitant prices that take a large percentage or the monthly income of the acceptant not minding the location and the accessibility of the residence to the place of work. Until recently for an was becoming exceedingly very difficult for an average wage earner as well as the self –employed individuals to build houses of their own within a long period of time say ten years through their private savings. Most civil servants in Nigeria between 1978 and 1988 cloud hardly make some savings not to take of building houses of their own. Also, the cost of building materials is very exhobitant, cost of land, labour and professional fees are very high which has led to the situation whereby the construction cost per square meter is far more than what an individual could meet after the provision of food and other social needs. <br/>            Also due to the fact that individual cannot own houses of their own as a result of the high construction cost involved, it has contributed to people hiring at very exorbitant rates because there are more buyers one of housing good than the supply of those goods and services. The effect of this housing shortage mostly predominately in Urban areas not only led to over crowing in several cities, it has also led to many taking shelter under the bridges, schacks and make shifts (as in the case of lagos). The most unfortunate thing is that the existing residential buildings are not suitable to modern needs and lack in converses such as water closets (Wcs),P,Pe-borne water, power supply, open spaces etc. the situation prompted the united Nations to launch the aggressive programme of shelter for all in the year 2000.<br/>            To achieve this, the federal government of Nigeria incorporated it in the Nation’s third development plan (1975-1980) and sought to participate actively in the provision of housing for all income groups achieve significant increase in housing supply and bring relief especially to the low income earners and the self- employed who where the most affected by the acute shortage a situation whereby the Urban worker paid over 20% of his monthly income on rent. This has led to the provision of Estates by both the  federal and the state government in order to increase the housing stock available to the Urban population. It is on this background that this work tries to examine the effect of these housing Estates on Residential Housing Delivery.<br/>1.2       STATEMENTS OF PROBLEMS<br/>Government all over the world especially in developing countries embarks on the provision of housing Estate for their Wizens, this is usually to argument housing provision by the private sector of the economy. Although these estates were established by law and status, they present management problems inducing legal, physical, Financial, social – political and other problems such that in recent time management of public housing Estate has presented hydra-headed problems. These problems manifest themselves in the form of dilapidated buildings, poor sanctuary and environmental condition all resulting from poor management and lack of maintenance.<br/>This cleary, the crux of the housing problems in Nigeria today relate to the low income groups which constitute the main elements of both Urban and rural population with all these factors mentioned above one sees the housing problems in general as the problems that motivated both the federal and the state government, the Imo state government and the Imo state Urban and housing corporation and all the other state government and housing corporations to formulate their housing programmes. This is because good residential housing gives room for more production.<br/>1.3  AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>            The main aim of this research work is to evaluate the effect of housing estate on the residential housing provision in the Nigerian Urban cities: To achieve this aim the following objectives are set out. <br/>(1)                       To identify the various housing estates in the study area.<br/>(2)                       To determine the quantity (number)of houses provided through the Imo housing corporation in Owerri <br/>(3)                       To determine the effect of these housing Estate on the residential housing provision <br/>(4)                       To identify problems and constraints of the Imo housing corporate in the provision and management of these housing Estates.<br/>(5)                       To recommend ways of ameliorating the problems in (4) four above with a view of providing more housing Estate in the urban area.<br/>1.4        RESEARCH QUESTIONNAIRES  <br/>1.      Mention various housing estate in Imo state Owerri<br/>2.      What is the quantity number of housing provided by the Owerri housing co-operation? <br/>3.      What are the effect of these housing estates on the residential housing provision?<br/>4.      What are the problems encountered by the Owerri housing co-operation in the provision and management of these housing estates?<br/>5.      Recommend ways of ameliorating the problems with a view of providing more housing estates in the urban area.<br/>1.5        SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>It has often been argued that the distribution of residential housing ownership, specifically among the working class, increased support for the ownership of private property in general and areasthesises housing as an area of social structure pound on capitalist private enterprise. <br/>            To further buttress this point residential housing delivery in Owerri has made the individuals and low income earners to enjoy its role in stimulating national economy, its social services or significance and its financial and economic importance to individuals. Such services provided in that area include provision of shelter or accommodation, provides collateral security for loans / mortgage loans, durable goods which can be inherited, contributes to physical development, source of social prestige / status, provides employment opportunities, investment – which yields a flow of income it checks cost of housing reengage in the city, provision of schools, hospitals, recreational centers etc.<br/>            Therefore, since the need for shelter or accommodation is very universal, its significance or importance is very obvious. The importance of residential housing cuts across nation or political boundaries and it is a staminate to good health and individual productivity. This citizens of any nation who dwell in decent housing will enjoy good health, be productive and thus contribute positively to the growth of their nation’s economy. As we look at the social significance of housing to man, its role in the economic development of a community or individuals, we would be able to fully appreciate the importance of residential housing to man which is really the focus of this topic.<br/>1.6        THE SCOPE OR STUDY <br/>This project is limited to the analysis of the effect of the provision of housing estate on residential housing delivery using the World Bank Housing Estate Owerri as a case study- However this work is not concerned with provision and development of Housing Estates.<br/>1.9       OVER-VIEW OF THE STUDY<br/>This project comprises of five chapters the first chapter is the introduction comprising statement of the problems purpose of the study, Arms and objectives, significance of the study, scope and limitation of the study research Question and over –view of the study.

One of the major sources of finance is real estate taxation. Property tax reform is one of the alternatives proposed as a means for raising increased revenue to meet the financial needs of cities in less developed countries. Property rating is employed in Nigeria at the local government levels to raise revenues for public purposes. Rates are levied not on the nation as a whole but on a particular locality that is deemed ripe for the imposition of rates and with the consent of parliament. This consent is not given on every occasion of rate collection. The power is general one, given by statute without restriction and for all times.<br/>            The general lack of interest on the part of the property ratepayers and the reluctance of some assessment jurisdictions to disclose information, the property rate administration is often surrounded in mystery. This centres on the fact that the core of property tax (rate) administration is the value of each taxpayer’s property, so that each taxpayer will bear fairly his proportional part of the overall tax levy. Property owners have a right to know the approximate, fraction of estimated market value that is being used for tax (rating) assessment purposes.<br/>            If the local government have to exist and to viable as the third tier of government they must surely need some local revenue in order stand firmly property rating is the most obvious source of such revenue. Property rating not only helps in influencing development but is also the major source of local government revenue used in defraying the cost of services rendered by local government includes, inter-alia, parks, burial grounds, registration of marriage, death and birth.<br/>            It is important to note that rate is a form of tax, hence the use of property rate and property tax is interchangeable, although there is a slight difference between rate and tax, beside that rate is a form of tax, while in rating the amount of revenue required by a rating authority is first decided and then distributed among the rate payers according to a pre-fixed standard in other kind of tax the exact amount to be generated at the time of imposition is unknown.<br/>1.1                 BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/>From investigation and empirical data on property rating in general and in Enugu state in particular, one observes a gold mine with proper handling waiting to be exploited as can seen in Enugu north it is, therefore the aim of this paper to examine the administration of property rating in the state, how well informed the rate payers are, their attitudes, improvement in the system, how well the system has been paying off, and of course, a critical appraisal of the system.<br/>The purpose of this paper is to study and identify the sources of local government finance, its problems, methods of property assessment as provided in some rating laws/Edicts, the impact of control of rent edict on property assessment, prospects of property rating and make recommendations not only on how best to expand the local government financial base with particular reference to property rating system but also on how best to implement the rating in the country. The purpose also includes the prospect of site value rating as a means of boosting the local government finance.<br/>1.2                 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The local government reform law gave the function of rate collection to the local authorities. The valuation unit in the old Anambra State was staffed by civil servants. The unit organized tenement rating and prepared valuation list which were after due procedure sent to the rating authority to serve demand notices and collect tenement rates.<br/>One of the greatest rating problems in most rating authorities is the problem of collection. The weak or ineffective administration has resulted in a high rate of default. For example in 1978/79 in the whole of Enugu north 21% of the estimated rate revenue was collected. Some rating authorities are now embarking on a commission basis.<br/>The question of prosecuting defaulters is not actively pursued in most local rating authority areas for two reasons:<br/>(a)        Most of the defaulters are the élites who will adjudicate such cases.<br/>(b)        For political expediency landlords are political power brokers who chairmen of local rating authorities would not like to embarrass by prosecution.<br/>Part xiii of this Edict captioned “Rating” which includes sections 103 to 146 empowers a local government area, in other words, a rating areas to impose property rating on property owners as a source of revenue raising. In Enugu state in general, and Enugu North local government in particular, weaknesses are readily discernible in the present property rating structures which in retrospect, prevents successful implementation of their service. Most of the property rating administrators at the local government headquarters is mere technicians, others basely literate which in no less measure hamper their sense of judgments as per the nature of the properties they collect data from, to be used by the rating valuers in the ministry of local government as Enugu, to arrive at the annual values of the properties. This problem was aggravated during the political era when employment opportunities were nation on political rather than qualification basis.<br/>In collation with this, most property owners in Enugu are illiterates and do not know their rights.  Most of them do not know why they should pay property rate at all. Added to this ugly situation is the ambiguity mounted by the assessors (valuation officers) in their notice to the property owners indicating the assessed value thereof. They only show the assessed annual value with out signifying the actual rate payable. When most of landlords see these, they simply deafen their ears, and blatantly refuse to pay, misconstruing the annual value as the rate payable value. They are only brought to attention of this premise by litigation, which is not the best interest of the local government, the cost and time consummations. <br/>Another factor is how to equate the rating burden of the property owners in the locality with the value of services provided by the government activity. Implicit in this problem is the question of how to improve the current deplorable situation and weakening rural development programs via sound administration of property rating revenue.     <br/>1.3       OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY           <br/>The main objective for the introduction of property rating in the local government is to raise revenue from the source. Revenue, thus generated are utilized by the local government where the tenements/properties are located to provide essential service which the government grants cannot easily take care of.<br/>      Local government provides essential services such as the supply of water and electricity, repair of wads and bridge, supplementing of the government grant for the payment of staff salaries not employed by the government. They also, have the responsibility to provide good drainage system and the planning of their local government area.<br/>It is a fact that no government could long exist without the power to levy and collect taxes.(Barlowe.R)goes on to contend that the power to tax is the one great power upon which the whole national fabric is based. It is necessary to the existence and prosperity of the nation as the air he breathes is to the natural man. Thus the taxing power provides government with the major portion of revenues they use to finance their many operations and function, and it also provides a tool they can use for various fiscal and regulatory purposes.<br/>1.4DEFINITION OF IMPORTANT TERMS<br/>A)        PROPERTY RATING:       Also known as local government value of property paid to local government coffer as an amount per naira of the dateable value of the property. It is a local government tax based in rates, which are levied on the basis of ratable values of properties.<br/>B)        RATE:           Payment for the ownership or occupation of something valuable, that is, rate is payment for the benefit derived or derivable from services.<br/>C)        RATEPAYERS:                   Ratepayers are the property owners whose properties are ratable.

These rights are<br/>(a)        Rights of use               (b)        Right of ahenate <br/>(c)        Right to claim title to              (d)       Right of assimilate, and (e)     Right to pass by succession.   These rights are referred to as “bundle of right” or  property power.<br/>RATE NAIRAGE:   Means the amount in kobo to be charged on each naira in the assessed ratable value. It is currently 10k (ten kobo) in Enugu State.<br/>STATE:         State here means Enugu State.<br/>LOCAL GOVERNMENT: “local government” where used in this thesis implies the Enugu North Local Government Area of Enugu State.<br/>APPRAISER:           In relation to rating is essentially a valuer appointed to assess the value of hereditaments in the rating authority area.<br/>HEREDITAMENT: Means any land, tenement or property which are or may become hable to any rate in respect of which valuation list is by the rating Act made possible.

Unfortunately, none of this institution was able to meet up to the standard of an average higher institution of learning of course; most of their courses were limited to civil servants. Not only that, they cannot award certificate beyond ordinary level diploma (OND). <br/>In an attempt to remedy this and advance the course being offered by the aforementioned institution and perhaps put them into acceptable standard the Ukpani  Asika administration on list April 1972, merged the former college of technology with the college of administration.  <br/>Nevertheless, the amalgamation of the two-sister school could not meet up with both the state and national needs. Administration set October, 1972, the East central state administration set up a provisional council to determine structure of the government, the appropriate structure of an autonomous institution that would produce high quality technologist and technicians, professional managerial manpower in certain subject areas that will rhyme with the state and national needs. <br/>Consequently, on 3ist may 1973, the edict no of 1973, titled” the institution of management technology Edict” was promulgated. The Edit become operational from Ist July, 1973 and thus gave birth to what is now known as the institute of management and technology (IMT) Enugu.<br/>1.1       BACKGROUD OF THE STDUY <br/>A hostel by definition is a building in which cheap food and lodging is provided for students, but unfortunately in tertiary institution in Nigeria. The never seems to be the case. This is what prompted as to research on this issue. This research, though on higher institutions, has a special reference on the institute of management and technology (IMT) Enugu. <br/>It has been established that the inadequacy of hostel accommodation has an adverse effect on then actualization of qualitative and standard education in Nigeria, universities and polytechnics, that is why we have  taken it upon our selves to find out the lapses and problems that has heralded to this problem of inadequate accommodation. <br/>More so, there are other problems which prompted us to research on this topic this include: students involvement in armed robbery <br/>Student’s involvement in prostitution <br/>High rate of disobedience by student as a result of not living in an academic environment.  <br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>The problems associated with this subject matter includes that students in higher institution are being deprived of their sociological and psychological needs as a result of poor hostel accommodation. Include the student can stay in a room impacts some psychological pains on the students, as privacy is to a large extent <br/>Further more, the academic pursuit of the students has being hindered, the students now pay less attention to studies. In I.M.T for instance, that institution has two campus and some of the students who        stay in campus two now have to risk their lives in transporting themselves to the other campus. Not only that, the students spend a lot of money in transportation and education and the under standing which the students are supposed to gain on the part of the school it self, some of the rooms which were made to accommodate students are being used as offices for the stay in the institutes. Some of the rooms are vacancy and this being wasted because of poor management all this adversely affects the student academic pursuit. <br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>This study will be concerned with the problems posed by poor hostel accommodation, as it affects the quality of education in higher institute with particular reference to the institute of management and technology, ( IMT) Enugu and these are as follows: <br/>The students lack concentration on studies as a result of deprivation of privacy <br/>Students pay less attention to studies and spend much of their time trying to make money, as the money they have, have been spent on transportation. <br/>Cultism is about to take our the academic activities that are supposed be going on in the school, as most of students who stay off campus now mix with undesirable elements and they get involved in corrupt practices  <br/>The dual campus system makes the students to be worn out before reaching their lecture halls. <br/>Administrative lapse has hindered the implementation of policies that could enhance the quality of life of the students in the hostels. <br/>The fact that apart from the hostel fees, student who stay in the hostels spend a lot of money on feeding and acquisition of other recreational facilities. <br/>Student says they bribe officials before rooms could be allocated to them.  <br/>Why school authorities fail to provide accommodation for students eg in ESUT for instance, their is no accommodation for students, lest alone saying that it is inadequate. <br/>The last but not least is for us to find out what the management is doing about the in suffivier rooms of accommodation in IMT for instance as some of the rooms that were meant to accommodation students are now being used as offices. <br/>4.1       INCLUDE: OBJECTIVE OF STUDY<br/>By and large, accommodation, irrespective of it s nature or shape lost ensure reasonable comfort and relaxation. To ensure thus, it must not be in capable of providing adequate rooms of accommodation and certain basic recreation facilities such as pipe borne water, library centers, etc. but unfortunately, most, if not all the higher institution of learning in Nigeria are devoid of some of these basic facilities and infrastructure. <br/>The school, having been more advance and nationally known, created more rooms for the creation of more departments, which paved way for admission of student and recruitment of more personal. <br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>The project will be of immense importance to the strident and authorities of tertiary institutions, especially imt as it would not only help them trace the cause and effect of accommoda5tion problem but also suggest how best to tackle them. Above all the way the researcher squarely traced and uprooted the root causes and effect before dashing out her recommendation will alert the government too quickly and precisely intervene, thus bringing the problems of poor student’s academic performance in adequate accommodation. <br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS: <br/>Does IMT have enough accommodation space f0r his student? <br/>Does inadequate hostel accommodation affect the student study habit? <br/>Does lack of hostel accommodation contributes to the unnecessary exposure of IMT female student to sugar daddy and landlord? <br/>Are students happy to be accommodation outside the two campuses? <br/>Does accommodation problem make student of IMT spend most of their money on security accommodation else where? <br/><br/>\n\nTHE PROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF MANAGEMENT OF STUDENTS HOSTEL ACCOMMODATION IN HIGHER INSTITUTIONS IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROBLEMS AND PROSPECT OF MANAGEMENT OF STUDENTS HOSTEL ACCOMMODATION IN HIGHER INSTITUTIONS IN NIGERIA", "id": 154}]
