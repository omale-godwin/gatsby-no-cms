This has led to the development of new social work techniques that seek to achieve social transformation among the youth. These innovations which are being implemented by youth empowerment organizations are important not only to the social workers that utilize them and their clients but also for the upcoming professionals and institutions that provide services to the youth. <br/>The overall objective of this paper is to unravel the emerging innovative social work techniques applied by youth empowerment organizations that seek to achieve social transformation among the youth. This study reviewed different articles related to social work techniques, social work methods, social work intervention books, youth empowerment programs, social innovations, and existing local and international literature using different material from related fields to get rich information. <br/>This study recommends documentation of emerging social work interventions in youth empowerment and development programs, sharing of information and utilization on the new techniques and methodologies among social workers working with the youth. Social workers need to be trained on how to utilize social research to enhance their capacity in technique development, and organizing regular seminars and workshops where social workers can share and learn more about the new and emerging social work interventions.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1    Background to the Study    -<br/>1.2 Statement of the Problem    -    -<br/>1.3 Objective of the Study    -<br/>1.5    Research Questions    -    <br/>1.5 Significance of Study    -<br/>1.6 Definition of Terms    -<br/>CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>2.1.

The youths form almost half of the world’s population with the majority under 25 years of age (Gribble, 2010). This population however is at a greater risk ranging from radicalization, terrorism, health among other maladjusted behaviour that put their lives and that of the community at risk.Youth empowerment ranges from economic empowerment to social, ideological, educational, technological and political empowerment.<br/>No other time is the issue of youth empowerment and development more apt than the present time where youths are faced with a lot of unprecedented challenges. In the  world  of  over  seven  billion  population,  governments  and  policy  makers  are  increasingly finding  it  difficult  to  grapple  successfully  with  youth  unemployment, corruption, insecurity , among others make the world appear to be heading towards a dangerous precipice that has defied all known economic theories. This is why theprovisions of education, critical infrastructural facilities, improved health care services, employment opportunities and stabilized economy are sine qua non for any nation that anticipates a prosperous future. <br/>Youth  empowerment  according  to  Jimba  (2006)  involves  different  ways  the  youth  can  be  facilitated  to  cause changes  in their life style. He maintained that youth empowerment means a way of inculcating into the youths the spirit of transformation of ideas into creativeness. It encompasses different ways youth can be exposed into different trades that may help them to engage in sustainable paid and self-employment.<br/>Generally the youths are considered the future of the state since they determine its future development (Cohen, 2010). However, due to changes in the social institutions like the family and other factors like industrialization, urbanization, and environmental factors, the youth now face recurrent social problems in health, unemployment, drug abuse, and so on (Gribble, 2010). Half of Africa population is made up of young people, these Africa’s youth’s live on less than $2.00 a day (Mutuku, 2011). Besides earning low-income they are also faced with challenges hard to address, research shows that poor people die premature deaths, get married at a young age, and have large families, and experience malnutrition and ill health (Mwiti, 2006). <br/>Young people in Africa are growing up in social environments where chances of living decent lives are negligible and with bleak prospects (Mutuku, 2011). These widespread challenges are “breeding” frustration, anxiety and despair, culminating in crime, drug addiction, and early pregnancy and alcoholism (Mbatia, 2009). <br/>Hopelessness and desperation has made young people be vulnerable to armed rebel or insurgent movements as experienced in some African countries today (Cramer, 2011). To address these social problems, Social workers are mandated to apply evidence-informed practices based on emerging research findings and empirical evidence to provide quality services to the young people (NASW, 2013). The young population in Nigeria constitutes of 75 percent of the total population and it is estimated that this population is under the age of 35 years (Kahl, 2012). The Nigerian government has recognized that the youth have a role in shaping the country’s social, economic and political development (Owuor, 2008). However, Nigeria continues to experience a glaring mismatch between the aspirations of its youth and the opportunities available to them despite their high hopes and ambitions. (Agenda, 2013). This is clearly demonstrated by youth unemployment which is currently estimated to be over 70 percent in Nigeria and a major concern to policy makers (Nebe, 2012).<br/>Nigeria, as one of the developing countries of the world is struggling with numerous problems at each  level  of  her  education  system,  inability  to  halt  continuous  increase  in  the  rate  of  youth unemployment,  redundant  artificial  restrictions  placed  on  self-employment,  job  creation opportunities and outright lack of social services  such as roads, water systems and electricity networks. If anything, the Nigerian youth have been denied opportunities to develop in diverse realms of humanendeavours.  Ineptitude,  mediocrity  and  intellectual  dearth  have  become  the  three hallmarks  of  the  Nigerian  youth.  In  a  national  survey  jointly  sponsored  by  the  National Universities  Commission  (NUC)  and  the  Education  Trust  Fund  (ETF)  in  2004,  61%  of  20 organizations  rated  Nigerian  science  graduates  poor in  skills  needed  in  the  work  environment such as literacy,  oral  communication,  information  technology,  entrepreneurship,  analytical, problem-solving and decision making (Okafor, 2011).<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The purpose of skill acquisition programme as a means of youth empowerment according to Ogundowolo (2008) is to prepare and equip the youths with appropriate skills that are beneficial to them in future. He maintained that ideal skill  acquisition  is  capable  of  ensuring  value  re-orientation  among  the  youths  and  transforming  them  into  creators  of wealth  and  employment  instead  or  seekers.  The  creation  of  wealth  and  employment  helps in  poverty reduction  and increase of welfare status of individuals in the country.In  line  with  the  above  view,  Ogbe  (2009)  stated  that  wealth  creation through  youth  empowerment  is expected to reverse the structural weakness and imbalances in the economy by providing strategic focus and direction and inculcating in the youths the right ethics, discipline, values, hard work, honesty, respect and humility among others. <br/>Regrettably,  the  Nigerian  youth  are  grossly  unemployed  and  their  potentials  underutilized thereby  making  development  precarious.  With  over  ten  million  almajiris (child  beggars) wandering the streets of Northern Nigeria; 23.9% ofemployable Nigerians unemployed; and 112 million Nigerians (61%) living on less than a dollar per day (Muhammed, 2012), Nigeria’s future prosperity becomes insecure. Low economic growth, low economic activity and low investment have been adduced as factors contributing  to  low  job  creation  and  due  to  increase  in  population  growth,  the  small  labourmarket is unable to absorb the resulting army of job seekers in Nigeria (Emeh, 2012). <br/>The increase  in  the  population  of  youth  who  are  not  in  education,  employment,  or training (NEET) hinders development. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, MallamSanusiLamidoSanusi, is thereforejustified to have said:<br/>…the youth constitute 18% of the world population but African countries under invest on the  youth  at  great  consequences  such  as  breeding  an unproductive  segment  who  live under the poverty line of two dollars a day.<br/>If anything, the Nigerian youth have been denied opportunities to develop in diverse realms of human endeavours. Ineptitude, mediocrity and intellectual dearth have become the three hallmarks of the Nigerian youth. In a national survey jointly sponsored by the National Universities Commission (NUC) and the Education Trust Fund (ETF) in 2004, 61% of 20 organizations rated Nigerian science graduates poor in skills needed in the work environment such as literacy, oral communication, information technology, entrepreneurship, analytical, problem-solving and decision making (Okafor, 2011).<br/>The National Youth Policy is full of platitudes and little has been done to bring it into full implementation despite several reviews of the policy since its formulation in 1981. Admittedly, the federal government noted that policy attempts hardly provided a concrete framework for addressing the heightened problems confronting the youth in the 1990’s. This was partly because the implementation mechanisms of the policy were weak and ineffective (SNYPD, 2009). Bondzi-Simpson (2011) was therefore right to have asserted that enforcement challenge undermines the rate of development in most African states. Until 2007, there was no separate ministry for youth development in the country.<br/>Governments at all levels have continued to lay claim to several jobs created. Yet, the jobs are nowhere to be found by the massive youth. Dwindling economy resulting from corrupt practices (Otumba, 2013), lack of entrepreneurial skills (Alao, 2013), job creations, marketable and productive skills (Emeh, 2012) have all been identified as the root causes of youth unemployment. The crux of the matter is that apart from the youth unemployment rate put at 23.9 percent in 2011, there is the problem of unemployable youth arising from gross incompetence. There is a wide gap between employers’ needs and employees’ skills. The commonly suggested way out from these precarious situations is youth empowerment that will drive development in several sectors of the economy.<br/>To meet up with these challenges facing the youths, different skill acquisition programmers were initiated and put in place by the Federal and State governments throughout the country to instill in them the habit of acting through repetition and practice (FGN, 2004).Prominent among the reasons for the growth and expansion of skills acquisition programmes in Nigeria was the need for the survival of the youths through self-reliance programmes. Initially, the efforts of the  government towards youth  empowerment  was  in  agricultural  production  but  as  time  went  by,  the  idea  was  diversified  into  agricultural, industrial  and  handcrafts  production  that  can  yield  income  and  make  the  youths  viable.  In recent years, in order to achieve the desired goal, different training programmes were instituted by the Federal and State government to imbibe in the youths the culture of creativity and entrepreneurship.<br/>This studyassesses youth unemployment as a growing challenge in Uselu Community as well as the Nation as a whole in the social work perspective.<br/>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The main objective of the study is to assess the impact of youth empowerment programme using the social work perspective in Uselu community.<br/>1.    To assess the impacts of youth empowerment to Uselu Community.<br/>2.    To assess factors that hinder youth empowerment in Uselu Community.<br/>3.    To identify the level of youth empowerment in Uselu community.<br/>4.    To ascertain the roles of the government to youth empowerment.<br/>5.    To ascertain the roles of social workers on youth empowerment.<br/>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.    What are the impacts of youth empowerment programmes to Uselu Community?<br/>2.    What are the factors that hinder youth empowerment in Uselu Community?<br/>3.    What is the level of youth empowerment in Uselu community?<br/>4.    What are the roles of the government to youth development?<br/>5.    What are the roles of social workers to youth development?<br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The significant of this research work are enormous. First, the work addresses one of the key issues of contemporary Nigeria. It touches areas  that  affect  the  conduct  of  democratic  principles  in  Nigerian polity  which  is  the  National  Economic  Empowerment  and Development  Strategy  (NEEDS).  Hence,  the  study  is  of  benefit  tostudents  of  international  relations,  politics,  development  studies, history, and even those in the social sciences. <br/>The importance of youth empowerment development cannot be underestimated in Uselu community.  Creation of employment opportunities and utilizing it as a major source of livelihood and income generation by youth through micro enterprises is a crucial issue. Though theconcept of youth empowerment is progressively gaining momentum within the Edo Society, various studies have much focused on the analysis of  socio-economic  conditions  and  problems  faced  by  youth,  but  the  studies  on  youth empowerment  and  their  economic  contribution  is  extremely  limited.  Problems and potentials of youth empowerment in social and economic context virtually remain untouched.<br/>Thus, this study will contribute to the growing body of knowledge in youth empowerment as it looks at the concept from a different angle.  The  findings  of  this  study  will  shed  light  on  the  challenges  and  prospects  of  youth empowerment  in  Uselu community for  the  following  stakeholders:  researchers;  policy  makers; donors;  empowerment  educators;  and  the  youth  development  practitioners  who  are enthusiastic  about  developing  youth  empowerment  in  Uselu community. This study will also aid other researchers who might want to carry out research in related area.<br/>1.6    DEFINITIONS OF TERMS<br/>Unemployment: Unemployment people are without jobs and they have actively sought work within the past five weeks.

The generally accepted definition of human trafficking is that of the United Nations which defines it as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons by means of threat or the use of force or other means of coercion, of abduction or fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or a position of vulnerability or the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include at a minimum, prostitution or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery or practice similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs. (Palermo, 2000) Thus, three main elements are at the core of this definition and they include: the actual act of trafficking including the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, associated acts such as the threat or the use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of a position of weakness or vulnerability and exploitation including at a minimum the exploitation for  prostitution (or other forms of sexual exploitation) forced labor or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs. <br/>A number of factors contribute to the phenomenon of trafficking in human beings, in particularly children in West Africa. Predominant among these are poverty, large family size, lack of educational opportunities and lack of employment. Other factors facilitating trafficking of persons in Benin, Nigeria and Togo include ignorance on the part of families and children of the risks involved in trafficking, the high demand for cheap and submissive child labour in the informal economic sector, the desire of youth for emancipation through migration, institutional lapses such as inadequate political commitment, non-existent national legislation against trafficking in human beings, and the absence of a judicial framework allowing for the perpetrators and accomplices of trafficking to be held responsible and punished for their acts. Other contributory factors in trafficking in persons in the region include porous borders, corrupt government officials, involvement of international organized crime groups or networks, limited capacity of or commitment by immigration and law enforcement officers to control trafficking at the borders and lack of political will or desire to enforce existing legislation or mandates. The vulnerability of prospective victims are exploited in many respects; the victims most of whom are pre-teens, teenagers and mostly female are taken far away from their homelands to cities within their country or across national boundaries and exploited for optimum economic benefits. Many of them are engaged in cheap labor such as domestic servants, hawkers, beggars, prostitutes or put into other forms of servitude akin to slavery. <br/>Human trafficking is a social phenomenon that is spreading across every region around the world. Human trafficking consist of the movement of people from one country to another for sexual exploitation. The persons who recruits, as well as the persons who accompany and the persons who receive them in the place of destination are traffickers. Generally, people are trafficked from developing to developed countries in search of better opportunities. A factor predisposing young women to being trafficked is the feminization of migration for income generation opportunities. Increased female migration is partly due to the feminization of poverty. The countries of origin do not have sufficient resources to provide these minors and young women with adequate employment for a life with dignity.  <br/>1.2    Statement of the problem<br/>In Nigeria, women contribute to the domestic economy as farmers, petty traders, domestic workers and homemakers. Their work is grossly undervalued and poorly rewarded, and to worsen their condition, they have no direct access to credit facilities because of low income and lack of collateral. Their lack of formal training means that they are not able to access other opportunities available in the better paying employment sectors of the economy. Consequently, women have become prime targets of recruiters involved in trafficking for sexual exploitation. Trafficking in Nigerian minors and women into Italy for prostitution started around the second half of the 1980s, following the economic difficulties caused by the structural adjustment program (Aghatise, 2002). They started leaving the country on promises of fantastic and well-paying jobs in Europe, in factories, offices and farms. They arrived in Italy only to find themselves sold into sexual slavery. They were forced to engage in prostitution. Aghatise (2002) noted that the women who were trafficked at the beginning were mainly married women or separated women on the lookout for a way to cater for their families. Later those trafficked were mainly young girls who went in search of jobs to help their families. Their aim was to go abroad to suffer for a few months, earn huge amounts of money and return home to help the family. However, the reality was often different. Some have estimated that about 80% of girls and women trafficked into Italy from Nigeria are from Edo State. This is curious because traditionally this ethnic group does not encourage prostitution (Aghatise, 2002). Girls and women trafficked from Nigeria are often made to undergo some rites in order not to reveal the identity of their traffickers and madams to the Police and to pay their “debts” without creating problems.<br/>The problem of trafficking cuts across a range of development issues, from poverty to social inclusion, to justice and rule of law issues, and thus has relevance for practitioners throughout the development community. In addition, there is insufficient information on the traffickers and their modus operandi on which operational guidelines for a national strategy can be based. In addition, social workers and law enforcement officers are not adequately trained, and victim-witness protection schemes are non-existent or have not been implemented. Absence of efficient mechanisms to support local communities in prevention activities, and for the reintegration of trafficked minors and young women, results in increased vulnerability of individuals. These issues are the concerns of this research. In response to this problem, this study proposes to investigate several options to establish various ways in the rehabilitation of victims of human trafficking in Idia renaissance, Benin City, Edo state.<br/>1.3    Objectives of the study<br/>The main objective of the study is to examine the socio-cultural factors of human trafficking, other specific objectives include:  <br/>1.    To know the level and extent of human trafficking among individuals.<br/>2.    To find out the determinants of human trafficking.<br/>3.    To find out the effects of human trafficking and its prevalence in Edo state.<br/>4.    To discover ways in which human trafficking can be drastically reduced in the society.<br/>1.4    Research questions<br/>1.    Who is at risk of human trafficking?<br/>2.    Why is the trend more prevalent in Edo state?<br/>3.    What are the challenges in factors determining human trafficking? <br/>4.    How can the high incidence of human trafficking be drastically reduced in the society?<br/>1.5    Significance of the study<br/>The completion of this study through the collection and analysis of relevant data is envisaged to provide information on the concept of human trafficking and the socio-cultural factors determining human trafficking. The scope of the concept and the extent to which the incidence occurs in the study area. The study will also acquaint us with relevant knowledge that could lead to a change in orientation, philosophies and attitude towards human trafficking. It will provide parents and government alike with information on the tactics used by traffickers to get victims and possible ways of bringing the prevalence of the incidence to itsbarest minimum as well as the various methods and rehabilitation process in dealing with victims of human trafficking. Finally, the study could serve as a trigger for further studies into the occurrence of the socio-cultural factors determining human trafficking in OredoLocal Government Areas of Edo state and the country at large.  <br/>1.6 Area of study<br/>This study will be conducted among the oredo local government area of edo state.

The current study was conducted to investigate the socio-economic impacts of unemployment on youths development in Egor local government area of Edo state, Nigeria. Five research hypotheses were formulated and tested in line with the research objectives at 0.05 level of significance. Self – completed structured questionnaire was used to collect data from randomly selected 150 respondents. However, 92 copies of questionnaire were valid for data analysis, given a response rate of 92%. The data collected were analyzed using simple frequency, percentage and chi-square techniques. The chi-square test, indicates a significant fit between unemployment and socio-economic development of Nigeria youths. In other words, majority of the respondents believed that unemployment affects the socio – economic status of the unemployed, which leads to criminality, dishonesty and other negative social vices. On the basis of this findings, the study concludes that unemployment among youths is high in Nigeria with the tendency of causing pervasive poverty, youth uneasiness, high rate of social vices and criminal activities if not controlled. The study therefore, recommends urgent intervention of government at local, state and federal level to curb the menace<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 Background to the study    -    -<br/>1.2 Statement of the Problem    -    -    <br/>1.3 Research Questions    -    <br/>1.4.

Unemployment is one of the major challenges facing developed and some developing countries. As it is been usually phrased, the phenomenon of Graduate unemployment (GU) in the developing countries constitute an unusual problems to labour market and the general economy of these countries. (Sulaimon, Rahim, Akintunde, &amp;Ajiroba, 2016).<br/>    Nigeria's current unemployment situation is short of expectations, such that a large percentage of educated, able and qualified citizens cannot secure paid employment (Omotosho, 2009). This indicate that Nigeria over the years has steadily crumbled from its extremely resilient and esteemed position among developing nations (Ipaye, 1998).<br/>     According toOye, Ibrahim and Ahmad (2011), the state of unemployment demoralizes and increases the need of those who are able and enthusiastic to work but cannot find jobs.One of the major concerns of various administrations in Nigeria is the growing rate of unemployment in the country and it has consistently form part of the macroeconomic objectives of the government for the past decades (Omotosho, 2009). According to the World Bank Report (1993), the growing trend of employment and productivity of the Asian Tigers and Japan is responsible for their enviable and brilliant economic performance. Evidently, absence of the necessary framework to enhance employment and productivity level in Nigeria is the sole cause of the retard nature of Nigeria, the acclaimed giant of Africa. The trend and problem of unemployment in Nigeria remains obstinate with a tendency of growing geometrically to alarming rate of 3 million unemployed youth annually (Adelodun, 2006).<br/>    The trend of unemployment in Nigeria has a devastating effect on the youths from an extensive gamut of socioeconomic clusters, both the highly and less educated, even though it has mainly troubled a sizeable portion of youths from less privilege backgrounds (Ipaye, 1998). According to Adebayo and Ogunrinola, (2006), unemployment trend in Nigeria touches the job seekers within the ages of 20 - 24 and 25 - 44 years more while there is fewer prevalence of unemployment within the ages of 15 -19, 55 - 59 and 65 years and above. The rate of open unemployment was 12% in March 2005; it rose to 19.7% in March 2009 while the rate of underemployment hovered around 19% in 1998 (National Bureau of Statistics, 2010). From this point of view, it is apparent that unemployment, particularly the unemployment of young graduates, hinders Nigeria's progress in so many ways. Aside from economic issue, it also creates eminent danger for political stability of our dear country (Ipaye, 1998). Consequently, massive youth unemployment as it is presently recorded in Nigeria portends a serious multifaceted problems and the threat of unemployment has gradually been acknowledged as a pressing Nigeria (Ipaye. 1998,Udu&amp;Ugu. 2005).<br/>    According to Umaru and Zubairu (2001), unemployment has been recognized as one of the major impediments to social-economic growth in most developing countries. It reduces the aggregate output of the economy and results in underutilization of human resources. The need to avert the negative effects of u7nemployment has made the tacklingof unemployment problems of feature very prominently in the development objective of developing countries (Omotor&amp;Gbosi 2006). The issue of real output and employment growth in developing nations is a sine qua non for poverty reduction and a more equitable income distribution (Fofana, 2001). Omotor and Gbosi (2006) noted that the seriousness and nature of unemployment in Nigeria is relatively high when placed on the same pedestal with those of other African countries. According to them, in absolute terms; it is estimated that there are presently about 22 million youths unemployed in Nigeria.<br/>1.2        STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>    Unemployment constitutes a serious socio-economic problem in Nigeria and is really a tragic condition that requires urgent and proactive attention. Indeed, it is alarming and worrisome to observe that Nigeria's graduates who are educated, able and willing to work cannot find a job. The situation is becoming hopeless, as the rate of unemployment keep rising without any proactive attempt to curb the menace (Kayode, Samuel &amp; Silas, 2014). The trend of events in Nigeria, most especially, the falling oil prices, economic recession, insurgence in the Northern parts of the country among other factors. As a matter of fact, unemployment is one of the major developmental challenges facing Nigeria at the moment (Ipaye, 1998). Obadan and Odusola (2010) have found that the prevalence of unemployment in Nigeriaespecially in this 21st century is getting deeper and more pathetic, spiteful through ail faces of age groups, educational level and geographical spread.<br/>    The challenge of youth unemployment is very presence in Nigeria, because every year thousands of graduates are turnout for whom there are no jobs opportunity (Emeka, 2011). Hence, the Nigerian labour markets are beleaguered with youth hawkers who typically would have found beneficial employment in some organizations (Echebiri, 2005; Uwoma, 2006). Given the large percentage of unemployed youths, the trend of unemployment is capable of destabilizing peace as they portend a serious threat in view of nascent democracy and blatant disregard for party politics (Adepegba, 2011).<br/>Unemployment has negative consequence on the physical well-being of the peoples. The unemployed have high tendency to experience such feelings as downheartedness, melancholy, anger, acrimony and mortification (Goldney 1997). In addition, different form of misconducts like deceit, fraud, robbery and ferocity usually occur in a society with large number of unemployed populace. Britt (1994), Weich and Lewis (1998) and Reynolds (2000) studies have documented other forms of mental and health disorders, such as drug abuse, sexual assault, unwanted pregnancy, prostitution, and psychosomatic with unemployment.<br/>    Compounding the challenges further is the absence of reliable statistics on the level of unemployment, as no organization has so far produce precise figures presenting the current unemployment rate in Nigeria (Udu&amp;Agu, 2005), as in most occasion, the figures released by National Bureau of Statistics, and the World Bank, appeared contradictory. The reasons, alluded to the contradiction in employment statistics according to Raheen (1993), is the fact that only open unemployment is recognized and published by the official statistics. A review of extant reveals that most studies conducted on Nigeria's employment nature and structure situation have been largely devoted to unemployment and its determinants and or its impacts on economic growth (Adebayo &amp;Ogunrinola, 2006; Omotor&amp;Gbosi 2006). However, to the best knowledge of the author of this study, not much research attention has been given to the investigation of socio-economic effects of unemployment in Nigeria. Thus, the aforementioned challenges that motivated this study include the seemingly unabated high rate of unemployment in the country, the negative effect of unemployment on economic growth, the traumatizing effect of unemployment on Nigeria graduates and not being able to specify the exact causes of unemployment peculiar to Nigeria.<br/>1.3. RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.    What are the causes of unemployment in Nigeria? <br/>2.    What are the economic impactof unemployment in Nigeria? <br/>3.     What are the suitable ways to end unemployment in Nigeria?<br/>1.4.OBJECTIVESOF THE STUDY<br/>The main objective of the study is to ascertain the impact of unemployment on youth in Nigerian. <br/>1.    To identify the Causes of unemployment in Nigeria<br/>2.    To determine the economic Effects of unemployment in Nigeria. <br/>3.    To proffer possible solutions to unemployment problems in Nigeria based on the research finding.<br/>1.5.     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>    Owing to the down turn in the economic fortunes of this country over the years, the Nigerians have lost their pride of place, their status in the society has continued to dwindle. <br/>    Today, it is sheer mirage for fresh graduates to dream of the good things of life. They are made to understand and accept that the graduates, unemployment should be seen as a passing phase in the history of the nation. It is very doubtful if the much desired change in the near future will bring us anything. Therefore, this study is aimed at showing how these effects of unemployment have on socio-economic growth in Nigeria economy. <br/>    In conclusion, the findings of this work will help young graduates to know that white man’s job or white collar’s job as it is sometimes called is not the only means of survival. It will also stand as a guideline to them on the best way to live instead of engaging in social vices and also provide them with some ways of being self-employed, self-sufficient and even employing others.<br/>1.6.     DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>    In this aspect we are concerned about the impact of unemployment and it socio-economic effect on youth.<br/>    According to the Advanced Learner Dictionary, unemployment is defined as the amount of labour unused. When factor of production is not doing any job, we say it is unemployed. <br/>Unemployment is a very dangerous phenomenon to an industrialized economic system. Future primitive communities in Nigeria was usually self-sufficient and no unemployment problem through their standard of living is a very low living.<br/>The following terms are identified and defined as they are used in this study; <br/>•    Employment: This is the state of being employed, it is when work is being done in order to earn money or a living. It can also be seen as the act of being employed in an institution or organization to perform some certain duties and earn money at the end.<br/>•    Unemployment: This is a situation whereby one is able and willing to work at a prevailing wage rate but does not have work, or is not being engaged into any meaningful or well rewardable venture. <br/>•    Employed: This is the condition or instance of being engaged into any meaningful, gainful and rewarding venture or activity in a place, and it also means persons in this situation of being engaged into meaningful activities. <br/>•    Unemployed: This is the situation of not having a work or the issue of staying idle, not having job, and secondly it also means persons in this situation of not having a work, staying idle or not having job. <br/>•    Unemployment rate: This is the percentage of labour force without jobs but they are willing and available for work. <br/>•    Poverty: This is a living condition in which an individual is unable to take care of his or her basic needs like financials, clothing, food, shelter, inability to meet social and economic obligations, lack of gainful employment and other environmental opportunities at his or her disposal. <br/>•    National Income: This is the total amount of income given to a country from economic activities especially on imports and exports transactions usually in a given year or the total value of goods and services produced annually in a country.<br/>•    Economy: This is the relationship between production, trade and supply of money and consumption (and it patterns) in a particular area or region. <br/>•    Economic Development: This refers to the concentrated actions of policy makers and communities that promote the standard of living and economic health of a specific area. It can also be referred to as the qualitative and quantitative changes in the economy. <br/>•    Development: This is the improvement of something that is being regarded to the gradual change or growth of something that it becomes mores advance. <br/>•    Society: This means the particular communities of people, who share the same customs, laws, believes etc. <br/>•    Underutilization: This is when factors of production such as labour, capital and material resources like raw materials and funds are been used with very little or no capacity. <br/>•    Mobilization: This is the act of moving people, factors of production such as labour and capital, resources and other tangible and intangible materials from one place to another where they are needed or to be useful<br/><br/>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF UNEMPLOYMENT ON YOUTH SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF UNEMPLOYMENT ON YOUTH SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN EDO STATE", "id": 3}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE IMPACT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ON SCHOOL CHILDREN: A STUDY OF SELECTED SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>Domestic violence is the intentional and persistent abuse of anyone in the home in a way that causes pain, distress or injury (Ahie, 2009). As a social malady, domestic violence cuts across both the developed and developing nations of the world. Given it's global nature, domestic violence has caught the attention of relevant stakeholders including national and state governments of countries, both local and international health organizations, child right groups and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and of course the academics. As such, The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) (2006) asserts that domestic violence is a global problem of enormous proportions. For Adebayo (2014), domestic violence transcends national, cultural, racial and class boundaries.<br/>Despite being a global phenomenon, domestic violence in Nigeria as in most other African societies presents a peculiar case, in view of two obtaining interrelated realities. Firstly, the Nigerian society is traditionally patriarchal in nature, a reality which reinforces male- dominance and female subordination (Makama, 2013). Secondly, there is a high level of dependency in Nigeria (Zaggi, 2014; Nwakeze&amp;Omoju, 2011). The National Bureau of Statistics and UNICEF (2007) reports that the dependency ratio for Nigeria stands at 91%, meaning that a huge number of women, children and old-aged Nigerians depend on working class people, most of whom are men, given the employment structure tilted towards men.<br/>Putting the above two realities of a male-dominated society and the high dependence of other members of the family on males, what we have is a case of largely unchecked and unreported incidence on domestic violence perpetrated mostly by men towards other members of the family in Nigeria. In view of the traditionally reinforced male-dominance and the fact that domestic violence thrives on an existing relationship of dependence of the victims on the abusers, Ahie (2009) reports that domestic violence is culturally acceptable in Nigeria. In fact, Ahie (2009) points out that domestic violence functions as a means through which men enforce the conformity of women to their decidedly subordinate role in the customarily patriarchal Nigerian society.<br/>One of the most basic features of domestic violence is that it takes place within the home or family which is has been variously identified as the first context of socialization of the child (Driscoll &amp; Nagel, 2011; Nguyen, 2011). This places children as a vulnerable group in the center of domestic violence either witnessing violence; exposed to violence; experiencing direct abuse; hearing or seeing violence; and living with domestic violence. As such, Ahie (2009) points out that children are often principal victims of domestic violence. In a similar perspective, Finkelhor, Turner, Ormrod and Hamby (2009) acknowledge that children suffer higher rates of exposure to violence and crime than do adults, and such exposure is responsible for a considerable burden of physical and mental health morbidity. In the first ever global study on children exposure to domestic violence, UNICEF (2006) report that as many as 275 million children worldwide are exposed to violence in the home.<br/>Futures Without Violence (2008) points out the widely acclaimed and undisputed view that growing up in a violent home may be a terrifying and traumatic experience that can affect every aspect of a child's life, growth and development. This is because, child development is expected to occur within a secure and nurturing family and home environment. When domestic violence is present and becomes the norm, the environment is infected with tension and fear, wherein the normal tasks of growing up are likely to be adversely affected.<br/>For Nigeria, Olupohunda (2014) report that domestic violence is known to tear families apart, but the effects on children's emotional and academic development are much worse. Idogo (2011) opine that early childhood victimization, either through direct abuse, neglect, or witnessing parental domestic violence, has been shown to have demonstrable long-term consequences for antisocial behaviour, youth violence, adult violence tendencies, and other forms of criminality in the long run.<br/>Children in Nigeria are caught in the middle and exposed to domestic violence, leaving the children and the society at large have to deal with the adverse life-long sequelae that comes with it. In view of the high incidence of domestic violence in Nigerian families and its adverse consequences for children it becomes  imperative to identify the specific impacts it has on the children. In this regard, this study investigates the multifaceted toll domestic violence exerts on in-school children in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Nigeria faces epic proportions of violence. Thus, Musa (2014a) reports that Nigeria as a country is increasingly being plagued with several forms of violence, the most prominent being the spate of Boko Haram terrorism, sectarian and religious violence, ethnic and communal clashes. Musa (2014b) identifies the visible negative consequence of such violence to include residential compartmentalisation; destroyed and damaged landmarks and properties; hostile interpersonal relationship especially among persons of different religious affiliation; inability to freely visit and access certain streets, markets and business premises by reason of religious belongingness; high level distrust, acrimony, rivalry and enmity among the populace.<br/>CLEEN Foundation (2013) report that domestic violence ranks amongst the top four most common victimizations in Nigeria.Amnesty International (2005) report that domestic violence is the most prevalent form of violence against Nigerian women. Thus, on a daily basis, women are beaten, acid-bathed, raped and ill-treated for supposed transgressions, leading to sustained physical injuries, protracted emotional and psychological disorders, horrific disfigurements and in extreme cases, death. The problem of domestic violence in Nigeria is a peculiar one in view of other undesirable realities that coexist with the problem especially poverty, given that most Nigerian households are poor. As such Imhonde, Aluede and Oboite (2009) opine that poor families are more likely to be affected by domestic violence than relatively high-income homes.<br/>Another peculiarity of domestic violence problem in Nigeria is the most prevalent form of violence that it is not being recognized as a grave problem that needs to be systemically dealt with. As such, Ahie (2009) points out that there is some acceptance of some abusive behaviour such as wife battering and harsh discipline of children as 'normal' in the Nigerian society. In a similar perspective, Adebayo (2014) holds that violence is too frequently excused and tolerated in Nigerian communities, with husbands, partners and fathers being responsible for most of the violence against women.<br/>One other peculiarity of the domestic violence problem in Nigeria is that it is either unreported or under-reported. Ahie (2009) reports that victims of domestic violence in Nigeria do not report for fear of reprisal from abusers or the belief that the police and the judicial system cannot help, with law enforcement agencies usually dismissing complaints of domestic violence as a \"private matter\" or more popularly, \"husband and wife\" or \"boyfriend and girlfriend\" matter. In a similar vein, Adebayo (2014) reports that victims of domestic violence are often embarrassed to  report such incidences to the right agencies for justice.<br/>Children as one of the most vulnerable groups suffers a sizeable burden of the ripple effects of domestic violence. As such, Adebayo (2014) posits that domestic violence as a social malady threatens the stable and balanced psychological development of children in the Nigerian society, as children raised in violent homes are known to imbibe violent tendencies as they grow up. The above view corroborates one of major findings by UNICEF (2006) that is a strong likelihood that domestic violence results in a cycle of violence for the next generation, given that the single best predictor of children becoming either perpetrators or victims of domestic violence later in life is whether or not they grow up in a home where there is domestic violence.<br/>For children who live in households with domestic violence, Imhonde, Aluede and Oboite (2009) identifies serious negative effects to include aggression, phobias, insomnia, low self-esteem, depression, low level of social competence, poor academic performance. Despite these undesirable outcomes, the UNICEF (2006) in the first ever global study on domestic violence and children, points out that collecting reliable data on this hidden issue poses several challenges, as in almost every country there is limited data available on the prevalence of domestic violence, and even less information on the numbers of children who may be exposed to such violence.<br/>For Nigeria, UNICEF Nigeria (2011) report that reliable data on violence against children in Nigeria is scarce because violence is often not reported as it occurs mostly within the context where it is regarded as 'normal' such as within the family circle or behind the privacy of homes. National-wide studies as well as studies focusing on the incidence and impact of domestic violence on in-school children in Nigeria are either few or inaccessible. This is a major research gap that this study intends to fill. With focus on in-school secondary children in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State, this study will establish the incidence and impacts of domestic violence on in-school children.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>This study primarily aims to investigate the impacts of domestic violence on secondary school children. In this regard, this study specifically aims to:<br/>1.    Ascertain the level of domestic violence to which secondary schoolchildren are exposed.<br/>2.    Determine if domestic violence has a significant impact on the learning processes and outcomes of secondary school children.<br/>3.    Ascertain if domestic violence has a significant impact on the social competence and interpersonal relations of secondary school children.<br/>4.    Establish if domestic violence has a significant impact on the aggressive/non-aggressive behavioral tendencies of secondary school children.<br/>5.    Establish if domestic violence has a significant impact on the health behavior of secondary school children as regards to sexual activity and alcohol use.<br/>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>The fundamental research question posed in this study is: What is the impact of domestic violence on secondary schoolchildren? Specifically, the following research questions were asked to guide the study:<br/>1.    What is the level of domestic violence to which secondary students are exposed?<br/>2.    Does domestic violence have a significant impact on the learning processes and outcomes of secondary school students?<br/>3.    Does domestic violence have a significant impact on the social competence and interpersonal relations of secondary school students?<br/>4.    Does domestic violence have a significant impact on the aggressive/non-aggressive behavioral tendencies of secondary school students?<br/>5.    Does domestic violence have a significant impact on the health behavior of secondary school students as regards to sexual indulgence and alcohol abuse?<br/>1.5    RESEARCH HYPOTHESES<br/>In line with our research questions, the following research hypotheses were formulated to further guide our study:<br/>HO1: Secondary school children are exposed to a significantly low level of domestic violence.<br/>HO2: Domestic violence has no significant impact on the learning processes and outcomes of secondary school children.<br/>HO3: Domestic violence has no significant impact on the social competence and interpersonal relations of secondary school children.<br/>HO4: Domestic violence has no significant impact on the aggressive/non-aggressive behavioral tendencies of secondary school children.<br/>HO5: Domestic violence has no significant impact on the health behavior of secondary school children as regards to sex and alcohol use.<br/>1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The relevance of this study is fundamentally underscored by its focus on in-school secondary school students, most of whom are still within childhood and adolescence, both phases being very delicate and critical stages of one's life, requiring significant emotional investments and social support especially from home. Such required level of emotional investments and social support from home is usually absent in homes where domestic violence is the norm. Moreover, the secondary school age or phase is crucial as most children begin to make decisions and choices, thereby forming lifestyles for themselves, which affects them presently and very well into adulthood. Thus, it becomes imperative to systemically identify the impacts domestic violence have on secondary school students.<br/>The relevance of this study is also reinforced by the relatively slim body of literature on the subject matter, despite children being identified as a very vulnerable group of domestic violence and the grossly adverse consequences it has both for the growth and development of the child as an individual adult and collectively for the society. In this regard, this study attempts to establish the level of exposure of in-school children to domestic violence as well as the consequences of such exposure for various aspects of students' lives. Thus, this study adds to the slim body of research literature on the subject matter, and is expected to be of benefit to researchers in related investigations and analysis.<br/>Finally, the results and recommendations of the study will form critical inputs for decision makers, policy actors and school administrations in coming up with effective awareness campaigns to draw the attention of the Nigerian public to the existence of the problem, and also develop a framework within which domestic violence can be reported and dealt with within the rubric of law enforcement agencies and the judicial system.<br/>1.7    SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY<br/>The scope of this research study covers all secondary school students in Edo State. For our empirical field study, students will be randomly chosen from selected secondary schools in EgorLGA of Edo State.<br/>A major constraint faced by this study is the slim background of scholarly works on this research area which poses a huge constraint to this study. Closely related is the inaccessibility of the few works that exist as another major constraint on this study in terms of the extra time and cost of obtaining relevant materials for referential and review purposes.<br/>Another major constraint faced by this study is that domestic violence in Nigeria is regarded as a \"private matter\" which the children might be reluctant to talk about, being a very traumatic experience for them. This might affect the openness and objectivity of the sampled students, which could adversely affect the results of our study. Also, the research is also constrained by the time and cost of obtaining primary data from our field study for analysis.<br/>1.8    OPERATIONALIZATION OF TERMS<br/>In the context of this study, the following terms are the operational definitions were adopted:<br/>Impact: A significant or strong influence of something on another.<br/>Domestic Violence: A pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship that is used by one partner to gain or maintain power and control over another intimate partner, involving physical, sexual, emotional, economic, or psychological actions or threats of actions.<br/>Secondary School Students: These are students enrolled in classes of the junior and secondary school levels covering from junior secondary school one (JSS1) to junior secondary school three (JSS3) for use junior category and from senior secondary school one (SSS1) to senior secondary school three (SSS3).<br/><br/>\n\nTHE IMPACT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ON SCHOOL CHILDREN: A STUDY OF SELECTED SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE IMPACT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ON SCHOOL CHILDREN: A STUDY OF SELECTED SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO ", "id": 4}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>SOCIOCULTURAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH INFANT AND CHILD SURVIVAL IN AN AFRICAN COMMUNITY USING AGBARHO<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), a measure of child survival, is considered to be one of the strongest indications of a country’s well being, as it reflects social, economic and environmental conditions in which children (and others in society) live, including their health care. (Alderman and Behrman, 2004: vii).<br/>Infant and child mortality remain disturbingly high in developing countries despite the significant decline in most parts of the world. The state of the world’s children indicated that about 12.9 million children die every year in developing world (UNICEF, 1987). Also, the Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS), 1990 reported that 87 0f 1000 infants born in Nigeria die before reaching age five (FOS, 1992). The 1999 NDHS reported an infant mortality rate of 75 deaths per 1000 live births and under-five mortality rate of 140 deaths per 1000 live births for the 1995 to 1999 period.<br/>Also, review of trends in under five mortality rates between 1960 and 1998 by UNICEF (2000), based on an estimate of 187 deaths per 1000 for 1998 indicates a 10 percent reduction in Nigeria.<br/>According to the Nigeria Demographic and Health Service (NDHS), 1999, infant mortality and under five mortality rates for the ten years period preceding the survey for the South Western part of Nigeria, are 70 per 1000 and 102 per 1000 live birth respectively (NPC, 2000). The level of improvement in infant and child mortality in Nigeria as a whole is significantly lower than the average of 34 percent for Sub-Sahara Africa. And according to 2014 reports by UNICEF, 20 percent of child deaths in Sub-Sahara Africa occur in Nigeria. A development that has increasingly made Nigeria the cynosure of all eyes during global discussions on child mortality issues.<br/>At the beginning of this millennium, countries of the world agreed to reduce by two-thirds the under-five mortality rate by the year 2015. Between 2009 and 2011, the under-five mortality rate has dropped by about 45 percent globally. However, this progress is not the reality for all countries. Currently about half of the world’s under-five death occur in five countries: Nigeria, India, Congo, Pakistan and China.<br/>Despite our collective efforts, under-five mortality rate Nigeria has increased rather than reducing in the recent years. The multiple indicator cluster survey (MICSH) report indicated that the under-five mortality in Nigeria increased from 138 per 1000 live births in 2007 to 158 per 1000live births in 2011. This implies that 158 out of every 1000 children born in Nigeria will die before they celebrate their fifth birthday.<br/>Unfortunately, a majority of these deaths are due to preventable causes which could be averted by a variety of simple methods.<br/>Moreover, the importance of mother’s education for child survival through pathways other than enhanced socioeconomic status was brought into focus by Caldwell’s (1979) seminal paper on Nigeria. This paper argued that education of women played an important role in determining child survival even after control for number of factors, including such socioeconomic characteristics of the husband, as his education level and occupation.<br/>Other studies also show that increased levels of mother’s education were associated with improved chances of child survival in a wide range of developing countries: Hobercraft et al. (1984) covered 28 WFS surveys.  Mensch et al (1985) covered 15 countries. They also found that the association of maternal education and child survival was approximately the same in rural and urban areas.<br/>There are also overwhelming evidence that the strong and persistent associations of infants and child mortality with birth spacing are barely mediated by maternal education.<br/>It is in the light of these overwhelming facts available to us concerning the alarming rate if infant and child mortality in Nigeria in the presence and abundance of a myriads of solution that I present this work as a means to providing the awareness needed to sensitize the general public and specialized personnel’s on the pathway of escape from the societal plague of infant and child mortality in Nigeria.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Seventy percent of deaths in children below the age of five years in Sub-Saharan Africa are attributable mainly to these conditions; Malaria, Measles, Malnutrition, Diarrhea diseases, acute respiratory tract infection esp. Pneumonia and HIV infection. Consequently, this project work tries to answer the following:<br/>The socio-cultural factors that affects the survival of infants in Nigeria on a careful observation seem to have a parallel to those elsewhere in Africa. This is so due to the reason that while infant mortality may have been recorded on a large scale in Sub-Sahara Africa, it is also true that Africa and Nigeria in particular has recorded steady infant survival across communities that lack the access to basic primary health care facilities. This is evident from the steadily increasing population of Nigeria in particular and Africa at large. Hence, there readily comes to mind the question of what have been the factors responsible for the survival of infants and children in Africa despite overwhelming odds? <br/>What simple methods has mothers and caregivers applied consistently overtime to sustain the survival of their infants and children under five years as this is the most sensitive stage in the life of a child.<br/>1.3    AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of this research study is as follows;<br/>i.    To explore and analyze the social factors promoting infant and child survival<br/>ii.    To explore and encourage the cultural factors/practices that promotes better infant and child health<br/>iii.    To identify the reasons for neglect of sociocultural factors supporting better chances of infant and child survival.<br/>iv.    Finally, to identify the role of mothers and care givers in the administration and promotion of child survival strategies, and to encourage such.<br/>HYPOTHESIS/ASSUMPTION<br/>The researcher wants to find out how much the following questions apply to the study area.<br/>1.    How and to what extent can socio-cultural factors such as access to qualitative healthcare, maternal education, good weaning practices etc. influence the level of infant and child survival? <br/>2.    Could the level of infant and child survival be affected by religious and traditional beliefs? <br/>3.    In what ways and to what extent does early child immunization and adequate maternal/family care affect the overall survival of children in Africa?<br/>4.     In what ways and to what extent does early child immunization and adequate maternal/family care affect the overall survival of children in Africa?  <br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY    <br/>Infant and child survival rate which is also a reflection of infant mortality rate is considered to be one of the strongest in indicators of a country’s wellbeing, as it reflects social, economic and environmental conditions in which the citizenry of that country lives. Therefore, this study will serve as a useful tool towards provision of awareness and sensitization aimed at improving infant and child survival in Nigeria, which could be a way towards enhancing better government health policies and adoption of positive cultural practices.<br/>1.5       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>In this study, the researcher aims at investigating the relationship between socio-cultural factors and infant/child survival.<br/>The area covered in this study will be some homes, market places and also churches within Agbarho, Ughelli-North local government area of Delta state. <br/>The subject for this study would be mothers, guardians and other significant others. The time for the study would cover a two week period after the second semester final exams of the University of   Benin in the 2013/2014 academic session. <br/>1.6    LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>Sourcing for the materials for the work is expensive and the time available for the work is too short. This might have an effect on the study and on its level of coverage.<br/><br/>\n\nSOCIOCULTURAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH INFANT AND CHILD SURVIVAL IN AN AFRICAN COMMUNITY USING AGBARHO<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SOCIOCULTURAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH INFANT AND CHILD SURVIVAL IN AN AFRICAN COMMUNITY USING AGBARHO", "id": 5}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>SEX EDUCATION AND ADOLESCENT UPBRINGING IN BENIN CITY <br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>Sex education is the provision of information about bodily development, sex, sexuality and relationships, along with skills-building to help young people communicate about and make informed decisions regarding sex and their sexual health (Bridge &amp; Hauser, 2014). Sex education includes information about puberty and reproduction, abstinence, contraception and condom, relationship, sexual violence prevention, body image, gender identity and sexual orientation. Sex education is informed by evidence of what works best to prevent unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Sex education treats sexual development as a normal, natural part of human development. It is widely accepted that young people have a right to sexeducation because it provides accurate, complete and developmentally appropriate information on human sexuality, including risk-reduction strategies and contraception which help young people take steps to protect their health, including delaying sex, using condom or contraception and being monogamous. Providing an effectivesex education helps to meet young people’s rights to information about matters that affect them,their right to have their needs met and to help them enjoy their sexuality and the relationshipsthat they form.<br/>Sex education also helps equip young people with the skills to be able to differentiatebetween accurate and inaccurate information, and to discuss a range of moral and social issuesand perspectives on sex and sexuality, including different cultural attitudes and sensitive issueslike sexuality, abortion and contraception.Akerele (2010) opined that “sex is something you do, sexuality is something you are.” This wayof understanding sex highlights the difference between the act of sex and the individualexperience of sexuality, which is an intrinsic part of who we are, one that can’t be separated outof ourselves any more than our ethnicity or religious/spiritual beliefs.Sexuality is a natural andprecious aspect of life, an essential and fundamental part of our humanity. For people to attainthe highest standard of health,they must first be empowered to exercise choice in their sexualand reproductive lives; they must feel confident and safe in expressing their own sexual identity.<br/>Providing information through sex education is therefore about finding out what young peoplealready know and adding to their existing knowledge and correcting any misinformation theymay have. For example, young people may have heard that condoms are not effective againstHIV or that there is a cure for AIDS. It is important to provide information which correctsmistaken beliefs. Without correct information young people can put themselves at greaterrisk.Information is also important as the basis on which young people can developwell-informed attitudes and views about sex and sexuality. Young people need to have information onall the following topics:<br/>•    Sexual development &amp; reproduction - the physical and emotional changes associated withpuberty and sexual reproduction, including fertilization and conception, as well assexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS.<br/>•    Contraception &amp; birth control - what contraceptives there are, how they work, howpeople use them, how they decide what to use or not, and how they can be obtained.<br/>•    Relationships - what kinds of relationships there are, love and commitment, marriage andpartnership and the law relating to sexual behaviour and relationships as well as the rangeof religious and cultural views on sex and sexuality and sexual diversity (Akerele, 2010).<br/>Sex education is a widely used approach to prevent sexually transmitted infection andreproductive health promotion. Comprehensive sex education is effective at assisting youngpeople to make healthy decisions about sex and to adopt healthy sexual behaviour (Bridges, 2014).<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>There is increase problem in Nigeria today as to moral laxity, promiscuity, unwanted pregnancy, abortion, Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI), forced marriage, school dropout etc. among youths. According to Busari (2003), Physical, psychological, and social attribute of adolescence make youngpeople particularly vulnerable to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections(STIs).The increase of these problems according Orieh (1981) has been attributed to ignorance of youth about sex education, confusion and frustration resulting from lack of awareness of both the home and the school about the need for sex education in the educational setting. Hence, the relevance of sex education in our educational setting is the justification of the study. <br/>Nowadays, with rapid growth of information,sex information is everywhere. Adolescents are curious about sex. Their curiosity is inevitable, and they are often or not provided with accurate answers on the issues for them. Adolescents often are not able to comprehend fully their exposure to risk. Societies oftencompound young people’s risk by making it difficult for them to learn about sex andreproductive health. Therefore, parents and teachers need to instil correct concepts of sex to adolescents as early as possible before they are misled byindecent magazines and irresponsible media. Moreover, many youth are socially inexperienced and dependent on others,peer pressure often influence them often in a way that can influence their risk. The researcher has observed that when adolescents are not given or provided the necessary information about sex, it places them at risk of gettingpregnant, abortion or even contracting a sexually transmitted disease which make it a problem.When adolescents grow up, they need to learn andadapt to the physiological and psychological changes in different stages of development. The learningobjectives of sex education vary with the age of children and the environment. They need appropriateand continuous counselling and guidance. Parents and teachers are the core people who accompany the children during their adolescence stage asthey grow up, so, parents are also the most appropriate person to give their children sexeducation. The earlier sex education is given at home and in schools, the earlier the adolescent children are able to establish correct concepts on sex, and the easier the parents can handle the situation.<br/>1.3 RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>The study will attempt to answer the following questions:<br/>1) What are the effects of sex education on adolescent?<br/>2) What is the risk associated with sexual activity among adolescent?<br/>3) What are adolescent attitudes toward sex education?<br/>4) What are the barriers to teaching sex education?<br/>1.4    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The central main objective of this study is to:<br/>a)    Examine the impact of sex education on adolescent in secondary school.<br/>b)    To identify the risk associated with sexual activity among adolescent.<br/>c)    To examine the attitude of adolescent toward sex education.<br/>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study will focus on the role of sex education in secondary schools across Benin City. It is equally the belief of findings from this study to identify the importance of teaching sex education. Its implication as well as addressing of social problems confronting our adolescents or teenagers in the secondary school. Teaching of sex education is believed to initiate acceptable intervention programme aimed at addressing the social problems such as broken home, rape, prostitution, teenage pregnancy etc. Findings from the study will further enhance the knowledge and understanding of sex education as well as increase the awareness. It will also assist other researchers with relevant information for further research and studies, hence its relevance for our library. Furthermore, it is hoped that the findings in this study will afford education stakeholders and policy makers the opportunity to appreciate the benefit of teaching sex education in Nigerian secondary schools.<br/>1.6 AREA OF THE STUDY    <br/>Benin City is a city and the capital of Edo state in the southwest part of Nigeria. It is situated approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) north of the Benin River and 320 kilometres (200 mi) by road east of Lagos. The Binis are known for bronze sculpture, its casting and their arts and craft. Benin City is also the home of one of the oldest sustained monarchies in the world. Various festivals are held in Benin City yearly to celebrate various historic occasions and seasons. Benin City is the centre of Nigeria’s rubber industry, and oil production is also a significant industry. Benin City has both public and private secondary schools of different categories which includes, Edo college, Edo Boys High School (Adolo College), Western Boys High School, Garrick Memorial Secondary School, AsoroGrammar School, EghosaGrammar School, EdokpolorGrammar School, Niger College, Presentation National High School, Immaculate Conception College, Idia College, University Of Benin Demonstration School, University Preparatory Secondary SCHOOL, Auntie Maria College, Benin Technical College, Headquarters of Word of Faith Group of schools, Lydia Group of Schools, Nosakhere Model Education Centre and Igbinedion Educational Centre, Federal Government Girls College, Paragon Comprehensive College, Itohan Girls Grammar School.

Juvenile crime in law term, denotes various offenses committed by children under the age of 18. Children’s offense typically includes delinquent acts, which would be considered crime if committed by adults, and status offenses which are less serious misbehavior such as truancy and parental disobedience. Both are within the jurisdiction of juvenile court, more serious offenses committed by minors may be tried in criminal court and be subjected to prison sentences.<br/>Paul Tappan (2007), refers juvenile delinquency to a young person who commits anti-social acts. He went further by saying, juvenile delinquency is defined as an act committed by a child, which if committed by an adult, would be a crime. Therefore juvenile delinquency is any adult crime committed by minor.<br/>Theologians, philosophers, revolutionaries, as well as social scientists have for long pondered over the question of why some individuals deviate from social rules. Theories of some psychological and biological factors that make or differentiate criminals from non-criminal have difficulty in explaining the confrontational behaviour in those who possess the suspected trait or characteristics. Theories constructed in explain habitual criminal activity with delinquent background have been found inadequate to explain episodic acts of crime.<br/>Attempts in early times to explain delinquency have centered on biological and psychological factors which sought to explain crime and delinquency in terms of some deficiencies or imbalances in the individual, Elbert et al. (1935). This approach was infact typical of delinquency. Centered investigation, that led to the emergence of such theories as Lombroso’s “born-criminal “, where physical anomalies such as usually long aims were believed to be associated with crime and delinquency. Moreover, noting that criminals and delinquent behaviour patterns were found under certain conditions than others and in certain areas more frequently than others. Sociologists have moved away from the classical pre-occupations to center their interest on the various kinds of crime conditions and child rearing habits, as possible causes of delinquency.<br/>It is sad to note that, here in Nigeria, the incidence of juvenile delinquency have become a big problem in schools for example, students have been known to organize illegal parties, sometimes at night, fraternities and sorority i.e. ( a female students society in a university or college, (Uwaifo, (2012). They consolidated the perceived plans and positions against constituted authority. They smoke cigarettes, Indian hemp, engaged in excessive drinking as well as illicit sexual relations. The result from indulgence in these excesses is classic indiscipline in schools among our contemporary time s. thus, attracting many comments in most of our national newspapers and magazine. People have not only expressed their concern over these maladies, but have also blamed it on some segments of our society institutions.<br/>At home, disobedience to parents directives, stealing, fighting, damage to properties is but a few of the delinquent acts of the youth. Ugiagbe (2011) Juvenile delinquency is not a problem that is peculiar to Nigeria alone, it is an Global phenomenon,. A significant proportion of juvenile acts are found in many other countries of the world there are statistical data to show the rate of juvenile factor associated with it. As a result of its international nature, much study aimed at discovery the causes and hence treatments of delinquency have been carried out in different parts of the world. Home conditions alone are not the only factors responsible for juvenile delinquency. Association with peer groups, family background, poverty, personality traits and broken home. These associations are justified on the ground that the family has exclusive contact with the child in his period of greatest dependency and flexibility.<br/>1.2         Statement of the Problem <br/>There is an abundant store of folk wisdom, regarding what aspects of the family environment are conducive for delinquent development. Bad parental example, lack of discipline, lack of affection, parents irresponsibility, physical abuse, broken home, deprivation, lack of contact with parents. These ideals still have common occurrences, partly as a legacy of the thinking of the early criminologist studying the influence of the family environment on delinquent development. This was also explained by Omc &amp; Clean (2004/2005) that all children require an environment which meets their basic needs for physical, emotional, intellectual, social and spiritual development. When a child is denied any of these, it may result in negative short term of long term effects, that is, the child turns out to be a deviant, seeking every other means to meet his basic needs, thereby disturbing the peace of the society.<br/>Peer group is another factor that determines youth delinquency. According to       Thiessen, S., (1997) adolescents sometimes prefer the approval of their peer group to school or parental approval as a result, they tend to exhibit some anti-social behaviour tendencies just to please members of the group.<br/>Olajide and Gbadesere (2008), are of the opinion that the child appreciates the peer group, they believe in them than the school authorities (teachers) and the parents. As a result of this, the child will choose to accept the code of conduct shown by his peer group such as telling lies, stealing, cheating, disobedience and unrest in schools.<br/>The federal bureau of investigation reported an arrest rate of violent crime (aggravated assault, robbery and rape) among thirteen to seventeen years old in the united state of nearly 800. Per 100,000 in 1994, in this same year, in England and wales approximately 600 per 100,000 fourteen to sixteen years old were convicted or   cautioned by the police for violent crimes. In Germany 650, per 100,000 fourteen to seventeen years old were suspects in violent crimes in 1994 (Efeltter 1998.) Different approaches aroused in scientific and  practical literature on juvenile crime and violence to defined and explain delinquent behavior by young people. To criminologist, juvenile delinquency encompasses all public wrongs committed by young people between the ages 12. (Barnes et al. 1989).<br/>1.3          Research Questions<br/>i.    Does the socio-economic background of a child contribute to being delinquent?<br/>ii.    Does the peer group influence a child delinquent behaviour?<br/>iii.    To what extent does the society contribute to juvenile delinquency?<br/>iv.    Do children from unstable families tend to become delinquent than those from stable families?<br/>1.4         Objectives of the Study <br/>i.    To examine whether socio-economic background could be responsible for being delinquent..<br/>ii.    To examine whether peer group influence a child delinquent behaviour <br/>iii.    To examine the influence of society on child delinquent act.<br/>iv.    To help in providing possible ways/measures in curbing delinquent act among our secondary school students.\\<br/>1.5     Significant of Study<br/> This study specifically examine the effect of juvenile delinquency on secondary school students. It also seeks to examines why secondary school students engage in criminal activities. This study further elucidates the effect of juvenile delinquency on the academic performance of young people. This juvenile delinquency has generated a lot of public outcry and resentment from both government and well meaning Nigerians. It is against this back drop that a research work of this nature will be of benefits to the family, police, social worker, sociologist psychologist and policy makings in understanding the condition that could lead to juvenile delinquency in order to make concerted efforts geared towards and minimizing or curbing delinquent acts among youths. <br/>1.6    Definition of  Terms<br/>Juvenile: Juvenile is a young person psychologically immature or underdeveloped young individual resembling an adult of its kind except in size and reproductive activities.<br/>Juvenile Delinquency: According to Paul Tapan (2007), juvenile delinquency is a young person who commits anti-social act like stealing, cheating, telling lies and disobedience to authorities.<br/>Peer Group: A group of people of approximately the same age, status and interests.<br/>Socio-Economic Background: This is used in this work to mean parental background, as to whether the youth’s parents and poor or rich, educated or uneducated and discriminated against on the basis of ethnic nationality or not.<br/><br/>\n\nAN ASSESSMENT OF JUVENILE  DELINQUENCY AMONG SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS : THE SOCIAL WORK INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ASSESSMENT OF JUVENILE  DELINQUENCY AMONG SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS : THE SOCIAL WORK INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION", "id": 7}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>DOMESTIC MALTREATMENT OF THE ELDERLY IN OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, EDO STATE<br/>`ABSTRACT</b><br/>This paper examines nature and causes of domestic mistreatment/abuse and neglect of the elderly. Some of the elderly people have challenges of poverty and diseases of old age such as stroke, depression, dementia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Because of their shortcomings, they depend on their families and other caregivers for care and which normally result in abused in the process. Also in the absence of institutional care, adult children who are too busy to take care of their parents hire caregivers who also, maltreat them.<br/>Unfortunately, the elderly are unable to challenge their abusers and have no way of reporting their abuse and so many suffer in silence. Nigeria has the largest number of elderly people over 60years of age, South of the Sahara, yet there is very little put in place by the government by way of institutional policies and legislation or even implementation of the Madrid Plan of Action on Aging, to which it is a signatory. For now, families continue to bear the burden of caring for their elderly members but this is increasingly difficult for them. Some elderly members live in destitution and are left at the mercy of the public or good Samaritans.<br/>The literature review indicates there is a high prevalence of elder abuse in Nigeria in spite of the respect that the aged command. The paper highlights the difficulties elderly people face in Oredo local government area of Edo state. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    Background to the Study     -    -    -    <br/>1.2    Statement of Problem     -    -    -    <br/>1.3    Aims and Objective of the Study    -    -<br/>1.4    Research Question     -    -    -<br/>1.5    Relevant Research Hypothesis    -    -<br/>1.6    Significance of the Study    -    -<br/>1.7     Scope of the Study     -    -    <br/>CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>2.1    Introduction    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>2.2    Empirical Review of Previous work in the area of <br/>studies Ageing in Nigeria    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY<br/>3.1     Introduction     -    -    -    -    -    <br/>3.2    Research Design     -    -    -    <br/>3.3    Population of the study    -    -    -<br/>3.4    Sampling, Procedure and Sample Size    -    -<br/>3.5         Data Collection Instrument and Validation    -<br/>3.6    Method of Data Analysis    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER FOUR: DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS <br/>4.1        Introduction     -    -    <br/>4.2            Test of Hypotheses    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY, DISCUSSION, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS<br/>5.1    Introduction -    -        -    -<br/>5.2    Summary of Research Findings -    -    -<br/>5.3    Conclusion    -    -    -    -    <br/>5.4    Recommendations     -    -    -    <br/>5.5    Suggestion For Further Study    -    -<br/>References     -    -    -<br/>Appendix    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1        Background to the Study <br/>Ageing of the population is one of the most important demographic facts that came to the foreground in the 21st century. In the whole world, people live longer having high life expectance, decrease in birth rates, controlled fertility, and consequently, the elderly population increases.Several studies are being conducted on the abuse and neglect of the elderly. Despite the challenges of providing a universal definition for abuse and neglect of the elderly, it is generally agreed that there are three basic categories of abuse and neglect, including domestic elderly abuse, institutional abuse, and self-abuse (McDonald &amp; Collins, 2000). The focus of this study is on the nature and causes of domestic mistreatment of elderly people.<br/>The elderly people who had come to earth as babies, had spent their useful life in the service to humanity, most of them retired from active service and are now waiting for exist from the world into eternity. This group of individuals is in a stage of life known as late adulthood, a stage in life which people are known as elderly or referred to as aged. This period in the life span is characterized by declines that occur in association with advanced ageing in almost all aspects of development (Bigner, 1994; Santrock, 2006). Elderly people are between the age of 60 and extends to the period of near death or process of dying. This period of life is characterized by unique challenges/problems. Despite all those problems and challenges, youthfulness is been promoted by both the citizen and government.<br/>The united nations, recognized the importance of taking care of the elderly so in 1982 at Vienna, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a set of principles for older persons recommending that all members states incorporate them in their programmes for the old. Section 14 of the 1999 constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria made provisions for the aged, which state that \"the security and welfare of its people shall be the primary purpose of the government\" and section 16, sub-section 2(d) promises, \"that suitable and adequate shelter and suitable adequate food, reasonable national minimum living wage, old age care and pensions and unemployment, sick benefits and welfare of the disabled are provided for all citizen\". In contrary to what the constitution stipulated, the elderly are not covered by any of the social security scheme and they are left for the relations to take care. The onty beneficiaries are those in the formal employment who are enjoying pensions which is inadequate and often delayed due to corruption in pension system. And as Magnus Eze, Director, Parlia Consult rightly observed, \"no government policy or legislation is in place with which government can provide for the aged\".<br/>Consequently, the elderly are left to suffer different forms of abuse and neglect, this may primarily be due to the economic situation of the children or intentionally abuse and neglect the elderly.<br/>1.2    Statement of the Problem <br/>The growing number of aged calls for the urgent formulation of policy. The world population of the elderly is estimated to 64.6 million in 2015, and it is expected to rise to 103 million in 2030 and by 2050, it should be 205 million elderly people (U.N., 2002). Nigeria has the highest number of elderly people in south of the Sahara desert, over the age of 60 years.<br/>There are no reliable data in Nigeria on the prevalence of incidence of elderly abuse and neglect. In occasion when the act of abuse and neglect is committed, it is hidden by elder, their families, and communities to a large extent. So it is very difficult to quantify elderly abuse and neglect as this occur in the privacy of the home, institutions and the reporting system for elderly abuse are almost absent in the country.<br/>In order for the government to formulate the right policy, it is pertinent to take critical look at the nature and causes and neglect of the elderly. This study will focus on and attempt to identify the nature and causes of domestic maltreatment of the elderly.<br/>1.3     Aims and objective of the study <br/>a)    To determine the rate of abuse and neglect of the elderly people in Oredo Local Government Area.<br/>b)    To identify the causes of domestic maltreatment of the elderly people,<br/>c)    To identify the nature of the domestic maltreatment of the elderly people,<br/>d)    To determine the socio-demographic characteristic of the elderly people. <br/>e)    To emphasize the need for elderly care.<br/>1.4    Research question<br/>a)    What is the rate of abuse and neglect among the elderly people in Oredo Local Government Area?<br/>b)    What is the causes of domestic maltreatment of the elderly people?<br/>c)    What is the nature of domestic maltreatment of the elderly people?<br/>d)    What are the socio-demographic characteristics of the elderly people?<br/>e)    What are the care of the elderly?<br/>1.5    Relevant research hypothesis <br/>Hypothesis I<br/>Hoi: Over dependence by elderly persons for care and meeting of needs proves stress on the supporting relation and does not result in abusive situation.<br/>Hypothesis II<br/>H02: The level of domestic abuse and neglect does not depend on the social class and financial status of the elderly person.<br/>1.6    Significance of the study <br/>The voice of the older, people and their experience of abuse and neglect remain largely unheard as to ascertain the causes and nature of the abuse and neglect. A lacuna has been created, whereby the causes and nature are still somewhat absent from published studies.<br/>In order to properly analyze the abuse and neglect of the elderly a better understanding of the nature and causes of domestic maltreatment should be understood.<br/>The study will profile solution to elderly abuses in the local government area and in the country at large. It will serve the caregivers for the elderly the best technique and method to handle the elderly. However it help policy maker to make policy that will favour the elderly in the country. The study will contribute to the body of knowledge and also serve as reservoir for other researchers, It will help social worker to advocate for the elder in the society.<br/>1.7    Scope of the study<br/>This study is limited to residence of the Oredo local government area in Benin City of Edo state.<br/>Among others, the constraints encountered in the cause of the research work include: financial constraint, unwillingness of the respondent to complete the questionnaire logically and inability of the respondent to return the questionnaire on time and duly completed.<br/><br/>\n\nDOMESTIC MALTREATMENT OF THE ELDERLY IN OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DOMESTIC MALTREATMENT OF THE ELDERLY IN OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, EDO STATE", "id": 8}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>FAMILY PLANNING AND ITS IMPLICATION ON COUPLES’ HEALTH IN IKPOBA OKHA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, EDO STATE <br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    Background of the Study<br/>            Family planning is sometimes used as a synonym or euphemism for the use of birth control, however, it is most usually applied to a female-male couple who-wish to limit the number of children they have and /or to control the timing of pregnancy (also known as child spacing). According to (Okedare 2002), the issue of family planning all over the world has attracted attention due to its importance indecision making about population growth and development issues. In this wise, geographers have become increasingly alarmed by the precipitous rise in its effect on population growth, not only in Nigeria or the United State of America, but throughout the world. <br/>    The World Health Organization (WHO, 2012) defined family planning as the planning of when to have children and the use of birth control. It is achieved through the use of contraceptive methods and the treatment of involuntary infertility. Lawrence, (2006) on his own, sees family planning as a health service that helps couples decide whether to have children and if so when and how many. <br/>    Onokerhoraaye (2013) also defined family planning as the provision of birth prevention information service and appliances. It also involves teaching men and women about their bodies and teaching them how to prevent births usually with contraceptives but sometimes also with abortion or sterilization. Hatcher and Friedman (1997) opined that family planning is now seen as human right basic to human dignity. Their work further showed that family planning helps women protect themselves from unwanted pregnancies. Since the 1960, family planning programmes have helped women around the world avoid about 40 million unwanted pregnancies, as a result, many women’s lives have been saved from high risk pregnancy and unsafe abortions (Hatcher et al 1997:2, Huezo and Carigma, 1997). However most available works still points to emphasis being placed on the women folks at the detriment of their men counterpart (Olawepo 2003).<br/>    Expanding access to family planning has been a key aim of health and development programming for almost 50 years. Family planning is connected to all eight millennium development goals (MDGs). Family planning generates wealth and reduces hunger. (MDGs-1); prolongs education (MDGs2); empowers women and girls (MDGs-3) save infants (MDGs-4); improves maternal health (MDGs-5); prevents pediatric HIV (MDGs-6); reduces pressure on the environment (MDGs-7); and promotes global partnership (MDGs-8).<br/>    The (WHO) technical service (2012), states that though rarely articulated, family planning may involve consideration of the number of children a couple wish to have as well as age at which they wish to have them. These matters are obviously influenced by external factors such as; marital situations, career considerations, financial position, any disabilities that may affect their ability to have children and raise them besides many other considerations. If sexually active, family planning may involve the use of contraceptives. According to (Robey et al 1994) effective family planning grogram make the rapid spread of voluntary modern family planning methods possible in any country. Such programs help people achieve their personal reproduction goals.<br/>    Last collected in 2006 by the Nigeria National Bureau of statistics (NBS), the total population of citizens in Nigeria was around 166.2million people. Today, it is estimated to have about 180 million people. The United Nations (UN) projected that the overall population of Nigeria will reach about 440 million by the end of the year 2050. By 2100, if current figures continue, the population of Nigeria will be over 900 million. Morgan (2003) on the same issue indicated that in 2002, the total percentage of acceptors of contraceptives was 15% of both men and women of child bearing age. This goes a long way to show the fact that family planning services are not being used by a majority of Nigerian men and women of reproductive age.<br/>    The United Nations population fund (UNFPA) says that, “contraceptives prevent unintended pregnancies, reduce the number of abortion, and lower the incidence of death and disability related to complication of pregnancy and child birth”. (http://www.unfpa.org/familyplanning). UNFPA states that “if all women with an unmet need for contraceptives were able to use modern method that additional 24million abortions (14 million of which would be unsafe), 6 million miscarriage, 70,000 maternal deaths and 50,000 infant deaths would be prevented”.  (http://www.unfpa.org/familyplanning). In cases where couples may not want to have children just yet, family planning programs help a lot. Federal family planning programs reduced child bearing among poor women by as much as 25 percent, according to a University of Michigan study.<br/>    The World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank estimate that 3 person per year provide basic family planning and neonatal health care to women in developing countries. This would include contraception, prenatal, delivery and post natal care in addition to post-partum planning and the promotion of condoms to prevent sexually transmitted infections.<br/>Only about 30% of all women use birth control although over half of all African women would like to use birth control if it was available to them. (WHO, 2012) and (Cleland K et al 2011), the most available type of birth control is condom (Alex, Ezeh, and Tom, O. 2004).<br/>    Marriage can be wonderful as well as frustrating depending on the way you plan your marriage: this was the statement of Cecil Osborne (1978) a marriage counselor. This is when one control conception in order that or may produce the number of children which one desire to have at a space. People have little or no regard for family planning and this has resulted to needless large family size, thereby contributing to high increase in population growth.    However the rapid rate of modernization of family planning experienced in many countries has prevailed over traditional methods. These modern methods include the natural planning methods by which couples observe daily signs and symptoms of fertile and infertile phases of menstrual cycle to guide the timing of intercourse, according to their desire to avoid a pregnancy. Other methods includes; the condom, the intra-uterine device (I.U.D) coil, the pill, contraceptive, injections, forming tablets, diaphragms and cervical caps and vasectomy.<br/>1.2 Statement of the Problem <br/>    The introduction of family planning is in the words of Aristotle, the ancient philosopher who explains that civilization would better be achieved by preserving a stationary population in the city state of Greece. He argued for laws that would limit the number of children any family would have. Other philosophers went further to argue for just a child per family.<br/>    Children are gift from God, so controlling birth rate is wrong among the Edo speaking people when a child is named “Omosefe” it indicated that a child is more precious than riches, the equivalent in Ibo is “Nwakaego” and Yoruba equivalent “OmoboriOwo” these are some of the few reason why our fore fathers married many wives. At present some of our fathers still operate on extended family system and the gift from God, so it should not be controlled by man except God.<br/>    Also, children helps in the domestic work and also assist in farm and so the number of children one has will determine how wealthy one is in the society especially the sex differentiation whereby they want their wives to have a lot of male children, so the problem of controlling or spacing birth rate is difficult. The most crucial question now is: Are the people of lkpobaokha Local Government Area of the Edo State fully aware of the usefulness of modern method? This is due to the fact that  attitude of these people might influence the attitudes of these women depending on their level of awareness.<br/>Also, with Africa traditional system i.e. the customs and tradition might influence the attitude of these women towards family planning because in Benin tradition system, it is the man that is the head of the house and his decisions are final. Also if the man is a traditional man either a chief or he believes in his tradition, then having many wives and producing many children is his main objective.<br/>    Environmental influence might influence the attitude because the development of family planning is new in rural area compare to urban centres. The educational background of a couple will determine the attitude of these women because an educated couple would not want to produce a lot of children because they will not have time for them and also a working class woman would want to operate on the methods of family planning. But an illiterate person would have the best time in the world to take care of her child and so the tendency of producing more children is high and they might not know the importance of family planning.<br/>1.3 Research Question<br/>This research tries to find solutions to the following questions.<br/>1.    Are the women in lkpobaokha local government in Edo State aware of family planning methods?<br/>2.    What are the factors influencing the attitude of women towards birth control?<br/>3.    In what ways have the media help families to adopt family planning programmes?<br/>4.    How often does a couple visit family planning counseling centres?<br/>1.4 Objectives of the Study<br/>The general objective of this study is to examine the factors that influence the attitude of women towards family planning in lkpobaokha Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>1.    To examine how well exposed married couples are to the knowledge and practice of modern techniques of family planning.<br/>2.    To find out the factors that influences the attitude of couples toward family planning.<br/>3.    To investigate the ways the media have help families to adopt family planning.<br/>4.    To determine how often couples visit family planning counseling centre.<br/>1.5 Significance of the Study <br/>    The importance of family planning to the individual, family and the society at large cannot be over emphasized as it tends to curb the problems associated with population explosion, economic well-being and psychological development.<br/>    Findings in this study will therefore throw more light on the attitude of women towards the use of family planning methods. It will also help to find out whether the men and women especially in lkpobaokha Local Government Area are adequately aware of modern family planning methods.<br/>    The study will also depict whether couples actually practice family planning methods. If they do, to what extent they are involved. If not, their reasons for not being involved. This study will therefore enable us to identify the ways in which factors such as religion, culture, education and socio-economic factors affect the attitude of womem towards family planning methods.<br/>    Finally, this study will contribute to the existing body of knowledge on the need to encourage a positive attitude towards family planning in our society, particularly in lkpobaokha local government area of Edo State.<br/>1.6 Definition of Basic Concepts/Terms<br/>Family Planning: this can be defined as the practice of controlling the number of children in family and the intervals between their births particularly by means of artificial contraceptives or voluntary sterilization.<br/>Marriage: According to MerrianWebstar, marriage is the relationship that exist between a husband and a wife a similar relationship between people of the same sex marriage also called matrimony or wedlock is a socially or ritually recognized union or legal contract between spouses that establishes rights and obligations between them, between them and their children and between them and their in laws.<br/>Fertility: Is the natural capability to produce offspring<br/>Conception: The process of becoming pregnant involving fertilization<br/>Abstinence: Is a self-enforced restraint from indulging in bodily activities that are widely experienced as giving pleasure.<br/>Abortion: The deliberate termination of a human pregnancy most often performed during the first 28 weeks of pregnancy<br/>Contraceptives: A device or drug serving to prevent pregnancy.<br/><br/>\n\nFAMILY PLANNING AND ITS IMPLICATION ON COUPLES’ HEALTH IN IKPOBA OKHA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, EDO STATE <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FAMILY PLANNING AND ITS IMPLICATION ON COUPLES’ HEALTH IN IKPOBA OKHA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, EDO STATE ", "id": 9}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDE OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TOWARDS HOMOSEXUALITY AND ITS IMPLICATION ON SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT</b><br/>Chapter One: Background of study<br/>Introduction <br/>1.1 Background to the study  <br/>1.2 Statement of the Problem<br/>1.3 Research Question <br/>1.4 Objectives of the study <br/>1.5 Significance of the study <br/>1.6 Definition of Terms …<br/>Chapter Two: Literature Review<br/>2.1 Introduction.<br/>2.2 An Overview of Homosexuality<br/>2.3 Involvement of Undergraduate in the act of Homosexuality  <br/>2.4 Students attitude towards homosexuality on campus <br/>2.5 Harassment and Fear of Homosexuals <br/>2.6 Review of related Theorie<br/>2.6.1 Biological Theory<br/>2.7 Social Learning Theory …<br/>2.8 Theoretical framework <br/>Chapter Three: Research Methodology…<br/>3.1 Research design<br/>3.2 Study Area and Population <br/>3.3 Sample size …………<br/>3.4 Sample technique …<br/>3.5 Instrument of data collection <br/>3.6 Method of data analysis …<br/>Chapter Four: Data Presentation and Analysis<br/>4.1 Demographic Data of Respondents <br/>4.2 Gender distribution of respondents<br/>4.3 Age of respondents <br/>4.4 Religious distribution of respondents <br/>Section B:Analysis of research questions<br/>Chapter Five: Summary, Conclusion and Recommendations<br/>5.1 Summary of findings<br/>5.2 Conclusion<br/>5.3 Recommendations <br/>5.4 Limitations of the study<br/>5.5 Suggestion for further studies…<br/>References.…<br/>Appendix I ……<br/>Questionnaire…<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 Background to the study  <br/>Homosexuality is romantic or sexual intercourse or behaviour between members of the same sex (beth 1992:2). As a sexual orientation, homosexuality refers to an enduring pattern of or disposition to experience sexual, affectionate or romantic attractions primarily and exclusively to people of the same sex (Redmond 1999). <br/>The term homosexual is derived from a Greek word “homos” which means same. Thus connoting sexual acts and affections between members of the same sex. Lesbianism is a sexual act between females while Gay generally refers to male homosexuality. The word “Lesbians” is derived from the name of the Greek island “Lesbos”, where the poet Sappho wrote largely about her emotional relation with young women.  <br/>Historically, homosexuality has attracted much interest and attention but attitudes towards such preference of having sex with one of the same gender have varied in different epochs and cultural groups ranging from acceptance as among the ancient Greeks, to measured tolerance in the Roman times and outright condemnations. (Greg Reeder 1999).  <br/>According to the old testament, Leviticus 16:8-22, 20:13) sex between men is an abomination and any involved will be put to death, other parts of the Bible makes it known that homosexuality is a sin and any involved in it faces strong penalty. Such books of the Bible like the book of Romans 1:18-31, Corinthians 6:9 which says that homosexuals are unrighteous and will not inherit the kingdom of God. This however has affected the Judeo-Christian attitude towards homosexuality for centuries.  <br/>Also in primitive time, negative attitude is found in different cultures even in Africa, there has been serious condemnation of homosexuality such that anyone involved in act will be put to death.  <br/>In the late 19th century ambivalent attitude have prevailed, that is, opposing feelings about homosexuality such that some people fell homosexuality is normal and they tend to fight for their freedom. In some primitive societies homosexual activities are considered normal and socially acceptable. For instance in Arunta of Central Australia, homosexuality is a common practice. Some nations such as Great Britain, United States and West Germany to mention but a few have recently legalized homosexual relations between consenting adults. In the United States, in the 1940s homosexuality was classified as felony with punishment up to life imprisonment in all states. (Frank Beach 1991).  <br/>By the early 1970s at least ten states had legalized such acts between consenting adults. One third of the societies studied by ford and Beach include many industrialized countries; give little or no sanction to homosexuals.  <br/>In recent years in the United States such organizations as the Gay Activities Alliance and the Daughters of Bilitis have attempted to influence public opinion and legislation toward greater tolerance of homosexuals. Their effort and other world associations and conferences such as the 1974 Berkshire conference also the 1973 meeting of the Association of homosexual activists and other various meetings along with Gay advocacy books has created several attitudes among people of the world and attracted attentions. Recently, even in Nigeria, homosexuality is beginning to spread and open up and even though there has been a law against the act, still it is in existence in the country and also in various institution of higher learning in the country. Including University of Benin where there has been cases of homosexual activities amongst students though not too obvious and popular but it exist and there has been various attitudes towards it from other students who do not get involved in the act.  <br/>While a lot of research have been carried out in other aspect of students attitude very little or nothing has been done in the area of research on the attitude of students towards homosexuality. It is on this premise that this study seek to unravel the knowledge and general attitude of students towards homosexuality.  <br/>1.2   Statement of the problem <br/>With increasing urbanization in Nigeria and relative freedom from parents and guardian enjoyed by students in various institutions of higher learning in Nigeria. There has been different kinds of sexual orientation which includes homosexuality and attitudes towards it.  How do people regard to homosexuality and those involved in it is an issue that need to be investigated. While homosexuals face condemnation in some societies. They are accepted in other societies. In Nigeria, it is highly frowned at, because it is believed to have a negative effect on the general behaviour and it is strongly against the moral principle of Nigerian society and the University of Benin in particular. Though this act of homosexuality exist in closed and private settings in the University of Benin, this case is becoming obvious and privately alarming so much so that the moral ethics for which this mission university is known is under serious threat. The act is like underground water destroying the moral base of this noble university. Like wild fire, it is permeating into the minds of all students of the University of Benin. <br/>On the part of the homosexuals, most often they suffer psycho social trauma, social isolation and are society wide regarded as deviants, they are sometimes regarded and treated as criminals. In future, they may face the danger of childlessness except if they change and get married to opposite sex. This is outright negation of the order instituted by God. It is a violation against the natural use of man and woman.  <br/>Furthermore, the attitude of people towards the acts causes those involved in the act unable to socially and psychologically adjust within the society and relate to people and members of the society.  It is on the above premise that this study seeks to unravel the attitude of undergraduate students of University of Benin towards homosexuality and its effects on social adjustment.   <br/>1.3   Research Questions <br/>The following research questions shall guide this study  <br/>1. Do students have knowledge about homosexuality? <br/>2. How do students perceive homosexuality? <br/>3. How do students get involved in the act? <br/>4. How easy is it to disengage from the act?  <br/>5. What do students think about people who are involve in homosexual act?  <br/>1.4  Objectives of the study <br/>The general objective of this study is to investigate the attitude of undergraduate students towards Homosexuality and how it affect social adjustment. The specific objectives of the study area are as follows: <br/>1. To understand the extent to which students knowledge about homosexuality affects their attitudes and social adjustment. <br/>2.  To determine students’ knowledge about homosexuality.  <br/>3. To find out how students get involved in the act of homosexuality. <br/>4. To ascertain how easy it is to disengage from the act.  <br/>5. To suggest how this social ill will be stopped.   <br/>1.5 Significance of the study  <br/>This study has both theoretical and practical significance. Theoretically, the study intends to find out the motive behind indulging in homosexuality.  <br/>The findings of the study will be of immense values to the educators, psychologists and school administrators on the best ways to handle the problem of homosexuality among undergraduate students.  <br/>Again, the findings of this study will help to intimate the guidance counsellors on the social and sexual background of these students and how best to offer a programme of intervention for their re-integration into heterosexual world.  <br/>Thus, both students and counsellors will be better informed about the inherent dangers associated with indulging in homosexuality.   <br/>1.6   Definition of terms  <br/>HOMOSEXUALITY  <br/>Homosexuality is a romantic and sexual intercourse between members of the same sex or gender.    <br/>LESBIANISM  <br/>Lesbianism is the sexual relationship between two women, when someone is a lesbian it simply means that a woman is having sexual relationship with another woman.     <br/>ATTITUDE  <br/>This refers to a disposition to react or behave in a certain way towards an issue, event, act or a situation.  <br/>UNDERGRADUATE  <br/>These are people who are currently undertaking or studying for their first degree in a higher institution of learning.   <br/>GAY  <br/>This can be referred to as sexual relationship between two men.   <br/>SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT  <br/>This means adapting to the societal conditions or circumstances of one’s environment.   <br/>CLOSED AND PRIVATE SETTING  <br/>This refers to a secret place where the homosexuals carry out the act without being noticed by anybody.  <br/><br/>\n\nKNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDE OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TOWARDS HOMOSEXUALITY AND ITS IMPLICATION ON SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDE OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TOWARDS HOMOSEXUALITY AND ITS IMPLICATION ON SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT", "id": 10}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p> <b>IMPACT OF BROKEN HOMES ON ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE SCHOOL CHILD:<br/>A CASE STUDY OF SOME SELECTED SCHOOL IN OGBESON COMMUNITY, EDO STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This project work will examine the impact of broken home on the academic performance of the school child.

This is because of the public outcries concerning the low standard of education in the country (Imoge, 2002). The declining quality of education in the country and the breeding of graduates with little technical know-how have resulted in serious set-backs to the industrial development of the nation. Different factors are capable of influencing the academic performance of secondary school students. Such factors maybe the student’s internal, external or environmental state (intelligence, state of health, motivation, anxiety, home influence etc.) and their environment (availability of suitable learning environment, adequacy of educational infrastructure like textbooks and well-equipped laboratories) Investigation of these factors has produced several findings by researchers for example, Clemens and Oelke (1967) and Emeke (1984) have attributed the cause of poor academic performance to a combination of personal and institutional factors. Personal factors relate to the individual’s intelligence, knowledge and ability, while institutional factors are family or parental influences, societal influences, institutional influences and school related factors – student/lecturer rapport, teacher related factors, accommodation and living conditions. In the same vein, Wiseman (1973), Soghetan (1981)and Hassan (1983) among others have examined the causes of poor academic performance among secondary school students. Some of the factors identified are intellectual ability, poor study habit, achievement motivation, lack of vocational goals, low self-concept, low socio-economic status of the family, poor family structure and anxiety. The consequences of these include indiscipline in schools and low level of educational standard. A Daily Sketch Publication on “Causes and Cures of Poor Performance at WAEC Examinations” in 1986 identified and categorized problems responsibility for students’ poor performance to problems ofteachers, problems of inadequate facilities in the schools, problem traceable to students’, problems caused by parents and society at large and problems of government policies andfunding of education (Ajila and Olutola, 2000). Reviewed literature indicated that there is an awareness of the importance of the home environment or family on pupils/students’ academic performance. The home has a great influence on the students’ psychological, emotional, social and economic state. In the view of Ajila and Olutola (2000)the state of the home affects the individual since the parents are the first socializing agents in an individual’s life. This is because the family background and context of a child affect his reaction to life situations and his level of performance. Although, the school for the experiences that make up the individual’s life during school periods, yet parents and the individual’s experiences at home play tremendous roles in building the personality of the child and making the child what he is. Thus, Ichado (1998) concluded that the environment in which the student comes from can greatly influence his performance in school. Although, the home environment or family has been recognized as having a lot of influence on the academic performance of students (Nzewuawah, 1995: Ajihi&amp;OlutoIa, 2000). Previous studies have been concentrated on the area of socio-economic status of parents. Other aspects of’ parental environment such as the structure of the family have been grossly’ neglected. Yet,Ichado (1998) stated that parent constant disagreement affects children emotionally and this could lead to poor academic performance in school. The family lays the psychosocial, moral and spiritual foundations in the overall development of the child. While themother’s significant role in this cannot be overemphasized. Studies on father-child relationship suggest that the presence of a father in the home influences significantly the development of a child (Agulanna, 1999). Thus, parenthood is a responsibility requiring the full cooperation of both parents who must ensure the total development of their offspring(s). Structurally, a family is either broken or intact. A broken family in this context is one that is not structurally intact for various reasons—deaths of a parent, divorce, separation, dissertation and illegitimacy in which case, the family was never completed (Conkline, 1996). This analysis becomes necessary because life in a single parent family can be stressful for both the child and the parent. Such families are faced with the challenges of diminished financial resources (Children’s Defence Fund, 1994), assumptions of new roles and responsibilities, establishment of new patterns in intra-familial interaction and reorganization of routines and schedules (Agulanna, 1999). These conditions are not conducive for effective parenting. This isbecause when the single parent is overburdened by responsibilities and by their own emotional reaction to their situation, they often become irritable, impatient and insensitive to their children’s needs (Nzewunwah, 1995).<br/>1.2.    RESEARCH PROBLEM<br/>Nigeria is rapidly developing her technological education which has made the society more complex than it was in the past. The main problem of this study is to determine the possible impact and consequences of broken home on children and how it has impacted on their educational performance.<br/>Sub-Problem:<br/>    Can separation of parents have any negative impact on student’s performance<br/>    Does lack of concentration has much effect on a child education who is from broken home<br/>1.3    RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>1.    Do children from broken home perform academically lower than children from stable home?<br/>2.    Does high labour of children from broken home cause low academic performance of children<br/>3.    Does a child from a broken home drop out of school because he does not have money to continue school<br/>4.    Are children who are from broken home affected by low concentration in school<br/>1.4    STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE<br/>This study was aimed at achieving the following objectives:<br/>1.    To examine academic performance of children from broken home with that of children from stable home<br/>2.    To evaluate the impact of job engagement of children from broken home on academic performance<br/>3.    To know if a child from broken home can drop out school because of the lack of money<br/>4.    To find out if children from broken home are affected with low concentration in school<br/>1.5    SCOPEOFSTUDY<br/>This study covered all teenagers between the ages of 10-19 years senior secondary schools in Uhunmwonde Local Government Area of Edo State. The names of the schools are Ediaken Grammar School in Uhunmwonde, Technical College, Uhunmwonde, both in UhunmwondeLocal Government. The research was limited to SS II and SS III students of the above named schools students were given to be seventy-five in each school which is a total of one hundred and fifty student’s altogether.<br/>The reason for the choice of these classes was because the students were matured enough to speak for themselves and they can read and understand the questions.<br/><br/></p>\n\nIMPACT OF BROKEN HOMES ON ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE SCHOOL CHILD: A CASE STUDY OF SOME SELECTED SCHOOL IN OGBESON COMMUNITY, EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF BROKEN HOMES ON ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE SCHOOL CHILD: A CASE STUDY OF SOME SELECTED SCHOOL IN OGBESON COMMUNITY, EDO STATE", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IN BENDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF ABIA STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This study examined the problems and prospects of community development in Bende Local Government Area of Abia State. Community development is a positive improvement in socio-cultural, economic, political and physical structures within the environments, which enhances man’s standard of living. It is a process of education by which people of all ages and all interests in the community learn to share their thoughts, their ideals, their participation, their joy’s and their sorrow’s and in a large measure, to mould and shape the communal destiny for themselves. It is a process of self-discovery by which the people of a community learn to identify and solve their community problems. The instrument used for this study was the questionnaire. The theoretical framework used in the study was system and management theory, while the data collected was analyzed using simple percentage and tested with Chi-square formula, for the purpose of ascertaining its validity. However, the study reviewed the historical antecedent, lack of fund, lack of patriotic spirit, undue political crisis, over-dependence on federal allocation, unclear plan goals, etc, which were the problems working against the rapid development of Bende Local Government Area and Nigeria in general. The study recommended that attitudinal change in our work environment are the basis or panacea for the community development of Bende Local Government Area. This is because, the greatest discovery of our generation is that, human beings can improve their living standard by altering the attitude of their minds. All hands must be on deck in order to fight underdevelopment, this is because development is of man, by man and for man.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    Background of the Study    -    -    -    <br/>1.2    Statement of Problem    -    -    -    <br/>1.3    Research Questions    -    -    -<br/>1.4 Objectives of the Study    -    -    <br/>1.5    Significance of the Study    -    -    <br/>1.6    Definition of Terms/Concepts<br/>CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>2.1 Review of Theoretical Literature    -    -    -<br/>2.2 Review of Empirical Literature    -<br/>2.3    Review of Relevant Theories    -<br/>2.4    Theoretical Framework    -    <br/>2.5   Hypotheses    -<br/>CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY<br/>3.1   Study Design    -    -    -    -    -<br/>3.2   Scope and Area of Study    -    -    -<br/>3.3 Population of Study    -    -    -    <br/>3.4 Sample Size and Sampling Technique    -    -<br/>3.5 Instrument of Data Collection    -    -    -<br/>3.6   Method of Data Collection    -    -    -<br/>3.7 Method of Data Analysis    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER FOUR: DATA PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS AND HYPOTHESES TESTING<br/>4.1 Socio-Demographic Characteristics of Respondents    -    <br/>4.2 Major Research Issues    -    -    -    <br/>4.3 Cross Tabulation of Research Variables    -    <br/>4.4 Test of Hypotheses    -    -    -<br/>4.5 Discussion of Findings    -    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY, DISCUSSION, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS<br/>5.1 Summary of Findings    -    -    -    <br/>5.2 Conclusion    -    -    -    <br/>5.3 Implication of Findings for Social Work Practice in Nigeria    -<br/>5.4 Recommendations    -    -    -    -    <br/>References    -    -    -    <br/>Appendix I    -    -    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1     Background of the Study<br/>Development is multi-disciplinary; this is because it is used in different fields of study. The concept is borrowed from physical or natural sciences. It is used to describe the different stages involved in the process of improving or changing the quality of an object or human beings. For example, the development of a photograph film or improvement and changes which occur from childhood to adulthood.<br/>This study paid attention to the problems and prospects of community development in Bende Local Government Area of Abia State. The concept emphasizes the general increase in production and distribution of available goods and services, which can improve man’s standard of living. Chukwuezi, (2000) maintained that, ‘community may be referred to as a group of people interacting among themselves in a geographical defined space and time. They may share certain similar cultural attributes like norms, beliefs and value systems, etc.’<br/>A community maybe homogenous or heterogeneous. Homogenous community is a community that has similar socio-cultural norms and social institutions. For example, most rural communities like Ozuitem community in Bende local government area of Abia State. Heterogeneous community is a community made up of people with diverse ethnic origin and different cultural practices. For example, the urban and semi-urban communities like Onitsha urban community, Nsukka urban community, Nnewi urban community, etc.<br/>A similar characteristics is that a community must reflect the interaction of people within a defined spatial environment. Poston in Chukwuezi, (2000) defined community development as:<br/>A process of education by which people of all ages and all interest in the community, learn to share their  thoughts, their ideals, their participation, their joys and sorrows and in large measure, to mould and shape the communal destiny for themselves.<br/>Public participation, both in planning and implementation of development projects are very necessary for the development of any community. The people should be educated on the need for them to aspire towards a certain height, the peoples felt need should be identified and actions geared towards its realization instituted. Community development starts from mental disposition of individuals which make up the community. On the other hand, Okoli &amp; Onah, (2002) noted that:<br/>Rural development is conceived as being concerned with the improvement as well as the transformation of social, mental, economic, institutional and environmental conditions of the low income earners through the mobilization and rational utilization of their human, natural and institutional resources, so as to enhance their capacities to cope with their daily task of life and the demands of modern times.<br/>From the above concept, one can see that community development does not only limit itself to erecting structures, construction of roads, provision of pipe borne water and electrification. It encompasses those activities that are geared towards the overall enhancement of the living conditions of rural dwellers.<br/>International Association for Community Development (2016), defined community development as:<br/>‘a practice-based profession and an academic discipline concerned with the organization, education and empowerment of people within their communities’.<br/>In a wider perception, the aims of community development include employment, maximization of personal income of the people as a means of enhancing their standard of living, provision of technological equipment in order to increase the productivity of the individual and his family, creating awareness/sensitization which will enable rural inhabitants to be socio-politically and economically stable.<br/>It is a well known fact that Nigerian communities are characterized by abject poverty, oppression, degradation, deprivation, lack of essential amenities, etc. The rural people have fewer opportunities for education, no employment opportunities, and the standard of living is generally poor. There is superstitious believes, high mortality rate and general lack of social infrastructures.<br/>Unfortunately, this is so in Nigeria because most government policies geared towards community development have always been to the advantage of the few individuals who constitute the privileged class. Moreover, the administrative systems surrounding the implementation of community development programmes do not usually function in the interest of the majority and the same thing applies to the existing institutions, be they commercial, private or traditional. All these institutions, which are intended to function in the interest of the masses, invariably promote the interest of a few individuals who control and manipulate them.<br/>When good modern houses and other social amenities are concerned in a particular geographical area of the country or within the state capital, there is no development. When scarce resources are abundant in few hands while the majority of the people are languishing in penury, development is still farfetched. There may be economic growth without community development in a country. This is because, economic growth is merely the increase in the production of goods and services. It has nothing to do with distribution of the available resources to the rural dwellers.<br/> Development can occur when the goods and services are evenly distributed in such a way that the majority of the masses can afford to shelter themselves, feed and have a sense of belonging, and security; all leading to enhancement of the peoples well-being.<br/> Development is a positive improvement in the peoples standard of living. These improvements must involve physical change, enhancing an individual’s coping capacity, modification of our culture, beliefs and people’s perception. Todaro, (1985) in his own view observed that:<br/>Development is a multi-dimensional process involving the reorganization and re-orientation of the entire economic and social system.    This involves in addition to improvement of income and output, radical changes in institutional, social and administrative structures.<br/> Since the colonial era till date, a lot of developmental policies have been made. Successive governments in Nigeria have mapped out series of strategies aiming at improving the people’s standard of living at the rural areas.<br/> Regrettably, most of these policies have little to do with the felt need of the majority of the populace. It only express the wishes and aspirations of the elite class, who determines who gets what, when and how. The resultant effect is that the rich get richer while the poor gets poorer.<br/>    According to Seers in Ndukwe, (2005), the questions to ask about a country’s development are:<br/>(i)    What has been happening to poverty?<br/>(ii)    What has been happening to unemployment?<br/>(iii)    What has been happening to inequality?<br/>        If there is reduction in poverty level, unemployment rate and inequality, then one can conclude that there is development. If one or two of these central problems have been growing worse, especially if all the three have been on the increase, it would be strange to call the result development, even if per capital income doubled.<br/>         Development is summed up as man’s capacity to expand his own consciousness and therefore, his power over himself, his environment and his society. Man is central pivot around which development revolves. Development is for man, by man and of man. This means that man is not only the beneficiary of development efforts but must also initiate the action to develop himself. In other words, the opportunities created by development are generated or induced through efforts. Man must show the desire to develop before development can come. Besides, true development is that which leads to the expansion and growth of man’s inner qualities. Development must raise man’s ability to dominate himself, to become less dependent and more proficient in what he is doing as well as to become critical in outlook. Ndukwe, (2005).<br/>         Amadi, (2009) noted that, as a result of Nigerian independence and subsequent creating of more states, local governments and recently development centers in  Abia state and Nigeria in general, increase in rate of development planning has become inevitable.<br/>         Development planning in Nigeria can be traced back to 1946 after the second world war. Following the initiative of the secretary of states for the colonies in 1944, what was known as ten years of development and welfare came into operation. The formulation and implementation of the plan up to 1954 were highly centralized. The plan being actually prepared, under the direction of a small central development board, consisting exclusively of senior colonial government officials. This plan was not successful because the Nigerians whose welfare it was suppose to seek, were not involved in the formulation of the plan.<br/>         As a prospect of community development, Nigeria has embraced community development oriented programmes such as Poverty Alleviation Programme (P.A.P), Better Life for Rural Women, Operation Feed the Nation (O.F.N), Green Revolution, Integrated Rural Development Programme.<br/>         Nigerian local government system has been confronted with the problem of developing their communities and Bende Local Government is not an exception. It is an established fact that rural communities in Nigeria are characterized with backwardness in various ramification, this is in terms of shortage of infrastructural facilities and services.<br/>1.2     Statement of Problem<br/>         Different views has been expressed as to the organ or body that has the responsibility of executing community development programmes. In recent year, community developers have proved themselves veritable instrument for the planning and executing of community development programmes.<br/>         The community development in Bende Local Government Area of Abia State embarked on a road construction project which have been abandoned for some years without accomplishment. This may be due to the problems of inadequate funds to carry out these developmental projects, not minding the fact that inadequate funding of the project may hinder the accomplishment of the road project. Absence of qualified manpower to enhance the technical area should not also be forgotten.<br/>         As political entity, the community development project is always influenced by the politics of who should be the leader within the members based on the community development project and most of these leaders of community development are illiterates who may not know how to use modern equipment for development purposes.<br/>         There are faces of underdevelopment in our rural areas. The number of able bodied men and women, who are able and willing to work but could not see any are still on the increase. Some families are still finding it difficult to take two square meals a day. Some are still vagabonds in their fatherland, as a result of no shelter, and the gap between the rich and poor are getting wider every day. In Bende Local Government Area, people still roof their huts with bunch of grasses, crowned with an old basin. These grasses at times do not prevent intensive rain from drenching the occupants of such houses. These are the condition of rural dwellers in Bende Local Government Area of Abia State.<br/>1.3    Research Questions<br/>(i)    To what degree has corruption negatively affect community development in Bende Local Government Area?<br/>(ii)    How does lack of active participation an impediment to community development?<br/>(iii)    To what extent have illiteracy and poverty been a setback to community?<br/>1.4 Objectives of the Study<br/>(i)    To examine the effect of corruption on community development in Bende Local Government Area.<br/>(ii)    To ascertain what is responsible for the lack of active participation among members of the community.<br/>(iii)    To ascertain the effect of illiteracy and poverty of members of the community in community development effect.<br/>1.7     Significance of the Study<br/>        The study is very imperative among men, women and children in Bende Local Government Area because the study was initiated bearing in mind the position of rural communities in the local government area. However, the problems which have been identified in the study area are  half-solved and should be totally tackled to bring succor to the people, since community development is the focus of the government.<br/>         The study will equally help Non-Governmental Organizations (N.G.O’s) to assist government in bringing solution to some of the problems.<br/>        Finally, policy makers and implementers will correct their mistakes from this study, thus finding solution to the numerous problems that are facing community development in Bende Local Government Area.<br/>1.8     Definition of Terms/Concepts<br/>        To the purpose of clarity, the research will operationalize the outstanding concept in the research work. They are community, development, local government.<br/>COMMUNITY: This simply means group of people with the same or common tradition, belief, custom and language, living within a specific geographical area.<br/>DEVELOPMENT: This could be seen as a deliberate effort made by human beings so as to tap available human and non-human resources at a given time in order to bring positive result.<br/>LOCAL GOVERNMENT: This could be seen as the third tier of government (government at the grass root) created by law to take care of the people and to improve the social, economic and cultural conditions of the communities and of the integration of the communities into life of the nation.<br/><br/>\n\nPROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IN BENDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF ABIA STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IN BENDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF ABIA STATE", "id": 12}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>SURROGACY <br/>CHAPTER ONE: GENERAL INTRODUCTION</b><br/>1.1 INTRODUCTION <br/>Surrogacy is a method of assisted reproduction following an agreement whereby a woman agrees to carry a pregnancy to terms for another person or people as the case may be, these persons in the agreement with the surrogate mother will become the parents to the new born child after birth. If the surrogate mother receives monetary compensationit is known as commercial surrogacy, if not it is simply altruistic.<br/>Surrogacy is seldom the first choice on the journey to have children and build a family, often, people come to surrogacy after trying and exhausting other options such as intra uterine inseminations (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF) and gametes intra fallopian transfer (GIFT), research has it that the most common reasons why people come to surrogacy among anyother reasons which are medical problems such as impotency on the part of the male intending parent, absence of <br/>uterus, impaired uterus, medical conditions which could be heightened by surprises and eventually endanger a woman’s health and life, and same sex marriage.<br/>Surrogacy is a topic and an issue that remains controversial among many people and nations. The scientific development however has been appreciated by the beneficiaries of the process. The growing surrogacy phenomenon in which women agree to have their babies used to undergo a pregnancy and give birth to the resulting to the baby is becoming a major issues of discussion and a for a ground of battle of opinion, it is often referred as ‘womb renting’ wherein a bodily service is provided for a fee or compensation.<br/>The practice is fraught with complexity and controversy surrounding the implications forwomen’s health, dignity, and human rights of the childand the mother, morality, ethics and religion, some societies are beginning to grapple with the issues it raises.<br/>A few of many issues raised by surrogacy includes: the rights of the child (REN) produced, the ethical, moral, religious and practical ramifications of the further commodification of women’s bodies; the lack of national laws and regulations on surrogacy in most countries is cast against a background of rapid usage.<br/>In surrogacy, the rights of the child are almost never considered, the transferring of duties of parenthood from the birthing mother to the contract couple denies the child to and with the gestational mother. This births the question, ‘who is the real or true mother to the surrogate child? The one who incubated the child or the one who is responsible for the spiritual, mental and physical social and otherwise upbringing’?<br/>Surrogacy simply degrades a pregnancy to a service for hire and a baby for a mere product of commercial agreement, it is the commodification of the women’s body. It is significant that the stance of certain nations or countries on surrogacy be known because of direct or indirect commercial, political, religious and cultural relations to these countries.<br/>In Nigeria, gestational surrogacy is practiced by a few IVF chinks, the guidelines are as approved by the practice guidelines of the ‘association of fertility and reproductive health’ (AFRH) of Nigeria. The Art regulation that is currently being considered by the senate permits surrogacy and allows some inducement to be paid for transport and other expenses.<br/>In Greece, surrogacy is legal [Law 3305/2005] (‘enforcement of medically assisted reproduction’).<br/>Israel in march 1996, legalized gestational surrogacy under the embryo carrying agreement law, in Iran, surrogacy is legal and popularly practiced, in the United Kingdom (UK) commercial surrogacy arrangements are illegal, prohibited by the surrogacy arrangement act 1985’, Saudi Arabian religious authorities do not allow the use of surrogate mothers, instead suggest medical procedures to restore fertility and ability to deliver.<br/> The United states of America has surrogacy and its legal issues under state jurisdiction and legal situation for surrogacy varies from state to state, surrogacy friendly states include California, Illinois, Arkansas, Maryland and New Hampshire, in states like Michigan, it is a felony punishable by fine of up to $50,000 and up to five years in prison.<br/>1.2 CLARIFICATION OF TERMS<br/>For ease in the study of this material, it is paramount that certain reoccurring terms be clarified: <br/>1.2.1 SURROGACY<br/>Surrogacy is a scientific development in the field of child bearing which involves an agreement where a woman agrees to carry a pregnancy to term for a person or people, with or without an agreed compensation. This practice dates as far back as biblical times.<br/>1.3 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>  With the ideological controversies and conflicts in the world especially in the religious (Christian) world as it relates to surrogacy, this project attempts to answer certain questions: <br/>-The meaning and definition of surrogacy.<br/>-Impact on the world as it relates to infertility and child bearing.<br/>-The position of the church on surrogacy.<br/>1.4 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br/>Basically, this project aims at the following goals:<br/>-to peruse the concept of surrogacy<br/>-to explore the impacts of surrogacy on the church and the world.<br/>-to relate the position or stance of the church on surrogacy.<br/>-to proffer a balance between the ideals of scientific development in reproduction and the ideals of the church on procreation.<br/>1.5 METHODOLOGY<br/>The methodology of this research is archival and critical. Hence, books, journals, the internet, and all sources bearing information on the subject matter and related topics would be consulted for a concrete report.<br/>1.6 SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>The scope of study of this research document is restricted to the definition and meaning of surrogacy as well as the stance of the church, bioethicists and philosophers on surrogacy. <br/>1.7 DIVISION OF WORK<br/>    This work is divided into five chapters, each chapter bearing an idea connected to other chapters for a wholesome project. Chapter one comprises of the general introduction, clarification of terms, statement of problem, aims and objectives, methodology, scope of study and division of work.<br/>     Chapter two explores marriage, old and new testament views on marriage, the history and types of surrogacy. Chapter three views the impacts of surrogacy, chapter for highlights the position of the church, philosophers and bioethicists on surrogacy.

The questionnaire and interview instrument will be used to collect the data from the respondents.  The analysis of the study is based on the instrument used for data collection. It consists of quantitative and qualitative methods of data analysis. According  to the findings, there are factors that can be related to child labour, which can range from poverty , lack of education, low economical background, absence of policies, and lack of awareness and so on. However, children who are not well educated due to some constraint or factors may be face with low self-esteem and actualization. Many parents who have many children due to polygamous type of marriage do have a lot of children from various wives, and due to this, it can be difficult to carter for them, mainly were there are no good economic background or better welfare for the family. This can lead or make most of the children to be out to felt for themselves in other to survive in the society. Child labour has various forms; child slavery and slave life practices, forced or compulsory laour, including debt bondage and seldom, the use of children in prostitution, pornography and the drug trade activities.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE    <br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>Background Of The Study    -    <br/>Statement Of The Problem    -    <br/>Research Questions    -    <br/>Objectives of the Study    -    <br/>Significance of the Study    -    <br/>Definition of the Terms    -    <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Literature Review    -<br/>2.2 Review of Empirical Literature    <br/>2.3 Theoretical Framework    -<br/>2.4 Review of relevant theory    -    -    <br/>2.5 Hypothesis    -<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.1 Research Design    -    <br/>3.2 Population of the Study    -    -<br/>3.3 Sample size and Sample Technique<br/>3.4 Instrument for Data Collection    -<br/>3.5 Method of Data Analysis    -<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/> DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS<br/>4.1 Introduction    -<br/>4.2 Socio-Demography of Respondents by Sex                                                                                                       <br/>4.3 Major Research Issues<br/>44 Discussion of finding    <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/>5.1 Conclusion     <br/>5.2 Recommendation    s-<br/>Reference    -    <br/>Questionnaire    -    -<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>Background of the study<br/>Child poverty refers to the phenomenon of children living in poverty. This applies to children that come from a poor family background or orphans being raised with the minimum acceptable standards of living for the nation where that child lives are used to be poor. In developing countries these standard are lower and when combined with the increased number of orphans the effects are more extreme.<br/>The definition of children in most countries is people under the age of eighteen; while biologically the transition from childhood to adulthood to said to occur with the onset of puberty. Culturally defining the end of childhood is more complex, and takes into account factors such as the commencement of work, end of schooling and marriage as well as class, gender and race. According to the United Nations Children`s Fund (UNICEF) “children living in poverty are those who experiences deprivation of the materials, spiritual and emotional resources needed to survive, develop and thrive, leaving them unable to enjoy their rights, achieve their full potentials or participate as full and equal member of the society”.<br/>The Child Fund International (CFI) definition is based in Deprivation (lack of materialistic condition and services). Exclusion (denial of rights and safety) and Vulnerable (when society cannot deal with threats to children) other charitable organizations also uses this multidimensional approach to child poverty, defining it as a combination of economic, social, cultural, physical, environmental and emotional factors. These definitions suggest child poverty as multidimensional, relative to their current and changing living condition and complex interactions of the body, mind and emotions are involved.<br/>The easiest way to qualify child poverty is by setting the absolute or relative monetary threshold. If a family does not earn above that threshold, the children of the family will be considered to live below the poverty line. Absolute poverty threshold are fixed and generally only updated for price changes, whereas relative poverty threshold are developed with reference to the actual income of the population and reflect changes in consumption. The absolute poverty thresholds are the money needed to purchase a defined quantity of goods and services. While there is no exact standard used to set the thresholds, and it varies from country to country, it generally reflects the minimum income needed to acquire the necessities of life. Certain organizations, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Funds, use the absolute poverty thresholds of U.S$1 a day to measure poverty in developing countries. Since the 1960s, the US has use absolute poverty thresholds adjusted for family size and composition to determine those living in poverty. Europe and many other developed countries use a relative poverty threshold, typically 50% of the countries average income. Relative poverty does not necessarily mean the child is lacking anything but is more a reflection of inequality in society. Child poverty, when measure using relative thresholds, will only improve if low-income families benefit more from economic advances than well-off families. Measures of Child poverty using income thresholds will vary depending on whether relative or absolute poverty is measured and what relative measures, poverty is much higher in the US than in Europe, but if an absolute measure is used then poverty in some Europe countries is higher. It is argued that using income as the only threshold ignores the multidimensional aspects of child poverty, which includes consumption requirement, access to resources and the ability to interact in society safety and without discrimination.<br/>Statement of the problem<br/>Child labour as a result of poverty can contribute to the economic growth and development, however, the risks that are attached supersede the economic positive aspect of it. Risks like motor accident, rape, kidnapping, extortion, sexual molestation and the child involvement in robbery and other anti-social behaviors are too great to ignore. Child hawking exposes the child to a lot of hazards like sexual defilement, sexual assaults, neglects and threat of punishment for speaking out a exemplified. The consequences of these acts usually result in an unwanted pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, psychological problems and a gradual withdrawal from a healthy relationship with the opposite gender (UNICEF, 2000). Oloko (1989) noted that street hawking exposes the male and female child to danger posed by fraudsters and actual murderers because of their vulnerability at odd hawking hours. They are usually under personal jeopardy, harsh and hazardous condition such as becoming an easy target to occult predators (ritual killers). Although, various efforts were made by federal government and non-governmental organizations to stem the trend, such as the creation of children`s games village, the passage of the Child`s Rights Bill in 2005 by the National Assembly and the subsequent passage by some states, not much has been achieve as the trend continues. <br/>Child labor is recognized as the worst form of abuse and exploitation of children. The convention on rights of child (CRC) urges the governments to take effective measures for its eradication. Child labor is pervasive problem in developing countries. Africa and Asia account for over 90% of total child employment. The international labor organization (ILO) estimates the number of working children are abour 250 million in the developing countries, of whom at least 120 million are working full time. Of these working children 61% are in Asia, 32% in Africa and 7% in Latin America. In Pakistan about eight million children are working in different occupations and two third of them are employed full time. The fundamental rights of child as survival, education, protection and development are grossly violated by child labor. The root cause of child labor is extreme poverty which forces the parents to employ their children for some extra money for daily living.<br/>Child labour is a complex issue and various factors behind the laboring predominate indifferent contexts. To be able to combat child labour in Nigeria, the underlying causes must be understood. In-debt understanding of the situation must include special attention to the children`s own views which the study believes are the most important source of information, therefore, this study wants to investigate the underlying factors responsible for child poverty in Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>Research questions<br/>For the purpose of this research to be achieved, the following research questions will be raised:<br/>The level of awareness of children living in poverty in Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area.<br/>The socio-cultural effects of poverty on child labor.<br/>What are the effect of poverty to child labour.<br/>Objectives of the Study<br/>The general objective of this research study is to examine<br/>To find out the extent of awareness of child poverty in Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area<br/>To find out  the effect of poverty in children under the age of 18 years in Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area<br/>The negative aspect of child labor in ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area<br/>Significance of the Study<br/>The overall concern of the study is to obtain information, which can be used to proffer solution to child poverty, prioritize and monitor the worrisome problem of working children.<br/>The first specific concern is to determine the categories of the economic activities of children in rural and urban areas and the sectors in which they work in order to obtain valid information. The survey was designed to identify categories of child labour including unpaid family workers, paid workers in agricultural sectors, apprentices,as well as nomadic activities and household keeping activities of children.<br/>The second concern is the determination of the conditions under which children work, namely; regularity, time-demand, intensity, periods, problems and hazard of works. Moreover, information was obtained on the physical and social environment of work.<br/>The third concern of the survey is to obtain information on the attributes of children who carried out different categories of work such as age, gender, socio-economic status and other circumstances of their families as well as their ages at commencement of work and their educational and health status.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF POVERTY ON CHILD LABOR: A STUDY OF EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECTS OF POVERTY ON CHILD LABOR: A STUDY OF EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, EDO STATE", "id": 14}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE PREVALENCE OF FEMALE TRAFFICKING IN UGBOR COMMUNITY: CASE STUDY OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, EDO STATE.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Female trafficking in general and the trafficking of women in particular have been attracting increasing interest from states, international bodies, non-governmental organizations, the media and academia. The greater visibility conferred on this phenomenon has translated, on a national and international level, into policies designed to combat and prevent it, whose efficiency is debatable. This is the result not only of a lack of understanding of the specific features of the trafficking of women, but also of the fact that other objectives underlying the construction of these policies hardly meet the subjective needs and expectations of trafficked women. This article discusses some of the issues and both emerging and absent from the legal framework for the sexual trafficking of women, with reference to the empirical situation of sexual trafficking in Nigeria as analyzed in the study.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>Background of study    -<br/>1.2 Statement of the problem    -        <br/>Objective of the study    <br/>1.4 Research Questions    <br/>1.5 Significance of Study    <br/>1.6 Definition of Concept    <br/>CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>2.1.

Trafficking is largely a hidden crime, it is difficult to accurately determine the true prevalence of trafficking in women (United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime, 2012). Although valid and reliable data are hard to ﬁnd, a recent report estimated that 24.9 million individuals around the world are currently victims of forced labor (ILO, 2017). These individuals are exploited in economic activities such as agriculture, ﬁshing, domestic work, construction, manufacturing, and the commercial sex industry. Although the majority of detected victims are traﬃcked across international borders, 42% are victimized within their own countries (UNODC, 2016). Among these detected victims, 71% are female and 28% are children (UNODC, 2016).<br/>Traﬃcking is frequently aggravated by socio-economic problems, conﬂicts, or natural disasters that force people to seek work far from home or to migrate for survival (Sigmon, 2008). Macro-level factors associated with traﬃcking include economic injustice, poverty, wars and natural disasters, globalization of the consumer market, lesser respect for females, unattached men in construction operations and military installations in developing countries, and global sex tourism (Roby, 2005). Micro-level risk factors include family breakdown, poor family relations, child abuse and neglect, mental illness and substance use among parents, and homelessness among children (Roby, 2005).<br/>Trafficking in persons is a serious crime in which humans, especially females, are bought and sold as commodities. It is now a global phenomenon, but more prevalent in certain countries of the world. The European Police Organization(EUROPOL) has labeled the Nigerian organized network dealing in trafficking in persons as one of the major law enforcement challenges facing many European countries (US Trafficking Report, 2014). The United Kingdom government reports in 2014 that Nigeria generates the second highest number of potential victims of trafficking in persons. The leading country with a higher number of potential victims was Albania (SundaySun, 2015). Arising from her population size, economic potentials, political crises and geographical location, Nigerian is a source, transit and destination country for trafficking in persons in the West African sub – region (Adepoju, 2014).<br/> The nature of trafficking is both international and within the national borders, in which the young girls are recruited and trafficked for sexual exploitation and domestic servitude. The Nigerian trafficking situation has been compounded by the international terrorist group, Boko Haram, who have been forcefully recruiting young boys as child soldiers and abducting women and girls in the north-eastern parts of the country and subjecting them to sexual slavery though forced marriages to terrorists and domestic servitude around the neighboring countries of Chad, Niger Republic, Sudan, and Cameroun (NAPTIP, 2015). According to United States Department of State Trafficking Report (2014), Nigerian women and young girls are trafficked and subjected to forced prostitution in Italy, Spain, Scotland, the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Greece, and Russia, the Middle East especially Dubai, North Africa and Malaysia. In some of these countries, the young girls also serve as hard drugs courier and mules for the trafficking network.<br/>The international economic undertone of trafficking in persons, as being predominantly emanating from poorer countries in the international system was given emphasis by the United Nations 1994 General Assembly when it described trafficking in persons as the illegal and clandestine smuggling or \"movements of persons across national and international borders, largely from developing countries (largely from African continent) and some countries in transition (largely from Eastern Europe and Asian continent) with the end goal of forcing women and girl children (especially) into sexually or economically oppressive and exploitative situations for the profit of recruiters, traffickers and crime syndicates.\" (UNICEF, 2011). This study intends to research on the prevalence of female trafficking in Oredo, Benin City, Nigeria.<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>Human trafficking is being described as a global problem and a modern form of slavery. Women and children are the key target groups because of their unequal socio-economic status and their lack of awareness of their legal rights (Onyejekwe, 2005). this indicates, that women and girls make up 98 percent of the overwhelming majority of those trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation (ILO, 2008). Several factors have been explored as the root causes of human trafficking and these includes familydisintegration, genderinequality, feminization of poverty, feminization of migration,  globalization, and patriarchy.<br/>According to the UNODC (2016) highlighted that, of the persons trafficked for sexual exploitation, 97% are women and girls, while over one-third of persons trafficked for labor are women. In the same vain, UNODC (2014) reported that children in general and girls in particular, represented a continually increasing share of detected trafficking victims over the period 2004 to 2011. Other reports have identified a similar trend in traffickers targeting young girls within younger ages, believing they will be easier to control and to “satisfy high demand for sex with young girls” (UNODC, 2014). Nigeria is currently being described as a leading country in human trafficking with UNICEF classifying her as a leading country of origin for human trafficking (Skogeth, 2006). <br/>In as much as Nigeria is being described as the center hub for human trafficking, the metropolitan Benin City of Edo State is considered as a major market for cross border commercial sex work arising from human trafficking(Onyeonoru, 2005, Norli, 2006).  Majority of the previous studies conducted in relation to women trafficking and international prostitution in Benin City identified economic depression, occasioned by Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) as the root cause of this imbroglio (Women’s Health and Action Research Centre (WHARC, 2012; Osakue &amp; Okoedion, 2012; UNICRI/UNODC, 2013; Onyeonoru, 2013). Previous studies reveal that there is the involvement of close relatives or family members in the process of trafficking. As observed by (Long ,2014), trafficking for sexual exploitation though a worldwide phenomenon, indicates a cultural practice within the given society. <br/>Nigeria's response to addressing the menace of trafficking in persons has been driven by human rights abuses associated with human trafficking which over the years, had become very embarrassing in the international community, especially in Europeas Nigeria has been described as a source of transit to destination country for trafficked persons (International Labour Organization, 2008). Besides, Nigeria was keen on fulfilling her international obligation to the United Nations Conventions and Protocols she had signed. The National Legislation to domesticate the Protocol was sponsored as a private member Bill in the National Assembly sponsored by a Non-Governmental Organization, the Women Trafficking and Child Labor Eradication Foundation (WOTCLEF) in collaboration with some other civil society groups.The Bill was passed and signed into law in July 2003, as the Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition) Law Enforcement and Administration Act 2003 (as amended). This law, amended in 2005, has now been repealed, and a new legal framework put in place to fight trafficking in persons in Nigeria. This suggests Nigeria has put adequate legal provisions in place to protect women’s rights with regards to human trafficking, but the implementation and enforcement remain a controversial matter altogether. Laws are not implemented in a vacuum, but within a social structure.  The non implementations of these laws have also contributed to the prevalence of female trafficking in Edo State.<br/>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The broad objective of this work is to examine the prevalence of female trafficking in Ugbor Community of Oredo Local Government of Edo State.<br/>The specific objectives of this study are to: <br/>To understand the degree of the prevalence of female trafficking in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>To examine socio-economic factors that militate the prevalence of female trafficking in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State. <br/>To examinethe strategies and interventions employed by the Government to address the prevalence of female trafficking.<br/>To identify interventions and strategies employed by traffickers in trafficking victims of organized crime.<br/>To identify the role of Social Workers in addressing the menace of female trafficking.<br/> RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>Based on the assumption made, the following research questions are postulated.<br/>What is the degree of the organized crime in trafficking victims  in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State?<br/>What are the socio-economic factors that influence the prevalence of female trafficking in Ughoton Community of Edo State?<br/>What are the strategies and interventions employed by the Government to address the prevalence of female trafficking?<br/>What interventions and strategies employed by traffickers in trafficking victims of organized crime?<br/>What are the roles social workers play in addressing the menace of female trafficking?<br/> SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This study will be relevant to both theoretically and practically. Contribution to existing literature,  the study will  provide  the  general  public  with  information  on  the  involvement  of  organized  criminal groups  in  human  trafficking.  This  study  intends  to  add  to  the  body  of  existing  knowledge  on human trafficking and female trafficking in Nigeria. Such studies will give us important information that will enables us to contextualize information from other sources, and also to monitor changes, for instance in response to policies.<br/>The awareness that this study will create will serve as a strategy for strengthening  crime  prevention  against  female  trafficking,  especially  to  the  inhabitants  of Ugbor Community in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State. It will be useful to the body charged with combating human trafficking in Nigeria which is (NAPTIP),  This  study  will  further  encourage  awareness  campaigns;  when  people  are informed,  the  chances  of  their  being  at  risk  is  significantly  reduced. This kind of research will improve our understanding of how prostitution arenas are organized, and with this, also our understanding of female trafficking for prostitution.<br/>1.6 DEFINITIONS OF CONCEPTS<br/>Human Trafficking: This involves the act and attempted act of recruitment and transportation of persons (both male and female) within or across borders.<br/>Women Trafficking: This refers to the recruitment and transportation of women across national or international borders either voluntarily or involuntarily, for sexual or domestic purposes. It also includes the purchase, sale, transfer, receipt or harboring of young girls and women through deception for the purpose of subjecting the women and girls to involuntary servitude..<br/>Women Traffickers: These are organized criminal rings involved in the smuggling (illegal transportation) of women across national borders to regional destinations(e.g. Europe and Italy). They are commonly referred to as “Trolley”, “Italo” “Sponsors”, “Madame” and “Boss”, etc. <br/>Trafficked Persons: These are persons, male and female, recruited and transported within or across national borders for the purpose of sexual or domestic services.<br/>Internal Trafficking: This is also referred to as domestic trafficking. It involves the recruitment and transportation of persons within the borders of a country, either from rural to urban areas or from one State to another, for purposes of sex work, child labor, or domestic services.<br/>External trafficking (Cross-border trafficking):External  trafficking  is  also  referred  to  as  “international  trafficking”  and involves the movement of people across national, continental and international borders  for  the  purpose  of  sex  work,  child  labour  and  domestic  service  in exchange for monetary reward (Akor, 2007).<br/><br/>\n\nTHE PREVALENCE OF FEMALE TRAFFICKING IN UGBOR COMMUNITY: CASE STUDY OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, EDO STATE.<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PREVALENCE OF FEMALE TRAFFICKING IN UGBOR COMMUNITY: CASE STUDY OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, EDO STATE.", "id": 15}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE CHALLENGES CONFRONTING THE ELDERLY: CASE STUDY OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, EDO STATE<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/> INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1     Background of the study<br/>Individuals begin their ageing process at the moment of birth, and go through the life course accumulating a range of experiences that may positively or negatively affect their capabilities and wellbeing in later years (Aquilino, 1990).Population ageing is a global phenomenon with broader implication for demographic, socio-economic and health conditions of any nation advancements in the field of medicine have led to greater longevity and by implication, a substantial increase in the population of the elderly.<br/>It was revealed in (Wahab, 2013) that ageing is expensive and government in many developing nations is afraid of the costs of maintaining the increasing population of the elderly. Older people are a valuable asset to society, contributing in many ways (economically, socially, intellectually and otherwise,) to the progress of the society in their productive age. Unfortunately, in many societies older people have been left out at perpetual risk and uncared for. The aged is, therefore, deprived of smartness, promptness, dynamism, and confidence, which were the basic personality feature of youth and adulthood. <br/>Furthermore, the optimistic outlook of the aged gradually turns into pessimism. Extrinsic changes among the aged are the effects of disorganized social institutions, values and norms arising out of surrounding, social forces of urbanization, industrialization, modernization, and globalization (Ushasnee, 2004), Hence, the disorganized society, family, and personality produced deprivations to the aged in the contemporary society.  <br/>Even though the number and proportion of the aged is increasing globally, the rate of increase as well as the nature of institutional responses to their well-being differs from culture to culture.  As growing old comes with numerous challenges, some industrially developed countries tend to better prepare for it while some others, particularly Africa, are least prepared for this natural and universal process (Adeleke, 2014).<br/>Historically, before colonialism and subsequent governmental social policies dealing with the elderly were developed, services to the elderly were provided almost entirely by the family members (Annsuppes&amp; Wells, 2000). Traditionally in Sub-Saharan Africa, the main source of support was the household and family, supplemented in many cases by other informal mechanisms, such as kinship networks and mutual aid societies. This was possible in Nigeria since the society was homogeneous and with self sustaining system. Nigeria like other African countries became bettered by the forces of capitalism through colonialism in to money market economy, services and care of the elderly diminished (Zachariah, Phibine “&amp; David, 2013). These changes associated with development and modernization, combine to weaken traditional social values and networks that stress the important role of elderly people in the society and that reinforce traditions of intergenerational exchange and reciprocity. Earlier researches on the situation of the elderly revealed the overlapping pictures of failure to find an institutionalized social support for the elderly (Wahab, 2013).<br/>Often viewed and described as a dependent population, particularly in respect ofneeds (as longevity requires care and support as well as high cost of medical and health care), but the role of the elderly in nation building cannot be overemphasized (Adebowale, 2012). As the scholarsuccinctly put it, “they are the custodians of culture and tradition,  mediators during conflict resolution and contributions in enforcing peace in their various communities (Adebowale, 2012)’In traditional Nigeria societies, the family system and structure play a major role in the support for the older members. The extended family system strengthens the bond of relationships, giving every member a sense of belonging and advancing the interests. Thus, the task of care giving for the elderly lies primarily on the children, grandchildren, spouses, siblings, in-laws and other members of the family. This age-long tradition persists till the modern day Nigerian society but its effects had largely waned and eroded (Adeleke, 2014; Okoye, 2013; Oluwabamide and Egbafona, 2012).<br/> The influence of industrialization and urbanization on the family structure has been greatly striking and largely negative. The pressure to leave agricultural employment in rural areas for wage employment in the urban cities, increased personal roles and commitments, unemployment, economic crises, epidemics, widespread poverty, and numerous personal financial priorities and engagements are just a few of the factors that tend to impinge upon the bond of extended family relationships and the extent of care available from the primary care givers (Adeleke, 2014; Okoye 2013; Oluwabamide and Eghafona, 2012). This is compounded by the absence of government support and provision for the elderly as there is no specialized institution even the pension scheme designed to cater for the retired sector employees are often not beneficial tothem. This scenario creates a condition where the aged are neglected, left to fend for themselves and sometimes abused, having great implication on their physical and mental state.<br/>1.2     Statement of the problem<br/>Elderly people in Nigeria suffer a lot of economic and socialhardship in an increasingly hostile, competitive and intolerant society. Older people constitute one of the poorest groups in Nigerian society and aging in Nigeria constitutes a painful process attended by poor health, poverty and helplessness (Asagha, 2005). Older people rightly deserve the much needed care and support backed up by programme and policies that will enable them have control over their own live daily (Edward &amp; Miller 2003; Banks, 2004).The good news is that aging is swiftly becoming a worldwide phenomenon and undeniably urgently serious policy concern which needs adequate recognition by government of developed nation where it has reflected in the government vital document of economic and social development strategy (Okoye, 2014).<br/>In Nigeria, unlike in the developed countries, there exists no identifiable government intervention programmes dedicated to the welfare of the elderly persons despite their growing numbers. Though a mention could be made of the public pension scheme which places retired employees of government on life pensions, (Adeleke 2014) noted that this scheme is limited to less than 1 percent of the older population and that the whole scheme is marred by inefficiency, excessive bureaucracy and corruption, and sometimes portends danger to the beneficiaries as some became physically disabled or even give up the ghost in the process of assessing their pensions because of the tedious processes involved. Adebowale (2012) and Adeleke (2014) also noted that the majority of the elderly (including those who returned home after retirement) live in the rural areas where agriculture remains the major occupation and thus no opportunity to receive pension benefits from the government.<br/>Besides absence of government intervention, the extended family system which traditionally used to be the source of primary care giving in Nigeria  is greatly weakened and disintegrating. According toOluwabamide and Egbafona (2012), “today in African societies, the traditional institution responsible for care giving is being dismantled”. Pressure from urbanization, industrialization, modernization, poverty, high cost of living, dwindling appreciation of the role and usefulness of the older population, individuality, geographical mobility of youthful population and others are reasons given for the collapse in extended family structure and interdependence.<br/>The largest social protection programs for older people in Sub-Saharan African  are occupational pension schemes, but these typically cover only people who have worked in the public sector, in state enterprises, or in large private firms in the modern sector. The self-employed, workers in the informal sector, domestic workers, and the vast majority of the population living in rural areas and engaged in subsistence agriculture or other forms of subsistence living, majority of this group are excluded from formal social security schemes and must rely on their families for support and protection when they can no longer work (National Academic Press, 2006).<br/>Nigeria’s economy is the most viable in Africa. Unfortunately, Nigeria is currently one of the countries in Sub Sahara Africa with a large percentage of the aged without any form of social protection. However, the high rate of unemployment and the poor state of infrastructural facilities obstruct the activities of the elderly which within the existing condition expose them to more danger and untimely death. The elderly have contributed to the economy and the society at large and this is an important stage of their life that should never be ignored, yet there is no formal social security programme to cater for this large population of the aged. Caring for the elderly introduces many problems that are very similar in most developing countries including Nigeria. The conditions under which informal and formal supports are delivered to the elderly may have a major influence on the social, economic and security of the pattern of care for the elderly.<br/>This social exclusion has led to increase in challenges confronting this group as they are left to go through phases of life that hinder smooth aging and the elderly are faced with unwholesome challenges which include poverty, isolation, poor nutrition, poor quality health care, poor housing, hunger, inadequate domestic supports and other social services that will enhance smooth aging. These challenges call for adjustment., Adjusting to these and other changes is the central challenge in the social world of the elderly, as they may discover they can no longer cope on their own and have to rely on other people for care and support. Having to rely on caregivers for care and support introduces as new dimension to the social problems of the elderly (Akpan&amp;Umobong, 2013.<br/>The present imperative is that societies must respond to the extraordinary potential and range of variability in individual ageing, and seize the opportunity to rethink our notion of limits and recognize the far-reaching benefit societies stand to gain from the continuing contribution to the wellbeing of the elderly (John, 2000).<br/>The foregoing situations put the elderly in Nigeria in precarious physical and mental conditions and by implication, they face numerous challenges. Some of such challenges as enumerated by Oluwabamide and Egbafona (2012) include poor dietary provision, poor physical and mental health, poverty, isolation and loneliness, loss of respect, witchcraft  accusations, poor housing and poor living environments and susceptibility to epidemics. The foregoing conditions also hold sway for the elderly  inOvia Northeast Local Government Area<br/>1.3     Objectives of the study<br/> This study is designed in general terms to determine the challenges of the elderly in Ovia Northeast Local Government Area of Edo State. Based on the above. The study will focus on the following specific objectives:<br/>To ascertain the social, physical and mental conditions of the aged in Ovia North East Local Government Area.<br/>To investigate the challenges confronting the elderly in Ovia North East Local Government Area.<br/>To ascertain the form of social security available for the elderly in OviaNorth East Local Government Area.<br/>To suggest panacea to the challenges facing the aged in OviaNorth East Local Government Area.<br/>1.4     Research questions<br/> This study will address the following questions:<br/>What are the social, physical and mental conditions of the aged in Ovia North East Local Government Area?<br/>What are the challenges facing the elderly in Ovia North East Local Governement Area?<br/>What are the forms of social security supporting the elderly in Ovia North East Local Government Area?<br/>How can the aged be supported to live meaningfully in Ovia North East Local Government Area?<br/>1.5     Significance of the study <br/> The practice implication of this study and the findings can be used to inform policy makers and administrators to know the challenges confronting the elderly population in Nigeria and the need to respond through effective policy formulation and implementation. It would also contribute to the clarion call for policy intervention that will protect the elderly without any institutionalized social support and ameliorate the sufferings of the aged pensioners.<br/>This study will be of great significant to the extant body of knowledge of academia, practicing social workers in both public and private sector and it will build on the existing knowledge and fill the existing vacuum in data on the elderly in Ovia North east Local Government of Edo state.Moreso, this research will educate the society on the enormous challenges confronting the aging population without institutionalized social support and its manifestation among the aged pensioners in contemporary Nigeria.<br/><br/>1.6     Area of the study<br/> This study was conducted among the aged male and female in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State, Nigeria.Ovia North East Local Government Area is one of the Eighteen Local Government Areas in Edo State of Nigeria. The Local Government was created from the district council under the local government law in 1976.<br/>Ovia North East Local Government Area is one of the largest Local Government Area in Edo State with higher concentration of older people in Edo state which is the reason this Local Government Area was chosen for this study.

It affects hundreds of the millions of people, many of whom are mothers and fathers for two thirds of citizens in every nation. It is treating as number one; it creates social illness for people. It is also a principle roots of the problems of many young people who become involve in various criminal activities like drug peddling. Advance fee fraud (419) and it disturbs the sleep of millions and for the millions of others. It could be just around the corner. <br/>According to Encyclopedia America volume 27 (1974)  it state that, unemployment is a state of person who wants to work, but does not have a job. It can be seen as a structural problem where the production capacity of the economy is far below the level of absorbing the available manpower. The unemployment can also be said to mean those people who are able and eager to work, but for whom no suitable works are available.<br/>According to ADRIAN SINFIELD unemployment devalues or debases the standard or quality of life in the society. He elaborates further in the following ways: <br/>The working force would not be able to leave unsatisfying or unsatisfactory jobs because of fear they could not be able to get another and as a result o these, the number of frustrated and alienated workers increase. <br/>Divisions within society are likely to grow. The unemployed and those unsatisfactory or unsatisfying works may blame weak groups in society for their problems. Immigrants and ethnic minority may be used as scapegoat with the result that racial tension increases. <br/>Sinfield believes that high level of unemployment reduce the chances of equality of opportunity been achieved. <br/>John Lea and Jock Young said that unemployment among the youths leads to the marginalization of some members of society because those who are unemployed feel they have to stake in the society. Since they are not in any union, they lack the institutional means to express their discontent. Many social problems have been linked to unemployment “Sheila Allen and Alan Watson” says links between unemployment and a wide range of social problems have been made by academicians, politicians, and journalists, ill health, premature death, attempted and actual suicide, marriage breakdown, child battering, racial conflict and football hooliganism are of the examples that have been cited if we look critically, we could understand that all these problems are being caused by unemployment and it can be seen as an effect on individual rather than society. However, clearly, they also have implication for society because of unemployment does not cause or contribute to these problems, than it may threaten the stability of society by undermining the family and causing racial tension and crime. <br/>Unemployment is probably the most widely feared phenomenon of our times affirms the organization for economic cooperation and development (OECD). <br/>The extent and consequence of this phenomenon are known, writes the commission European Communities, but dealing it is “auduous” it is specter says one expert that is, returning to taunt the street of the old continent. <br/>Unemployment is an old problem, for centuries people have been finding themselves involuntary without work. Once the job was finished tens of thousand of people used in large construction project then becomes unemployed at lest until they find themselves in some other jobs. In the mid term they led a rather precarious life to say the least. <br/>During the middle age “even though a problem of unemployment in the modern sense did not yet exist” in those days anyone who did not work was considered as vagabonds. During later as 19th century many British analysts associated with the unemployed primarily with the roughs and a vagrant who slept out or walked the street at night explains Professor Burnelt. <br/>The discovering of unemployment “took place near the end of 19th century or the beginning of the 20th century. Social commissions were instituted to study and resolve the problem such as the selected committee of British house of common on distress from want of employment. In 1895, joblessness had become a social plague. The new awareness grew dramatically particularly after the First World War. The conflict with its frantic arms production had particularly eliminated unemployment. But beginning in the 1920s, the Western world faces a series of recession culminating great expression that began in 1929 and struck all the industrialized economy of the world. After the second world war, many countries experienced a new economic boom, and unemployment dropped, but the beginning of today’s unemployment can be easily traced back to the mid 1960 says the organization for economic cooperation’s and development, the labour market suffered a new blow caused by the oil crisis of the 1970s and the computerized information explosion with consequent layoff, unemployment has begun relentless ascent cutting into even those white colours and managerial sectors once considered secure. Economic distinguishes between a numbers of types of unemployment; Frictional, cyclical and structural unemployment. <br/>Frictional Unemployment: This type of unemployment does not usually seen as serious problem because it occurs when a worker changes job but does not adapt immediately to the new job. <br/>Structural Unemployment: Generally leads to include as an important constituent, that element of unemployment, which is due to the insufficiency of means of production in relations to the employment availability’s. Structural unemployment can also occur when jobs are available and there are workers seeking employment, but workers do not match the job.<br/>Cyclical Unemployment: In the broad sense the term covers not only cyclical unemployment proper, but also seasonal unemployment: this is a type of unemployment whereby throughout the period, the number of unemployment far exceeded the number of vacancies, that is, the supply of labour exceed the demand of workers by employers. The concepts of cyclical unemployment do not imply that unemployment will fall to comparatively low in the future. It is momentous to note that we have both rural and urban unemployment. <br/>To the rural areas employment, which is the main form, under utilization of labour  in developing countries. It comprises those people who are doing some work but could do more, yet are not seeking extra work. It includes many unpaid household workers and family workers in agriculture. If the number of people working on a farm holding is increased but more land is not cultivated, there is going to be some disguised unemployment. Urban unemployment on the other hand takes form of visible under employment, which comprise those people who are doing work which is below their capacity. A person who is trained but cannot find work that is suitable to his ability and take unskilled jobs for instance is visibly underemployed, if he or she is actively seeking better work. <br/>Unemployment has hit all sectors of the economy one by one. For instance agriculture with its increased in mechanization, which puts people out of work, then industry, which has been affected by the energy crises from the 1970s on and now, the services sector, commerce education  a section previously considered unassailable. Twenty years ago unemployment rate in excess of 2 or 3% would have caused great alarm. <br/>Today an industrialized nation is well if unemployment is kept below 5% or 6% and many developed nations have higher rate. <br/>Unemployment is not just a matter of facts and figures individual drama are the result for the plague that strikes men, women, and unemployment can prove to be tremendous burden especially if his been out of work for a long time will it difficult to have a job and sadly. Some have never been employed again. <br/>Furthermore, while the proportion of young men and women out for more than one year appears to have stabilized in the year April, 1985 to May 1986. The proportion of unemployment for three or more years increased to encompass nearly 100,000 young would be workers. In addition to a doubling of total youth unemployment displacement of the young unemployed into prolong durations of joblessness. <br/>With the advent of rising and persisted unemployment among young people, attempts to explain it cause. As Ashton (1987) points out that such explanation were sought first in demographic changes in the composition in the working population and later in the high wages paid to young workers. <br/>Ashton notes further that growth in the supply of young people to the labour market was in fact at peaked in 1979, before the sharp up turn in rate of youth unemployment in the early 1980s. Thus, an over supply of young people in the labour market can be best only a partial explanation of widespread youth unemployment. <br/>In Nigeria, many years ago secondary school leaver’s after they might have passed their West Africa School Certificate Examination (WASCE) looked forward to the future with confidence. Such school leavers may secure employment easier either of his choice or near choice with promotion prospect. He may decide to go on to continue his higher education or enter any training institution. Unlike the secondary school leaver, the university graduate could choose from a range of opportunity. The University graduate held an opportunity to either go into government service, public cooperation or to commercial company like a bank. <br/>In the past fifteen years, at least since 1970s, there have been high job markets for the secondary school leavers, in 1980s the University graduates have been hit with unemployment. In fact, this unemployment problem what has happened to the output of the secondary schools and universities. However, the concern of this study is to find out or to investigate into the cause and also to find out a possible solution to this enormous problem that threatens the core of out nation’s life stream. This research is also carried out to reduce the problem of unemployment among youths.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>One of the main characteristics of urban unemployment in the developing countries is that, the proportion of the young who are affected is generally large. In nearly every case the unemployment rate in the range of 15-34 age groups are equal to or more than, double the rate for the population as a whole, whose unemployment rate is already considerably influenced by the rate for young people. The present study becomes relevant because one of the most important problems facing Nigeria in general and Edo State in particular is that of employment creation. It is very pertinent that those that suppose to constitute labour force should be able bodied youths who are still under the age of 15-45 years. <br/>In our country today, those who can be found in this trauma (unemployment) were mainly the youths, those that posses their secondary school certificate and university first degree do not have a place  in labour force. This unemployment problem had actually pushed some youths to be hardened criminals, armed robbers, drug traffickers, football hooligans marriage breakdown, racial conflict, attempted and actual suicide. <br/>In Edo State, youth unemployment had lead to the manifestation or violence in the  society, for instance the Egor People Congress (EPC) members are unemployed youth, significant percentage of armed robbers are unemployed youth. Youth unemployment has created a balance deficiency in the overall function of Nigeria society, between ages 18-64 which are suppose to be working population of enlarge percentage whereby unemployment rate makes it impossible for this population to work. The dependent population which in fact is higher in percentage shall be sufficiently reimbursed, leading to mass poverty poor natural income. <br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>It is significant because it will add to already existing body of knowledge of youth unemployment. <br/>It is significant because it will look into the cause and effect of youth unemployment in Egor Local Government in South Nigeria providing visible solutions to unemployment in that area. <br/>It will bring to light various factors contributing to unemployment thus providing probable instrument to policy makers. <br/>It will classify, locate and verity variables while are expected to form pre-conditions of unemployment making problem solving possible. <br/>JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY <br/>This study is justified by its relevance in the area of contribution to the existing literature or materials and helping to solve problem of unemployment in the society. <br/>RELEVANT RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>What is unemployment? <br/>Who is youth? <br/>Who is unemployed? <br/>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>To determine the major causes of youth unemployment in Benin, Nigeria. <br/>To elicit the relationship (if there is any) between the overall economic characteristics of the country and youth unemployment. <br/>To elicit the effectiveness or impact of youth unemployment on the Nigeria industrial sector.<br/>To advice and give recommendation where necessary to the policy makers in the country on one hand and youths of the country on the other hand. <br/>DEFINITION OF CONCEPT<br/>In the field of social research, there is the need to clarify the meaning of concepts especially the way the investigation made use of them operationally. However, Goode and Halt (1952) defined concepts as logical constructs derived from sense expression, perception of even familiar complex experience. For the purpose of this research, the investigation would make the following research concepts. <br/>Employment: it is a means of having a job or other gainful occupation. <br/>Unemployment: it is important to remember that unemployment cannot simply be defined as the number of people without jobs. Such a wide definition would include children who are too young to work, pensioners who are retired and housewives and others who chose not to take up paid employment. Therefore it is state of a person who wants to work but does not have a job. <br/>Again, for the purpose of this research and in spite of our recognition of different definitions of youths in the literature on the subject, we shall restrict the concept to those young people between the ages of 10-30 years. They constitute about 65% of the total population in Nigeria. They also constitute the majority of the total work force in the country. <br/>Youth Unemployment: this is a total aggregate of able –bodied youth that found themselves in the dilemma of unemployment. <br/>Visible Unemployment: this consists of those who are doing no work, but are trying to get work. The numbers involved may not be very large, but they may include people who have obtained some education and cannot find suitable work. <br/>Residual Unemployment: this is associated with physical and mental disability. There is no country without residual unemployment and because of this; no country can achieved full employment. <br/>Seasonal Unemployment:  this has to do with climate that is labour being employed temporarily due to unfavourable climate condition. <br/>Voluntary Unemployment: where a person decided not to work either because the salaries is not sufficient or because of being a housewife. <br/>Disguised Unemployment: this is the main form of under – utilization of labour in developing countries. This usually occurs where a person is too qualified for the job he is doing, it comprise of those people who are not seeking extra work. <br/>Mass Unemployment: this is another type of unemployment, which look with trade cycle. It is usually characterized by a general fall in aggregate monetary. This happened during the period of depression. <br/>Structural Unemployment: this occurs when jobs are available and there are workers seeking employment, but the workers do not match the jobs. <br/>There are two types of unemployment <br/>Regional: exist where the workers do not live in the area where suitable vacancies are available. <br/>Sectoral: exist where the unemployed person lacks appropriate skills or qualified of full skills. <br/>GENERAL DESCRIPTION  OF THE STUDY <br/>The study will primarily be restricted to the resident of Egor local government area of Edo State. Thus it will be a micro study within the local government aimed at finding out the caused and affects of youths unemployment. The major limitation in this study will be the financial constraints coupled with the time limitation, as a result of my pursuit of academic activities. <br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>Youth unemployment in Edo State has been on the use since the colleges of second republic with vices of corruption and austerity. Then in Egor Local Government rural urban community where industrial activities are not developed and the people are semi – skilled works, traders and farmers.<br/>METHODOLOGY <br/>This research is designed to embrace both unemployed males and females residing in Egor Local Government of Edo State. <br/>I have selected these sets of people because in hope that with their practical experience as unemployed people they will be able to offer more useful information required for this research.<br/>The streets are as follows: <br/>Uwelu Road <br/>1st Otawere Avenue <br/>Ojo Street <br/>Otete Road <br/>Immaculate Way <br/>2nd Otawere Avenue <br/>Oviasogie Street <br/>Iyamu Street  <br/>Uwasota Road     <br/>In each street, thirty (30) respondents will be picked and it should be noted that the sampling frame of this research work is one hundred and twenty respondents (120) which comprise the four streets. <br/>1.11    RESEARCH DESIGN <br/>However, in this research, the research method to adopt in this study is the survey method in order to justify the study. A survey is the type of study in which the researcher selects a sample of respondents on whom questionnaires are administered or the respondents are asked questions directly either in form of questionnaire or verbal interview. <br/>1.12    HYPOTHESIS <br/>Statistical hypotheses can be explained as assertion of two or more types of hypotheses, which are going to be used. <br/>Failure to acquire sufficient learning is a cause of youth unemployment <br/>Industrial recession is the cause of youth unemployment<br/><br/>\n\nCAUSE AND EFFECT OF YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CAUSE AND EFFECT OF YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT ", "id": 17}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE CHALLENGES CONFRONTING THE ELDERLY: CASE STUDY OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, EDO STATE<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/> INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1     Background of the study<br/>Individuals begin their ageing process at the moment of birth, and go through the life course accumulating a range of experiences that may positively or negatively affect their capabilities and wellbeing in later years (Aquilino, 1990).Population ageing is a global phenomenon with broader implication for demographic, socio-economic and health conditions of any nation advancements in the field of medicine have led to greater longevity and by implication, a substantial increase in the population of the elderly.<br/>It was revealed in (Wahab, 2013) that ageing is expensive and government in many developing nations is afraid of the costs of maintaining the increasing population of the elderly. Older people are a valuable asset to society, contributing in many ways (economically, socially, intellectually and otherwise,) to the progress of the society in their productive age. Unfortunately, in many societies older people have been left out at perpetual risk and uncared for. The aged is, therefore, deprived of smartness, promptness, dynamism, and confidence, which were the basic personality feature of youth and adulthood. <br/>Furthermore, the optimistic outlook of the aged gradually turns into pessimism. Extrinsic changes among the aged are the effects of disorganized social institutions, values and norms arising out of surrounding, social forces of urbanization, industrialization, modernization, and globalization (Ushasnee, 2004), Hence, the disorganized society, family, and personality produced deprivations to the aged in the contemporary society.  <br/>Even though the number and proportion of the aged is increasing globally, the rate of increase as well as the nature of institutional responses to their well-being differs from culture to culture.  As growing old comes with numerous challenges, some industrially developed countries tend to better prepare for it while some others, particularly Africa, are least prepared for this natural and universal process (Adeleke, 2014).<br/>Historically, before colonialism and subsequent governmental social policies dealing with the elderly were developed, services to the elderly were provided almost entirely by the family members (Annsuppes&amp; Wells, 2000). Traditionally in Sub-Saharan Africa, the main source of support was the household and family, supplemented in many cases by other informal mechanisms, such as kinship networks and mutual aid societies. This was possible in Nigeria since the society was homogeneous and with self sustaining system. Nigeria like other African countries became bettered by the forces of capitalism through colonialism in to money market economy, services and care of the elderly diminished (Zachariah, Phibine “&amp; David, 2013). These changes associated with development and modernization, combine to weaken traditional social values and networks that stress the important role of elderly people in the society and that reinforce traditions of intergenerational exchange and reciprocity. Earlier researches on the situation of the elderly revealed the overlapping pictures of failure to find an institutionalized social support for the elderly (Wahab, 2013).<br/>Often viewed and described as a dependent population, particularly in respect ofneeds (as longevity requires care and support as well as high cost of medical and health care), but the role of the elderly in nation building cannot be overemphasized (Adebowale, 2012). As the scholarsuccinctly put it, “they are the custodians of culture and tradition,  mediators during conflict resolution and contributions in enforcing peace in their various communities (Adebowale, 2012)’In traditional Nigeria societies, the family system and structure play a major role in the support for the older members. The extended family system strengthens the bond of relationships, giving every member a sense of belonging and advancing the interests. Thus, the task of care giving for the elderly lies primarily on the children, grandchildren, spouses, siblings, in-laws and other members of the family. This age-long tradition persists till the modern day Nigerian society but its effects had largely waned and eroded (Adeleke, 2014; Okoye, 2013; Oluwabamide and Egbafona, 2012).<br/> The influence of industrialization and urbanization on the family structure has been greatly striking and largely negative. The pressure to leave agricultural employment in rural areas for wage employment in the urban cities, increased personal roles and commitments, unemployment, economic crises, epidemics, widespread poverty, and numerous personal financial priorities and engagements are just a few of the factors that tend to impinge upon the bond of extended family relationships and the extent of care available from the primary care givers (Adeleke, 2014; Okoye 2013; Oluwabamide and Eghafona, 2012). This is compounded by the absence of government support and provision for the elderly as there is no specialized institution even the pension scheme designed to cater for the retired sector employees are often not beneficial tothem. This scenario creates a condition where the aged are neglected, left to fend for themselves and sometimes abused, having great implication on their physical and mental state.<br/>1.2     Statement of the problem<br/>Elderly people in Nigeria suffer a lot of economic and socialhardship in an increasingly hostile, competitive and intolerant society. Older people constitute one of the poorest groups in Nigerian society and aging in Nigeria constitutes a painful process attended by poor health, poverty and helplessness (Asagha, 2005). Older people rightly deserve the much needed care and support backed up by programme and policies that will enable them have control over their own live daily (Edward &amp; Miller 2003; Banks, 2004).The good news is that aging is swiftly becoming a worldwide phenomenon and undeniably urgently serious policy concern which needs adequate recognition by government of developed nation where it has reflected in the government vital document of economic and social development strategy (Okoye, 2014).<br/>In Nigeria, unlike in the developed countries, there exists no identifiable government intervention programmes dedicated to the welfare of the elderly persons despite their growing numbers. Though a mention could be made of the public pension scheme which places retired employees of government on life pensions, (Adeleke 2014) noted that this scheme is limited to less than 1 percent of the older population and that the whole scheme is marred by inefficiency, excessive bureaucracy and corruption, and sometimes portends danger to the beneficiaries as some became physically disabled or even give up the ghost in the process of assessing their pensions because of the tedious processes involved. Adebowale (2012) and Adeleke (2014) also noted that the majority of the elderly (including those who returned home after retirement) live in the rural areas where agriculture remains the major occupation and thus no opportunity to receive pension benefits from the government.<br/>Besides absence of government intervention, the extended family system which traditionally used to be the source of primary care giving in Nigeria  is greatly weakened and disintegrating. According toOluwabamide and Egbafona (2012), “today in African societies, the traditional institution responsible for care giving is being dismantled”. Pressure from urbanization, industrialization, modernization, poverty, high cost of living, dwindling appreciation of the role and usefulness of the older population, individuality, geographical mobility of youthful population and others are reasons given for the collapse in extended family structure and interdependence.<br/>The largest social protection programs for older people in Sub-Saharan African  are occupational pension schemes, but these typically cover only people who have worked in the public sector, in state enterprises, or in large private firms in the modern sector. The self-employed, workers in the informal sector, domestic workers, and the vast majority of the population living in rural areas and engaged in subsistence agriculture or other forms of subsistence living, majority of this group are excluded from formal social security schemes and must rely on their families for support and protection when they can no longer work (National Academic Press, 2006).<br/>Nigeria’s economy is the most viable in Africa. Unfortunately, Nigeria is currently one of the countries in Sub Sahara Africa with a large percentage of the aged without any form of social protection. However, the high rate of unemployment and the poor state of infrastructural facilities obstruct the activities of the elderly which within the existing condition expose them to more danger and untimely death. The elderly have contributed to the economy and the society at large and this is an important stage of their life that should never be ignored, yet there is no formal social security programme to cater for this large population of the aged. Caring for the elderly introduces many problems that are very similar in most developing countries including Nigeria. The conditions under which informal and formal supports are delivered to the elderly may have a major influence on the social, economic and security of the pattern of care for the elderly.<br/>This social exclusion has led to increase in challenges confronting this group as they are left to go through phases of life that hinder smooth aging and the elderly are faced with unwholesome challenges which include poverty, isolation, poor nutrition, poor quality health care, poor housing, hunger, inadequate domestic supports and other social services that will enhance smooth aging. These challenges call for adjustment., Adjusting to these and other changes is the central challenge in the social world of the elderly, as they may discover they can no longer cope on their own and have to rely on other people for care and support. Having to rely on caregivers for care and support introduces as new dimension to the social problems of the elderly (Akpan&amp;Umobong, 2013.<br/>The present imperative is that societies must respond to the extraordinary potential and range of variability in individual ageing, and seize the opportunity to rethink our notion of limits and recognize the far-reaching benefit societies stand to gain from the continuing contribution to the wellbeing of the elderly (John, 2000).<br/>The foregoing situations put the elderly in Nigeria in precarious physical and mental conditions and by implication, they face numerous challenges. Some of such challenges as enumerated by Oluwabamide and Egbafona (2012) include poor dietary provision, poor physical and mental health, poverty, isolation and loneliness, loss of respect, witchcraft  accusations, poor housing and poor living environments and susceptibility to epidemics. The foregoing conditions also hold sway for the elderly  inOvia Northeast Local Government Area<br/>1.3     Objectives of the study<br/> This study is designed in general terms to determine the challenges of the elderly in Ovia Northeast Local Government Area of Edo State. Based on the above. The study will focus on the following specific objectives:<br/>To ascertain the social, physical and mental conditions of the aged in Ovia North East Local Government Area.<br/>To investigate the challenges confronting the elderly in Ovia North East Local Government Area.<br/>To ascertain the form of social security available for the elderly in OviaNorth East Local Government Area.<br/>To suggest panacea to the challenges facing the aged in OviaNorth East Local Government Area.<br/>1.4     Research questions<br/> This study will address the following questions:<br/>What are the social, physical and mental conditions of the aged in Ovia North East Local Government Area?<br/>What are the challenges facing the elderly in Ovia North East Local Governement Area?<br/>What are the forms of social security supporting the elderly in Ovia North East Local Government Area?<br/>How can the aged be supported to live meaningfully in Ovia North East Local Government Area?<br/>1.5     Significance of the study <br/> The practice implication of this study and the findings can be used to inform policy makers and administrators to know the challenges confronting the elderly population in Nigeria and the need to respond through effective policy formulation and implementation. It would also contribute to the clarion call for policy intervention that will protect the elderly without any institutionalized social support and ameliorate the sufferings of the aged pensioners.<br/>This study will be of great significant to the extant body of knowledge of academia, practicing social workers in both public and private sector and it will build on the existing knowledge and fill the existing vacuum in data on the elderly in Ovia North east Local Government of Edo state.Moreso, this research will educate the society on the enormous challenges confronting the aging population without institutionalized social support and its manifestation among the aged pensioners in contemporary Nigeria.<br/><br/>1.6     Area of the study<br/> This study was conducted among the aged male and female in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State, Nigeria.Ovia North East Local Government Area is one of the Eighteen Local Government Areas in Edo State of Nigeria. The Local Government was created from the district council under the local government law in 1976.<br/>Ovia North East Local Government Area is one of the largest Local Government Area in Edo State with higher concentration of older people in Edo state which is the reason this Local Government Area was chosen for this study. It has an area of 2,301 km2 and a population of 153,849 according to the 2006 national population and housing census (NPC, 2006.

However, the concept that children have specific rights deserving of enforcement and protection is a comparatively modern development, Edokpolor, 2010. The popular assumption in time past was the best interest of the child at heart, there was no thus the necessity to think in terms of child right. The idealized perception of adult child relations ignored the grain realities on ground. But subsequent to the various reform movement of 19th century, concern for the perception of the dignity, equality and basic human rights consciousness children have since become a constituency in their own right in whose behalf laws have been enacted providing for protection against the abuse of parents, economic exploitation and social neglect, Ali, 2001.<br/>Children are individuals and are immature human but culture determines the different ways they should act and the things they are supposed to do, Francis, 2000. It is after all an axiom of international declaration that the child for the full and harmonious development of his personality, should grow up in a family environment in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding.<br/>In spite of the view about children, it has become an important concern for scholars and the general public in the existence of child abuse i.e were children are physically, emotionally, psychologically and socially demoralized, whereas they are meant to be protected and the norms, value that make up the society should be internalized enough to the independent responsibilities for the continuous upliftment of the society but rather they are used negatively at their own detriment.<br/>The issue as regards child abuse should be viewed as a social problem which should be critically being addressed and proper solutions projected. The interpretation of child abuse in recent context when the trafficking of child become the order of the day, individual in different part of the world most especially in Africa engaged in trafficking children especially from the rural areas, Glamour Girls, 20002.<br/>An article of the United Nations Convention on the right of children urges everybody to recognize the right of the child, protect it from physical abuse e.g. rape, child labour, hawking, street vending that can drain the child mentally or any form of inhumane treatment that can hazardous to child’s development especially the child’s education.<br/>Child abuse is any action or inaction towards children that will either cause them pain or harm (directly or indirectly) or deprive them of their rights, Herrenkohi, 2008.<br/>Simply put, any attempt to violate children’s right. Child abuse in Nigeria is increasingly an alarming rate and it seems no one cares. A child needs to have equal access and right over resources, development benefits and even rights to make certain decisions and suggest the way forward in our society. Many factors are responsible for the causes of child abuse in most countries of the world. Parents had the unrestricted authority to do a child whatever was deemed necessary. Usually the father made all disciplinary decision. According to Marzouki, 2002, children do not have the right to survival, the right to health, the right to be protected from all form of economic exploitation, the right to leisure, recreation and cultural activities, the right to special measure of protection in case of handicap, Marzouki, 2002.<br/>1.2    Statement of the Problem<br/>Child abuse is of a recent happening but rather it is an issue that is not limited to particular family, state, country but it cuts across different ethnic groups in the society, Hugbes, 2005 .<br/>The major problem faced by an abused child is that they are unable to fight back at the physical attack melted out on them and also to share their experience with a loved one. What also seems to be a great problem in child abuse is the mental, physical attacks, psychological, social which most time result to death of the child. It affects the child boldness and makes him or her feel inferior amongst is age group.<br/>What obtains today is probably due to poverty, parents in the rural areas hand over their children to urban dwellers who most often fail to put them through school rather than using them as unpaid servants or street hawkers. Some of the consequences of child abuse is that children who experience abuse and neglect are 59% more likely to be arrested as juveniles, 28% more likely to be arrested as an adult and 30% more likely to commit violent crime. Other consequences could be physical, health, shaken baby syndrome, impaired brain development (Centres for Diseases Control and Prevention, 2008).<br/>The situation Assessment and Analysis (SAA) undertaken by United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF, 2001), states that “millions of Nigerian children and women face special problems of disadvantages, discrimination, abuse and exploitation sometimes in appealing circumstances”. Many children and women is common in Nigerian homes and is culturally sanctioned due to culture or traditional constrains is highly stressed, quasi nuclear-urban families. Urban conditions and corresponding changes in the nature of the family and unemployment have also created conditions in which many children suffer maltreatment from negligence. Talking of the problems of exploitation that face so many Nigerian children, huge numbers of children are engaged in hazardous or exploitative forms of child labour. Many of these children particularly those coming from the rural, enter the urban labour market through the activities of child traffickers. Some children in particular girls as well as young women become victims of sexual exploitation at the worst of cases end up as debt bonded sex weapons in the hands of international prostitution racket. Children are invariably among the principal victims of bloody ethno-religious and other conflicts that befall communities across the country. The more general problem that Nigerian children face, particularly those living in the urban slum areas and growing up amidst dangers and corrosive influences of the society deeply scarred in moral decay include violent crime, vigilantism and drugs. As a result of such activities some children find themselves in conflict with the law as juvenile offenders (UNICEF, 2011).<br/>     Research Questions<br/> Is child abuse caused by poverty?<br/>Is child abuse caused by illiteracy?<br/>Is child abused caused by environment?<br/>What is the significant relationship between child abuse and child labour?<br/>1.4    Objectives of the Study<br/>1.    To ascertain if child abuse is caused by poverty.<br/>2      To find out if child abuse is caused by illiteracy <br/>3.      To determine if child abuse is influenced by environmental factors.<br/>4.     To determine the significant relationship between child abuse and child labour. <br/>1.5      Significance of the Study<br/>Child abuse is currently a worldwide issue that draws the attention of everyone.

The  US  Office  and  Violence  Against  <br/>Women  (OVM)  defines  domestic  violence  as  a  “pattern of  abusive  behaviour  in  any  relationship  that  is  used  by  one  partner  to  gain  or  maintain  power  and control  over  another  intimate  partner”.  The  definition  adds  that  domestic  violence  “can  happen  to anyone  regardless  of  race,  age,  sexual  orientation,  religion,  or  gender”,  and  can  take  many  forms, including  physical  abuse,  sexual  abuse,  emotional,  economic  and  psychological  abuse  (Office  of Violence Against Women, 2007).  <br/>Violence  against  women  is  a  technical  term  used  to  collectively  refer  to  violent  acts  that  are primarily  or  exclusively  committed  against  women.  Similar  to  a  hate  crime,  this  type  of  violence targets  a  specific  group  with  victim‟s  gender  as  primary  motive.  The  United  Nations  General Assembly  defines  violence  against  women  as  any  act  of  gender-based  violence  that  results  in,  or  is likely  to  result  in  physical,  sexual  or  mental  harm  or  suffering  to  women,  including  threats  of  such acts,  coercion  or  arbitrary  deprivation  of  liberty,  whether  occurring  in  public  or  in  private  life.  The 1993  Declaration  on  the  Elimination  of  Violence  Against  Women  noted  that  this  violence  could  be perpetrated by assailants of either gender, family members and even the „State‟ itself (United Nations, 2013).  Worldwide  governments  and  organizations  actively  work  to  combat  violence  against  women through a variety  of  programmes.  A UN resolution designated November 25 as International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. <br/>Domestic  violence  against  women  is  a  violation  of  women‟s  human rights beyond geographical,  cultural, religious, social,  and economic conditions. It is a common problem experienced by women all around the world to varying degrees and types.  As  an important public health  concern,  it has strong social, cultural, and psychological  basis,  and  has  devastating  physical,  emotional,  social,  and  financial effects.  Despite direct effects on women, it also affects women‟s children, families, and the society as a whole.  Domestic violence against women has received increased attention from academic, clinical, and research communities.  Studies  in  the  field  revealed high incidence  of  spousal  assault, and reported domestic  violent  acts  among  the  most frequently  committed  crimes  (Avis,  2012).  As  one  of  the  most  pressing  societal problems  today  (APA, 2002),  domestic violence against women represents a serious violation  of  women‟s  human  rights.  It is an important cause of injury, and a risk factor for many physical and psychological health problems among women (Watts &amp; Zimmerman, 2002). <br/>Researches  in  the  field  generally  labeled domestic  violence  against women as male violence against women,  family violence,  intimate partner violence, intimate partner abuse, domestic  abuse,  spousal  abuse, wife abuse, and the  like.  In many other studies, the term included violence against women and girls by intimate partners, including cohabiting partners, and by other family members (UNICEF, 2000).  Nevertheless,  at  the  international  and  national  levels,  the  most  commonly cited term was  “domestic violence against women” from   reputable organizations and numerous academicians(e.g., UNICEF, 2000; WHO, 2005; Turkish Republic, Prime Ministry, Directorate General on the Status of Women, 2009).  <br/>According to UNICEF, domestic violence is generally perpetrated by men who are, or who had been, in the positions of trust, intimacy and power for the women. International,  national,  and  regional  studies  revealed  that  domestic violence  is  a  global  women’s  human  rights  problem  that  is  prevalent  in  all  the societies across  regional,  ethnic,  racial,  and  class  groups.  Accordingto  WHO‟s  (2015)  comprehensive report on domestic violence,  in different regions of the world, the  range  of  lifetime  prevalence  of  physical  or  sexual  violence,  or  both,  by  an intimate partner was 15% to 71%, with estimates in most sites ranging from 30% to 60%. As for emotional abuse and controlling acts, across all countries, between 20% and  75%  of  women  experienced  one  or  more  of  these  acts,  most  within  the  past twelve months. <br/>Furthermore, according to the results of the most comprehensive national research on domestic  violence against women released  by Turkish Republic, Prime Ministry, Directorate  General  on  the  Status  of  Women  (2009), domestic  violence against women is  a  widespread problem  in Turkey , as well. While the prevalence of physical and/or sexual violence experienced by married women was 42% nationwide, it varied between 26%and 57% across the regions. Moreover, emotional violence reported by women was 44%.  The percentage was 69% when the acts of behaviors that control women’s daily activities were considered as emotional abuse. Reported  economic  violence  acts  like preventing  women  from  working  or causing women to quit the job were23%.  The research also revealed that domestic violence has direct and indirect negative effects on physical and/or mental health of women in Turkey.  Regardless of residence and background characteristics, women who had violence history reported negative physical and/or mental health problems two or three times more than women who had no violence history.  <br/>In  addition  to  these,  in  a  recent  regional  study  (Akar  et  al.,  2010) conducted in Ankara,  the capital city of Turkey,  77.9% of women reported that they were exposed to at least one of the types of  domestic violence during their lifetime. The  most  reported  type  of  violence  was  economic  violence  (i.e.,  60.4%).  The prevalence of controlling behaviors, emotional violence, physical, and sexual violence were reported as 59.6%, 39.7%, 29.9%, and 31.3%, respectively. Domestic violence against women is a complex problem.  There  is  no single  definite  factor  to  account  for  it (Harway&amp;O‟Neil,  2001;  UNICEF,  2000; APA,  2002).  Thus,  to  study  the  subject  with  its  multiple  factors  by  multivariate approaches is highly suggested (Koss et al., 2004; APA, 2006, cited in APA, 2002).  <br/>Several  researchers  referred  the  causes  of  domestic  violence  to  social,  cultural, relational,  biological,  and  psychological  factors,  and  their  interrelations  <br/>(Dutton, 2005;  Harway&amp;O‟Neil,  2001;  Walker,  2009;  APA,  2002;  Watts  &amp;  Zimmerman, 2002). According to UNICEF (2000), numerous complex and connected social and cultural factors lead women to be the victims.  Such factors include socioeconomic forces, the family institution where power relations are enforced, fear of and control over female sexuality, belief in the inherent superiority of males, and legislation and cultural sanctions that have traditionally denied women and children an independent legal and social status.  These factors are the manifestations of historically unequal power relations between men and women.  <br/>When the causes and risk factors of domestic violence against women are considered for Turkey, a similar frame is obtained.  As  discussed  above, domestic violence against women is a kind of gender-based violence, and it mainly occurs in a specific  context  of  patriarchy  where  controls of  women  are  tolerated  (Dobash&amp;Dobash, 1979;  Stacey, 1993;  Anderson, 1997; Walker, 1999). The social context of  families  in  Turkey  is  generally  gender  stereotyped  and  male  dominated  (Hortaçsu, 2007). Based on gender stereotypes and patriarchal values, husbands are expected to act  in  accordance  with  their  powerful  positions,  and  even  behave  violently  to maintain that (Hortaçsu, Kalaycıoğlu, &amp;Rittersberger-Tılıç, 2003). Cultural values in Turkey place the primary responsibility on women for keeping the family together. Hence, women are expected to endure, sacrifice, and suffer silently in order to keep their families together. From  a  similar standpoint, according to World Organization against Torture‟s Report on Violence against Women in Turkey, the unequal gender power relations created by discrimination in education, employment, and in political life  render women  vulnerable  to  violence,  both  in  domestic  and  the  community spheres in Turkey  (OMCT, 2003). <br/>In African societies, domestic violence is viewed as a private issue between spouses which does not call for legal intervention. Women continue to suffer in silence and even accept domestic violence in their marriages as part of their destiny (Curran and Bonthuys, 2004). This is rather unfortunate for such women to accept this cruelty as their destiny. On a daily basis in the Nigerian society, there is shocking news of domestic violence everywhere. If the news is not about the growing trend of “baby making factories” dotting the nooks and crannies of Nigeria, it may be about a husband killing the wife or wife killing the husband. Sometimes, it may be about a father violating his daughter by sexually abusing her. Nigerian women are beaten, raped and even murdered by members of their own family for a supposed transgression, which can range from not having meals ready on time to visiting family members without their husband‟s permission. Some women even experience acid attacks from their husbands or boyfriends which cause extreme pain or disfigurement, sometimes leading to the death of the victims (Africa Journal of Mission and ministry, 2016). <br/>Domestic violence affects all social groups in the society and can consist of physical, sexual, emotional, economic and psychological abuse (America Psychiatric Association et al, 2005). Although men can also be victims of domestic violence (Denis 2014), women and children suffer it most. The prevalent culture of silence and stigmatization of victims of domestic violence hinders public acknowledgment of the problem. There is an urgent need to challenge the social prejudices and the institutional structures of the Nigerian society in order to protect women, not just from danger, but also from ridicule, fear and isolation.  <br/>In the Nigeria scenario, a consultant psychiatrist, DrMaymunahKadiri, said about 25 percent of women in Nigeria has to go through the ordeal of domestic violence. The worst forms of them are battering, trafficking, rape and homicide. While domestic violence is a violation of fundamental human rights, which the Nigerian constitution is against, there are no stringent enforcements. According to the cable, only 2 percent of such crimes are reported.  <br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>  Most people assume domestic violence is a private, family matter and choose not to get involved. However, domestic violence impacts a community in surprising ways. Domestic violence tears the very fabric of a society by dismantling family unit and causing a ripple effect of repercussions that are felt for many years. One of most lasting consequences of domestic violence is the harm it does to family bonds. Children witnessing violence committed against their parent can find it difficult to trust adults in the future. It compromises their attachment to the person that should love and protect them, weakening the family unit. An estimated 3.3 million children are expose to violence against their mother or a female caretaker. These kids have high higher levels of anger, hostility, disobedience, and withdrawal. They have similar health issues as adults: anxiety, sleep disorders, mental health and behavior health issue. One can imagine the effect this has on the on school performance. <br/>Adult victims suffer from a host of long-term health problems like heart disease, chronic pain, stress disorders, and arthritis, increasing health care costs for everyone. The effects of domestic violence cut across a wide range of issues and some studies estimated the total annual cost in the U.S. exceeds $12 billion. This includes health care costs for the victim‟s body and mind for conditions such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and dissociation (Essen, 2009).  The effect of domestic violence doesn‟tstop at the front door. Too often, it spills into our community; into places that are supposed to be safe havens on their own. If a person is in an abusive relationship, we encourage him or her to strategically make others aware of their situation; particularly their children‟s school and their own workplace (Dutton &amp;Golant 2012).      <br/>  Going through the introduction of this work, it is observe that Women have been at the receiving end of violence in Nigeria. The Nigeria Watch database provided the opportunity to validate the extent to which these women have been victims of homicide and manslaughter, taking note that the word „women‟ is used generically for females. A number of factors are responsible for domestic violence against women: for example, domestic violence, rape, and sorcery, with domestic violence having the highest number of cases. However, the limitations to the study can permit only speculative deductions regarding geopolitical zones. The scope of this research will be limited to domestic violence in Benin City, Edo state. <br/>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>    The general objective of this study is to determine the effect of domestic violence on marital relationship. Other objectives include; <br/>To assess the knowledge and perception of violence against women in Benin City. <br/>To ascertain the causes of domestic violence <br/>To find out the effect of domestic violence on children academic performance. <br/>To contribute to existing literature on domestic violence. <br/>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>    There are numerous effect of domestic violence on the victim both physical and psychological, also on the children and as well as the society at large. More so, several questions come in view of the research study. <br/>What is the awareness of the prevalence of domestic violence among women in Benin City? <br/>What are the causative factors of domestic violence? <br/>What are the effects of domestic violence? <br/>Does domestic violence have effect on the children? <br/>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY      <br/>Domestic violence on marital relationship also known as intimate partner violence is a common problem in romantic relationships, with research suggesting that intimate partner violence between partners occurs in between one third and two thirds of young couples in dating, cohabiting, and newlywed relationship. Recent studies have established, moreover, that domestic violence is a strong prospective predictor of relationship dissolution (Zlotnick&amp; Johnson, 2010). <br/> In our society, many women are violently treated by their intimate partners, while they suffer in silence. In some cases, domestic violence leads to the death of these women. This should not be allowed to continue because women are crucial to the growth and development of any nation and the world at large. They are homemakers, custodians of social, cultural and fundamental valves of the society; and permanent change is often best achieved through them. Full community development is impossible without their understanding, cooperation and effective participation. Considering all these, women deserve better treatment but the opposite is usually the case. Domestic violence affects all social groups in the society and can consist of physical, sexual, emotional, economic and psychological abuse. The prevalent culture of silence and stigmatization of victims of domestic violence hinders public acknowledgment of the problem. <br/>Despite continuous clamour for women‟s empowerment and emancipation, and the increasing involvement of women in politics and the socio-economic sectors, there is no doubt that women are being victimized and violated all over the world, especially in developing countries. Domestic violence against women is an important women‟s human rights concern that has overwhelming impacts on victims, families, and the society. Hence, it is vital to improve the awareness of the problem. Understanding the problem, so that developing assessments, preventions, and interventions will be means to combat domestic violence.  <br/> It is on this premise that this  paper  discusses  the  meaning of  domestic  violence,  types  of  intimate  partner violence,  effects  of domestic violence on marital relationship as well as  their  children.  This  paper  also discusses  causes  and  management  of  domestic  violence  against  women.  In conclusion, recommendations were made to eradicate this menace from the society.  In Nigeria, however, there is little literature on domestic violence against women. The following research thus seeks to uncover the causes of the killing of women and provide a basis for more research in this field of study. <br/>1.6 DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Domestic: relating to activities normally associated to the home.  <br/>Violence: action which causes destruction, pain, or suffering. <br/>Domestic violence: this is violence or other abuse by one person against another in a domestic setting such as in marriage or cohabitation. <br/>Abuse: is the improper usage or treatment of an entity, often to unfairly or improper gain benefit. <br/>Marital Relationship: the relationship between wife and husband. <br/>Violation: breaking or dishonoring of law, or contravention of a duty or right. the act of violating someone or something <br/>Violence Against Women: this refer to violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against women and girls. <br/>Psychological Effect: of, pertaining to or affecting the mind especially as a function of awareness, feelings or motivation. <br/>Physical Effect: refers to therapeutic effect or adverse effect of medical treatment on the body. <br/>Stigmatization: the act of treating someone unfairly, regarding them as being bad or having something to be ashamed of. <br/>Sexual Abuse: this is undesired sexual behaviour by one person upon another.

It is generally associated with the condition under which people live. Poverty is a relative concept, a condition that can only be defined by comparing, circumstances of one group of people or an entire economy with that of others. The problem of defining poverty arises since the measures one uses to compare a people defend solely on some assumptions about “adequate standard of living” which some enjoy and some others do not enjoy. If one acknowledges that poverty is primarily a relative concept, what then can “absolute poverty” be? Word Development Report (WDR) says that it is a condition experienced by about 750 million people.<br/>   Absolute poverty describes a situation in which people barely exist, where the next meal may come from is a matter of life and death; as the cumulative effect of malnutrition and starvation give them the tragic distribution of having the highest mortality rate of any group in the world. It is believed that absolute poverty can be eradicated and that is the aim of poverty alleviation programme. The concept of poverty is a recurrently one, pertaining to pleasantly in Africa because it is linked closely with political, psychological, social as well as economic program, with great consequences for people all over the world.<br/>   The bitter reality of Nigeria situation is not just that the poverty level is getting out of hand but that out of every 10 Nigerians more than four live in poverty conditions of extreme poverty of less than #320 per capital per month which barely provide for a quarter of the nutritional requirements of healthy living. Nigeria Human poverty Index (HPI-1) at 40.5 ranks 54 out of 77 development countries for which the index is available. The HPI index measures the extent of deprivation, the proportion of people who are total left out of progress. Nigeria ranks 146 out of total 176 countries in its Human Development in terms of life expectancy, education and real income per capital.<br/>   Statistical data available indicate that by 1960 the poverty level in Nigeria affects about 15% of the population. It rose by 1980 to 28%. In 1985, the level of poverty was 46%. This dropped to 43% in 1992. the federal office of statistics in 1996 put the poverty level in Nigeria life expectancy at birth was 51 years, literacy rate was 44% and 70% of the population reside in the rural areas where the natural resources are located yet lack access to portable water, health care, facilities and electricity. The federal office of statistics states that poverty level in Nigeria varies from state to state in the country. This is because of the fact that economic and political mismanagement has become the order of the day. Political instability threatens the realization of national aspiration. External dependency has also created the international payment imbalances, huge debt and servicing obligation poor economic and political structures have impaired growth in education, transportation, electricity, health care, water supply, cultural communication, housing and social facilities.<br/>   Poverty persists despite the government attempt by past government to find lasting solution to the problems of national economy and to raise the standard of Nigerians. Now, it should be the focus of the present administration to decide on which programme to design for fishing poverty. The national poverty alleviation programme has been selected for this task.<br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>   Poverty eradication was first considered by the Babangida led administration (1985-1993). Then, it was known as the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) with the aim of creating employment opportunities for the citizens and also to increase the standard of living of Nigerians. However, the programme has taken a step ahead of what it was during the Babangida regime. On assumption of office in 1999, president Obasanjo change the name to Poverty Alleviation Programme (PAP). Secondly, he highlighted the aims and objectives of PAP to include the following:<br/>To raise the standard of living of Nigerians.<br/>To eradicate all forms of poverty within the Nigerian landscape.<br/>To make Nigerians feel served in this discharge of their civil right.<br/>   In contemporary terms, a giant Nation which lives within its means, such a nation is further described as one that has achieved industrial power, military strength, technological might, political and economic stability. Standard educational system, political liberty and a real opportunity for citizens to build a better life (Clinton, 1997).<br/>   An important implication of the acquisition of the status of a great Nation is the ability to reduce or eliminate poverty. Also inclusive in the elimination list are the following completely:<br/>Fear of retrenchment and premature retirement result in work inefficiency.<br/>Lack of incentives and motivation to the workers brings about loss of interest on the job.<br/>Political instability, Government in Africa is not often stable. Therefore, such a programmed economic situation will have no meaning in terms of high standard of living of Nigerians when it is being introduced newly.<br/>That NAPEP has encouraged the device of innovation ways by Nigerians.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>  Nigeria is a country rich in both human and material resources and yet the majority of the citizens wallow in abject poverty. The federal government had at different times tackle the issue of poverty yet poverty still rear its ugly head.<br/>   This research study is therefore an effort to know why these programmes have made an impact in solving the issue of poverty. Such programme is the National Poverty Alleviation Programme (PAP).<br/>   The definition of poverty and its Assessment are addressed by salop (1992). According to him, the definition of poverty focuses on the question of who is poor? Poverty assessment covers the issues why are people poor? And also what should the government and policy makers do about it? To identify the poor, a poverty line is drawn reflecting the income level and a community of people whose income fall bellow the minimum acceptable of everyday life. the next steps briefly illustrate this.<br/>   Depending on the availability of data in identifying the poor by age, sex and ethnic characteristics, where they live, how they fit into consumption and production activities of the economy. It summarizes the available social indicators for example infant mortality rate, literacy level, fertility and maternal mortality rates, etc and income indicators (Per Capital Income) etc.<br/>   To determine the forces that may explain why people are poor, Salop for instance suggested a careful critical enquiring of the constraints to poverty eradication on assessment of the country’s circumstances of ineffectiveness in economic management in promoting effective labour intensive growth and evaluation of government effort to develop the poor human resources as well as close analysis of the extent of cost effectiveness of the social safety net (Salop, 1992).<br/>   The constraints to this poverty alleviation programme are mainly:<br/>Poverty instability<br/>Improper allocation of resources<br/>Ineffectiveness on the part of workers, which result in the non-attainment of specified field goods.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>   For the purpose of this research to be achieved, the following reach question most be looked upon/at: <br/>To ascertain who is poor?<br/>To ascertain what should Government and policy maker do about the issue of poverty.<br/>Why are people poor?<br/>What constitutes poverty?<br/>Does poverty exist in Nigeria?<br/>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY    <br/>   The major purpose of this research study, is to investigate whether the poverty alleviation programme has achieved its full aim of making Nigeria the nerve center of not only west Africa and African countries but also the world at large especially the economic life of Nigerians.<br/>   Other specific objectives of this study include:<br/>To explain the relationship between low custom tariffs and poverty alleviation.<br/>To find out whether adequate attention is given to the agricultural sector and small and medium scale enterprises (SMES), alleviate poverty.<br/>To examine the correction between interest rate reduction and poverty reduction.<br/>To find out how the provision of primary health care can alleviate poverty.<br/>To investigate how the provision of employment and poverty alleviation.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>   This research work or study is meant to investigate the prospect and constraints of poverty alleviation in Nigeria with a particular reference to Estako West Local Government Area, of Edo State. This study will be of help to policy makers as well as cooperate bodies in the course of eradicating poverty in Nigeria. It is also important, that it appraise the present system methods of poverty alleviation in Nigeria.<br/>   Moreso, this research study is also intended to fill the gap in knowledge, as it was designed in such away as to show how the various programme put in place to eradicate poverty have either been effective or not. It amongst other things, furnish student as well as the general public with relevant information on the prospect and constraints of poverty alleviation programme in Nigeria.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>   The area that will be cover in this research study is the prospect and constraints of the reduction/alleviation of poverty in Nigeria. This will be done with a particular reference to Estako West Local Government Area, Edo State.

For example, epidemiological research has indicated that one in five women experience a depressive episode at some point in the lifespan (Bianchi, 2006), and additional research suggests that child-rearing may pose unique challenges to women’s mental health. More studies point towards career having the potential to affect the adjustment and functioning of all family members, particularly children. Indeed, children who are exposed to the nature of their mothers’ work are at increased risk for the development of a wide range of adjustment problems, including externalizing behaviours and internalizing symptoms (Bianchi, 2006). Given the high rate of maternal depressive due to their career as well as more general emotional distress in workplace, many children may thus be at risk for adjustment problems.<br/>Career and child training are the two most important aspects in working mothers’ lives and, contrary to the initial belief that they are distinct parts of life, these domains are closely related (Hawa, 2004). A significant amount of researchers have concluded that working mothers face career-child rearing conflict (Giele, 2008). <br/>Career-child rearing conflict is primarily caused by excessive work demands and predicts negative family outcomes in children, whereas family-work conflict is primarily determined by family demands and predicts negative work outcomes (Giele, 2008). Important to this study is how career affect child rearing practices among working mothers in Nigeria.<br/>In the United State the only legally sanctioned form of marriage is monogamy, that is a marriage between two partners usually a woman and a man. Polygamy is the concurrent marriage of the sex with two or more members of the opposite (Vander, 2003), the most prevalent form of polygamy which is the concurrent marriage of one man with two or more women. However, in Nigeria polygamy is more common. It is belief to be our traditional system of marriage for example in Benin custom; a man can marry as many wives as he can, even if he cannot take care of them. The women end up struggling for themselves and their children.<br/>This study focuses on the effect of working mothers and rearing of children in Benin City. This study significantly explores the problems of rearing children on working mother. In the context of career development, combination of parting the children and the husband and the overall effects on the job satisfaction and performance on the women.<br/>Statement of Problem <br/>Working as a mother and rearing children has been a very different combination to cope with as a carrier woman, parents values for their child rearing practice contributes to the ways they try to shape their children’s development. It has been proven over time through research and statistics shows that most children’s whose parents particularly working mothers, lack a degree of proper rearing and the needed care because they are left in the hands of strangers like the day-care centres, or relatives/friends or even neighbours.<br/>Most research work has directly or indirectly focus on role conflict in the home men do not experience same role conflicts as the women because the home role of the women still continues regardless of what she adds to the roles as paid workers most children suffers neglect of parental care, through sickness or abuse. Some of the abuse cases recorded in Benin Cityand other neglects that children goes through or suffers in the hands of those they are left with to cater for them has been attributed to lack of care from their parents because of working mothers who combine working with the duties and responsibility of child rearing. This study therefore seeks to examine the effects of working mothers and child rearing on the child and the society at large. <br/>Research Question <br/>The following research questions are stated as follows:<br/>What are the impart/effect of rearing children on career mothers?<br/>What are the challenges facing career women in the study area?<br/>What are theobstacles, militating against career women in the context of nurturing of children?<br/>What are the coping mechanism of career women who are nursing mother?<br/>1.4      Objectives of the Study<br/>The objectives of this study are as follows:<br/>to explore the effect of rearing of children on career mothers.<br/>to examine the challenges facing a working mother.<br/>to elucidate the factors against ameliorating the effect of rearing of children on working mother.<br/>to investigate the coping mechanisms of nursing mother who are career women.<br/>    Significance of Study <br/>This study is important and relevant in our present day society where most women have raising to the challenge of helping, assisting or mainly taken care of the home as the case may be. It is of much relevance to all meaningful Nigerians who of the opinion  thatwomen needs to be encourage, assisted and praised for their role in the family. <br/>This study seeks to open the eyes of many to some problems women or mother goes through that men/father don’t necessary go through.<br/>This study will further improve our knowledge on the rigour women have to go through when they combine work/job to rearing children or raising a home. It will aid the government and employers to labour on how to put measures in place to reduce the stress women undergo for combining job with raising family or rearing a child most especially in Oredo Local Government Area. This study will be useful to all who believes in the fight for women that there should be equality, it will also be relevant for gender studies. The contribution from this study will serve as an added information on the subject matter and give boost to already existing literatures, it will also aid policy makers to make laws that will add to the value of women in the society.<br/>This study also help to spot out some reasons women decides to work even when they are rearing children of the income of their husbands, their educational qualification etc.<br/>1.6    Scope of Study <br/>The scope of this study is limited to Oredo Local Government Areaperception of the effect of rearing of children among working mothers.<br/>This research shall be limited to working mothers  inOredo Local Government Area and other working mothers within the communities due to nearness sources of materials and also the accessibility to the sources of materials.<br/>1.7    Definition of Terms <br/>Working Mother: They are women who are gainfully employed in the daily pursuit of their livelihood.<br/>Non-Working Mother: Are mother in the

and face different barriers.  \r\nIn Nigeria, people with disabilities make up the country’s population \r\nstrength and as such, there is need to eliminate the discriminations and\r\n stigmatization on them by professional social worker and integrate them\r\n back to the society.<br/>    The physically challenged persons can be \r\ndefined as those certified by a specialist in any field of therapy as \r\nhaving one or more of the following disabilities:- blindness, partial \r\nblindness, emotional disorder, deafness, social maladjustment, mental \r\nretardation and amputation of part of the body as a result of illness or\r\n unexpected accident. The disable persons could also be seen as the \r\nhandicapped, include those who are not capable of carrying out certain \r\nfunctions or activities, which a normal person can perform as a result \r\nof certain impairment such as blindness, deafness and mental \r\nretardation.<br/>    However, the researcher agreed with the definition \r\nof the term ‘The Physically Challenged’, according to the United Nations\r\n General Assembly Resolution, 3447(30) of 9th December, 1985 “The term \r\ndisabled means any person unable to ensure by himself or herself wholly \r\nor partly the necessities of life, as a result of a deficiency, either \r\nhereditary or not, in his or her physical or mental capacities”.  The \r\nmedical model of disability sees the disabled person as the problem.  \r\nThe disables are to be adapted to fit into the world as it is and if \r\nthis is possible, then they are shut away in some specialized \r\ninstitution or isolated at home, where only most basic needs are met.  \r\n(Self-Direction Community Project 2000-2001 (1)).<br/>    The medical \r\nmodel views disabilities as a person’s problem caused by diseases, \r\ntrauma or other health condition which therefore requires sustained \r\nmedical care provided in the form of individual treatment by \r\nprofessionals.  The disability right movement, led by individual began \r\nin the 1970s.  The self-advocacy is often seen as largely responsible \r\nfor the shift toward independent living and accessibility.  The term \r\n“Independent Living” was taken from 1959 California Legislation that \r\nenabled people who had acquired a disability due to polio to leave \r\nhospital wards and move back into the Community with the help of cash \r\nbenefits for the purchase of personal assistance with the activities of \r\ndaily living, with its origins in the United State civil rights and \r\nconsumer movement of the late 1960s.<br/>    In 1976, the United Nations \r\nlaunched its International Year for Disabled Persons (1981), and later \r\nre-named the International Year of Disabled Persons.  The UN Decade of \r\nDisabled Persons (1983-1993)  featured a World Programme of Action \r\nConcerning Disabled Persons.  Bowe (1979) was the only person with a \r\ndisability representing country in the planning of IYDP – 1981.  Today, \r\nmany countries have named representatives who are themselves individuals\r\n with disabilities. (Answers.com Tm).<br/>    On December 13, 2006, the \r\nUnited Nations formally agreed on the convention on the rights of \r\npersons with disabilities, the first human rights treaty of the 21st \r\ncentury, to protect and enhance the rights and opportunities of the \r\nworld’s estimated 650 million disabled people.  Countries that sign up \r\nto the convention will be required to adopt National Law, so that \r\npersons with disabilities would for example, have equal rights to \r\neducation, employment, and cultural life, the right to own and inherit \r\nproperty; not be discriminated against in marriage, children and not be \r\nunwilling subjects in medical experiments.<br/>    With following efforts\r\n by United States and United Nation to improve the life of disables \r\nstated, the efficiency of a professional Social Worker to improve the \r\nstandard of living of Physically Challenged persons in our society must \r\ntakes its roles.<br/>    Social Workers have a key role in working with \r\npeople to help them build resilience, maintain hope and optimism and \r\ndevelop their strengths and abilities.  Social Workers meet people and \r\nmanage their situations of danger and uncertainly in their environment \r\nand change their negative behaviours.  Social Work, as approved \r\nrecognized body can advise and influence government and legislature in \r\nenacting laws that will be beneficiary to the disables in our society, \r\nsuch as equal educational opportunity, equal right of being employ in \r\nthe labour market, and position in government decision making and \r\nenforcement terms.<br/>    The Physically Challenged Persons can be \r\nhelped to overcome the notion of being seen as second hand citizen \r\nthrough counseling and enlightens campaign to the general public not to \r\ndiscriminate against the disables and that there is much abilities in \r\ndisable persons if they are received fully into the society as able \r\nindividuals.<br/>    The professional Social Workers could also persuade \r\nthe government in making provision benefits to disable persons, their \r\ndisability insurance as not be able to work due to their disability \r\nshould be inclusive.  Provision of Wheel Chair, Standing Frames, Text \r\nTelephones, Accessible Keyboards, Large Print, Braille and Speech \r\nrecognition Computer software.      Individuals with disabilities often \r\ndevelop personal or community adaptations, such as strategies to \r\nsuppress tics in public or sign language in deaf communities.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>In\r\n Nigeria, as elsewhere in many other cultures, the disabled is sometimes\r\n considered a visitation of the sins of the parents on the child.  \r\nCongenital disability in children is often viewed with unpleasant \r\ninsinuations.  As a result, many parents of disabled children prefer to \r\nconceal them.  For those who are grown up, families and relatives see \r\nthem as burden, thus early in life the disabled is faced with social \r\ndiscrimination and isolation.  Many prefer to treat them as social \r\noutcasts.  To many without the required level of understanding, the \r\ndisabled is incompetent, untouchable, incapable and irresponsible.<br/>It\r\n is against this background of discrimination to physically challenged \r\npersons, that the researcher decided to carryout research on physically \r\nchallenged persons.  The main purpose is to identify the causes of the \r\nproblems and make important recommendations as to improve their standard\r\n of living that would make them to become useful to themselves and the \r\nsociety.<br/>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>This study aims to achieve the following objectives:<br/>To show how the disable persons can be re-integrated into the society by social workers and other stakeholders.<br/>To enlighten the society on the need to show love and care to the victims of physical deformities.<br/>To reduce the stigmatization and discrimination against the physically challenged persons in Nigeria.<br/>To show the usefulness of physically challenged persons if they are integrated back to society.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>It\r\n would have been reasonable to have research study such as physically \r\ndeformed persons around every state and strategic places in Nigeria but \r\nowing to the study limitation, the scope of the study was streamlined to\r\n Egor Communities in Egor Local Government Area in Benin City. <br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>The\r\n study is important because it will portray the usefulness of the \r\nphysically challenged persons in Nigeria.  It will also help to \r\nenlighten the policy makers and stakeholder on the need to integrate the\r\n physically challenged persons into their plans and budget.  It will \r\nalso help in the improvement of knowledge.  The study is also useful \r\nbecause it will help the policy makers in policy formation.  So also as \r\nan avenue for further study.  It can also of relevance for good \r\nreadership for all person in the society.  <br/>LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY<br/>The\r\n main problem of this research is financial constraint suffered by the \r\nresearcher.  The cost of relevant books and other materials required for\r\n this research is on high increase.<br/>Transportation is another serious\r\n problem in the course of this research work.  There was high cost of \r\ntransportation because of the festive period hence the huge amount of \r\nmoney to run around for data collection in attempt to cover large city \r\nlike Benin became a problem.  Egor Community was then chosen as a case \r\nstudy.<br/>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>The physically \r\nchallenged persons are found all the world.  They are more and easily \r\nidentify in Nigeria, especially in states capitals where they roam the \r\nstreet begging for alms for survival.  Most of these disabled are locked\r\n up in a house as untouchable and irresponsible while some others are \r\ndriven out of the house as an outcast by their relations as a result of \r\nbeing seen as physically challenged persons.<br/>Most government and the \r\nsociety shows non-challant attitude or little contributions towards \r\nthese set of persons, they are abandoned to suffer without showing any \r\nfelling or concerned about them.  The International Year of Disabled \r\npeople which was launched in 1979 and that of Advisory Group on \r\nDisability set up by the Prince of Wales in 1985 in attempt to unit \r\nlocal health housing and social services authorities to work together to\r\n develop better services for disabled people yielded little improvement \r\non them.<br/>The physically challenged persons are parts of the society \r\nand they cannot be ruled out or been neglected.  Hence the government, \r\nnon-governmental organization, the humanitarian and the society should \r\nsee to the well being of these set of people.<br/>Egor Communities is \r\nlocated in Edo State and it is Administered directly by Egor Local \r\nGovernment Council which governmental parastatal that provides social \r\namenities for the physically challenged person in the community.  The \r\ncouncil is managed by the Chairman.  The council is funded by the \r\nFederal government and it also make do with internally generated funds \r\nlike tax etc, however, there is financial constrain to execute planned \r\nprojects in the agency.  There is lack of special required equipment to \r\ntrain the physically challenged in the agency.  There is inadequate \r\nstaff on ground and the inability to employed more staffs.<br/>Also, \r\nthere is problem of discriminations and victimizations against the \r\nphysically challenged persons as they are not treated and given equal \r\nopportunity like their fellow non-physically challenged persons by the \r\nsociety.  It could be said that these problems of discriminations and \r\nneglect against disabled persons call for urgent intervention by the \r\nprofessional Social Workers to address and enlighten the public the \r\nusefulness of the physically challenged ones.  And if such persons are \r\ncater for and integrated into the society, they would be useful to \r\nthemselves and contribute to the growth and development of the country. <br/>However,\r\n it can be said that the Social Work Department of Egor Local Government\r\n Council, Uselu had been able to put a smile on the faces of many \r\nphysically challenged persons that were formally rejected.  The Social \r\nWork Department trained and rehabilitated many physically challenged \r\npersons in Egor Community that are now living an independent life while \r\nsome are admitted to higher institution of learning.  The department had\r\n been able to lift the burden from many parents and society thereby \r\nmaking Nigeria as a country that cares for her less privileges once.<br/>In\r\n summary, the researcher suggest that the government should redirect and\r\n reposition its attitude towards and individual spirit filled \r\nphilanthropists and the professional Social Workers should see the need \r\nof removing the burden of discriminations and victimizations against the\r\n physically challenged persons and create good atmosphere for them to \r\nlive.<br/>Definition Of Terms:<br/>Physically Challenged:    Connection to the body resulting to handicapped in the body rather than the mind.<br/>Social Worker:    A person whose job involves giving help and advice to people who are in need of it.<br/>Integrating:    The act or process of mixing people who have previously been separated.<br/>Discrimination:  Practice of treating a particular group in society less fairly than others.<br/>Victimization:    Make to suffer unfairly.<br/>Isolation:    The state of being alone.<br/>Untouchable:    People that cannot be

The phrase itself originated in the United States, Canada and Europe to described the kinds of gender-based derogation and violence that occur in public places, notably, work places and educational institution. The emphasis was forms of gender-based violence that were not readily codified in criminal law (Phyllis, 1983) as such behaviour actually has damaging psychological and physical effects on the victims.   <br/>   The U.S Department of Education and Office for Civic Right (OCR) (1997). Charged withing, interpreting, and enforcing OCR quid lines on sexual harassment recognition two types, quid pro quo and hostile environment harassment. Quid pro quo harassment involves request of sexual favours generally by a school employee to a student in exchange for educational participation or benefit. Hostile environment entails harassing sexual conduct that is so severe, persistent or pervasive that it limits a student ability to participate on or benefit from educational activities. <br/>   In Nigeria, sexual harassment was noted in official document in 1981, in the report of cookey commission on salary and conditions of services of university staff, was concerned over allegations of female student failing their examination for reasons other than scholastic and felt that some machinery for addressing the problem should be put in place (Cookey Report, 1981). Since then nothing has been done to back-up the express concern. Women centered Notional Organization (WN) was one of the first to look up in the early 1980’s, also with no appreciation or progresses made. Again in 1989, the Minister of education then, circulated to act heads of educational institution to set up standing committees on sexual harassment. Victims, particularly student have been left to tackle the issues on individual basis. <br/>   Thus, it is only recently that attention is being paid to the problem. It appears to be pervasive particularly in the context of higher education. It is usually taken for granted and believed to be normal and not yet perceived as serious problem that should be tackled and urgently too.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>      It appears that sexual harassment in educational institution and workplaces can be understood and defined in many different ways making it even more complicated to prevent and address the issues. Its definitions is problematic, with no consensus as to what constitutes sexual harassment and violent culture, particularly in Nigeria were little National attention has been paid to the problem. Student are likely to be at a loss when a professor’s friendly concern starts to felt like a demand for sexual relationship that they do not want but are afraid to reject. <br/>   It is therefore through expedient to identify and define what constitutes sexual harassment and evolve the definition from among the targets of sexual harassment in educational institution. As real and vicarious victims of sexual harassment, and as a way of validating their definitions, it is necessary to determine their reaction to the harassing behaviours as define by them. As a real vicarious and potential target, they were likely to suggest solution to the problem.<br/>   The study therefore addresses the challenges of defining sexual harassment by requesting selected undergraduate to define and respond to a range of sexual harassment behaviour and violent culture among universities students, including their reaction to such and to proffer solution.   <br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>     For the purpose of this research to be achieved, the following reach questions will be look upon:<br/>What constitutes sexual harassment?<br/>Are female students more likely to face sexual harassment than male students?<br/>Do sexual harassment and violent culture affects the academic activities of student in the university.<br/>What is the perceived extent of sexual harassment and sexual relationship between female and male faculty members in the University of Benin under study?<br/>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>    The general objective of the study is to ascertain the sexual harassment and violent culture in Nigerian Universities, the study will investigate the following:<br/>Factual causes of sexual harassment<br/>Effect of sexual harassment among Universities undergraduate<br/>Reactions of Universities student about sexual harassment <br/>Relationship between Universities employee that effect violent culture among student’s<br/>Conduct of Universities undergraduate that influences sexual harassment and violent culture in the University settings  <br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>      This research work or study will be of a benefit to the following individuals and institution; student, Universities staff employee, policy makers, legislative bodies and the public.<br/>   The study will be of benefits to policy makers that will guide in solution making which would hold out to the menace that is steadily eating our educational system like a cancer. Particularly, interest would be paid to the sexual harassment and violent culture being practice in selected Universities.<br/>   Moreso, it will also be of benefits to legislative bodies/judiciary heads for them to know that there should be a rule and regulations that guides the core of the Universities and also the employee staff of the Universities not to be responsible for an anti-social behaviour that affect the academic activities of the Universities school student.<br/>   The general public will become aware of the irritation to sexual harassment and its effect in the academic performance and development among Nigerian Universities school students. <br/>Operationalization of Terms<br/>Sex : This refers to the act or practice of sexual intercourse between a male and a female.<br/>Harassment: it is commonly understood as behaviour intended to disturb or upset, and it is characteristically repetitive.<br/>Violence: This is an intentional, non-accidental act of omission, on the part of person’s or any other person’(s) interacting with student aimed at injuring or destroying the student.<br/>Culture: Which is referred to as the way or pattern of life of an individual or group of people in relationship to custom, tradition, belief system that is passing from one generation to another?<br/>University: Is an institution of higher education and research, which grants academic degree in variety of subject and provides both undergraduate education and post-graduate education.<br/>Sexual Harassment: This has been defined as any planned, intentional, recurring or unwelcome verbal comments, gesture, or physical contacts of sexual, which is intended to place the recipient or receiver in an uncomfortable, embarrassing and undesired situation.<br/>Violent Culture: Is an unpleasant way of behaviour that causes effect on people, country and individual, which is adapted from a generation to another, negatively.  <br/><br/> </p>\n\nSEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENT CULTURE AMONG STUDENTS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF BENIN, UGBOWO CAMPUS, BENIN CITY EDO STATE <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENT CULTURE AMONG STUDENTS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF BENIN, UGBOWO CAMPUS, BENIN CITY EDO STATE ", "id": 24}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>MARRIAGE INSTITUTION AND THE CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE: CASE STUDY THE NWANGELE PEOPLE<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>BACKGROUND TO STUDY</b><br/>Introduction<br/>    Marriage is a veritable rite of passage where by a man and woman come together from different families for the purpose of living together, procreation and to ensure the continuity of community life1. Marriage also serves a purpose of providing mutual interest and understanding of spouses. Human needs for affection are better served through marriage. Apart from ensuring Economic and Financial security, Marriage serves the purpose of regulating relationship between the sexes as it give rise to legally and socially approved sex partners and thus check indiscriminate sexual activities.<br/>    In western society, Marriage is regarded as the end product of heterosexual, dating, courtship and engagement. It is culturally limited to the nuclear family in the African setting2.  However Marriage is not between a woman and a man, but largely concern of the Kin’s both in its contraction and maintenance. In other words, marriage goes beyond the immediate partners involved in it, to the members of the whole family on both sides. However whether western or African in nature Marriage is regarded all over the world as an important phase of life worth celebrating. The truth of this assertion can be found in the popular belief that of the three crucial ceremonies that are celebrated namely, Naming ceremony, Marriage ceremony and Burial ceremony, the only accounts for one namely; Marriage. Little wonder therefore that the prospective husband and wife eagerly look forward to the day of their Marriage. Indeed it can hardly be over emphasized that in the timeless words of Tullius Cicero “the first bound of society is Marriagre”3. As stated earlier Marriage is a significant aspect of people’s culture worldwide. Many people often find it difficult to understand other people’s culture on account of its own seeming strangeness to their own.<br/>    The people of Nwangele in Imo state in the south eastern part of Nigeria holds the traditional value of Marriage to be sacred to their cultural value. Dr Iroegbu described the key elements of Igbo traditional marriage using prevalent in Mbano area of Imo state, which a number of principles underpins marriage institution one of them is that Marriage in Nwangele is not between one man and one woman, but rather it is between families and to a great extent between clans or villages. In the typically tradition the first step in marriage take the form of introduction between families involved. The Nwangele arrangement takes place in an event which is called “Igba Nkwu Nwanyi N’ala” it involves the payment of an amount agreed upon families which is known as bride-price and it is usually accompanied by other gift items such as Kolanuts, Palmwine, Tobacco, Local-gin etc. The presentation of these and the payment of bride price is followed by certain ceremonies after which the girl is usually accompanied by her relative and age groups to her new home taking along some household utensils which will enable her setup her own home.<br/>    Another principle is that Marriage is sacrosanct. Divorce or Separation is not rampant and in event of a Divorce which rarely happens among the Nwangele people, part of the bride-price is usually refunded by the bride’s family depending on the custom. In other words it is said that marriage among these people holds realistic and priceless value to them. However in extenuating circumstances (which include flagrant abuse and neglects acts, likely to cause illness, promiscuity etc) the Marriage maybe set aside in accordance with the values, rules and practices prevalent in the locality. A third principle of Igbo Marriage institution is that dating or any kind of relationship between the man and the girl before formally married is not encouraged. <br/>    This Study therefore examines the cultural significance of marriage among Nwangele people in Imo state4.<br/>Aim and Objectives of the Study<br/>    The aim of this study is to examine the culture of Nwangele people in regards to Marriage and its significance and its objectives include:<br/>To highlight the importance and benefits of Marriage institution among the people<br/>To examine the Cultural significance of Marriage among the people <br/>To examine the role Marriage plays in solidifying relationship that enriches the communities<br/>To examine the role Marriage plays, acting as an incubator for the raising of balanced socially functional children.<br/>To examine the process of how marriage is contracted among the Nwangele people.<br/>Significance of the Study<br/>    Marriageis anideal set for children to be raised in to functionality as a contribution to the community. Marriage is a journey through life which enhances and enriches the entire community. Marriage is a strong and important institution among the people of Nwangele, this is because it unites not only two individuals but two their families and communities. The relevance of the study is to investigate the cultural significance of Marriage. It provides additional knowledge in inter community relations in Nwangele. With a case study of Marriage institution it reveals various cultural marriage practices which have been playing tremendous roles in strengthening the relations of the communities in Nwangele<br/>Scope of the Study<br/>    The scope of the study is about the Nwangele people with a focus on Marriage institution and the cultural significance it has on Nwangele local government.<br/>Methodology<br/>    In the course of research, relevant data and information were obtained from the main sources. These were primary and secondary sources.<br/>Primary sources:source utilized in the course of the research were made from observation (which includes getting a firsthand view as to what marriage institution entails in Nwangele), telephone interviews face to face surveys etc, after gaining an insight into the research by reviewing the secondary source and previously collected data.<br/>Secondary sources:source which were consulted in some Universities and public libraries in the country which include textbooks, Journals, Articles, Write ups and newspaper reports etc. These sources helped to provide data for a critical analysis of marriage institution among the people of Nwangele local government area in Imo state. <br/>Literature Review<br/>    There is not much academic work on cultural significance of Marriage among the people of Nwangele; there is however certain literature that deals on relevant aspects of marriage institution among the Igbo people in general. Reviewing the works of other scholars an attempt to undertake a related task has been a common routine among researchers. Thus without the views of intellectual predecessors and mentors, no product is considered.<br/>    According to Elechi Amadi in his book, The Concubine6 he states “the importance of marriage relations guiding during negotiations of marriage between Ahurole and Wigwe. The book depicts what marriage relation brings to two communities involved in the contraction and he gives an idea as to their order of importance more especially the bride-price”. Also in his book “the Slave”7, Elechi Amadi portrays what “marriage activities means for the Erekwi youth, in girls were taught the secret of marriage during Mgbede as it ends with the finding of a worthy wife to be, the case of Wizo and Enna”. In Chinua Achebe’s “Things Fall Apart”8 marriage was seen to bring household lineages and even towns together. The Igbo believed that every adult male and female must marry and build their households, Children were valued highly and marriage was a requisite first step.<br/>    Marriage observed by Mbiti in his book, African Religion and Philosophy9 focused on existence, “Marriage is a duty a requirement for the corporate society and a rhythm of life in which anybody must participate”. Also F. K. Nukunya “Tradition and Change: an introduction to Sociology”10 states that “marriage is a basic institution in ever society. It is the recognized social institution not only for establishing and maintaining the family but also for creating and sustaining the ties of kinship. This statement centre on the importance of marriage among the Igbo tribes. In Chukwu’s “Traditional Igbo Marriage in Nigeria”11 novels even compare traditional marriage to drama “in every normal person is an actor or actress and nobody assumes the position of an audience”. Indeed the enthusiasm that often overwhelms the very being of a young one when it comes to marriage is always unparallel.<br/>    According to C. Mitchell in A New Dictionary of Sociology12 she defines “marriage as a socially sanctioned sex relationship involving two or more people of the opposite sex whose relationship is expected to endure beyond the time required for gestation and birth of Children”.   Utibe Ukos “marriage the Igbo way”13, explains “marriage has a foremost place in the Igbo social economy. It looks upon the horizon of any maid and youth as an indispensable obligation to be fulfilled with as little delay as possible after reaching the age of puberty”. A. Nwoye in his book “Marriage and Family counselling”14 defines Marriage as “a sacred and permanent contract which is enacted when two people (a man and woman) decide on their own accord and in the presence of their family or witnesses to exchange the formal consent to live a life promoting their mutual growth and welfare as persons in their journey together through life”. While commenting on the socio-cultural relations of the Igbos, Obaro Ikime in his book “Groundwork of Nigerian History”15 used marriage institution between communities. While on the other hand, J. C. Anene observed in “Afigbo’s Ropes of Sand”16 that even though artificial boundaries separated ethnics, social cultural factors continue to bring them together in form of inter-marriage. C. C. Ifemesia’s, Traditional Human Living among the Igbo’s: an historical perspective17, on his study of south Eastern Nigeria, he maintained that there was early inter-marriage between the Igbo and Bonny.<br/>    However in as much as there equally existing cultural uniformity, there equally cultural differences among the people of Nwangele regarding marriage institution.<br/>Chapterization    <br/>    This project is divided into five chapters:<br/>Chapter One: Background to the study<br/>Chapter Two: Geography and Traditions of the Nwangele people<br/>Chapter Three: Traditional marriage practices in Nwangele<br/>Chapter Four: Significance of marriage among Nwangele people<br/>Chapter Five: Conclusion<br/>Endnotes<br/>Ogbeide Victor, “wine carrying and bridal train: A portrayal of Traditional Igbo marriage in Elechi Amadi’s”.

Aging will continue because of the extension of life and the reduction of fertility (Troisi 2004). The  ageing  of  world’s  population  is  a  crucial  challenge  for  the  21st  century.  Population ageing affects individuals and nations and due  to  several  factors  which  include  decline  in  fertility,  improvement  in public  health,  increase  in  life  expectancy  and  changes  in pattern of care  among  the  family structures and the decline in community services. <br/>Aging is the accumulation of changes in a person over time. More so, aging is a multidimensional process of physical, psychological and social change. (Bowen and Atwood 2004). Some dimensions of aging grow and expand over time, while others decline. Research shows that even in  late  life,  potentials  exist  for  physical,  mental and  social  growth  and  development  (Papalia, Sterns, Feldman, and Camp, 2002).  According  to  the  Economic  and  Social  Commission for  Asia  and  the  Pacific, the  number  of  older  persons  (people  aged  60  and  over)  in Asia,  as  a  whole,  will more  than  double  from  322  million  in  2000  to  about  705  million  in  2025. Countries  like  Japan  and  Singapore  will  likely  have  the  oldest  population  by  2030.  Decline  in  fertility  was  brought  about  by  more  wide  spread  acceptability  of  family  planning  and changes  in  family  structure while  increase  in  life  expectancy  is  attributed  to  improved  medical care  on  support  of  the  elderly  was  brought  about  by  technological  advancement (ESCAP 2001).             <br/>According  to  a published  U.S  Bureau  Bulletin  of  the  Census  and  Database  on  Ageing  in  1988,  the  world’s  total population  is  growing  at  a  rate  of  1.7  percent  per  year.  The  population  aged  60  years  and  above is  increasing  by  2.2  percent  per  year;  and  the  number  of  persons  aged  65  years  and  over,  is rising  by  2.8  percent  annually.  The  bulletin  shows  further  that  every  month,  the  net  balance  of the  World’s  older  population  (60  years  and  over)  increases  by  1.2  million  persons.  It is expected that this demographic pattern will continue.  Troisi  (2004)  observed  that  already  one  out  of  every ten  persons  is  now  60  years  or  above.  By  2050,  one  out  of  five  will  be  60  years  or  older  and  by 2150,  one  out  of  three  persons  will  be  60  years  or  older  (Troisi  2004:354). <br/>Troisi also observed that  the  older  population  is  ageing,  that  is,  the  oldest  old  (80  years  or  older)  is  the  fastest growing  segment  –  constituting  11  percent  of  the  60  years  or  older  age  group,  is  projected  to grow  to  19  percent  by  2050.  The  number  of  centenarians  is  projected  to  increase  15fold  from approximately  145,000  in  1999  to  2.2  million  by  2050  (Troisi  2004:354).  Even  though population  of  the  elderly  is  increasing  in  all  countries  of  the  world,  up  till  the  early  80‟s,  the demographic  transition  was  mostly  viewed  as  a  phenomenon  of  the  developed  countries  (Sylvia, 2000;  Troisi,  2004).  But  in  fact  as  observed  in  the  literature  the  great  majority  (two-third)  of those  over  60  years  of  age  live  in  the  developing  world  and  that  the  proportion  is increasing steadily  and  will  reach  nearly  three-quarters  by  the  2030‟s  (UNFPA  and  CBGS,  1999  cited  by Sylvia,  2000:9). <br/>In  Nigeria,  the  proportion  of  the  aged  population  has  been  increasing. According to a research by (NPC)  before  Nigeria  gained independence  in  1960,  there  was  a  population  census  conducted  in  1952/53.  Since independence,  the  country  had  only  conducted  three  successful  population  censuses  in  1963, 1991  and  2006.  The  total  number  of  persons  aged  60  years  and  above  in  1952/53  was 2,448,000.  In 1963,  1991  and  2006  population  census  the  total  number  of  persons  aged  60  years and  above  was  3,617,000  and  8,227,782  and  19,580,204 respectively (NPC 2003).  This data shows that the population of the elderly has significantly increased and the  issue  of  changing  family  structure and  care  provision  for  the  elderly  is  one  of  such  values,  which  is  culturally  rooted  and  esteemed but face with challenges in modern time. In  many  traditional  African  societies the  family  is  charged  with the  responsibilities  for  the  provision  of  support  for  the  elderly and such  support is  provided  voluntarily  without  any  remuneration  (Kosberg,  1992;  Brown,  1999).  The population of the elderly in the world is increasing rapidly (United Nations, 2004) and the rate of increase is higher in developing countries including Nigeria. <br/> Currently, Nigeria has the highest number of the elderly people in Africa estimated to be about 5.6% of the Nigeria population (NPC, 2008). With this increase in the growth of the aging population, the number of people that will need health care will undoubtedly increase. (Donatelle 2011) posited that in most curricula  for  health  professionals,  little  or  nothing  is  indicated  about  the  care  of  the  elderly showing absolute neglect in this area (Mclafferly and Morrison 2004) stated also that most health workers  have  very  poor  knowledge  of  mental  health  conditions  which  are  common  with  the elderly  and  as  such  health  workers  come  to  service  with  deep  seated,  negative,  diluted  and superstitious belief about caring for the elderly.  This lack of adequate knowledge and negative attitude towards the care of the elderly may result in serious problems in our society in the near future. <br/>The nuclear institution formed  the  bulwark  of  informal  social  welfare support  to  elders  in  Africa  (Apt  and  Katila,  1994  in  Ghana;  Adamchak  1991,  in  Zimbabwe  and TogonuBickersteth,  1987a,  b  1988,  1989  in  Nigeria).   Unfortunately,  with  the  SubSaharan  African  societies  coming  under  various  cultural  influences and  high  death  tolls  of  the  youth  by  HIV/AIDS,  the  traditional  institution  that  supported  elderly care  is  highly  threatened.  The  extended  kinship  support  is  gradually  declining  under  the pressure  of  modernity.  Economic  woes  and  recession,  coupled  with  governments‟  insensitivity in  the  region,  also  compounded  the  problems  of  the  elderly  as  they  have  been  largely  neglected in  various  issues  that  affect  them. Most  African  countries  are inadequately  prepared  for  the  emerging  challenges  of  the  growing  elderly  population  (United Nations,  1994). The extended families institution has generally become less effective in the support of the care for the elderly.  To  make  things  worse  in  this  part  of  the  continent, concurrently  with  the  rising  proportion  of  the  elderly,  is  the  weakening  of  the  traditional  safety nets (Ojewale 2013). <br/>A major  challenge  in  the  face  of  rising  proportion  of  the  elderly population,  is the physiological and psychological care of the elderly, This  research  is  therefore an  attempt  to  understand the changing pattern of care for the  elderly  in  Nigeria. The family cannot  adequately  meet  the  needs  of  the  old  persons in Nigeria, and the diminishing  economic  power  has  hindered  the  willing  family  member’s  capability to provide care.  Priorities  are  given  to  the  needs  of  the  members  of  the  nuclear  family  –  spouse  and children  –  at  the  expense  of  older  family  members:  parents  or  grandparent, care provided by the family has gradually decreased.  But  with  changing  social  and  economic configurations,  older  persons  are  most  of  the  time  left  in  the  care  of  strangers  i.e.  people  who are  not  properly  trained  to  be  caregivers,  many  of  them  uneducated,  young  and  frustrated (Oyetunde and Ojewale 2013).<br/>This has led to the changing pattern of care and the social work intervention and services in modern society, this research work is to explore the social work intervention and the introduction of moonshine elder care Centre as a platform to bridge the gap of care for the elderly in Benin City, Edo State.<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>       The need for Geriatric institutions is more than ever more urgent now in Nigeria because of the increasing number of aged people. It was estimated that by 2015, there will be 64.6 million aged in the world; this figure was expected to rise to 103 million in 2030 and by 2050, we should have over 205 million aged people (Mudiare, 2013). With increasing numbers of older people, especially in Africa, unfortunately the increase  is  taking place in a situation where  the  society is least prepared for challenges that  older  people  are experiencing at present  as  the  demand  to  meet  their  needs grows.  The  range  of  problems  that  older  people  in  Africa  are  facing  is  constantly increasing as societies are locked up in conflicts, experience huge economic problems, natural  disasters,  diseases  and  deterioration  in  family  relationships.   <br/>In as much as these harrowing experiences, frustrating structural strains, the  elderly  are  faced  with  the  challenges  of  deteriorating  health  conditions,  poor nutrition, poor housing, poor hygiene, lack of healthcare, elder abuse, social security, isolation,  boredom,  and  dependence.  At varying international fora, much concern has been expressed about the elderly, with profound suggestions made towards improving their conditions.  These fora include  the  United  Nations‟  First  World Assembly  on  Ageing,  in  Vienna  in  1982  (United  Nations,  1982  cited  in  NPC,  2003); International  Conference  on  Population  and  Development,  1994,  and,  Madrid International Plan on Ageing, 2002 (NPC, 2003). <br/>Given the economic difficulties in families, unemployment, urbanization and poverty, it is increasing difficult for grown up children to manage their own families of procreation as well as their aged parents thus putting the elderly at risk of abuse and neglect whether or not they live alone. Researchers continue to come up with different findings about the changing patterns of the care for the elderly especially in developed economies. Can the findings of those studies be replicated in emerging economies like Nigeria? In Nigeria, little or no empirical studies have been done to establish the changing pattern of care for the elderly and the intervention (Mudiare, 2013).  <br/>1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>The broad objective of this study is to examine the changing patterns of the care for the elderly and social work intervention.  <br/> The specific objectives are: <br/>1. To examine the challenges encountered by the elderly in our society. <br/>2. To examine the level of professional intervention by social workers and its contribution to care for the elderly. <br/>3. To examine the role of social workers in elderly care centers.  <br/>4. To determine the importance of legislative enactment on policy for the Geriatric institutions.<br/>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>In line with the objectives of the study, the following research questions are raised: <br/>1. What are the problems encountered by the aged in the society? <br/>2. To what extent does moonshine elderly care center cater for the aged or elderly in our society? <br/>3. To what extent will government social security and social protection benefit the elderly? <br/>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>Having increased number of ageing population is an indicator of high survival rate occasioned by good health system and condition of living. At the family level, it is a pride in some communities in Nigeria to have their parents or relations ageing who are elders because of their roles in recounting past stories, customs, tradition and care for the children. On the other hand, they come to become liabilities to the families when they pose health problems requiring fund for treatment or constitute total economic burden on family and children. <br/>At the community or family level, elderly persons become liabilities when they are not contributing to the economy and much money has to be set aside for their health provision and other services. As a result of the poverty in the family level and government’s non provision for the ageing, a significant number engaged in alms and begging and other undignified practices to earn living.  Older people constitute a part of society’s structure which has a role to play and has some needs that must be met. However, if those needs are not met such as engaging  in  activities,  shelter,  food,  clothing,  financial,  isolation,  health,  sex,  safety, love,  affection,  belongingness,  respect,  welfare,  retirement,  etc.,  they  can  constitute  a problem to the society and thereby, affect other parts of the social structure. The most likely result is that, older people may depend on other parts of the structure for survival and create problems for the society, especially the family and the government. These practices were considered in the past as a taboo. <br/>    The study therefore scrutinize the role of extended family in the care if the aged living in the respondents‟ area with a view to knowing the level of care and support available for them. The findings of this study provided information on the level of awareness of elderly, the introduction of elder care institution and services. It further provided information for care and support, types of occupation engaged in their challenges and means of addressing them. In addition, it provided useful basis upon which further studies can be made. <br/>The  result  will  help  to  provide  basic  information  for  designing  structures  and programmes  for  the  care  of  the  elderly  in  the  community.  It will also provide evidence based information on graceful ageing. It will serve as a reference material to other researchers in the field of community health practice. Findings  of  the  study  will  help  in  showing  the  level  of  knowledge and  attitude  of  the care providers towards the care of the elderly and will help improve the decision making. The result will also help in building up knowledge base on the care of the elderly patients. Improving data base  on  elderly  health  nutrition  and  standard  of  living  which  will  help  for  further  research, advocacy, policy dialogue and programming. <br/>1.6 AREA OF STUDY<br/>Moonshine eldercare Centre facility, which is located in Benin City, Edo State Nigeria.

A questionnaire consist of  150 population that has close ended and open ended questions concerning some of the family planning practice was used as an instrument of data collection. In analyzing the data, the simple percentage (%) and chi-square (x2) method which is a measure of association or discrepancy existing between the observed and expected frequencies will be used.  On the basis of the findings it is therefore concluded that the increasing population in the country is brought about by the negligence of family planning methods due to religious belief or lack of awareness on availability of child control measures. The study indicates that there is a relationship between couples’ attitude and education to the use of family planning methods. However, finding demonstrates that there is positive relationship between couples’ attitude and age to the use of family planning. Also, finding indicate that there is a significance difference in couples attitude to the use of family planning methods of people base on differences on their religious belief.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    Background of the Study    -    -<br/>1.2    Statement of the Problem    -    -    <br/>1.3    Research Questions    -    -<br/>1.4    Objectives of the Study    -    -    -        <br/>1.5    Significance of the Study    -    -    -    -    -<br/>1.6    Definition of Terms/Concepts    -    -    -    -    -    </p><p>-CHAPTER TWO    <br/>LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>2.1    Review of Theoretical Literature    -    -    -    -    -<br/>2.2    Review of Empirical Literature    -    -        <br/>2.3    Review of Relevant Theories    -    -        <br/>2.4    Theoretical Framework    -    -    -    -    <br/>2.5    Hypothesis    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>METHODOLOGY<br/>3.1 Study Design    -    -    -        <br/>3.2 Scope of Study and Area of Study    -    -    -<br/>3.3 Sample Size and Sample Techniques    -    -    -    <br/>3.4 Instrument for Data Collection     -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>3.5 Method of Data Collection -    -    -    -    -    <br/>3.6 Method of Data Analyses    -    -    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.1    Socio–Demographic Characteristics of Respondents    -    -    -<br/>4.2    Major Research Issues    -    -    -    -        <br/>4.3    Cross Tabulation of Research Variables    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>SUMMARY, RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSION<br/>5.1    Summary of Findings    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>5.2    Conclusion    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>5.3    Implications of Findings for Social Work Practice in Nigeria    -<br/>5.4    Recommendation-    -    -    -    -    -    -        <br/>Reference    -    -    -    -    -<br/>Questionnaire    -    -    -    -    -    -    -        <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Background of the Study<br/>            Family planning is sometimes used as a synonym or euphemism for the use of birth control, however, it is most usually applied to a female-male couple who-wish to limit the number of children they have and /or to control the timing of pregnancy (also known as child spacing). According to (Okedare 2002), the issue of family planning all over the world has attracted attention due to its importance indecision making about population growth and development issues. In this wise, geographers have become increasingly alarmed by the precipitous rise in its effect on population growth, not only in Nigeria or the United State of America, but throughout the world. <br/>    The World Health Organization (WHO, 2012) defined family planning as the planning of when to have children and the use of birth control. It is achieved through the use of contraceptive methods and the treatment of involuntary infertility. Lawrence, (2006) on his own, sees family planning as a health service that helps couples decide whether to have children and if so when and how many. <br/>    Onokerhoraaye (2013) also defined family planning as the provision of birth prevention information service and appliances. It also involves teaching men and women about their bodies and teaching them how to prevent births usually with contraceptives but sometimes also with abortion or sterilization. Hatcher and Friedman (1997) opined that family planning is now seen as human right basic to human dignity. Their work further showed that family planning helps women protect themselves from unwanted pregnancies. Since the 1960, family planning programmes have helped women around the world avoid about 40 million unwanted pregnancies, as a result, many women’s lives have been saved from high risk pregnancy and unsafe abortions (Hatcher et al 1997:2, Huezo and Carigma, 1997). However most available works still points to emphasis being placed on the women folks at the detriment of their men counterpart (Olawepo 2003).<br/>    Expanding access to family planning has been a key aim of health and development programming for almost 50 years. Family planning is connected to all eight millennium development goals (MDGs). Family planning generates wealth and reduces hunger. (MDGs-1); prolongs education (MDGs2); empowers women and girls (MDGs-3) save infants (MDGs-4); improves maternal health (MDGs-5); prevents pediatric HIV (MDGs-6); reduces pressure on the environment (MDGs-7); and promotes global partnership (MDGs-8).<br/>    The (WHO) technical service (2012), states that though rarely articulated, family planning may involve consideration of the number of children a couple wish to have as well as age at which they wish to have them. These matters are obviously influenced by external factors such as; marital situations, career considerations, financial position, any disabilities that may affect their ability to have children and raise them besides many other considerations. If sexually active, family planning may involve the use of contraceptives. According to (Robey et al 1994) effective family planning grogram make the rapid spread of voluntary modern family planning methods possible in any country. Such programs help people achieve their personal reproduction goals.<br/>    Last collected in 2006 by the Nigeria National Bureau of statistics (NBS), the total population of citizens in Nigeria was around 166.2million people. Today, it is estimated to have about 180 million people. The United Nations (UN) projected that the overall population of Nigeria will reach about 440 million by the end of the year 2050. By 2100, if current figures continue, the population of Nigeria will be over 900 million. Morgan (2003) on the same issue indicated that in 2002, the total percentage of acceptors of contraceptives was 15% of both men and women of child bearing age. This goes a long way to show the fact that family planning services are not being used by a majority of Nigerian men and women of reproductive age.<br/>    The United Nations population fund (UNFPA) says that, “contraceptives prevent unintended pregnancies, reduce the number of abortion, and lower the incidence of death and disability related to complication of pregnancy and child birth”. (http://www.unfpa.org/familyplanning). UNFPA states that “if all women with an unmet need for contraceptives were able to use modern method that additional 24million abortions (14 million of which would be unsafe), 6 million miscarriage, 70,000 maternal deaths and 50,000 infant deaths would be prevented”.  (http://www.unfpa.org/familyplanning). In cases where couples may not want to have children just yet, family planning programs help a lot. Federal family planning programs reduced child bearing among poor women by as much as 25 percent, according to a University of Michigan study.<br/>    The World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank estimate that 3 person per year provide basic family planning and neonatal health care to women in developing countries. This would include contraception, prenatal, delivery and post natal care in addition to post-partum planning and the promotion of condoms to prevent sexually transmitted infections.<br/>Only about 30% of all women use birth control although over half of all African women would like to use birth control if it was available to them. (WHO, 2012) and (Cleland K et al 2011), the most available type of birth control is condom (Alex, Ezeh, and Tom, O. 2004).<br/>    Marriage can be wonderful as well as frustrating depending on the way you plan your marriage: this was the statement of Cecil Osborne (1978) a marriage counselor. This is when one control conception in order that or may produce the number of children which one desire to have at a space. People have little or no regard for family planning and this has resulted to needless large family size, thereby contributing to high increase in population growth.    However the rapid rate of modernization of family planning experienced in many countries has prevailed over traditional methods. These modern methods include the natural planning methods by which couples observe daily signs and symptoms of fertile and infertile phases of menstrual cycle to guide the timing of intercourse, according to their desire to avoid a pregnancy. Other methods includes; the condom, the intra-uterine device (I.U.D) coil, the pill, contraceptive, injections, forming tablets, diaphragms and cervical caps and vasectomy.<br/>1.2 Statement of the Problem <br/>    The introduction of family planning is in the words of Aristotle, the ancient philosopher who explains that civilization would better be achieved by preserving a stationary population in the city state of Greece. He argued for laws that would limit the number of children any family would have. Other philosophers went further to argue for just a child per family.<br/>    Children are gift from God, so controlling birth rate is wrong among the Edo speaking people when a child is named “Omosefe” it indicated that a child is more precious than riches, the equivalent in Ibo is “Nwakaego” and Yoruba equivalent “OmoboriOwo” these are some of the few reason why our fore fathers married many wives. At present some of our fathers still operate on extended family system and the gift from God, so it should not be controlled by man except God.<br/>    Also, children helps in the domestic work and also assist in farm and so the number of children one has will determine how wealthy one is in the society especially the sex differentiation whereby they want their wives to have a lot of male children, so the problem of controlling or spacing birth rate is difficult. The most crucial question now is: Are the people of lkpobaokha Local Government Area of the Edo State fully aware of the usefulness of modern method? This is due to the fact that  attitude of these people might influence the attitudes of these women depending on their level of awareness.<br/>Also, with Africa traditional system i.e. the customs and tradition might influence the attitude of these women towards family planning because in Benin tradition system, it is the man that is the head of the house and his decisions are final. Also if the man is a traditional man either a chief or he believes in his tradition, then having many wives and producing many children is his main objective.<br/>    Environmental influence might influence the attitude because the development of family planning is new in rural area compare to urban centres. The educational background of a couple will determine the attitude of these women because an educated couple would not want to produce a lot of children because they will not have time for them and also a working class woman would want to operate on the methods of family planning. But an illiterate person would have the best time in the world to take care of her child and so the tendency of producing more children is high and they might not know the importance of family planning.<br/>1.3 Research Question<br/>This research tries to find solutions to the following questions.<br/>Are the women in lkpobaokha local government in Edo State aware of family planning methods?<br/>What are the factors influencing the attitude of women towards birth control?<br/>In what ways have the media help families to adopt family planning programmes?<br/>How often does a couple visit family planning counseling centres?<br/>1.4 Objectives of the Study<br/>The general objective of this study is to examine the factors that influence the attitude of women towards family planning in lkpobaokha Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>To examine how well exposed married couples are to the knowledge and practice of modern techniques of family planning.<br/>To find out the factors that influences the attitude of couples toward family planning.<br/>To investigate the ways the media have help families to adopt family planning.<br/>To determine how often couples visit family planning counseling centre.<br/>1.5 Significance of the Study <br/>    The importance of family planning to the individual, family and the society at large cannot be over emphasized as it tends to curb the problems associated with population explosion, economic well-being and psychological development.<br/>    Findings in this study will therefore throw more light on the attitude of women towards the use of family planning methods. It will also help to find out whether the men and women especially in lkpobaokha Local Government Area are adequately aware of modern family planning methods.<br/>    The study will also depict whether couples actually practice family planning methods. If they do, to what extent they are involved. If not, their reasons for not being involved. This study will therefore enable us to identify the ways in which factors such as religion, culture, education and socio-economic factors affect the attitude of womem towards family planning methods.<br/>    Finally, this study will contribute to the existing body of knowledge on the need to encourage a positive attitude towards family planning in our society, particularly in lkpobaokha local government area of Edo State.<br/>1.6 Definition of Basic Concepts/Terms<br/>Family Planning: this can be defined as the practice of controlling the number of children in family and the intervals between their births particularly by means of artificial contraceptives or voluntary sterilization.<br/>Marriage: According to MerrianWebstar, marriage is the relationship that exist between a husband and a wife a similar relationship between people of the same sex marriage also called matrimony or wedlock is a socially or ritually recognized union or legal contract between spouses that establishes rights and obligations between them, between them and their children and between them and their in laws.<br/>Fertility: Is the natural capability to produce offspring<br/>Conception: The process of becoming pregnant involving fertilization<br/>Abstinence: Is a self-enforced restraint from indulging in bodily activities that are widely experienced as giving pleasure.<br/>Abortion: The deliberate termination of a human pregnancy most often performed during the first 28 weeks of pregnancy<br/>Contraceptives: A device or drug serving to prevent pregnancy.<br/> <br/><br/></p>  \n\nATTITUDE OF WOMEN TOWARDS FAMILY PLANNING: A CASE STUDY  OF IKPOBA OKHA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ATTITUDE OF WOMEN TOWARDS FAMILY PLANNING: A CASE STUDY  OF IKPOBA OKHA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE", "id": 27}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN ASSESSMENT OF YOUTH PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT: A CASE STUDY OF ESTAKO EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This study was designed to access youth participation in community development activities in Estako east local government area of Edo state.

Youth participation in community development project has been as old as human existence on earth. Their contribution towards community development in a given area like EtsakoEast local government area of Edo state  has much to be desired because it is generally accepted in most developing countries like Nigeria that government alone cannot develop all the rural communities as at when due.<br/>     One major issue that has continuedto occur on the agenda for rapid and genuine development in Nigeria in recent times is how to secure the participation of youth in the development process. This is because of the belief by people that no genuine or viable and self-sustaining development can ever be achieved without the involvement of the people. Nowadays, the approach to development which ignores the needs, aspiration, rights and inputs of the local people is not only old fashioned but is also increasingly becoming unacceptable.<br/>     In most part of the world, the challenge of rural development is being accepted as something that is worldwide. This is because most dwellers of rural areas for too long have been disadvantaged in terms of life and basic necessities and the desire to develop rural areas has been a major concern of the developing nation in the national development plans of these countries. Nigeria is not left out in this laudable task, hence the issue has been vigorouslypursued  in the country since the attainment of political independence in 1960.<br/>    Youth participation occur in community development when the change agents and members of the community share the formulation and execution of proposals or plans and programmes designed to bring about improvement in the living standards of the people and that of the community (Paul 97:8). In other words, participation stipulates that the local people should take part in the planning, utilization and assessment of the social amenities of their facilities designed for the improvement of their welfare. It is such participation that gives the people the pride of ownership of the facilities completed in the process of community development.<br/>    Idachaba&amp; William (1986) noted that various measures has been taken, since 1960 which wheresupposed to increase the production in Nigeria and their measure has the aim of developing our rural economy. In spite of the various actions taken so far, Nigeria rural communities are yet to be developed and the living condition in our rural areas were mainly that of poverty, ignorance disease, filth and constant threat of life.<br/>    In the rural area of Nigeria, inadequate health facilities and bad sanitary condition and practices obtained communicable disease and child malnutrition are prevalent despite the fact that in some area people live in the midst of plenty, rural diet is largely unbalance which Etsako east local government area is notleft out. As a result, some youth  have taken up the challenge of developing those areas by embarking on self-help project in their villages and under their community heads.<br/>    More so, the concept emphasizes the initiative of the people as a means of stimulating the active participation of all youths. community development participation creates faith in common understanding. It enhances the possibility of success by which beneficiaries of development project influence the direction and execution of such project rather than merely receiving a share of project benefit <br/>     Consequently, it is crucial to ensure in the course of designing development programmes, the active involvement and contributions of the entire people who should be educated to share in the responsibility along with the benefit of development are from the area. Youth participation can be in two forms: voluntary and involuntary. It is voluntary when such participation is readily provided without any attempt to stimulate. Participation is involuntary when it is stimulated by the development agent or change agent or other specialists for that matter. Community participation can be achieved through setting up of youth advisory group conducting opinion survey; and organizing members into civil and cultural organization.<br/>     Participationhas the advantage  of increasing project efficiency, promoting projects effectiveness, helping to build the capacity of beneficiaries as well as enhancing the empowering the members of the community. It can also promote confidence building and create a sense of belonging in the people. This is sometimes referred to as people’s participation (pp). “this element emphasizes the involvement of the community members In the activities that are designed toenhance the development of their community. This is a very important factor in the process of community development.<br/>     Before now, Nigeria argues,Idiode (1989) has adopted the superstructure approach of the technological society in seeking to bring about development. Such an approach/practice is based on the belief that a country can become quickly modernized and the benefits will trickle down to the community.<br/>1.2 Statement of the Problem<br/>The development of rural community has been one of the primary objectives of  Nigeria since the attainment of independence in (1960). From then till the close of the seventies (1960-1980), agriculture and the provision of rural infrastructures featured prominently in the national economic development effort of the government.<br/>     However, in Nigeria over 69 percent of its population dwells in rural areas for more than a quarter of century after independence (Olutundsun, 1975). The lot of the over seventy million Nigeria who dwell in the rural areas of the country has hardly improved in acute of the country with enormous resources, a greater percentage of the people of Etsako are still saddled with the problems of acute lack of basic amenities like good drinking water, electricity, motorable roads, communication facilities, better education, health institution, poverty and subsistence modes of agriculture. Most of the rural dwellers live in  deprived and disadvantaged conditions with particular regards to the various social and economic endeavors. This nature of Nigeria rural development problems appears to attract wide spread agreement.<br/>1.3 Research Question<br/>1.    What is the level of youth participation in community development programmes in the area?<br/>2.    What are the forces influencing the level of youth participation in community development programmes in the area?<br/>3.    What percentage of the youth have positive attitude towards community development programmes in the area?<br/>4.     What percentage of the youth is adequately mobilized to participate in community development programmes in the area?<br/>5.     Are there resources for mobilizing the youth for participation in community development programmes in the area?<br/>1.4Objectives of Study<br/>This study seeks to achieve the following objective/purpose:<br/>1.    To ascertain the level of youths participation in community development programmes in the area<br/>2.    To determine the forces influencing the level of youth participation in community development programmes in the area<br/>3.     To ascertain the attitude of the youth towards community development programmes in the area.<br/>4.     To find out if the youths are involved in planning of community development programmes in the area.<br/>5.     To find out if the resource for mobilizing the youths for participation in community development programmes in the area are adequate<br/>6.    To find out if the youths are adequately mobilized for participation in community development programmesin the area.<br/>1.5Significance of the Study<br/>This study is significant in many ways. The findings will provide an opportunity to know the extent to which Youth participate in community development has improved the living standard of the people in the community. It will create social consciousness Inthe Youth by being able toidentify their needs and felt-needs and finding possible solution in community development. The findings will also help other researchers who will like to carryout research on this area. The general public will be able to benefit from the findings by using the good roads, pipe borne water, etc, initiated by the youths, beside, the data gathered will help the government to provide facilities for more youths and also help to facilitate the youths participation in community development programs. <br/>    Finally it is hoped that through the findings of this study, community development divisions in wards headquarters in EstakoEast Local Government Area would be encouraged to put more effort to mobilize Youthsto take active part in rural and community development programmes.<br/>1.6Limitation of the Study<br/>This study in the cause of investigation was faced with a number of limitations one of the most patent limitations was caused by human attitude towards research. Many people consider research as an exercise meant to expose the weakness of the programme and also a proves of finding out one’s secret.<br/>     Due to this, many of the respondents in some communities failed to give or provide the correct information needed by the questions raised for fear of being exposed. It was for this reason that the researcher has to assure the respondents of confidentiality of information supplied.<br/>     Time frame was another limiting factor. A study of this nature would normally require enough time to enable the researcher visit every communities in the local government area under study to sources for vital information relating to the focus to the study.<br/>     Another limiting factor to this study rises from difficulty involved in obtaining references materials and getting vital information from the local government. The bureaucracy of the authority makes this difficult task.<br/>     Finally, the study was also limited by the difficulty associated with collecting information from individuals, who are not politicians.<br/>1.7 Definition of Terms <br/>A number of terms were used in the course of preparing this study. For the purpose of clarity and avoidance of ambiguity, the following terms are explained in the sense in which they are used in the study.<br/>Youth participation:Youth participation is used in this study to mean the involvement of the young people in the entire development project/programe in order to bring about a positive change<br/>Rural development:This refers to the restructuring of the economy in order to satisfy the material needs and aspiration of the rural masses, and to promote individuals and collective  incentives to participate in the process of development. It is also aimed at bringing about improvement in the living standard of the rural masses with a view to   encourage and stimulating the people to participate in the transformation of their rural area.<br/>Community: This may be regarded as a collection of the people who occupy a geographical area, people who are engaged in economic and political activities and who essentially constitute a self governing social unit with some common values and experiencing feelings of belonging to one another<br/>Development: This is referred to as a form of change from a poor condition to a better one. It is also a type of social change in which new ideas are introduced into a social system to enhance living condition of the people.<br/>Self help: This implies the improvement of the people through their own efforts largely for their own benefit without any external assistance.<br/>Community development: This refers to the restructuring of the economy modern to satisfy the material needs and aspirations of the rural masses and to promote individual and collective incentives to participate in the process of development.<br/> Youth: This could  be defined as young people who are not yet fully accepted as adults. They are usually called youth because they are young, strong, dynamic and very active in the society and fall between the age of 18 to 45 years.<br/><br/>\n\nAN ASSESSMENT OF YOUTH PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT: A CASE STUDY OF ESTAKO EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE. <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ASSESSMENT OF YOUTH PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT: A CASE STUDY OF ESTAKO EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE.

According to Merriam Webster dictionary, courtship is the activities that occur when people are developing a romantic relationship that could lead to marriage or the period of time when such activities occur.</p> <p>Premarital sex is sexual activity practiced by people who are unmarried. Historically, premarital sex was considered a moral issue which was taboo in many cultures and considered a sin by a number of religions, but since about the 1960s, it has become more widely accepted, especially in Western countries.</p> <p>Several studies have been carried out on the perception of students on courtship considering its effect on pre-marital sex (Bogle, 2008). These studies indicate that young men and women are more frequently engaging in casual sex or what is known as ‘campus courtship’ or ‘hooking up’ than the traditional courtship where lovers are not to engage in pre-marital sex. Hooking up carries a level of ambiguity but has been generally defined as a sexual encounter, anything from kissing to having sex, especially between young men and women without implying any marital commitment.</p> <p>The large percentage of divorces each year, non-marital pregnancies and pre-marital sex has all dramatically changed the traditional family structure. Courtship which was a trend that has been present for decades in Nigeria became popular as a result of western education. Courtship among undergraduates has changed the realm of male and female interaction as it used to be in the traditional African society. Prior to the colonial era, men had to call upon women and be invited to visit the woman’s home under strict supervision from the family. This type of courtship was a form of traditional courtship that had very clearly delineated guidelines that, men and women were expected to follow. However, western education has totally redefined the perception of young men and women about courtship and sex before married. The university environment provides the opportunity for young individuals to go out to places away from the watchful eyes of the family and community members and engage in another kind of campus courtship popularly known as ‘hooking up’ (Hettlinger, 2007).</p> <p>Several factors such as the mass media, the social media, internet, peers, changing family traditions, money, the university environment, among others has influenced how young men and women think and participate in courtship alongside modern social changes. The influence of this perception on courtship has influenced undergraduates’ sexual behavior, particularly in the areas of courtship and its relationship with premarital sex.</p> <p><b>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</b></p> <p><b></b></p><b></b> <p>Literature regarding the undergraduates’ perception on courtship and its influence on pre-marital sex is limited.

The impact of drug abuse among adolescents has been a stigma of moral decadence, violence, thugery, assault, madness and murder. The menace of drug abuse has eaten deep into the fabrics of our society; however, with effective counselling programmes, the problems can be tackled through campaign against drug abuse by government and other relevant authorities Drug control counselling centres should be established in every community and qualified health counsellors should be employed in helping drug addicts by giving them special advice on how to go about the withdrawal system. Drug awareness units to be set up in all states by the federal, state and</p> <p>local government not to try people who use drugs as criminals, but to help solve their socio-psychological problem.

The use of drugs in itself does not constitute any danger, because drugs correctly administered have been a blessing. Falco (1988) as cited by Sambo (2008) viewed that “chronic use of substances can cause serious, sometimes irreversible damage to adolescent’s physical and psychological development. The use of drugs could be beneficial or harmful depending on the mode of use.</p> <p>A drug refers to a substance that could bring about a change in the biological function through its chemical actions (Okoye, 2001). It is also considered as a substance that modifies perceptions, cognition, mood, behaviour and general body functions (Balogun, 2006). They could thus, be considered as chemical modifiers of the living tissues that could bring about physiological and behavioural changes (Nnachi, 2007). Drug abuse is a major public health problem all over the world (UNODC) (2005). The use and abuse of drugs by adolescents have become one of the most disturbing health related</p> <p>phenomena in Nigeria and other parts of the world (NDLEA; 1997).Several school going adolescents experience mental health programme, either temporarily or for a long period of time. Some become insane, maladjusted to school situations and eventually drop out of school.</p> <p>According to Fawa (2003), “Drug is defined as any substance, which is used for treatment or prevention of a disease in man and animals. Drug alters the body functions either positively or otherwise depending on the body composition of the user, the type of drug used, the amount used and whether used singly or with other drugs at the same time”.</p> <p>NAFDAC (2000) as cited by Haladu(2003) explained the term drug abuse as excessive and persistent self-administration of a drug without regard to the medically or culturally accepted patterns. It could also be viewed as the use of a drug to the extent that it interferes with the health and social function of an individual. World Book Encyclopedia (2004) defined drug abuse as the</p> <p>non-medical use of a drug that interferes with a healthy and productive life Manbe (2008) defined drug abuse as the excessive, maladaptive or addictive use of drugs for non-medical purpose.</p> <p>Abdulahi (2009) viewed drug abuse as the use of drugs to the extent that interferes with the health and social function of an individual. In essence, drug abuse may be defined as the arbitrary overdependence or mis-use of one particular drug with or without a prior medical diagnosis from qualified health practitioners. It can also be viewed as the unlawful overdose in the use of drug(s). Odejide (2000) warned that drug abusers who exhibit symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, behaviour changes, fatigue and loss or increase in appetite should be treated by medical experts and counsellors to save them from deadly diseases.</p> <p>        Amunonye (2001) defines drug as a substance which by its chemical nature has an effect upon the body or the higher nervous system (the mind). Therefore, many substances not usually thought of as drugs covered by this definition include caffine, nicotine, alcohol, household chemicals and pollutants. It is important to note that drug abuse is not contained simply to the abuse of dangerous drugs like narcotics-opium, heroine etc but also the abuse of panadol, codeine, antibiotics, laxatives etc in other words every substance apart from food is a drug and must therefore be regarded as being detrimental to health if not taken under proper medical advice or used correctly accordingly to medical prescription.</p> <p>        According Ebie and Pela (2000) opined that the Nigerian society does not usually frown at the abuse of drugs which does not produce over behavioural changes. The primitive people recognized the use of tobacco, native brewed drinks, cocoa leave and kolanuts to provide pleasurable relief of pain, fatigue and hunger but never realized they were abusing drugs. Different drugs have different effects some, such as cocaine or methamphetamine, may produce an intense “rush” and initial feeli9ng of boundless energy. Others such as heroine, benzodiazepines or the prescription oxycontin may produce excessive feelings of relaxation and calm. What most drugs have in common though is over stimulation of the pleasure centre of the brain. With time the brain’s chemistry is actually altered to the point where not having the drug becomes extremely uncomfortable and even painful. This compelling urge to used, addition, becomes more and more powerful, disrupting work, relationships and health.</p> <p>        Prescription drug abuse is just as dangerous as street drug use. When used appropriately, prescription drugs in the opiate family, such as vicodin (hydrocodone) and oxycontin, are often prescribed for chronic pain or recovery from surgery. Benzodiazaphines, such as valium or xanax are prescribed to treat anxiety. The problem arises when these drugs begin to be used “off label”.</p> <p>        Furthermore, prescription of drugs provide an easy point to other family members susceptible to abuse.    Unpleasant youthful activities are widespread in Nigeria and all over Africa to the extent that they have been giving a lot of concern to the government and general public. In primary schools, peer engage in organized crimes and disrupt normal academic programmes. In secondary schools and most Nigerian universities, the activities of secret cults are known to have been source of threat to lives and property. Outside the campuses, a lot of ritual killings are taking place. (Aluede 2000).</p> <p>        The impact of drug abuse among Nigerian youth’s bankrupt, decadent and wasted generation and loss of our societal values and ideals. The situation now appears to be such that no one can claim ignorance of what is happening. We cannot suit on the fence and criminally pretend on the menace of drug abuse among our young people. Little wonder, then that the former UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan once said “Drugs are tearing apart our societies, spawning crime, spreading diseases such as aids and killing our youths and future”.</p> <p><strong>1.2       </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>In most Nigerian dailies, different opinions over the effect of drug abuse among youths are expressed in different kinds of articles as “Drug Abuse”, “Drug Misuse”, Drug Addiction” etc, without empirical evidence to support the claims. It would not be scientific to accept these opinions.</p> <p>There is need therefore to conduct a study on the effect of drug abuse or misuse of drug among youths. The failure of the students to recognize that drug addiction is symptomatic of an underlined psychiatric disorder or psychological conflict has led to the continuous drug taking.</p> <p><strong>1.3       </strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>1.           Does drug abuse among students caused by family background friendship and per group association?</p> <p>2.           Does drug abuse among students used for psychological purposes like, tension relieving, intensifying perception and so on?</p> <p>3.           Does drug abuse cause health hazard which can lead to death?</p> <p>4.           Do parents and teachers have any role to play?</p> <p><strong>1.4       </strong><strong>PURPOSE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This work is an attempt to study the effect of drug abuse among youths and the role of parents and teachers using students in secondary schools in Benin City, Edo State as a case study. This research finding may apply to other primary and post primary institutions in Nigeria. Purpose of this study therefore is to determine the existing finding of other studies like mine.</p> <p><strong>1.5       </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is not only important to the two schools under study but to the state in particular and Nigeria in general.</p> <p>The study is significant especially this period of our national life when the federal government is talking of re-branding, “Nigeria”, Great People Great Nation! There is no better way to start the rebranding than from children of school age.

Prior to the term, child abuse normally referred to only physical mistreatment but since then, its application has expanded to include, in addition to inordinate physical violence, unjustifiable verbal abuse, the failure to furnish proper shelter,, nourishment, medical treatment or emotional support.</p> <p>        Child abuse can also be seen as the crime of harming a child in a physical, sexual or emotional way. Child abuse is also any illness, impairment or abnormal condition that affects primarily infants and children e.g. those in the age span that begins with the fetus and extends through adolescence.</p> <p>        Although, for the most part, the diseases of childhood are similar to those of the adult, there are several important differences for example certain specific disorders such as precocious puberty are unique to children. Others such as inflammation of the kidney are common in children and infrequent in adults. At the same time, some diseases that are common in adults are infrequent to children. These include essential hypertension (high blood pressure).</p> <p>        Education is an instrument of social, mental and economic development through which right values and attitude for proper development are inculcated. Child abuse and its consequences which is the unjust treatment given to a child, disturb this development process.</p> <p>        It is a practice whereby children are battered, deprived of some basic needs in the home and at school. The saying that the child is the father of the man recognizes the fact that the quality of today’s child will determine the quality of tomorrow’s man.</p> <p>        Truly, the present economic hardship in the country is a fascination of child abuse. In this condition, education of the child becomes the victim of economic down turn of the nation. For those that attend school, many are hawking and pushing wheel-barrow, car wash as part time job to raise the school fees. While others feeds ad cloth the family through the venture. As a result of this abusing condition, the cumulative influence of these activities may have poor academic performance as its consequences.         The offshoot of this child abuse and the consequences is examination malpractice to make for academic deficiencies resulting from failure to attend school regularly and devotion to class activities. Thus, a child generally is a boy or a girl of any age between infancy and adolescence. But for the convince of law, a definite age bracket is ascribed to a child. According to Eigbe (2006), a child in the southern states in Nigeria is a person between the age of 0 – 14 years and in northern states between 0 – 12 years.</p> <p>        Child abuse is a type of physical or mental injury or maltreatment of a person who is regarded as a child. The definition of child abuse has been expanded considerably to include more than just the beaten and sexually abuse child. It extends to any condition injurious to child’s physical or emotional health that has been inflicted by parents, guidance or other caretakers and school mates. The situation should be that of intentional infliction of injuries other than accidental means like suffering, harm by reasons of consequences, malnutrition, sexual abuse of growing up under condition which threaten his or her survival. Definite knowledge as to the nature and scope of child abuse appears to be lacking due to the difficulties associated with the definition of the concept as well as the cross cultural global issue regarding what is and what is not child abuse. In western orientation, child abuse extends to various misuses of children, especially with regards to functions relating to certain responsibilities such as “child labour” either in the form of “farm work “, or street hawking which many children in African cultural content embark upon as an acquired work rule in an extended family system.</p> <p>        Children belong to the defenseless and disadvantaged group. They should not be harmed or maltreated in any way as they are incapable of appreciating the dangers they face and the adverse effects which ill treatment have on their future development. Other children, especially adolescents are exposed, as are adults to environmental hazards that they deliberately seek such as cigarette smoking and the use of alcohol and other drugs. This article reviews the scope of diseases that affect children with particular emphasis on the ways in which the unique attributes of the growing child and special aspects of his environment serve to modify the causes, effects and treatment of particular diseases.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>        Edo State has witnessed in human act of child abuse and its consequences and its devastating effect on the child development. This becomes obvious when viewed from treatment melted on the children from broken home and parental neglect. The following are some abuse and consequences meted on a child;</p> <p>a.           Inadequate care for the children by parents and guardians in terms of providing basic needs.</p> <p>b.           Deprivation of certain children’s right both in the home and at school.</p> <p>c.           Child prostitution through hawking</p> <p>d.           Child kidnapping or death through hawking</p> <p>e.           Exposure to danger of death or harm through kidnapping</p> <p>f.            Misuse of children in various working areas.</p> <p><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        The finding of this study will enable parents and guardians to have alternative way of child rearing with abuse of children. There will be improvement on children enrolment in the school as the findings of the study will be known to the society at large.</p> <p>        The study will also help educational personnel to understand what constitute child abuse and its consequences (like working on the teacher’s farm during school hours, sex abuse by senior students, lack of teaching materials etc its perpetuating force and effect so that they know where and how to start combating it.

Atchley (1980) define ageing as a broad concept that includes physical, psychological, mental changes that occur in our bodies.</p> <p>The perception of ageing and the older adults vary from one society to another. While some societies has positive perceptions of ageing, the other societies has negative perceptions. Ageing in African society is the concept that traditionally invokes the image of respect, reverence and the knowledge that is passed down from one generation to another (Abanyam, 2013). There is a general agreement that African elders have traditionally been treated with great respect in their families and the community. This tradition extends from known customs of pre-slavery civilization on African families and kinship groups. The ability of the elderly to recall cultural historical beliefs, legends, war and important historical events in family or clan has been especially treated as immense contributions.</p> <p>The elderly Ibo of East Nigeria still enjoy reverences in their communities. The beliefs that the elders are closest to the ancestors help to contribute to the respect for the living elderly. Some societies provide health care for elders, social support, family care, government formulate policies and laws that protect the rights of elders; churches and religions give their support by providing medical day care program, visiting, shopping, meals and outreach program and they wished they lived forever Arth (1968).</p> <p>In our contemporary society, the image of ageing becomes tainted. Some global societies that had great respect to their old population has now approached their old age with disdain and intolerance. The Fulani People of Africa move older people to the very edge of their communities – indeed very near to their future graves. They are already seen as socially dead and are held in low regard. In some developing nations in Africa, the older adults are branded witches and are persecuted, isolated and rejected Macionis and Plummer (2005).</p> <p>Growing old in contemporary society is a challenge. Contempt and disrespect stem from the aspect of ageing against one’s will. The older people are being considered as being broken down, slow to work and virtually worthless individuals. This is due to urbanization, monetization, and globalization (Cohen 1994).</p> <p>Modernization, industrialization and global influences have brought about certain changes in some societies especially in the south east and south-south zone of Nigeria. The western culture has greatly influenced the perception towards the older adults in Nigeria. Abiodun (2007) opines that the access to formal education has led to a reduction in the power and prestige given to the accumulated wisdom of the older adults. The direct linkage of educational attainment with occupation and income has altered the economic status of the older adults. The mutual obligation of the extended family system are being systematically eroded by the increasing emphasis on material success and individualism. The search for greener pastures in the urban cities has resulted in the neglect and abandonment of the older adults in rural communities without any form of care. The irregularity of gratuity and pension payment have exacerbated a care challenge for the elders.  Thus, some communities without regard for elders subject them to all manner of suffering, human right abuses, domestic and verbal violence.</p> <p>In Akwa Ibom generally and in Abak in particular, over the last three decades the older adults were valued and respected but in recent times there seems to be disrespect and abuses such as the killing of the older adults during political activities, exploitation of the older adults, neglect during times of sickness. With all these abuses on the older adults, they perceive ageing as a period of regret, torture and shame.</p> <p>Apart from that, there are communities in Abak Local Government Area that have no social infrastructure such as portable water, electricity, health centre. This makes life extremely difficult and unbearable for widows and widowers especially between the ages of 65 and above. The older adults often suffer from sickness such as Arthritis, Heart disease, stroke, hypertension, Diabetes, cancers, blindness, deafness and schizophrenia. Their life is commonly associated with “fall”.</p> <p>This study therefore is concerned with investigating the perception of the people of Abak Local Government Area towards the older adults. The older adults here include people from 65 years and above this is because old age has been commonly defined as beginning at the age of sixty-five (65) years (Flesch, 1986). In Nigeria, the Retirement Age Harmonization Act of 2012 puts the retirement age of Judicial officers and academic staff of tertiary institutions at 70 and 65 years respectively…(Maji, 2014).</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Growing old in the olden days in African society was quite different from what is obtainable in contemporary African society. In the traditional African society, olden people were highly esteemed because of the important roles they played by helping to integrate the society, preserve its cultural values, transmit knowledge and skills, settle disputes and educated the young. People in the traditional African society holds positive views about older people. They got the best available foods, drinks, and their judgment were highly valued and respected. (Abanyam, 2013).  In fact, Mboto (2002) claims that the word Senator is a Latin word for the older people.</p> <p>Giddens (2009) indicates that in traditional societies’, older people were often accorded a great deal of respect. Among cultures that include age-grades, they had the final say over matters of importance to the community. According to Asiyambola (2008), the role of elderly in nation building at the various stages of their life can not be overemphasized. They are the custodians of culture and traditions, mediators during conflict resolution and contributors in enforcing peace in their various communities. Today, the traditional institution responsible for the care-giving is being dismantled. This institutions, which is extended family is being dismantled and consequently, the ageing population is now facing a number of problems. These problems have brought some challenges to older adults. (Oluwabamide 2007, John 2010).</p> <p>By neglecting the older adults, contemporary African societies have missed out on the wise saying which teaches ideas such as the evil of jealousy, selfishness, wickedness, hypocrisy and greed while inculcating virtues such as love, kindness, gentleness impartiality, fairness or justice and humility (Dzurgar, 2012:106). This was aimed at equipping the younger ones with the necessary skills and attitudes that would help younger people to function effectively in the society (Ering, 2008 and Abamyam, 2013). This was the case in all African societies</p> <p>However, the problem is the perception of the children and adults about ageing and the older adults. Contemporary societies have successfully carried on the tradition of impertinence in many aspects by forcefully pushing and neglecting the older people out of the workforce as well as the community display of irreverence. This perception has been carried on by raising young people with negative perception of growing old or becoming old.</p> <p>This perception has alarming misconceptions that remain as imaginary study to young people. It portray a negative image and hope from the generations that are moving next to the stage. Ageing has been linked to various problems ranging from maltreatment, ageism, neglect and exploitation. This is a problem to the ‘graying population’ and the society at large. It is therefore the task of this study to investigate the perception of ageing by the older adults.</p>\n\nPEOPLE'S PERCEPTION OF AGEING: THE CHALLENGE OF THE OLDER ADULTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION OF AGEING: THE CHALLENGE OF THE OLDER ADULTS", "id": 32}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Current World Population include an estimated 1.2 billion young people between the ages of 15 and 24 years, which is about 24.7% of the world’s working age population. Worldwide youth unemployment is high, almost three times higher than the adult unemployment rate. With the economic downturn, the worldwide youth unemployment is expected to reach 25% in 2012 (International Labour Organisation, 2008).</p> <p>In certain parts of the world, especially Sub-Saharan, African, youth unemployment rates can be as high as 60%. More than one third of the young people in the world are unemployed, have completely given up looking for a job or are working but still living below the $2 a day poverty line (International Labour Organisation), or have migrated. Young job seekers face increasing difficulties finding work in the current economic scenario and these have resulted in several social phenomena in the society.</p> <p>Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and the eighth most populous country in the world with a population of 154, 729,000 citizens. Our nominal GDP is $207.166 billion and we have a nominal per capita income of $140,011. Nigeria also has the second largest economy in Africa, if I may ask, is this country not blessed? Yet, it is still plagued by youth unemployment which had been one of our major problems in recent years. Both government and the private sector had discussed this issue at forums and conferences but have not found a solution to it. Its continued existence has been linked to lack of power supply and financial empowerment for youths.</p> <p>Youth unemployment in Nigeria is mostly referred to as graduate unemployment and this means that only the skilled youths are seen as unemployed while the unskilled youths are not given any consideration. However, youths are not a homogenous group and their employment prospects differ according to numerous factors ranging from region to gender to schooling. These phenomena have pushed the Nigerian yoiuths to a stage of anomie and they have adopted dysfunctional methods, such as: armed robbery, prostitution, terrorism, kidnapping, thuggery, militancy, internet scam, fraudulent acts, and so on, in order to cope with the increasing trend of economy meltdown in the country.</p> <p>This research will x-ray how the impact of unemployment in Nigeria has severely affected youths, using a case study of Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State. The study will examine the rural and urban population of people living in the area responses to unemployment predicaments and their differential variables.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government is an area with an increasing population of 137,100 thousand people, (National Planning Commission, 2006). The population is growing at a very fast rate with large unemployment youths living together in the population. Due to high level of unemployment in the Local Government Area, people have adopted dysfunctional methods such as pick-pocketing, kidnapping, assassination, political thuggery, prostitution, defrauding and so on, in order to provide themselves with income and enhances their societal survival.</p> <p>People living in Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government Area see these dysfunctional methods as an alternative to their unemployment status in the area, as the government have failed to provide the unemployment opportunities needed as one of the basic necessity in life.</p> <p>Base on the above statements, many questions arise like, why is the rate of unemployment at an alarming rate in Ibesikpo Local Government Area; despite the area richness in mineral and natural resources, and what are the destructive effect of these social phenomena to the people of Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government Area?</p> <p><strong>1.3   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>This study will provide answers to the following research questions;</p> <ol><li>What is the extent of youth employment in Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government Area?</li> <li>What are the consequences of youth employment in the area?</li> </ol> <p>iii.     How is the Government tackling the unemployment plague in Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government Area?</p> <ol><li>In what ways has the unemployment rate relates to the high rate of social vices in Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government Area?</li> <li>What are the effects of youths unemployment in urban and rural areas of the Local Government.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4   OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The Main objective of the study is to critically examine how unemployment can affect the outcome of youth social behaviour and characteristics in the society. In line with the statement of problems, the study will also seek to achieve the following minor objectives:</p> <ol><li>To investigate the effect of unemployment on youth activities in Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government Area.</li> <li>To unravel various social phenomena that unemployment is the causative factor in Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government Area.</li> </ol> <p>iii.     To review Akwa Ibom State Government strategies concerning youth unemployment in Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government Area.</p> <ol><li>To find out the different variables between urban and rural youth unemployment in Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government Area.</li> <li>To help provide various methods to reduce youth unemployment in Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government Area.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5   STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>Two hypotheses will be tested in this study. These include:</p> <ol><li>There is no significance relationship between unemployment and youth activities.</li> <li>There is no significance effect between unemployment and social vices in Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government Area.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will be beneficial in many ways; it will serve as a tool for further research work for other researchers who will endeavour to carry out research in the same field in future. The study will help government to provide profer solutions as regard unemployment and its effects on youths in Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government Area in particular, and Nigeria as a whole. It will further help scholars towards the advancement of knowledge, such as reference material, term paper topic, symposium and seminar presentation.</p> <p>The study will serve as a guide and important tool in the fight against high level of unemployment. It will also serve as a base or premises for other researchers to challenge, amend, and provide corrections to the research work. The study will provide answers to various arms of governments in Nigeria about unemployment and its causative factors in the society, especially the youths.</p> <p><strong>1.7   LIMITATION/SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study will be restricted to Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government, which comprises urban and rural areas. It will restrict itself to one urban centre of Nung Udoe. And rural areas like Obot Idim, Okop Ndua Erong and Obio Aduang.</p> <p>The study will familiarized itself with various conceptual words, such as unemployment, types of unemployment, youths, Nigeria, Ibesikpo Asutan, poverty, kidnapping, armed robbery among others.</p> <p>The study will adopt Anomy Model postulated by Emile Durkheim as the theoretical framework for the research.</p> <p><strong>1.8   JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Various researchers have conducted research works on unemployment and its effects on youth in the society. For instance, International Labour Organisation (2010) found out that 35 countries for which data exist, nearly 40% of job seekers have been without work for more than one year and therefore run significant risks of demoralization, loss of self-esteem and mental health problems. More importantly, young people are disproportionately hit by unemployment.</p> <p>Also in a study conducted in the United States of America (U.S.A) by Thooker (2011) shows that unemployment in the U.S currently stands at an eye-popping of 9.6%. There is 4 out of 10 Americans who want to work but unable to find a job. The situation is particularly affect the citizens who have been out of work for a long time and have therefore lost unemployment benefits that have expired. This situation has forced American government to budget more on social welfare packages for these unemployed youths, and therefore, causing strains on the other sectors of American economy.</p> <p>White and Wyn (2004), postulates that unemployment is a single factor that affects young people, their families and communities. Today, youth unemployment has become a serious issue all over the world; approximately half of the unemployment group is of youth.</p> <p>In Nigeria, Awogbenle and Iwoamadi (2010) concluded that youth unemployment was an impeding factor of developing economies. They argued that the situation had become more pathetic for hunting jobs not only for experienced and educated youth. They suggested juveniles to be self-employed through entrepreneurial process rather than to serve others.</p> <p>Base on the above literature, non of the studies have given comparative analysis concerning unemployment and its effects on youths in contemporary Nigeria.</p> <p>This is why I had decided to focus my consequences on the contemporary societies using a case study of Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State.</p> <ul><li><strong>DEFINITION OF CONCEPTS UNEMPLOYMENT</strong></li> </ul> <p>In economics, unemployment refers to the condition and extent of joblessness within an economy, and is measured in terms of the unemployment rate, which is the number of unemployed persons divided by the total civilian labour force. Hence, unemployment is the condition of not having a job often referred to as being out of work, or unemployed. The history of unemployment is the history of industrialization.</p>\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT AND IT'S EFFECTS ON NIGERIA YOUTHS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " UNEMPLOYMENT AND IT'S EFFECTS ON NIGERIA YOUTHS", "id": 33}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT<br/>With civilization and urbanization on the increase in Nigeria today and also freedom from parents enjoyed by youths and students in various institutions of higher learning in Nigeria, different kinds of sexual orientation has developed which homosexual is one of them. Homosexuality being the romantic or sexual intercourse or behaviour between members of the same sex, has attracted much interest and attention as a social problems that needs to be investigated and solved. However, there have been different kinds of attitude towards the act and those involve in it. In Nigeria, it is strongly frowned at, because it is believed to have a negative effect on the general society, it therefore constitute a deviant behaviour and it is highly against the moral principle of Nigerian society in general and Caritas University in particular. Therefore, this study seeks to examine the attitude of undergraduate students towards homosexuality and its implication on social adjustment, hence examining how the attitudes of undergraduate students affect homosexuals in the school environment. The objective of this study aims on how students get involve in the act and also to ascertain how easy it is to disengage from the act and finally to discover if there is a positive correlation between attitude of undergraduates towards homosexuality and social adjustment of homosexuals.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/><strong>1.1 Background to the study</strong><br/>Homosexuality is romantic or sexual intercourse or behaviour between members of the same sex (beth 1992:2). As a sexual orientation, homosexuality refers to an enduring pattern of or disposition to experience sexual, affectionate or romantic attractions primarily and exclusively to people of the same sex (Redmond 1999).<br/>The term homosexual is derived from a Greek word “homos” which means same. Thus connoting sexual acts and affections between members of the same sex. Lesbianism is a sexual act between females while Gay generally refers to male homosexuality. The word “Lesbians” is derived from the name of the Greek island “Lesbos”, where the poet Sappho wrote largely about her emotional relation with young women.<br/>Historically, homosexuality has attracted much interest and attention but attitudes towards such preference of having sex with one of the same gender have varied in different epochs and cultural groups ranging from acceptance as among the ancient Greeks, to measured tolerance in the Roman times and outright condemnations. (Greg Reeder 1999).</p> <p>According to the old testament, Leviticus 16:8-22, 20:13) sex between men is an abomination and any involved will be put to death, other parts of the Bible makes it known that homosexuality is a sin and any involved in it faces strong penalty. Such books of the Bible like the book of Romans 1:18-31, Corinthians 6:9 which says that homosexuals are unrighteous and will not inherit the kingdom of God. This however has affected the Judeo-Christian attitude towards homosexuality for centuries.<br/>Also in primitive time, negative attitude is found in different cultures even in Africa, there has been serious condemnation of homosexuality such that anyone involved in act will be put to death.<br/>In the late 19th century ambivalent attitude have prevailed, that is, opposing feelings about homosexuality such that some people fell homosexuality is normal and they tend to fight for their freedom. In some primitive societies homosexual activities are considered normal and socially acceptable. For instance in Arunta of Central Australia, homosexuality is a common practice. Some nations such as Great Britain, United States and West Germany to mention but a few have recently legalized homosexual relations between consenting adults. In the United states, in the 1940s homosexuality was classified as felony with punishment up to life imprisonment in all states. (Frank Beach 1991).</p> <p>By the early 1970s at least ten states had legalized such acts between consenting adults. One third of the societies studied by ford and Beach include many industrialized countries; give little or no sanction to homosexuals.<br/>In recent years in the United States such organizations as the Gay Activities Alliance and the Daughters of Bilitis have attempted to influence public opinion and legislation toward greater tolerance of homosexuals. Their effort and other world associations and conferences such as the 1974 Berkshire conference also the 1973 meeting of the Association of homosexual activists and other various meetings along with Gay advocacy books has created several attitudes among people of the world and attracted attentions. Recently, even in Nigeria, homosexuality is beginning to spread and open up and even though there has been a law against the act, still it is in existence in the country and also in various institution of higher learning in the country. Including Caritas University where there has been cases of homosexual activities amongst students though not too obvious and popular but it exist and there has been various attitudes towards it from other students who do not get involved in the act.<br/>While a lot of research have been carried out in other aspect of students attitude very little or nothing has been done in the area of research on the attitude of students towards homosexuality. It is on this premise that this study seek to unravel the knowledge and general attitude of students towards homosexuality.</p> <p>1.2 Statement of the problem<br/>With increasing urbanization in Nigeria and relative freedom from parents and guardian enjoyed by students in various institutions of higher learning in Nigeria. There has been different kinds of sexual orientation which includes homosexuality and attitudes towards it. How do people regard to homosexuality and those involved in it is an issue that need to be investigated. While homosexuals face condemnation in some societies. They are accepted in other societies. In Nigeria, it is highly frowned at, because it is believed to have a negative effect on the general behaviour and it is strongly against the moral principle of Nigerian society and Caritas University in particular. Though this act of homosexuality exist in closed and private settings in Caritas University, this case is becoming obvious and privately alarming so much so that the moral ethics for which this mission university is known is under serious threat. The act is like underground water destroying the moral base of this noble university. Like wild fire, it is permeating into the minds of all students of Caritas University.<br/>On the part of the homosexuals, most often they suffer psycho social trauma, social isolation and are society wide regarded as deviants, they are some times regarded and treated as criminals. In future, they may face the danger of childlessness except if they change and get married to opposite sex. This is outright negation of the order instituted by God. It is a violation against the natural use of man and woman.<br/>Furthermore, the attitude of people towards the acts causes those involved in the act unable to socially and psychologically adjust within the society and relate to people and members of the society.<br/>It is on the above premise that this study seeks to unravel the attitude of undergraduate students of Caritas university towards homosexuality and its effects on social adjustment.<br/>1.3 Research Questions<br/>The following research questions shall guide this study<br/>1. Do students have knowledge about homosexuality?<br/>2. How do students perceive homosexuality?<br/>3. How do students get involved in the act?<br/>4. How easy is it to disengage from the act?<br/>5. What do students think about people who are involve in homosexual act?</p> <p>1.4 Objectives of the study<br/>The general objective of this study is to investigate the attitude of undergraduate students towards Homosexuality and how it affect social adjustment.<br/>The specific objectives of the study area are as follows:<br/>1. To understand the extent to which students knowledge about homosexuality affects their attitudes and social adjustment.<br/>2. To determine students knowledge about homosexuality.<br/>3. To fnd out how students get involved in the act of homosexuality.<br/>4. To ascertain how easy it is to disengage from the act.<br/>5. To suggest how this social ill will be stopped.<br/>1.5 Significance of the study<br/>This study has both theoretical and practical significance. Theoretically, the study intends to find out the motive behind indulging in homosexuality.<br/>The findings of the study will be of immense values to the educators, psychologists and school administrators on the best ways to handle the problem of homosexuality among undergraduate students.<br/>Again, the findings of this study will help to intimate the guidance counselors on the social and sexual background of these students and how best to offer a programme of intervention for their re-integration into heterosexual world.<br/>Thus, both students and counselors will be better informed about he inherent dangers associated with indulging in homosexuality.<br/>1.6 Definition of terms<br/>HOMOSEXUALITY<br/>Homosexuality is a romantic and sexual intercourse between members of the same sex or gender.<br/>LESBIANISM<br/>Lesbianism is the sexual relationship between two women, when someone is a lesbian it simply means that a woman is having sexual relationship with another woman.<br/>ATTITUDE<br/>This refers to a disposition to react or behave in a certain way towards an issue, event, act or a situation.</p> <p>UNDERGRADUATE<br/>These are people who are currently undertaking or studying for their first degree in a higher institution of learning.<br/>GAY<br/>This can be referred to as sexual relationship between two men.<br/>SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT<br/>This means adapting to the societal conditions or circumstances of one’s environment.<br/>CLOSED AND PRIVATE SETTING<br/>This refers to a secret place where the homosexuals carry out the act without being noticed by anybody.</p>\n\nKNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDE OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TOWARDS HOMOSEXUALITY AND IT'S IMPLICATION ON SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDE OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TOWARDS HOMOSEXUALITY AND IT'S IMPLICATION ON SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT", "id": 34}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>This study attempts to explain the socio-cultural factors influencing student's career choice in Kosofe Local Government area of Lagos State. The study adopted a qualitative approach. While a total of 150 respondents were selected using simple random sampling, the research instrument was a structured questionnaire having both open and closed ended questions. The social cognitive career development theory and the career development -model were used to explain the concept further. Also, two hypotheses were tested in the course of the study. The finding reveals that there is no significant relationship between socio-cultural background and student career choice, and there is a significant relationship between parental influence and student career choice. The study recommended that there should be better effort put into counseling and guidance on career choice by the government, and that parents should endeavour to identify personal qualities in their ward and encourage them to pursue a career along that line.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0      Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Students career ‘choice’ is a subject which has attracted academic, professional as well as public attention due to its multifaceted nature. Since career is a result of the interplay between individuals within organizational and social structures, it yields well to analysis form diverse perspectives ranging from occupational psychology to organizational sociology. Research on students career choice is not uncommon on occupational groups such as accountants and , health care professionals (Morrison 2004; Hallissey et. al, 2000, Kyriacou and Colthatt, 2000. The aim of such research is often to predict students career choice behaviour based on personality as well as demographic distributive factors.</p> <p>When we think about career choice, several things immediately come to mind, such as job description, training and education required, career outlook, as well as salary - but there are a number of other factors that may influence an individual’s decision. Thus, skills and abilities, that is, considering the individual's skills and abilities and how they may fit a particular occupation comes out of one of the earliest career development field, trait factor theory, and is still in use today.</p> <p>It is important to understand that career choice is not made based on any one factor is our choices are subject to many influences; individual, cultural, social and environmental. The combination and interaction of various influences on an individual decision-making are unique to him or her and the individual's\" situation. The number of choices that we are aware of and the number of choices that exist and are available to us in reality may differ. Furthermore, there may be choices that we are not aware of, or which are unavailable to us due to structural constraint that we may fail to recognize. Lack of awareness of our full range of choices may lead us to make use of a limited range of career alternatives or opportunity structures. Understanding factors that impact on career `choice' would be instrumental in designing and delivering better informed counselling and mentorship (Rant and Michael, 1983). Sheridan et.al, noted that the initial career ‘choice’ of managers and the relative status of their department play a role in outcomes of their career tournament, such as promotion, transfer, and salary progression. Therefore, identifying possible influences of career choice is important as such influences may impact on job entry behaviour as well as subsequent career outcomes.</p> <p>Some people strongly belief that university graduation provides advantages in employment in comparison to high school graduation. Thus, a university entrance examination is regarded as the most important stage and pathway for business life and employment. As a result of this believe, admission to university, even a less preferred one is regarded as more important than the quality of the match between occupations and individual abilities. (Ozkale et. al; 2004). The mismatch and graduation from a less preferred discipline have considerable impacts in the early years of careers (Erdogmus, 2003), resulting in a continuation of the career `choice' process subsequent to graduation from the first university degree. Parents as the key source of funding for children education may be interpreted as an indication of a form of collectivist culture (Price, 1997).</p> <p><strong>1.1        STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Although career choices are important for young people, they are not a matter of life and death. In fact, most people do not get into a settled career until their mid-20s. If a student aspires to be a doctor, lawyer or other professional, it's a long haul - as it always has been. For others, though, the route is likely to be much less predictable. But before a student starts a career, they'll probably have to consider further some socio-cultural ideals. Many recent changes have occurred in this area.</p> <p>Higher education costs money, and there is an increasing number of part-time (often poorly paid) jobs open to students, with many universities and colleges having reduced study hours to enable students to earn. In terms of post-university work, employers are increasingly looking for experience as well as academic qualifications. It is as important that a student builds towards a body of experience as it is to make good career choices in relation to his or her socio-cultural background.</p> <p>One of the most challenging educational issues facing Nigeria is understanding and solving the persistent disparities in achievement among racial and ethnic groups. while much of the focus on this issue has centered on student achievement as measured by grades and test scores (Jencks and Phillips, 1998; Steinberg et. al; 1992), there has been considerable attention to understanding and explaining differences on students career choice (Fernandez et. al., 1989; Ogbu 1989).</p> <p><strong>1.2      RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>This study is attempting to identify socio-cultural factors that influence student's career choice. To achieve this aim, the following questions will be investigated:</p> <p>1.        What influences students' choice of career in any way?</p> <p>2.        How do parents perceive their children's course of study?</p> <p>3.        Do parents have influence on their children's career choice?</p> <p>4.        Are there any chance for parents to deciding what their children will be in the future?</p> <p>5.        What is/are the motivating factor(s) of student career choice?</p> <p><strong>1.3      OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objectives of the study are as follows:</p> <p>1.        To investigate the socio-cultural factors which influence student's career choice?</p> <p>2.        To discover the role of parents in the choice of career of students.</p> <p>3.        To explore the motivating factors that determine students choice of career.</p> <p><strong>1.4      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is significant for its effort in identifying the socio-cultural factors that affect choice of career. Also, when completed, it will help students to have .a better understanding of what `career' is really all about, as it is common in our society that most children and students do not know what career choice really entails, hence they choose based on peer influence, common social sentiment or parental advice.</p> <p>Some also choose based on the pecuniary gains inherent to the `career', when it is not what really interests them. Therefore, this study will serve as a stitch in time as young people will learn to consider their socio-cultural situation before making career choices.</p> <p><strong>1.5      SCOPE AND DELIMITATION</strong></p> <p>The scope of the work is limited to young and adolescent students, both male and femalein Kosofe Local Government of Lagos State.</p> <p>The limitations of this study includes that it only applies to students in Kosofe Local Government, and the study is limited to data received to cover the set scope.

A sample of 300 students was randomly selected to complete a self-administered questionnaire about knowledge, attitude and practice of smoking in the University, Ojo. The Majority of the smoking students (69%) knew the adverse effects of smoking. Rates of non-smoking students who knew the adverse effects of smoking were significantly higher than that of students who smoke. A high rate of students showed an opposing attitude towards the assumption that smoking females would have more friends (89%), have stronger personality (86%), and be more attractive (89%) than non-smoking females. Similar higher rates of negative attitude were also observed towards the smoking male. About 50% of smokers have a misguided belief that smoking helps them concentrate while studying and 20% believe that smoking helps in avoiding obesity. Students that started smoking before enrollment in a university had a significantly higher rate of heavy smoking as compared to those who started smoking after being enrolled. Students smoke not because they lack the knowledge about the risk of smoking but due to misguided beliefs and attitudes.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Smoking has become a complex global public health problem and a major health-risk factor linked with the development of cancer, heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes (World Bank, 1999). It is responsible for the largest preventable cause of death in the world. Each day more than 13,000 people die prematurely because of tobacco use (CDC, 2000). This figure is expected to almost double by the year 2020. Countries at all levels of development are victims of the tobacco epidemic (WHO, 2003a).</p> <p>According to the World Bank Reports in 2003 there were about 1.3 billion people smoking cigarettes or other products, and out of them, almost one billion were men and 250 million were women. About 80 percent of these people lived in low and middle-income countries (Guindon &amp; Boisclair, 2003). Cigarette smoking has become not only a national social problem, but a global one also. Smoking is expected to kill 4 million people in the next 12 months, and by 2030, it will kill 10 million people a year, which is more than any other single cause of death. Seven million of these deaths will occur in low-income and middle-income countries (World Bank, 1999; CDC, 2000). Numerous studies reveal that smoking prevalence has remained stable in the United States of America (USA) at 23% since 1993 (Etter, 2004; Fiore, 2003; Giovino, 1994).</p> <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that five million deaths occur annually due to tobacco use and this number of deaths is expected to reach more than eight million by the year 2030 (Gajalakshmi et al., 2004; WHO, 2009). About 80% of this number will be in developing countries (WHO, 2009). However, the exact magnitude of the problem of smoking in developing countries is not well defined. There is little information to describe the characteristics of smoking patterns in these countries (Gajalakshmi et al., 2004). Smoking has a great economic burden by causing a decrease of economic productivity and high health care expenditures in addition to the cost of tobacco (Ruff et al., 2000).</p> <p>Smoking also has an environmental impact due to second hand (passive) smoking (El-Ansari, 2002). The impact of smoking is not limited on the smokers, but it can spread to affect the non-smokers as well. Second hand smoking has an impact on birth outcomes represented in low birth weight (Abu-Baker et al., 2010), and contribute significantly to respiratory tract infections in infants (Jones et al., 2011).</p> <p>It is well known that cessation of smoking is extremely difficult. This statement is supported by research that has proved beyond doubt that nicotine is highly addictive (Rugkasa et al., 2001). Smoking prevalence rises sharply during adulthood. This means that there is an induction of smoking even after high school (Torabi et al., 2002). Between 1991 and 1997, the rate of smoking had increased by 32% among 18 to 24 years old adults in the USA (Torabi et al., 2002). Studying smoking behavior and attitude among this sector of the population will add valuable information about the patterns of smoking among this age group (Vakeflliu et al., 2002). In addition, knowledge about previously identified socio-environmental factors associated with smoking among college students in developing countries is limited (Pickett et al., 2000; Moore, 2001).</p> <p><strong>1.2     Aim of the Study</strong></p> <p>                The aim of this study is to investigate the knowledge, attitude and practice on smoking among University students in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3     Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>                To find out the knowledge about tobacco smoking among Nigerian University students</p> <p>                To determine the smoking practice among Nigerian University students</p> <p>                To investigate the gender difference of smoking among Nigerian University students</p> <p>                To investigate effective methods to reduce prevalence of smoking in Nigerian University</p> <p><strong>1.4     Research Questions</strong></p> <p>                What is the prevalence smoking practice among Nigerian University students</p> <p>                How are the knowledge, attitude, and practice students in Nigerian University related to smoking?</p> <p>                Is there any gender difference as related to smoking among Nigerian University students</p> <p>                What is the effective methods to reduce prevalence of smoking in Nigerian University</p> <p><strong>1.5   Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>·        Smoking rate among Nigerian University is lower than among general population.</p> <p>·        How are the knowledge, attitude, and practice students in Nigerian University related to smoking?</p> <p>·        Smoking among Nigerian University students is gender related</p>                                                           \n\nKNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE AND PRACTICE ON SMOKING AMONG STUDENTS IN NIGERIAN UNIVERSITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE AND PRACTICE ON SMOKING AMONG STUDENTS IN NIGERIAN UNIVERSITY", "id": 36}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0            </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1 BACKGROUND STUDY</p> <p>Divorce is the dissolution of marital relations; in this process marriage is completely broken down either in social or legal context. The Black Dictionary of law has defined divorce as \"the legal separation of husband and wife affected by the judgment of decree of a court and either totally dissolving the married relations or suspending its effect so far as concern the combination of the practices (1994). Divorcees are free to remarry after divorce whereas separation may not allow it.</p> <p>Divorce is nothing and in common senses it is taken easily somewhere in which a couple ends their marital relations and starts to remarry, but it may create some vital problems in the family, like adjusting to new life.</p> <p>Many divorced people remarry in Nigeria, as well as other parts of the world, and about half those who do are already parents. The result is the creation of “blended families”, also called “stepfamilies”. For instance, in 1992, over 11 percent of all American children were living with one biological parent and one stepparent. Estimates are that a fourth of American children will live with a stepparent before reaching the age of sixteen. By the year 2000, it has been estimated that, stepparent is expected to outnumber traditional nuclear families (Cherlin and Furstanberg</p> <p>2000). It can be argued that, perhaps the most important factor in the increase in divorce throughout the twentieth century has been the greater social acceptance of divorce. In particular, this increased tolerance has resulted from relaxation of negative attitudes toward divorce among various religious denominations. Although, divorce is still seen as unfortunate, it is no longer treated as sin by most religious leaders (Gerstel 1987).</p> <p>Marriage is a social and cultural phenomenon and approved social pattern where by two or more persons establish a family. Sexual intercourse between the marital partners and subsumes reciprocal right and obligation between the spouses and their children. Marriage is a key means that enables to make a union between a man and woman, which may situate in different socioeconomic background. However, the forms of marriage are responsible to disruption of marital status and lead to divorce. In the present research 63.0 percent of divorce cases were under the arranged marriage, which may challenge to western divorce trend where, maximum cases of marriage are under love marriage which breakdown easily. Similarly, 37.0 percent of divorce cases are found with in love marriage.</p> <p>Some of the studies (Choudhary 1988, Pothan 1986, Metha 1975) on divorce based on Indian society have found the causes of divorce leads by exogamy marriage but in this study 8.40 percent of divorce cases have found under endogamy marriage system. Basically, low age at marriage of wife, marriage with wrong information or forced marriage. 7.40 percent of educated women were married with illiterate men without any concerned to her; they were actually unknown about it. In this study as a case, Mr. S.A and miss P.R were married with wrong information. Basically that was based on their family interests. She was matrix pass where as her husband was just literate but relatively well in economic condition. After two years of their marriage, marital relation between them was continuously became loose and occurred divorce.</p> <p>Similarly, unequal educational and economic statuses of the spouses were major cause of the divorce under arranged marriage, which has more or less endogamy nature. Similarly, 33.0 percent of male were generally disagreed on the process of their marriage. 7.40 percent married were exogamy, which failed to gain family support. Those marital circumstances have created the situation that supports to breakdown their marital relation. 33.0 percent of husbands and 60.0 percent of wives were at the age of 20 when they get married. This situation of age factor indicates that the divorcee had immaturity to their family life. Similarly, the high age difference in husband and wife and unequal educational status creates differ expectations from the marriage which strongly support to occur divorce gradually.so this study focuses on the sociological analysis of marriage and divorce, using Alimosho local government of Lagos State as a case study.</p> <p>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>The rate of divorce among couples in Nigeria and the world at large is really disturbing and alarming. Current trends suggest that close to two thirds of new marriage will end in divorce. For instance, nearly 32 percent of couples who divorce will do so before their fifth anniversary and about 63 percent before their tenth (Martin and Bumpass 1989 and National Centre for Health Statistics 1993). But, since the nineteenth century the proportion of marriages ended by death of a spouse has declined, while the proportion end by divorce has increased, more or less steadily.</p> <p>Divorce rates climbed in the 1960s and 1970s reached a peak in the early 1980s, and have dropped slightly since then. Still the U.S. divorce rate remains high when compared with the rate in earlier eras and in other societies (Whites 1990). In the same vein, in recent years, Nigeria has witnessed the high rate of divorce as a result of urbanization and industrialization. The periods triggered to a monetary industrial economy. Thus, the extended family that used to resolve conflicts or misunderstandings arise between couples were no longer functioning effectively like in the past. The extended family structure eventually broke up in the process; and there was a shift towards the nuclear family system characterized by less involvement of members in the resolution of marital conflicts.</p> <p>It has been observed over the years that children are always at the receiving of marital instability. The wellbeing of children is no longer a priority during marital instability, most children are often affected psychological due to lack to the fact they no longer enjoy and receive affections from their parents. Study has shown that the academic performance of students are mostly affected due to marital instability, most students who are victims of a broken home often lack the privilege of a good education. It has been observed that most children who are involved in crime are often from broken homes. Due to like of proper tutelage and parental guidance, most children are found involved in theft, murder, rape, burglary, robbery, etc. these problems necessitates the need to carry out a study on the sociological analysis of marriage and divorce.</p> <p>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY     </p> <p>The general objective of this study is to carry out a sociological analysis of marriage and divorce, using Alimosho local government area as a case study. The specific objects are:</p> <p>1.     To ascertain the rate divorce among married couples in Alimosho Local government area.</p> <p>2.     To find out the causes of divorce among married couples in Alimosho Local government area.</p> <p>3.     To investigate the consequences of divorce on the wellbeing of the children.</p> <p>4.     To examine the influence of childlessness on the rate of divorce among couples in Alimosho local government area.</p> <p>5.     To know the effects of socio-economics factors on the rate divorce among couples in Alimosho Local government area.</p> <p>1.4     RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>The relevant research questions related to this study are:</p> <p>1.     What is the rate divorce among married couples in Alimosho Local government area?</p> <p>2.     What are the causes of divorce among married couples in Alimosho Local government area?</p> <p>3.     What are the consequences of divorce on the wellbeing of the children?</p> <p>4.     What is the influence of childlessness on the rate of divorce among couples in Alimosho local government area?</p> <p>5.     What are the effects of socio-economics factors on the rate divorce among couples in Alimosho Local government area?</p> <p>1.5     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </p> <p>This study is significant to parents because it elucidates the factors responsible for divorce and how the reduce the rate of divorce among married couples. The study is also relevant to the government, the study shows the implication of joblessness on the rate of divorce among newly married couples.</p> <p>This study will enhance the existing body of literature by contemplating the areas of the literature that have not yet been examined or considered and incorporating these factors into the current study. The study will thus form the basis for further studies in the field.</p> <p>1.6     SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The scope of this study is restricted to the sociological analysis of marriage and divorce, using Alimosho Local government area of lagos State as a case study.</p> <p>1.7     LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</p> <p>Some of the major constraints the researchers encountered in putting up this research include lack of time, lack of willingness to give information by respondent and also limited resources.</p> <p>1.8     DEFINITION OF TERMS     </p> <p><strong>Marriage</strong>: is the legally or formally recognized union of two people as partners in a personal relationship.</p> <p><strong>Divorce</strong>: is the termination of a marriage or marital union, the canceling or reorganizing of the legal duties and responsibilities of marriage.</p>                                                         \n\nSOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE", "id": 37}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>BEHAVIOURAL PROBLEMS</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Behavioural problems are bad, unacceptable behavioural in a given society. Behavioural    problems (maladjustment)is defined as bad or unsatisfactory adjustment of behaviour (Webster Encyclopedia unabridged dictionary, 1994). Ross (1980) views behavioural problems to be presented when a child emits behaviour that deviates on arbitrary and relative social norm in that it occurs with a frequency or intensity that authoritative adults in the child’s environment judge under the circumstances to be either high or too low.</p> <p>From the perspective of public welfare and safety personality disorder or maladjustment was defined as an antisocial personality which is marked by a long-term of irresponsible, impulsive, unscrupulous, even criminal behaviour beginning in childhood or early adolescence (Berstein, Roy, Srull, and Wickers, 1991). To the teacher, the meaning of behavioural problem in the classroom situation “is a higher or explicit attempt to give a symbolic interactionist account of discipline problems in the calassroom (Stebbings, 1970). There are over 427 behavioural problems identified by Ross (1980) but those of very serious implication that has relevance to teaching/learning process and research work has been done extensively is by Stouffer. He had 50 behavioural problems exhibited by school different. Although not of equal seriousness. None of them can be said to be entirely unimportant (Stouffer, 1998).</p> <p>According to Stouffer (1988) information from the white house conference on child health and protection indicates that one out of every three school child’s maladjusted in one or the other. It had also been estimated that 12 percent of school children are so emotionally up-set as to require the services of guidance specialist and physiatrists (Mukhurjee, 1978). To obtain a situational report, the researcher also found from social welfare center Kaduna and the Borstal Training Institute Kaduna State alarming increase of about 80% and 100% respectively in the number of maladjusted children/youths which must bear it roots since their childhood. This is because any maladjusted preschool child will turn to the maladjusted in childhood and then turn out to be a maladjusted adolescent and finally turns out to be a maladjusted adult if nothing is done to curb it at the initial stage. This opinion is shared by Kagan and Moses (1962), Kolo (1992) and Coplan (2005). Where they stated that behaviours exhibited by children at young age tend to stabilize throughout  life. Wickman (1978) found a marked discrepancy between the rating of teachers and mental hygienist on the relative seriousness of behavioural problems in school children. Teachers stress the importance of problems relative to sex, dishonesty, disobedience, disorderliness and failure to learn. For them the problems that indicate withdrawing, recessive characteristics in children are of comparatively little significance. This opinion is also shared by (Stebbins, 1970) Research work has been done extensively by Stouffer (1998) on the ratings of teachers on behavioural problems of children in the developed nations. Literature has shown the non-existence of such data in Nigeria. Their research findings cannot be authoritatively said to be true of our own school children in Nigeria due to certain factors such as environmental, social economical and political.</p> <p>According to Dantani and Abubakar (1999), manifestation of maladjusted forms of behaviour in primary school is one of the areas of concern for teachers, educational administrators and parents. This is because no meaningful learning can take place if the learner is maladjusted. Teachers have great role to play in the development of the pupil they often observe the development in children that occur during school year and they report their cognitive, affective and psychomotor development. The contribution of the teacher in the development of the child cam make a difference for the brighter future of any society (Okon and Anderson, 1982).</p> <p>According to Hendrkz (1986) the school is expected to contribute towards pupil’s development as healthy balance people who are able to fit into their communities, to control their less acceptable impulse to become what is known as socialized. Teachers encounter more of children’s behavioural problems they know those problems that can hamper effective teaching/learning in the class and those behaviour that could be detriment to the child. Based on all these, the researcher intends to finds out how the teachers will rate the behavioural problems of children in the primary schools in Kaduna state.</p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Teachers have a great role to play in the development of the pupil. They often observe the development in children that occur during school year and report their cognitive, affective and psychomotor development. The contribution of the teacher in the development of the child can make a difference for a brighter future of any society (Okon and Anderson 1982) this opinion is also shared by Hendrikz (1986).</p> <p>From the background, one out of three pupils is maladjusted in a way (Stouffer, 1998). From the situational report, information from social welfare center and Borstal Training Institute Kaduna stated that there were over 80% and 100% increase respectively in the number of maladjusted children. Manifestation of maladjusted forms of behaviours in the primary schools is one of the areas of concern for teachers, educational administrators and parents. This is because no meaningful learning can take place if the learner is maladjusted. The maladjusted should exhibit problems such as truancy, inattention, no interest in working quarrelsome, restless, disobedience, stubbornness, laziness.</p> <p> The teacher could be stressed up in trying to correct the child, may lose patient, may even be annoyed and refused to come to class because of the problem of the maladjusted child. </p> <p>There are over 50 behavioural problems of children in the classroom, it is important to point out which of these behavioural problems affect the teachers and pupils effective teaching/learning process. Rating of behavioural problems of children by teachers and metal hygienist has been carried out by (Blair, Jones &amp; Simpson, 1975). In the development nation, this can not be authoritatively claimed to true situation for our own school children due to economic, environmental social and political factors. In order to find out which behavioral problem has serious implication, this study is designed to find out which behavioural problem has serious implication, this study is designed to find out how teachers rate behavioural problems of children in primary schools in Kaduna State.</p> <p><strong>1.3     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to determine the teacher’s ratings of behavioural problems of pupils in public primary schools in Kaduna State specifically. This study is to:</p> <p>1.                  Find out current causes of behavioural problems among children of primary school in Kaduna.</p> <p>2.                  Identify the ratings of teachers of the seriousness of fifty behavioural problems of children in the primary school in Kaduna State.</p> <p>3.                  Find out the difficulties teachers encounter with children having behavioural problems in the primary school in Kaduna State.</p> <p><strong>1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is hoped that when teacher’s rating of behavioural problems of children in the primary school are identified, the study will be beneficial to teachers, headmasters, school administrator, parents, guidance and counseling personnel, psychologist, mental hygienist students and the government. It would identify those behavioural problems that can be hamper effective teaching and meaningful learning, thereby it would help the teachers and administrators to utilize the most suitable teaching methods/techniques. Behavioural problems which crop up in childhood will be reduced to the minimum because teachers will be able to curb that in childhood. The child would also develop a sound personality, sound attitude and morals which is one of the goals of primary education in Nigeria (National Policy of Education, 2004). Parents will benefit because, they will be able to identify these behavioural problems in their children and help them to manage these problems. Mental hygienist, guidance counseling will be better informed and it would be a tool for making their work easier.</p> <p><strong>1.5     ASSUMPTION OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>The study will cover five chapters; Chapter one consist of the background of the study, including statement of the problem, objectives, scope etc. The chapter two deals with the review of related literature, Chapter three dwelled on the research methodology, while Chapter four present and analyse data collected from sample respondents and finally, the chapter five of the study summarize, conclude and provide recommendations to the problems identified by the study. </p> <p><strong>1.6     RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>The following research questions have been formulated to guide the study:</p> <p>1.                  What are the current causes of Behavioural problems among primary school pupils in Kaduna State?</p> <p>2.                  What are the teacher’s ratings of the seriousness of 50 behavioural problems of children in the primary school in Kaduna State?</p> <p>3.                  What are the difficulties teachers’ encountered with children having behavioural problems in primary schools in Kaduna State?</p> <p><strong>1.7     SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study looked into teachers rating of the seriousness of behavioural problems of children in Kaduna state, the current causes of maladjustment among children as well as the difficulties the teachers faced with children having such problems. The ranking order of the seriousness of the behavioural problems of school children is not included in the research work.</p> <p><strong>1.8    LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In carrying out a project work like this, a lot of problem are often encountered and such problems include the following;</p> <p>-      Collection of data posed a problem as some of the respondents approached for interview were quite indifferent</p> <p>-      Scarcity of textbooks, journals and other relevant publication on the chosen topic which serves as inhibiting factor in gathering up to data information on the subject matter.</p> <p>-      Internal and external validity also a problem to the research work.</p> <p>-      There was also the uncooperative attitude of some of the respondents which they frequency complain of engagement elsewhere.</p> <p>-      In addition, the research is restricted in scope because of financial constraint. A larger population would have been sampled if not for financial limitation.</p> <p><strong>1.9     OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong><em>Attitude</em></strong>: is an expression of favor or disfavor toward a person, place, thing, or event (the attitude object).

But if both or either of them should fail to carryout the term or fulfill their duties towards each other, then the contract may be broken. This is what we called divorce or Talaq.</p> <p>Talaq is an Arabic word which really means dissolution of marriage. Although Islam has given the right of divorce to both men and women, it has been made necessary that this right should be exercised only  in exceptional cases when no other way is left and all methods of making peace between husband and wires have proved a failure. </p> <p>The history of marriage and divorce in the ancient nations have formulated that the cause of divorce has been erratic. The Jewish law allows dissolution of marriage as a matter of no great concern. If husband finds any uncleanliness in wife, then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it on her hand and send her out of his house. When she has departed out of his she may go and be another man’s wife. </p> <p>In Christianity, on the other hand, a saying attributed to Jesus has been reported: “what therefore God has joined together let no Man put asunder; whosoever shall put away his wife and marry commitment adultery against her”. </p> <p>The catholic says, “when the sacrament of matrimony has been received by a man and ratified by their cohabitation as husband and wife, their union cannot be dissolved except by death.”</p> <p>Islam has steered it’s middle course and has avoided the extremes of either making divorce to rigid or banning it altogether, or making it too loose and frivolous. Islam has permitted divorce but has imposed certain conditions and limitations upon the right of the husband to divorce the  matrimonial bond so that the husband may not act in haste or anger. Divorce is of two kinds in Islam.   </p> <p>A.          <strong>Talaq Rajai</strong>: The divorce which permits husband resuming conjugal relationships. This is revocable divorce which is pronounced twice. If the relationship improves during the period of probation (Iddah), the divorce is revocable.</p> <p>B.          <strong>Talaq Ba’in</strong>; Talaq Ba’in means the irrevocable divorce that separates the couple finally. The revocable divoerce becomes absolutely or irrevocable if the period of probation is allowed to elapse without the huband having revoked either by expression of words or by conduct.</p> <p>A Muslim is given every opportunity by the Qur’anic injunction to reconcile if possible before making final decision before he carry out the irrevocable divorce. After the two period of temporary separation, one has to make a final choice. He may take back in love and amity, or let her go finally. The ghost of marriage in Islam is to unite two lives and to bring happiness to the couple. Even then, the husband is enjoined by the Qur’an not to dismiss the wife in disgrace, or with view to humiliating her, but to let her go kindly with due regard to her, tenderness and with a view to secure  peace of mind for both the wife and himself.</p> <p>On the Christian perspective, the divorce must be pronounced in the presence of the court judge or pastor of the church, just as in the case of marriage were the husband or wife is guilty of adultery. It is a public act to be known by all. It’s the duty of the head of the church (pastor) to divorce the marriage. It is the irrevocable divorce that separates finally. No re-marriage in Christianity.</p> <p>1.1   <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong></p> <p>Today, the Nigeria society seems to be passing through a very cohensive force of divorce problems, which disturbs the peaceful living that exists between the said two parties. It has become a problem of concern to almost every Nigerian. Hence this research is undertaken to investigate courses of divorce problem in our well pronounced society today.</p> <p>Unfaithfulness of husband/wife could cause divorce in marriage, others may be lack of children, lack of money, late of love and misunderstanding, difference in religions and interference from outsiders could also contributes to divorce problem. </p> <p>1.2   <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>It is importance to know that the motive behind this study is not only for the purpose of the award of NCE but it is hoped that this research will help parents, couples and the government to know the extent to which  rampant  divorce  is occurring in Nigerian society. This study will also look into the actual causes of divorce with a view to determine its effects and to recommend measures designed to solve the problems with this, the researchers hope that this work will be of immense benefit to the society,  parents and government.</p> <p>1.3   <strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>Researchers  carried out studies to achieve a ghost or purpose no matter how simple or complex they may be, that is to say, each research is trying to address one problem or the other. The major reason for carrying out this research is to bring about the last settlement between couples so that no inch of misunderstanding could be noticed above all other odds. </p> <p>1.4   <strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>The researchers has decided to limit the areas of coverage to Kaduna metropolis, due to  financial problem and lack of time. Despite the limitations, it is my belief that this research work would be of interest to any reader and lay foundation for further research. </p> <p>1.5   <strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS </strong></p> <p>Research questions as defined by Awotunde et al (1977(, are questions a researcher poses in order to obtain answers which will enable him/her solve the problem investigated. They are used by researchers in break down a problem into it’s specific parts. </p> <p><em>The research question encompasses the followings.</em></p> <p>a.           Unfaithfulness of husband/wife could causes divorce </p> <p>b.          Lack of children could also cause divorce among couples.</p> <p>c.           Lack of money to maintain the family also leads to divorce.</p> <p>d.          Lack of love and constant misunderstanding also contributed to divorce among couples. </p> <p>e.           Different religions is a factor contributing to divorce among couples </p> <p>f.            Also contribute to divorce problem is interference from outsides. </p>\n\nCAUSES AND EFFECT OF MARITAL PROBLEMS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CAUSES AND EFFECT OF MARITAL PROBLEMS", "id": 39}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       </strong><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The concepts of child abuse and child neglect are forms of maltreatment on the child that impedes child survival, development and participation. Children are seen as assets to parents and government because they are human resources that any society can boast of, therefore, parents and government invest in them in order to obtain better tomorrow. This can be achieved however, if their early child socialization is devoid of harmful cultural practices that crippled their chances of survival, development and participation. </p> <p>Ejikeme (1987) defines child abuse as a problem arising from the intention of an adult to carry out an act that is inimical or detrimental to the physical, intellectual, language, emotional, moral and social development of a child; while child neglect which involves some degree of deprivation refers to an intentional failure of an adult to perform physical, cognitive, moral and social development of a child.</p> <p>However, it is imperative to note in this premise that what constitute child maltreatment in one society may not be considered same in another society, this is because of cultural differences an belief, practices. From the above, it will be important to trace the fact that there might be different factors that caused child abuse and neglect since the application of cultural ideology is not universal; that is, it changes across societies. </p> <p>However, different forms of child maltreatment exist like: child trafficking, street begging, street hawking, child discrimination or child preference, early marriage, prostitution, child labour, use of virgin girl-child for ritual/sacrifice etc. despite tangible evidences or empirical indicators of child abuse and neglect, it is difficult to measure. </p> <p>This is so because it is recognized as a major social problem that occurs in all levels of social class, race, religion and ethnic groups. It is important to note that the practice of child abuse and neglect is supported by government indirectly when the individual is seen as a product of the society. </p> <p>Poor socio-economic status of parents trace its roots through unemployment and destitution as government does not address social inequality, unemployment and poverty amongst its citizens, instead people in position work towards actualizing their selfish ends and those who cannot meet the society values through the legitimate means result to deviance and crime as postulated by Robert K. Merton, Alemika and Best (1988) argues that our past successive state Governors/Administrators both military and Politicians, business individuals, foreigners etc who loot billions of Naira from the country’s treasury and precipitate years of economic crisis, political instability etc are hardly arrested, prosecuted nor jailed, instead they are rewarded with Chieftaincy tittles, honorary degrees, ministerial appointments, contracts and the like.</p> <p><strong>1.2       </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Forms of child maltreatment like; child abandonment, child abduction, child trafficking, street begging, street hawking, child labour, prostitution, early marriage and the like, deteriote and cause a total decay of the society. This foster insecurity and anarchy as a result of inadequate means of meeting legitimate goals or values of the society. This jeopardizes not only the immediate children but further endangers our future continuum and a tactical genocidal wipe of humanity since child maltreatment maimed the survival, development and participation of the child.</p> <p><strong>1.3       </strong><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The research at glance intent to critically analyzes, appraises and examines the impact of negative attributes of child abuse and neglect on the individual, families and the society. The specific objectives are:</p> <p>i)             Determine the impact of child abuse and neglect on the child.</p> <p>ii)           Determine the relationship between child abuse, child neglect and crime.</p> <p>iii)          Determine the roles of parents and government in curbing the menace.</p> <p>iv)          Determine the influence of culture in propagating child abuse and neglect.</p> <p>v)            Make appropriate recommendations to the government.</p> <p><strong>1.4       </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Child abuse and child neglect are social problems that affects a significant number of people about which something need to be done. This menace deters technological advancement and waste a lot of wisdom and talents. This study however, would help reduce the number of people affected through adequate mobilization and campaign against this catastrophe. This study would also help in legislating against the catastrophe. This study would provide a data bank that serve as literature for further use by scholars.</p> <p><strong>1.5       </strong><strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study was restricted to Gyel district of Jos south local government area; this is to provide the researcher access to sample a particular target population to ensure meaningful work.</p>\n\nCHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT", "id": 40}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CUSHIONING THE EFFECT OF CULTISM IN NIGERIA TERTIARY INSTITUTION</p> <p> CHAPTER ONE </p> <p><strong>1.1   INTRODUCTION</strong></p><p> Cult according to the longman dictionary of contemporary English is the group of people believing in a particular system of religious worship with its special customs and ceremonies.   Similarly the Oxford advanced learners dictionary of current learning defines same as a system of religious worship especially one that is expressed in ritual.   Generally cultism has been identified as an obvious and problematic issue that prevailed in most social and cultural set up in the world today. Because of its changed nature of operation, it is said to be a religious groups devoted to livings authority, a new teaching or in human practice, ranging in size from few fellowers living under the command of their higher authority to world wide organization directed by a complex chain of command. However, this work “cushioning the effects of cultism in Nigerian tertiary institutions” is concerned with the educational sector that is, how the scenario affects the lives and activities of higher institution of higher learning in Nigeria like the universities, polytechnics, and the college of educations.   Although, cultism in Nigeria tertiary institution started in the 1950`s specifically in the universities of Ibadan where it served as an organized resistance of tyranny and oppression, today it has turned to a deadly and blood thirsty group that has living leaders and promotes new occult or mysterious doctrines.   Apparently, one my be prompted to say that the root of violence in our institution of higher learning came as a result of the dangerous and inhuman dictrine which contributed in making our campuses unstable. Cultism has coursed a lot of unbearable damages on the psyche of innocent students just as the social life in some tertiary institutions has been earnestly marked by terror, crime of different kinds and uneasiness. Live of students, lecturers as well as the management have been stark by this act of anti-social activities all in the guise of cultism. It is more sympathetic and unpleasant that cultism in our various campus today has taken a murderous stand and has become an epidemic to the education sector, which in recent time had led to the distortion of academic calendar and closure of many tertiary institution. A case in point can be traced to the cultism acts in the Olabisi Onobanjo University, Ile-Ife in Ogun State, Obafemi, Awolowo University (OOU) in Ogun state and that of university of Jos Respectively, whose presence has ruined the future of many potential students, lecturers and the management of some institutions. This is because those whom much is invested in are busy fighting and shading the blood of one another as if the campus is a competition floor in which everybody will claim his power.    Nevertheless, the situation has over the years thrown a saddened and piteous mood on the federal government of Nigeria ministry of education. The authorities of this institution themselves and has rendered their efforts useless reviving the sector. Infact, cultism is a bye product or an element of one fall to a lower level in moral and socio-economic order. Consequently, despite the open condemnation of cult activities in the institution of higher learning via the instrument of law and administrative sanctions, the battle appears to be lost to cults doctrines practice   Therefore, this term paper, a thirty (“30”) minutes radio discussion programme in “cushioning the Effect of cultism in Nigeria tertiary institution” will dig deeply into the nature, causes, effect and finally look into the ways out of the given scenario.   <strong>1.2      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PURPOSE </strong> The idea of conducting this works dates to the confusions and restless pressure imposed on some of the Nigerians institutions by this anti-social act (cultism), which resulted to some extent where campuses were unstable and administrative efforts dangling to and fro.     A study of this nature is considered significant in at least three respects namely; personal, social and academic. The study will enable the researcher to sharpen his/her focus, and understanding of the basis of cultism, how it affects the education sector and its immediate and remote solution or recommendations. The study which has its primary aim of exposing the nature of cultism and help to nurture and sustain an atmosphere in which students will function and advance in their chosen pattern of any given social groups with a better understanding of the past. In the light of this, it will help the institutions management and other interest groups to add to their mapped strategies against cultism in order to eliminate it in their sphere of jurisdiction.   Furthermore, this study intended not only to add to the existing body of knowledge about cultism but to also stimulate future researchers in related areas and in brief serve as a reference material for the students, lecturers as well as the management  of concerned institutions.   <strong>1.3   </strong>Although, it is believed that several studies have been done in the area of cultism, but that does not mean that all have been done. As it is often said “No man is an highland” so no man can claim that he/she has accomplished a study on cultism and its relevance solutions because the world and the society we live in is changing every moments.   However, this term paper covers   in term of geographical spread, the education sector especially the universities, polytechnic and colleges of education , because it is the root of any developed and developing country and if therefore left to be ruined by certain groups of individuals, the consequences will not only fall great on the sector but the globe at large.   <strong>1.4   PROGRAMME FORMAT</strong> The term paper takes a thirty (“30”) minutes radio discussion programme and will be featuring four discussants among which are a lecturer, parent and two students of Kaduna Polytechnic. They will be answering questions such as, in few minutes can you justify the nature of the cultism, what are the causes of cultism, what are the effects and the imperative ways of the cultism in Nigeria tertiary institutions.   The programme will start with a sign tone to usher in the presenter. It will take only one break after fifteen (“15”) minutes of discussion for musical time out to ease the discussant and the listeners at home. Moreover, the programme will run out with a signtone fades under the presenter and later boost up to the end of the programme ands fade out completely   <strong>1.5      </strong><strong>THE LIMITATIONS</strong> Basically nothing comes easy or being advantageous without some aches or shortcomings. As such one problem observed in the cause of this work is time constraint. The time available of the researcher disposal is limited and as such hindered any proper research. It   therefore, be noted that the findings of the research may have limited global application </p>\n\nCUSHIONING THE EFFECT OF CULTISM IN NIGERIA TERTIARY INSTITUTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CUSHIONING THE EFFECT OF CULTISM IN NIGERIA TERTIARY INSTITUTION", "id": 41}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT</strong></p> <p><strong>(A CASE STUDY OF KADUNA SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF KADUNA STATE)</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.0   <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1<strong>   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It has been the general assumption that children with reasonable physical care would grow into normal happy adulthood. But scientific investigations of psychologists, sociologist and psychiatrists regarding personality development has uncovered the greater importance of the growing up and its lasting effects on the total personality of a person. Adult personality has its root in childhood. What we can do as adult is largely determined by ways in which we were allowed into experience inevitable events of childhood. </p> <p>Thus the aim of this research work is to shed more light on the issue of child abuse and neglect in Kaduna South Local Government of Kaduna State.</p> <p>A child is neglected when he lacks continues physical and emotional contact with his mother. Children under this category are those may be due to lose of mother or both parents or the separation of both parents, thus child may be sent to nursery school or orphanages with many children which makes it difficult for special individual attention to be rendered to each child. Those children are therefore brought up by stranger which could be changed at different times due to the shift of their study.</p> <p>Child abuse on the other hand can be defined as the portion of harm to children that result from human action or in action that is prescribed, proximate and preventable. The definition recognizes that such harm is no accident but something perpetrated on children by others, usually intestinally and that the actors inflicting this harm do not enjoy society approval. It is also point out that abuse generally come from the child immediate environment and that it is preventable child neglect is a passive form of maltreatment or abuse UNICEF (1986).</p> <p>1.2   <strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</strong></p> <p>Kaduna South Local Government Area was created on 23rd September 1991 by the Babangida’s regime. Hitherto it was part and parcel of Kaduna Local Government. The Local Government Council has its headquarter located at Makera, comprising of two districts namely: Tudun Wada and Makera, each district headed by a district head and supported by village and wards councilors, Kaduna South shares common boundary with Kaduna North to the North West. The two districts share common boundary with the other districts located in the three local government area. Kaduna South has a population of 373,576 as per 2006 census.  </p> <p><strong>Education </strong></p> <p>However, in the education, the area is having about (29) public schools in which (8) primary schools and in Tudun Wada and (13) in Makera and five (5) secondary schools in Tudunwada and three (3) in Makeri. </p> <p>Furthermore, the area is having private nursery/primary and secondary schools approximately one hundred and twenty four (124) i.e. 80 in Tudun Wada and (44) in Makera district. </p> <p>Adult education programmes and constructed apart from the various vocational training centres, run by various organizations like (YMCA). Apart from Kaduna Polytechnic as a higher institution of learning. There is a prison school at Barnawa, Health Institution like the school of Nursing and Midwifery and school of psychiatric Barnawa.   </p> <p>There are over fifty (50) large and small scale industries that abound in the local government and some include, textile, defence corporation, Nigeria Breweries, Peugeot Automobile, KFCC, fertilizer superphosphate, pharmaceutical company, blanket industry just to mention a few. </p> <p>To boost commercial activities in the local government area and the markets and up to R. Tourist attractions and hotels, the council has six (6) tourist areas and about twelve (12) hotels. Kaduna South Local Government areas well connected by road, bridges and railway line system.</p> <p>Thus, the above mentioned geographical, emotional, educational and administrative features taken together given Kaduna South its unique characteristics. It was discover that the habitants have little or no knowledge of what child abuse is. </p> <p>Some with dishes roaming the street and begging for food and aims for certain belief. They were also denied educational pursuit and a child right to decide for themselves what they want to become in future. Without being told, you will see for yourself how little children hawk around from morning till evening for financial support, this researcher strongly, belief is one of the causes of child abuse and neglect because this kind of occupation endangers the child’s life and expose him to hard situation.</p> <p>1.3   <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong></p> <p>The researcher’s concern to delve into the affairs of CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT in Kaduna South Local Government Area of Kaduna State becomes necessary because the record available to this researcher shows that since the creation of Kaduna South from the former Kaduna local government there was not been any necessary attempt for research work into the activities of child abuse and neglect. </p> <p>However, it is widely believed that the good image of any social or community depend largely on the social background of its children. Therefore, the problem of child abuse in the local government has been a total neglect in large extent. A situation brought about probably by the undesirable element in our society mostly associated with women folk and partly perhaps the government who have not given enough attention to the ugly situation in the area but rather sitting on chairs in offices. Based on this, the researcher will seriousness wishes to know the activities to the authority concerned with the affairs of child abuse, towards educating the people of the area and of course suggest ways on how to improve and implements their programme towards making the entire area a conducive place of living. </p> <p>  1.4 <strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The following are the objectives of the study:</p> <p>a.   To identify the factors responsible for child neglect </p> <p>b.  To determine the factors responsible for child neglect</p> <p>c.   To identify the factors responsible for child abuse</p> <p>d.  To determine the rating of the factors responsible for child abuse</p> <p>1.5   <strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The following research question guided the study:</p> <p>a.   The absence of either parent in any family setting can also perhaps bring about child abuse</p> <p>b.  Roaming the street and begging  for food and aims for certain belief will equally bring in child abuse</p> <p>c.   The act of ignorance among the parent will make a child not go to school but hawk all day and that also brings in child abuse</p> <p>d.  The occupational pressure of the working parent is also a contributing factor to child abuse</p> <p>1.6   <strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is the opportunity to do or achieve something which children are being abuse of more to say, production of two many children to the wide world and not taking care of them should be eradicated by family planning to space the recreation of babies.  </p> <p>However, the absence of mother in any family setting can also perhaps bring about child abuse and the study is out in looking for the suitable solution of resolving it, through the government and the societal people to be aware of the child to try to come affection, warmth etc.</p> <p>Finally, the scope of the study is to improve the standard of living  of clued not by seen influence by an absent of one parent and two much of giving birth of babies. </p> <p>The government should Endeavour to encourage agencies to treat such a social ill or evil in the society.</p> <p>1.7   <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is an attempt to provide evidence and identify pattern of child abuse and neglection with a view to offering suggestion and recommendations that will date the level. This study would be of immense value to parents, counseling teachers of low level of educational and children. The finding and suggestion resulting from this study will go along way in helping parent and guidance to know irritating iterance or actions, it have on youth and children or young once which can be economically, psychological or society which will enable parents, adult to adjust in order to ensure smooth development of children.

This sexual relationship has over the years been mixed by various infections known as the sexual transmitted diseases (STDs).</p> <p>These STDs are in various forms and their effects are also different. One among such STDs is Human Immune Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/ AIDS). These two STDs are the most dangerous and ravaging of the STDs.</p> <p>In 1981, HIV the virus of an illness (AIDS),was identified in Los Angeles, USA. In December of the same year, A similar virus was seen in Britain. By March 1987, nearly 6,000 cases were reported throughout Europe. It is one of the most serious health problems in the world today. </p> <p>Though, the origin of HIV/ AIDS is said to be not in Africa, Africa has the highest number of casualties compared to other continents. Nigeria first witnessed the bitter taste of HIV/AIDS was identified in April 1986 in a girl of 13 years. All age groups are affected, but it is higher among the 20-24 years age group, with a national prevalence of 5.6%. This age group is followed by the 25 and 29 years old with a 5.4% national prevalence. And ever since then the number of cases have escalated beyond imagination and millions of Nigerians are living with the disease, in which the cure is yet to be discovered. </p> <p>HIV/AIDS has various symptoms, which includes body weakness, constant and excessive cough, stooling, lost of body weight, rashness etc there are also various means of contacting this disease which may include, sexual relation with an infected person, for example through vaginal intercourse, oral sex and anal sex. Other means of getting infected includes sharing of sharp objects with an infected person, unscreened blood transfusion, mother to child transmission etc. </p> <p>The HIV/AIDS pandemic is said to be a bane on the development of a society Thus, in Nigeria, the scourge has affected the economic population who are supposed to meaningfully contribute to the development of Nigeria. The use of anti – retroviral drugs have given hope to many infected persons for a life even after infection. These drugs are given free and are made available by donor agencies and the federal government in order to curb the number of casualties of the disease. </p> <p>There are number of sensitization and preventive measures that are employed to check the menace of HIV/AIDS pandemic, and these are sex education, use of condoms and media campaigns. This research study is poised to uncover the attitudes of youths towards the HIV/ AIDS pandemic and to ascertain the behaviour of youths towards the various merchandize employed to combat the menace of HIV/AIDS in Niger state and most specifically in Federal University of Technology, Minna.</p> <p>Youths constitutes the highest number of casualties of the disease, So the study chooses the students of the said institution as its research population. It is against this background that this study intends to address the following questions. What is the level of knowledge of students about HIV/AIDS. How prevalent is sexual abstinence among students and especially students of Federal University of Technology Minna. What are the perceptions of students towards Voluntary Counseling and Testing as a factor in the prevention of HIV/ AIDS? What are the attitudes of students towards HIV/ AIDS?</p> <p>1.1            <strong>RESEARCH PROBLEMS </strong></p> <p>Sexual intercourse has led to sexually transmitted infection (HIV/ AIDS) which has led so many especially the youths to an early grave. Youths are not a homogenous population but a diverse group with different risk, needs and access to information and services (UNAIDS 2004).</p> <p>Kabiru et al (2004) reported in a study conducted in a northern Nigerian town that the commonest high risk sexual behaviour among the sexually active university students was having multiple sexual partners (51.7%) followed by the history of sexually transmitted infection, (29.8%) anal sexual intercourse (12.1%) alcohol consumption (12.8%), and intravenous drug use (6.4%).</p> <p>There is evidence of increased sexual activity and high risk behaviours among students in tertiary institutions in Nigeria with high prevalence rate of sexually transmitted infections (HIV/ AIDS), (16.3% and 23%, in the North and South respectively).</p> <p>1.2            <strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE RESEARCH </strong></p> <p>The general objective of this research is to address the perceptions of students towards the prevention of HIV/ AIDS. However, the specific objectives of this research are:</p> <p>-                     To assess students knowledge and attitude towards HIV/ AIDS</p> <p>-                     To examine the various ways of sexual abstinence among university students. </p> <p>-                     To understand the perceptions of students towards prevention method as a factor in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (HIV/ AIDS).</p> <p>1.3            <strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES </strong></p> <p>H1: There is a relationship in the knowledge of HIV/ AIDS and the prevention of the disease.</p> <p>H0: There is no relationship in the knowledge of HIV/ AIDS and  the prevention of the disease. </p> <p>1.4            <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Human Immune deficiency Virus (HIV) and acquire immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has continue to be the major concern not only to Niger state government but the federal government and the entire world. This study may then serve as a pioneer effort towards the understanding of HIV/ AIDS among students of federal university of technology Minna, Niger State. The result of this study may help policy maker’s particularly educational planners in Niger state to design more appropriate instructional programme on HIV/ AIDS. </p> <p>The study may also provide the basis for further research on HIV/AIDS</p> <p>1.5            <strong>RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>§     To what extent has the society try to educate its youth about HIV/AIDS? </p> <p>§     Does economic status and educational background among undergraduates determine students’ knowledge of HV/AIDS? </p> <p>§     Do parents, religious leaders or government responsible for HIV/AIDS among students.</p> <p>1.6            <strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>This research is limited to issues about the knowledge and attitude of students towards HIV/ AIDS in federal university of technology Minna, A convent sampling of 100 students. </p> <p>The research is limited to only undergraduate students of FUT Minna.</p>\n\nKNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDE OF STUDENTS TOWARDS HIV/AIDS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDE OF STUDENTS TOWARDS HIV/AIDS", "id": 44}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>TEENAGE PREGNANCY AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR TEENAGERS </p> <p>(A study of Kaura Local Government Area of Kaduna State.)</p><p> CHAPTER ONE </p> <p><strong>1.0</strong>   <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Baldwin (1950) viewed teenage stage, as a period where reactivation of the `sexual drives that has been inactive during the latency period. He said teenagers are on the boundary between childhood and adulthood and they are faced with the choice of a whole way of life in terms of their job, their ethics and so forth. He further said that to find this in the face of many alternative roles, individuals must decide what they want to do and whether they are able to do it, they must take responsibility for decisions that may shape the rest of their life or destroy it. And to take this independent step, persons need a real sense of identity of their own worth as individuals and their esteem and he said our culture does not make it easy for our teenagers to take this step in life.</p> <p>Watson and Lindgren (1979) gave the definition of a teenager simply as the period or stage of development that separates childhood from adulthood. They said it is also difficult to indicate the limits of a teenager; at what point does it begins and what point does it end, they said the characteristics of a teenager first shows themselves about 10, 11, or 12 years of age with the subtle changes In behaviour and appearance, then it becomes most obvious at puberty with the start of the menstrual cycle in girls.</p> <p>Longman dictionary of contemporary English (1995) gave a definition of pregnancy as the period of time when a woman is pregnant while pregnant on the other hand having an unborn baby growing inside an individuals body. So therefore, teenage pregnancy is a period of time by which a girl is carrying or having an unborn baby growing inside her womb.</p> <p>World Health Organization (2004) opined that a teenager is a person between 15-19 years of age, they said it is a period where an individual is shaped and prepared for adulthood responsibilities they said also that there are advantages and disadvantages of teenage pregnancy or having a baby at ones teenage stage, they went ahead to say that when you are younger the benefits are usually associated with greater fertility a more healthy pregnancy and a quicker recovery after birth. But the down side is that your social life, education and training can be severely disrupted just when it might be taking off into an interesting direction. Moreso, they said some teenagers are much more capable of looking  after a child than the older women because late motherhood or late pregnancy has a greater risk of complications in the pregnancy and reduce fertility. Being older, they said can also be more exhausting looking after growing children.</p> <p>1.1   <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM </strong></p> <p>This study was concerned with the advantages and disadvantages of teenage pregnancy in Kaura Local Government Area of Kaduna State. For clarity of purposes:-</p> <p>-                     Teenage girls do not have adequate knowledge of protecting themselves from unwanted pregnancy.</p> <p>-                     Given them out in marriage early and then using the benefits they get from the girls husband to train their male children in school.</p> <p>-                      Their male counterparts taken advantage of them by abusing them sexually. </p> <p>-                     Leaving school because of unwanted pregnancy. </p> <p>-                     Giving them out in marriage early to prevent them from prostituting.</p> <p>-                     Getting pregnant even when their reproductive organs have not fully developed.</p> <p>1.2   <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>Teenage pregnancy has continued to be a major concern not to Kaduna teenage girls only but also to Nigeria at large. This study may then serve as a pioneer efforts towards the understanding of teenage pregnancy to Kaura Local Government  Area. The result of the study may help policy makers particularly, educational planners in Kaduna State to design more appropriate instructional Programmes on teenage pregnancy.</p> <p>The result of the study may also help to highlight some of the diseases that are associated with teenage pregnancy like Vesico Virgina Fistular (VVF) and Rector Virgina fistular (RVF). The study may also provide the basis for further research on teenage pregnancy. </p> <p>1.3   <strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS </strong></p> <p>-                     Teenage pregnancies occur as a result of relationship with older male counterparts.</p> <p>-                     Free assess to pornographic films without the presence of adult guidance on sex education.</p> <p>-                     Are there adequate knowledge and proper guidance on teenage pregnancy. </p> <p>-                     Are there any benefits and dangers of teenage pregnancy to teenage girls and the society at large.</p> <p>-                     Does cultural upbringing and religious inclination affect teenage pregnancy. </p> <p>-                     Does teenage pregnancy affect young girls performance in school.</p> <p>1.4   <strong>DELIMITATION</strong> </p> <p>At the time of the study there were a thousand staff working with Kaura local government area.

The problem of inequality in employment being one of the most pressing issues today, in order to examine this situation, one must try to get to the root of the problem and must understand the sociological factors that cause women to have a much more difficult time getting the same benefit, wages and job opportunities as their male counterpart. The society in which we live has been shaped historically makes the policy makers have consistently been male and it is important to examine all facts of the problem, but in order to fully tackle the issue on most recognize that this inequality in the work force is rooted in what shape future employees and employers – education. The research work will examine the inequalities in policy, actual teaching situations, admission to post-secondary institution, hiring and job benefits and wages, the situation will also tackle was is being done to solve this problem and what can be done to remedy the situation.</p> <p>Monrovia Street is an area situated in Ungwan Rimi Gabasawa ward under Kaduna North Local Government with a total of least populated area in Gabasawa ward which is more or less like a GRA consist of civil servants, students and businessmen and women etc. the population has made up different tribe such as Hausa, Yoruba, Gwari, Igbo, Nupe, Katab, etc.</p> <p>Those living in Monrovia are predominantly civil servants that is 80% of people are said to have gainfully employed either by government or private sectors. And of 20% of them are engaged in commercial activities ranging from trading, tailoring, hair dressing, etc out of which 15% where engaged by men only 5% is engaged by women base on the research.</p> <p>I found that women were left behind in time of gainful employment as well as commercial activities in the area. In view of above a lot is expected to be done to bridge the gap between the two genders.</p> <p>1.2    <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Men and Women are both equal and both play vital roles in the creation and development of their families in particular and the society in general indeed; the struggle for legal equality has been one of the major concerns of women movement all over the world. Therefore, the sense of insecurity, humiliation and helplessness always keep a woman mum our whole socialization in such that for any unsuccessful marriage which results the who is held responsible. Cultural beliefs and traditions that discriminate against women may be officially discredited but they continued to flourish at the grassroots level, this has been main of this research work.</p> <p>1.3    <strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>1.      To find out factors responsible for low employment opportunities of women.</p> <p>2.      To find out the effort of Government towards reducing gender inequality.</p> <p>3.      To examine the implication of gender inequality in the society.</p> <p>1.4    <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>A research of this nature has to do with gender issues must be of great significance. Gender inequality in terms of employment opportunities, home management and other issues are very critical. Therefore, this research will be of significance in the following areas:</p> <p>1.           The project work is one of the basic requirements for the award of National Diploma in Social Development.</p> <p>2.           It is expected to provide solutions to the problem of gender inequality generally and specifically in employment opportunities.</p> <p>3.           Considering the roles played by human in home and nation building, if genders imbalances are corrected using the recommendation of this research, the nation would be greater, this is another significance.</p> <p>4.           Researchers may find this work as a foundation for further research.</p> <p>5.           Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) may find the research work and its recommendation very useful.</p> <p>1.5    <strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1.      What are the factors responsible for low employment opportunities of women?</p> <p>2.      What are the efforts of government towards reducing gender inequality?</p> <p>3.      What are the implications of gender inequality in the society?</p> <p>1.6    <strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In carrying out the research work, the researcher chose Monrovia Street as area of study and focused on gender inequality on women employment opportunities restricted the finding in the above area.</p> <p>And most of whom he asked question were women because they are most hit by poverty and vitracy and dominated in terms of wages, salaries and other commercial activities.</p> <p>In view of the above, the researcher promoted to focus more attention on women in order to find out why the inequality exist and look for a way to find solution and unless something various is done by the government to control the problem.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF GENDER INEQUALITY ON WOMEN EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY (A STUDY OF MONROVIA STREET, UNGUWAN RIMI – KADUNA)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF GENDER INEQUALITY ON WOMEN EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY (A STUDY OF MONROVIA STREET, UNGUWAN RIMI – KADUNA)", "id": 46}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE EFFECT OF STREET HAWKING AMONG TEENAGE GIRLS</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Nigeria, the most populous black nation in the world with an estimated population of about 140 million people (2006, Census), is endowed with abundant human and natural resources like oil, tin, limestone, zinc, natural gas, good vegetation  and climate which varies from being equatorial in the South, tropical in the centre and arid in the north. This great country, 3rd world largest producer of crude oil has about 5.3% annual growth rate but it is estimated that 70% of Nigerians live in poverty (Tola, 2008). </p> <p>The above features are legacies of decades of prolonged military rules coupled with mis-management and corruption, which have daily impoverished the people and made them “beggers” of a sort amidst plenty. This act of misrule has increased anti-social behaviour amongst the populace. Sadly, the quest for material wealth at all cost has introduced a new dimension of wealth creation into the psyche of Nigerians-which  is street hawking. </p> <p>Street hawking is the third largest criminal activity in the world after arms and drug trafficking (Tola, 2008). In the last decade, the phenomenon of street hawking has considerably increased throughout the world and most especially in Nigeria. Every year, million of individuals, mostly female are misled by decot or forced to submit to servitude. </p> <p>The UN convention Against Transnational orgainsed crime (2000) defined street hawking as follows; “the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, of abuse of power, giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation” “exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs”</p> <p>ANPPCAN (2010) sees street hawking as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, habouring or receipt of female by means of threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power, a position of vulnerability or the giving or receiving of payments, benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over the child for the pupose of exploitation. </p> <p>Research evidence shows that female are trafficked for the purpose of domestic services, prostitution and other forms of exploitative labour (UNICEF, 2007). These has been  a serious concern about the cause of street hawking in Africa as a whole and Nigeria as a country in particular. </p> <p>UNICEF (2007) has identified poverty, large family size, rapid urbanization among others as the major factor why many Nigeria female are vulnerable to trafficking. Parents with large family are often prone to those traffickers deceit in giving away some of their female to city residents or even strangers promising a better life for them. Trafficking deprives child victims the privilege to exercise their wide range of rights, including the right to belong and identify, the right to freedom, education among others. ANPPCAN(2010). </p> <p>As a result of this, the study on the causes, effects and remedies of street hawking in Nigeria is worth pursuing. It is hoped that the findings of this study will provide  meaningful information as to the stoppage of the act in Nigeria and Africa as a whole. </p> <p>Female living in rural areas in Nigeria often lack access to quality education, good health and other basic needs which make their parents to entrust them in the hands of other family members who are financially upright to help them train their female.</p> <p>However, this custom has been abused by those family members or relatives because of the exposure of these female to hazardous work, prostitution and other forms of inhuman activities. </p> <p>This act posses a serious challenges to the growth of the Nigerian society, economically, socially and politically. </p> <p><strong>1.2     Purpose of the Study </strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is:</p> <p>i.        To look at the origin and development of street hawking  in Nigeria </p> <p>ii.       To examine the causes of street hawking in Nigeria </p> <p>iii.      To analyse the effects of street hawking in Nigeria, socially, politically and economically </p> <p>iv.      To profer solutions to the problems of street hawking in Nigeria. </p> <p><strong>1.3     Significance of the Study </strong></p> <p>This study will be of great importance, as it will provide necessary information on the causes, effects and remedies to street hawking in Nigeria. It will also provide further research in combating trafficking in Nigeria. The study will also be useful for further purposes and for further researches into street hawking within and outside the country. </p> <p><strong>1.4     Scope and Limitation of the Study </strong></p> <p>The study will be restricted to the causes and effects of street hawking in Nigeria. Solution to the problems of street hawking will also be sought in the cause of this research. This research focuses on the causes, effects and remedies of street hawking in Nigeria but due to finance, time and other factors. </p> <p><strong>1.5     Operational Definition of Terms </strong></p> <p>Child:  Child in this study means any person less than eighteen years of age</p> <p>Trafficking: The recruitment, transfer, harbouring, or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation.</p> <p><br/></p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF STREET HAWKING AMONG TEENAGE GIRLS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF STREET HAWKING AMONG TEENAGE GIRLS", "id": 47}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY SOCIAL WORKERS IN SOCIAL WORK PRACTICE</strong></p> <p><strong><em>(A case study of Selected social welfare centres)</em></strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0     </strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Although social work practice in Nigerian is gradually growing group, the rate of development acceptance of any reformation is very slow, social work is still growing in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>For years now, social work practice department in this country, had laid make emphasis on the correction of juvenile delinquents and vagrants, and sometimes organizers of youth clubs/association and sports, in fact this is part of their work but the function of social welfare department is to help the poor and the needy in their bit to survivor, it is also to help problems that brought about by environment of social change.</p> <p>The welfare are therefore, meant toward those who cannot meet up with the challenges (new social changes), there are several services offered in the state and these include conciliation rehabilitation and general welfare, these includes married couples with marital problems, victims of mental and physical distress or handicapped etc. others includes services for children  is of service to children with social workers, investigation are carried out by social workers with the aim of helping the court to determine the type of treatments to be made. The social welfare agency also are responsible for looking after abandoned babies and making proper arrangement to find foster parents for them or placing them in children’s home services to family in distress is another and these involves family case work practice. The social workers tries to discourage family disintegration and endeavour when ever possible i.e. to affect matrimonial reconciliation, this involves many persuasion and many difficulties are often encountered, service for the handicapped, disable person and baggers and these also mainly rehabilitate the unfortunate people.</p> <p>At present there are five rehabilitation centres in Kaduna state the centres and were they are situated are Kakuri, Barnawa, Sabon Tasha and Magajin Gari, within Kaduna metropolis, to the low recognition or piece meal given to social welfare services department in this country social workers can not provide these above mentioned services. Effectively thus most of our social policy and planning fails.</p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>This research work is from observation and interaction with the staffs at the agency (social welfare magin gari Kaduna state) during my SIWES attachment and it became evidence that in the agency, work is slow, cases that suppose to be brought to social welfare are been taken to the police, also  there is need for workshops and seminars.</p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>The study is restricted to finding out the problems encountered by social workers in social work practice. The study limits the collection  of data to selected social welfare centre magajin gari and social welfare office magajin gari and also the social welfare office sabon tasha Kaduna state.</p> <p>The findings of this study was gotten from observation and interaction with staffs of the agency during my industrial training fund (I.T.F) attachment social development encompasses, child welfare, rehabilitation etc. but it will only focus on the problems encountered by social workers in social work practice.</p> <p><strong>1.4     </strong><strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES </strong></p> <p>The general objectives of this study is to identify the problems encountered by social workers in social work practice in magajin gari, local government social welfare office Kaduna and social welfare office Sabon Tasha Kaduna state.</p> <p>The specific objectives includes</p> <p>1.          To find out the range of service rendered by the agency</p> <p>2.          To identify the problems with which the staffs of the agency had to contend</p> <p>3.          To determine how client were informed about the agency and the type of problems the brought to the agency and whether the got the help or not.</p> <p>4.          To know what strategies one could adopt to enhance the services</p> <p><strong>1.5     </strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1.          What are the range of services rendered by the social welfare agencies</p> <p>2.          what are the problems encountered by the staffs in the social welfare agency (magajin gari and sabon tasha)</p> <p>3.          what are the problems been brought by client to the social welfare agency? And are these problem properly solve?</p> <p><strong>1.6     </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>The pattern of social welfare work in Nigeria has witnessed many changes in the last decade. The inexperience men previously see social welfare agency as rendering family services alone such as children maintenance allowance. Child dispate and maltreatment or handling wives by their respective husbands. But due to rapid public awareness, many stored appreciating the scope of the services rendered by the agency. These include among others, child care, hospital services, probation, family welfare, youth and prison welfare services respectively.</p> <p>This project will enable the authority concerned and the populace to understand and appreciate the importance and problems encountered by the social welfare agencies in this country.</p> <p>The social workers will benefit from these study in the source that it will help and make them know were they are lacking behind.</p>\n\nTHE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY SOCIAL WORKERS IN SOCIAL WORK PRACTICE (A CASE STUDY OF SELECTED SOCIAL WELFARE CENTRES)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY SOCIAL WORKERS IN SOCIAL WORK PRACTICE (A CASE STUDY OF SELECTED SOCIAL WELFARE CENTRES)", "id": 48}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC CORRELATION OF FEMALE CRIMINALITY IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p><strong>[A CASE STUDY OF KADUNA PRISON]</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.0    <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Traditionally, it has been argued that there has been so little research interested in the area of female criminality due to the fact that the number of females offenders have been so small and insignificant. But statistics alone is not sufficient to explain why female offenders are not treated as a social problem, (Smart Carol, 1976). If women are for some reasons less prone to participate in deviant activities than men, there is hardly a reason to omit them from consideration (Giddens 1997).</p> <p>The non-challant attitudes towards the investigation of female criminality could be that the male gender has always been associated with criminal acts.</p> <p>Male criminals such as terrorists, drug users etc are treated as rational, autonomous adults who have reasons for engaging in deviant or anti-social activities. Thus, a female thief is mentally unbalanced or her chemistry is disturbed or her husband made her to do it (Delmont 1980).</p> <p>However, recent researchers like Giddens, Datesman, and Scarpiti have shown that women also commit criminal acts. Most of what we know about crime is based on prosecutions and convictions and it is not impossible that women commit large number of crimes for which they are not persecuted or convicted. </p> <p>1.1       <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Female criminality and delinquency are becoming more serious and more of a threat to the social order in Nigeria. The rate at which women are involved in criminal activities makes one stop to wonder what is really happening to the women folk. </p> <p>Women are known to occupy the natural position in inculcating moral values in children, but with the rising trend in involvement of women in criminal activities, one is left to wonder the kind of future generation we will have as the engagement of the women is criminal activities makes them fail in carrying out their roles as the guardians of morality in our society.</p> <p>For example, what would a mother with criminal tendencies do to her children or wards who indulge in criminal activities, since she is into it herself? Of course she’ll not see anything bad in what the children or wards do, thus crime permeates the whole society.</p> <p><strong>1.2    GROWTH OF FEMALE CRIMINALITY</strong>  </p> <p>According to  Hauwau E. Yusuf, (2002) The general socio-economic condition that nurtured the increase in crime rates generally in the post independence era equally have the necessary impetus for the growth of female criminality in the country. Prior to that and amongst other factors, the difficulty in securing farmland in the rural areas brought about the migration of women to the urban centers. However, with the oil boom; this took a new dimension. It could be recalled that this phenomenon induced the expansion of the urban wage sector. The doubling of urban areas in the space of few years seemed to offer women more opportunities and hope for a better future. In addition to this, increased money in circulation in the urban areas have woman with no formal education the opportunity to take out a living form trading. What is more, expansion of infrastructure and the need for more manpower in the oil dominated economy resulted in women, who had formal education finding some employment in both the public and private sectors as clerical workers, secretaries, nurses and teachers. They even found their way into jobs which were exclusively male preserved such as lawyers, journalists, administrators, university teachers etc. (Oloruntimein, 1982). These increased opportunities, though still low when compared with those of men, contributed to the growth of female criminality. Inspite of this, it must be stressed that women formed a large chunk of temporary workers and are the first to be laid off in times of economic crisis and refreshment. Majority of them are employed in the service sector (both public and private), with only a minority employed in the manufacturing industry like pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food processing companies. They equally man the pumps at petrol stations, sorting of mails in post offices, cooking and serving the food at restaurants. (Hauwau E. Yusuf, 2002)</p> <p><strong>1.3       </strong><strong>Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The general objective of the study was to describe the extend and type of female involvement in crime and analyse the types of crime in which women have been most visible. Specifically the study tried to:-</p> <p>                     i.        Determine the socio-economic attributes of women in crime.</p> <p>                   ii.        Identify factor predisposing women to criminality </p> <p>                 iii.        access if there is discernible pattern in the type of crime committed by women.</p> <p>                 iv.        Make recommendation on the reduction or elimination of female criminality. </p> <p><strong>1.4       </strong><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The importance of the study is to redirect the line of explanation of female criminality. One does not need to be a feminist to assert that we live in a male dominated world. This is even more so far African were the  image of the male still loom large in perception of issues, action and even the nature and type of research to be conducted. There is no saying that apart from most researches being male influenced, they are equally male dominated, with issue relating to women relegated to the background or taking a second place after those of the men.</p> <p>However, even in the advance and industrialization nation of the world most especially in America, until recently, very little had been written about female offenders. What is more, fewer degree of advancement in education and intellectual development such nations are just focusing their search lit on involvement of female in crime, then for underdeveloped (developing countries like Nigeria, one would expect that  such effort is also in its formative stage. Therefore, a research of nature is justified in other to fill the obvious gap in the attention paid to female criminality particularly in relation to the available current literature and how the prevailing condition in the society could lead to female criminality.(Hauwau E.Yusuf,2002).      </p>\n\nTHE SOCIO-ECONOMIC CORRELATION OF FEMALE CRIMINALITY IN NIGERIA [A CASE STUDY OF KADUNA PRISON]<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC CORRELATION OF FEMALE CRIMINALITY IN NIGERIA [A CASE STUDY OF KADUNA PRISON]", "id": 49}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE EFFECTS OF DRUG ABUSE ON STUDENTS ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IN BENUE STATE UNIVERSITY, MAKURDI</strong></p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The study examines the effects of drug abuse on the academic performance of Benue State University students.

{"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>REHABILITATION OF EX-CULTISTS IN TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS</strong></p> <p>Cultism and its attendant problems have assumed a threatening dimension in recent times in the Nigerian society.  More disturbing is the fact that cultism cuts across all facets of the society, including the educational institutions in the country.  The immediate consequence is that the Nigerian universities, polytechnics, colleges of education and secondary schools have become centres of violence, instead of centres of learning that they were hitherto known for.  Indeed, some scholars like Gimba Abubakar (2002) commenting on the deteriorating standards of tertiary education referred to cult activities in the universities as offering \"Bachelor of Science\" in violence and \"Master of Administration\" in cultism.<br/>This situation prompted Eneji (1996) to have remarked that \"almost every passing day, there are new stories of devilish acts perpetuated by secret cults on campuses\".  He added further that from the universities to polytechnics, colleges of education and other tertiary institutions of learning come stories of violence, torture and unwarranted intimidation executed by members of secret cults.<br/>It is common place to see that most Nigerian newspapers and magazines have become \"bulletin boards\" for reporting the daily exploits of members of secret cults.  In fact, tertiary institutions are now breeding ground for cultists operations.  Within the framework of cultism, justice is replaced with \"Jungle Justice\", peace by tales of horror, love by brutality.  Intimidation, tortures and extortions abound and morality seems to have been driven into outright decadence.  In the same way, academic excellence has been relegated to the background.  Unfortunately, all efforts to tackle the social menace, cultism in Nigerian tertiary institutions, especially in Delta State have defied all solutions.  The efforts of the Government and the managements of this citadel of learning are like putting off the fire without identifying the sources of the fire.<br/>Cult clashes in Delta State tertiary institutions have often led to the destruction of lives and property, brutal rapes, maiming and kidnapping.  They have been a major threat to the effective pursuit of academics in the institutions of higher learning in Delta State and beyond.<br/>The ravaging problem posed by cultism brings to the fore the numerous social problems that characterize modern and traditional societies like ours and this culminate to efforts by sociologists and other related professionals coming up to proffer solutions to the unpleasant socio-cultural conditions which tend to have unpleasant consequences for humanity.<br/>Taking a clue from the above analysis, cultism could be well described as a social menace due to its associated morally questionable conducts - murder, prostitution, rape and sexual harassment, armed robbery, etc.<br/>Cultism as manifested in secret cults is a set of practices, beliefs or ideas whose essence is known only to members and exclusively admired and dependent upon by many, even to the extent that members would want to lay down their lives.  It is this doggedness of members that reinforces the importance of and awe of the group, especially among non-members.<br/>Honestly speaking, cults membership involves close group membership such as the Ogboni secret cult among the Yoruba of the South Western Nigeria, now the Refined Ogboni Fraternity, Ekpe secret cult among the Efiks of the Southern part of Nigeria, Asigidi found in the Benin Area of Edo State, etc. with their different ways of carrying out their activities in their area of jurisdiction.  The most disheartening thing is that what is happening in the larger society has been transferred into the tertiary institutions in Nigeria and the Delta State axis in particular.<br/>This social dynamism has caused a social disorganization, intellectual stagnation, and a crimogenic society where anxiety and fear of the unknown stand in the way of capacity building and national development.<br/>The quest to curb the attended problem of cultism has led to the identification of several causal factors such as government ineptitude, poor family background, staunched self development and social disorganization in all facets of life.<br/>In the past different efforts have been made by government, non-governmental organizations and managements of tertiary institutions to bring order to cultists activities on campuses.  However, all these strategies adopted by these responsible bodies have proved moderate success as cultists' activities in Delta State tertiary institutions have become more sophisticated and unpredictable with the glaring challenge of rehabilitating those ex-cultists who renounced their membership in their different cults.<br/>The issue that captures the minds of sociologists and other professionals is whether we should fold our hands and pretend not to see these promising youths who have renounced cult membership rot away, or should we ignore those ex-cultists to their fate?<br/><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong><br/>Ex-cultists in tertiary institutions suffer some psychological setbacks in relation to their fellow students on campuses.  Initially, at the time of initiation and active participation in cult's activities, they were on top of the world.  They were terrorists to their schoolmates and victims but with the new change of status as ex-cultists, their power and influence begins to dwindle.  They sometimes feel alienated from their old friends and sometimes feared to be victimized by opposition camps and even their former cult members.<br/>Some of the envisaged problems faced by ex-cultists are given below:</p> <ol><li>They are unable to think critically and logically.</li> <li>They are sometimes prey and victims of cults members and opposition camps.</li> <li>They suffer from fear due to impaired thinking and consequently anxiety of the unknown.</li> <li>Inability to do well in academics and other areas of life due to threats from former cult members.</li> <li>Loss of respect and identity among their school mates.</li> <li>Inability of school management to cater for their traumatic and psychological problems.</li> <li>They suffer from emotional stress.</li> <li>They are unable to be well re-integrated into the academic community.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Objectives of Study</strong><br/>This study is aimed at investigating the impact of cultic activity on higher institutions of learning and how rehabilitation efforts have impacted on ex-cultists.  However, these objectives are outlined below:</p> <ol><li>To explain the psychological and social dynamics common to cultic environment.</li> <li>To help individuals who are ex-cultists to return to emotional and psychological stability.</li> <li>To help the student or ex-cultist to return to social stability through a reintegration programme.</li> <li>To examine the causes of cultism in tertiary institutions.</li> <li>To trace the historical antecedent, of cultism in tertiary institutions.</li> <li>To recommend measures to curb the menace of cultism in tertiary institutions.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Research Questions</strong><br/>In order to have a proper grasp of the study, the following questions need to be asked:</p> <ol><li>Does ex-cultists reason or think logically?</li> <li>Are ex-cultists victims of violence from former cult members and opposition cults?</li> <li>Are ex-cultists predisposed to fear of the unknown?</li> <li>Is the poor academic performance of ex-cultists due to fear from former cult members?</li> <li>Do ex-cultists loose respect from their school mates?</li> <li>Does school management cater adequately for the traumatic and psychological needs of ex-cultists?</li> <li>Do ex-cultists suffer from emotional stress?</li> <li>Does the rehabilitation efforts of management yields proper integration into the academic community.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Assumptions</strong><br/>The following assumptions are developed to enable the researcher to critically examine the subject matter:</p> <ol><li>Low academic performance is directly related to ex-cultist membership of secret cult.</li> <li>Aggressive behaviour is directly related to membership of secret cults.</li> <li>Individuals from defective family background are more prone to membership of secret cult.</li> <li>There is relationship between the rehabilitation efforts of school management and ex-cultists in tertiary institutions.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Scope and Limitation of Study</strong><br/>This study is carried out within the confines of tertiary institutions in Delta State.  The choice for this boundary is due to the fact that the situations in Delta State University Campuses located at Abraka and Oleh, Delta State Polytechnic at Ozoro, Oghara and Ogwachuku , Delta State College of Education at Agbor, and Warri and other citadel of higher learning. However, the situation is not different from other universities or colleges nationwide but due to time and financial constraints, the focus shall be at the three campuses of Delta state University situated at Abraka. <br/><strong>Significance of the Study</strong><br/>The research work is directed at contributing to knowledge in all citadel of learning.  The following are the relevance:</p> <ol><li>The study will show the relationship that exist between cults activities and Nigerian students.</li> <li>It will also indicate whether the activities of cultists on the students have been more relevant or otherwise.</li> <li>It shall also make recommendations on areas where necessary to improve the lots of the Nigerian students.</li> <li>The recommendations of this study shall be useful to counselors in all respect to students' life.</li> <li>It shall be of immense benefit to government ministries, agencies and other non-governmental organizations involved on the intervention and prevention of cultism in Nigerian universities and other colleges of learning.</li> <li>It shall also be used for the rehabilitation of ex-cultists who have renounced their membership of secret cults.</li> <li>This study shall also be an eye-opener to fresh undergraduates in higher institutions.</li> <li>The study shall also serve as a guide to psychologists who are involved in the rehabilitation of ex-cultists.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Research Methodology</strong><br/>This encompasses the sources of data and data analysis.</p> <p><strong>Sources of Data</strong><br/>The data for this study shall be collected from primary and secondary sources.  In the case of the former, the researcher shall randomly distribute 200 Questionnaire to the three campuses of Delta State University, Abraka.<br/>In each questionnaire, 20 questions shall be asked and the questionnaire shall be collected the same day.<br/>On the other hand, secondary sources of data shall be based on unpublished and published documents, journals and related literature which shall be sought from the library, and internet.<br/><strong>Data Analysis</strong><br/>The data collected shall be presented orderly for proper analysis.  The completed and answered questionnaire shall be analyzed using the quantitative research method.<br/>In addition, this document and relevant literatures shall be well analyzed in concomitant with the data so collected.</p>\n\nREHABILITATION OF EX-CULTISTS IN TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " REHABILITATION OF EX-CULTISTS IN TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS", "id": 51}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong><strong>FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT AMONG PARENTS IN IKA SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF DELTA STATE</strong></strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p> <strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Ika South is a Local Government Area of Delta State, Nigeria. Its headquarters are in the town of Agbor. It has an area of 436km2 and a population of 62,594 (Onyeche, 2012).</p> <p>Child abuse and neglect is a social and public health problem in Nigeria, as well as a children’s rights issue. Abuse and neglect can lead to a wide range of adverse consequences for children and young people. There is generally not a single factor that results in the abuse or neglect of a child; it is usually a combination of various factors. In addition, the duration (such as the duration of an illness) or intensity (such as the level of drug or alcohol abuse) can make it more or less likely that a child will be at risk for abuse (Aber and Cicchetti, 2014).</p> <p>Child abuse is a term used for maltreatment and neglect of children. Child maltreatment may be formally described as: …all forms of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect or negligent treatment or commercial or other exploitation, resulting in actual or potential harm to the child’s health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust or power (Woodhouse, 2011).</p> <p>Child neglecton the other hand is generally seen as a different phenomenon from maltreatment. Child neglect may be defined as: “any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caregiver, which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation, or an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm” (Culp, 2011). Neglect is in many ways the more insidious harm against a child, with long-term effects at least as damaging as physical abuse (if not more so) but often going unnoticed (Bloom, 2011).</p> <p>The term <strong>‘</strong>child abuse and neglect’ refers to the harm experienced by children or young people under the age of 18 yearsas a result of the actions, inactions or inability of people with a parental responsibility for them (Sylvestre and Mérette, 2010). Parental responsibility in relation to a child means all the duties, powers, responsibilities and authority which, by law, parents have in relation to children (Greenfield, 2010). The harm experienced by the child or young person may arise from a significant event or may arise from the cumulative effect of abuse and neglect. Most parents love their children, but when stress, tiredness, lack of skills, information and support combine it can be overwhelming (Drotar, 2012).</p> <p>It is certain that no child is ever to blame for abuse inflicted on him or her by an adult. There may be no ‘child’ factors present at all when a child is abused. However the risk of abuse of a child may be increased if the child has attributes that make parenting more difficult or has high needs. Relevant factors might include being a premature baby, persistently crying, being one of a multiple birth, and/or having behavioural or mental health problems (Rosenbaum, 2011).</p> <p>Some children may be vulnerable because of emotional difficulties they have that both reflect and exacerbate social isolation. The resulting cognitive and emotional deficits serve as signals of vulnerability and/or interfere with their self-protective skills outside the home (Vissing, 2012). Thus, some children are victimised again and again. Cognitive and emotional deficits resulting from sustained abuse (including family violence) or neglect at home may increase the risk of a vicious circle of victimisation outside the home as well. Thus, for example, experiences such as loss, conflict, deprivation or turmoil within the home may undermine a child’s ability to protect themselves, making them a potential target for bullies or sexual predators (Abram, 2010).</p> <p>Low educational attainment of caregivers has been identified as a risk factor for child maltreatment and neglect (Berger, 2010) and is also associated with poverty. Hence poverty (especially when compounded with other risks such as sole parenthood), low educational attainment and maltreatment can set up a cycle whereby one perpetuates the other (Jacobson, 2010). As with other risk factors, the strength of the relationship between low educational attainment and neglect and maltreatment is unclear, as are the causal pathways. Low educational attainment can both reflect and contribute to disadvantage including precarious employment and low income. Lack of education may also mean a parent has less understanding of issues associated with parenting, or has limited ability to learn themselves (Twardosz and Lutzker, 2010).</p> <p>A further widely recognised stressor is sole parenthood (Alessandri, 2011). Two factors appear to contribute to sole parenthood as a stressor and risk factor for children: the first is the strong link between sole parent households and poverty, especially reliance on benefit income (Chaffin, 2011) although, due to the loss of the absent parent’s wage-earning power, “the majority of single-parent, female-headed families [are driven] into poverty, <em>regardless of whether the mother works</em>.” [emphasis added] (Bloom, 2011); the other is that sole parenthood may be associated with lack of family or community-based support networks. And a sole parent is doing the work of two people. While support provided to mothers is significantly associated with them being able to provide support for their children, there is no evidence that lack of support and/or wider family dysfunction necessarily leads to maltreatment (Aber and Cicchetti, 2014).</p> <p>Child abuse occurs in every country in the world, and despite considerable efforts and resources, rates of maltreatment and neglect in developed countries have not markedly diminished, nor are researchers much closer to being able to assess which children are at risk, and what programmes effectively change long-term behaviour so as to prevent maltreatment (Berger, 2010).</p> <p>Child abuse and neglect have immediate and long-term consequences. In addition to negatively impacting on the child, child abuse and neglect impacts on the family, the school community, and even future generations. The ability to survive and thrive in the face of child abuse and neglect depends on a variety of factors, including the extent and type of abuse or neglect, whether it was continual or infrequent, the age of the child when abuse was initiated, the child’s relationship to the abuser, and how the abuse or neglect was responded to if discovered or disclosed. Outcomes are also dependent on the child’s personality traits, inner strength, and the support the child receives from those around them (Berger, 2015).</p> <p> Neglected children are also at considerable risk. These children are more likely than other children to suffer from a serious physical injury due to an accident such as falling, drowning, fire, or ingesting poison. They are also at a greater risk than other children of being physically and sexually abused from an unrelated caretaker, often times a significant other or friend of their parent(s) (Berger, 2010).</p> <p>It is important to note that some children will not develop behavioral problems, so it cannot be assumed that a lack of behavioral problems is evidence against child abuse or neglect. When there are behavioral problems as a result of child abuse and neglect, they will most likely be related to difficulty following rules, being respectful, staying in their seats and keeping on-task, temper tantrums, and difficult peer relationships. As children become older they are more likely to engage in self (Woodhouse, 2011).</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Many child deaths, however, are not routinely investigated and postmortem examinations are not carried out, which makes it difficult to establish the precise number of fatalities from child abuse in Ika South Local Government Area of Delta State. There are problems in properly recognizing cases of infanticide and measuring their incidence. Significant levels of misclassification in the cause of death as reported on death certificates have been found, for example, in Ika South Local Government Area of Delta State. Deaths attributed to other causes – for instance, sudden infant death syndrome or accidents have often been shown on reinvestigation to be homicides.</p> <p>Despite the apparent widespread misclassification, there is general agreement that fatalities from child abuse are far more frequent than official records suggest in Ika South Local Government Area of Delta State where studies of infant deaths have been undertaken.</p> <p>Among the fatalities attributed to child abuse, the most common cause of death is injury to the head, followed by injury to the abdomen. Intentional suffocation has also been extensively reported as a cause of death. Injuries inflicted by a caregiver on a child can take many forms. Serious damage or death in abused children is most often the consequence of a head injury or injury to the internal organs. Head trauma as a result of abuse is the most common cause of death in young children, with children in the first 2 years of life being the most vulnerable. Because force applied to the body passes through the skin, patterns of injury to the skin can provide clear signs of abuse. The skeletal manifestations of abuse include multiple fractures at different stages of healing, fractures of bones that are very rarely broken under normal circumstances, and characteristic fractures of the ribs and long bones.</p> <p>One of the syndromes of child abuse is the ‘‘battered child’’. This term is generally applied to children showing repeated and devastating injury to the skin, skeletal system or nervous system. It includes children with multiple fractures of different ages, head trauma and severe visceral trauma, with evidence of repeated infliction. Fortunately, though the cases are tragic, this pattern is rare.</p> <p>Children may be brought to professional attention because of physical or behavioural concerns that, on further investigation, turn out to result from sexual abuse. It is not uncommon for children who have been sexually abused to exhibit symptoms of infection, genital injury, abdominal pain, constipation, chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections or behavioural problems. To be able to detect child sexual abuse requires a high index of suspicion and familiarity with the verbal, behavioural and physical indicators of abuse. Many children will disclose abuse to caregivers or others spontaneously, though there may also be indirect physical or behavioural signs.</p> <p>There exist many manifestations of child neglect, including non-compliance with health care recommendations, failure to seek appropriate health care, deprivation of food resulting in hunger, and the failure of a child physically to thrive. Other causes for concern include the exposure of children to drugs and inadequate protection from environmental dangers. In addition, abandonment, inadequate supervision, poor hygiene and being deprived of an education have all been considered as evidence of neglect.</p> <p>Data on non-fatal child abuse and neglect come from a variety of sources, including official statistics, case reports and population-based surveys. These sources, however, differ as regards their usefulness in describing the full extent of the problem. Official statistics often reveal little about the patterns of child abuse. This is partly because, in Ika South Local Government Area of Delta State there are no legal or social systems with specific responsibility for recording, let alone responding to, reports of child abuse and neglect. In addition, there are differing legal and cultural definitions of abuse and neglect between societies. There is also evidence that only a small proportion of cases of child maltreatment are reported to authorities, even where mandatory reporting exists.</p> <p>Case series have been published in many countries. They are important for guiding local action on child abuse, and raising awareness and concern among the public and professionals (Corso and Mercy, 2011). Case series can reveal similarities between the experiences in different countries and suggest new hypotheses. However, they are not particularly helpful in assessing the relative importance of possible risk or protective factors in different cultural contexts, this study is therefore set to investigate the factors that are responsible for child abuse and neglect among parents in Ika South Local Government Area of Delta State.</p> <p><strong>Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main objective is to examine the factors responsible for child abuse and neglect among parents in Ika South Local Government Area of Delta State.

Children all over the world have been entertained by various animated films and cartoon shows for over 80 years. Currently, children across the world are exposed to animated film classics and new cartoon series which can be seen on cable/satellite channels, such as Boomerang, Cartoon Network, and The Disney Channel. Violence in cartoons is an integral part of cartoon content. In fact, frequency of violence in cartoons is higher than in live-action dramas or comedies (Potter &amp; Warren, 1998). As the result, children are more exposed to violence showed in the cartoon program than any other television program broadcasted. Cartoon watching affects the attitude and behavior of children i.e. their liking and disliking, way of talking, and behaving with other children. It also has a strong effect on their language and the way of their dressing and eating. When children watch cartoon character is smoking they might likely practice it someday. Cartoon related injuries are now becoming a serious problem, which is now needed to be addressed in the world today. Due to strong affiliation with these supernatural characters in cartoons, many children fall prey to some serious injuries (Saturnine, 2004). Under the guise of “having fun”.</p> <p>There has been a serious argument among researcher that children's cartoons are too violent say that these cartoons will greatly affect these children's behaviors growing up. Violence is a learned behavior and therefore children need to see violence in order to become violence themselves (Krieg, 2003). If a child is viewing their favorite character hitting, kicking, and beating up the \"bad guys\" a child will learn these behaviors too. However, according to Siegel (1996), children also learn how to endure and strength to tackle the evil that has bedeviled the society when watching their favorite character doing so. And because most of these cartoons do not show any consequences for these behaviors and in a sense glorify violence; children think that this is an acceptable form of problem solving (Benham, 2006). Children also experience other negative effects from viewing these violent cartoons such as, antisocial behaviors, increased anxiety, and nightmares containing TV characters (Chandler, 1999).</p> <p>However, many parents and teachers across Nigeria are worried about the cartoons their children are watching (Krieg, 2003). According to Krieg (2003), they feel that the cartoons have become too violent and are having negative long-term effects on children. It is common to see young boys pretending to shoot one another, while jumping on the couch and hiding in closets as a sort of make-believe fort. But parents say that children are learning these behaviors from cartoons and imitating them. Others however, disagree; they say that violence in cartoons does not affect children and that children need this world of fantasy in their lives. They say that children would show these same behaviors regardless of the content of the cartoons they watch (Benham, 2006).</p> <p>It was found in previous study that what children watches on TV at age 8 will be one of the best predictors of how aggressive they will be as an adult. The children's TV viewing outweighed other factors such as child-rearing practices and socioeconomic factors (Chandler, 1999). Chandler (1999) also found that what a child watches after age 8 is not nearly as important as what they watch before age 8. Others argue that this violence desensitizes children to real life violence. They see the cartoon characters beating up the bad guys so when they see a bully at school picking on another kid they are less likely to find anything wrong with that situation.</p> <p>It has long been accepted that certain behaviour by children causes significant alarm, distress, fear or intimidation to certain members of society (Siegel, 1996). Antisocial behaviors are disruptive acts characterized by covert and overt hostility and intentional aggression toward others. Antisocial behaviors exist along a severity continuum and include repeated violations of social rules, defiance of authority and of the rights of others, deceitfulness, theft, and reckless disregard for self and others (Snow, 2004). Antisocial behavior can be identified in children as young as three or four years of age. If left unchecked these coercive behavior patterns will persist and escalate in severity over time, becoming a chronic behavioral disorder. Antisocial behavior may be overt, involving aggressive actions against siblings, peers, parents, teachers, or other adults, such as verbal abuse, bullying and hitting; or covert, involving aggressive actions against property, such as theft, vandalism, and fire-setting (Snow, 2004). Covert antisocial behaviors in early childhood may include noncompliance, sneaking, lying, or secretly destroying another's property. Antisocial behaviors also include drug and alcohol abuse and high-risk activities involving self and others (Anderson, 2008).</p> <p><strong>1.2              </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>It is a general believe that adults can watch violence in cartoon and other TV  series and understand that it is not real, children on the other hand may have difficulties in differentiating between what is real and what is make believe. This is has made it necessary to understand how cartoon violence influences the behaviour of children. Multiple risk factors for development and persistence of antisocial behaviors include genetic, neurobiological, and environmental stressors including violent cartoons, beginning at the prenatal stage and often continuing throughout the childhood years (Haynes, 2008). Heavy exposure to media violence through television, movies, Internet sites, video games, and even cartoons has long been associated with an increase in the likelihood that a child will become desensitized to violence and behave in aggressive and antisocial ways (Haynes, 2008). However, research relating violent cartoons with antisocial behavior is inconsistent and varies in design and quality, with findings of both increased and decreased aggression after exposure to violent cartoons. However, the researcher is investigating the correlation between violent cartoons and antisocial behaviors in children.</p> <p><strong>1.3              </strong><strong>OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The following are the objectives of this study:</p> <ol><li>To examine the correlation between violent cartoons and antisocial behaviors in children.</li> <li>To determine the extent of children exposure to violent cartoons.</li> <li>To determine the positive influence of cartons on children.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4              </strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <ol><li>What is the correlation between violent cartoons and antisocial behaviors in children?</li> <li>What is the extent of children exposure to violent cartoon?</li> <li>What are the positive influence of cartoons on children?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5              </strong><strong>HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p><strong>HO: </strong>There is no significant relationship between violent cartoons and antisocial behaviors in children</p> <p><strong>HA: </strong>There is significant relationship between violent cartoons and antisocial behaviors in children</p> <p><strong>1.6              </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The outcome of this study will form a useful guide for government, policy makers and the video censor board in regulating the violent content of cartoons videos on sale in the country considering the antisocial consequences on children. The results of this study will also educate the parents and teachers on the type of cartoons that the children should be exposed to and the consequences. This will also form a guide for the parents and teachers in educating their children on the language and attitude that are socially acceptable and the ones that are not. This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.</p> <p><strong>1.7              </strong><strong>SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This correlational study between violent cartoons and antisocial behaviors in children will cover the violent contents of popular cartoon videos on sale in Nigeria with a view of identifying the negative consequences on children behaviour.

The quality of parenting is more essential than the quantity spent with the child. For instance a parent can spend the entire afternoon with his or her child but the parent may be engaging in a different activity and not demonstrating interest towards the child. Parenting styles are the representation of how parents respond to the demand of their children. Parenting practices are specific behaviours, while parenting styles represent broader patterns of parenting practices. There are many different theories and opinions on the best ways to rear children, as well as differing levels of time and effort that parents are willing to invest. Children go through different stages in life; therefore parents create their own parenting styles from a combination of factors that evolve overtime as children begin to develop their own personalities.</p> <p>In sociology and psychology, self-esteem reflects a person’s overall subjective emotional evaluation of his or her own worth. It is a judgment of oneself as well as an attitude toward the self. Self-esteem encompasses beliefs for example, “I am competent”, “I am worthy” and emotions such as triumph, despair, pride and shame.</p> <p>Smith and Mackie (2007) defined it by saying the self concept; it is what we think about the self; self-esteem, is the positive or negative of the self, as in how we feel about it” self-esteem is attractive as a social psychological construct because researchers have conceptualized it as an influential prediction of certain outcomes, such as academic achievement, happiness, satisfaction in marriage and relationship, and criminal behaviour.</p> <p>Within Western Cultures, self-esteem consistently has been demonstrated to be directly related with parenting styles characterized by low levels of acceptance and high levels of over protection (i.e. affectionless control). Although in traditional collectivist cultures there may be a preference for this parenting style, within a strong collectivist framework. It is not thought to have a negative impact on self-esteem.</p> <p>Self-esteem, defined as the extent to which an individual believes himself or herself to be capable, significant, successful and worthy (Coopersmith, 1981), consistently has been found to relate with psychological states and behaviours (Cramer, 1989; Dishivn, Patterson &amp; Reid, 1988; Workman &amp; Beer, 1989). The importance of self-esteem as a global indictor of psychological health has encouraged research into the influence of variables such as parenting on self-esteem development.</p> <p>As noted by the Basic Behavioural Science Task Force of the National Advisory Mental Health Council (1996), the parent-child relationship represents the earliest and most enduring social relationship of the human life span. Accordingly, the quality of the parent-child relationship has been argued to have a significant impact on the competence, resilience and well-being of all individuals. (Basic Behavioural Science Task Force of the National Advisory Mental Health Council, 1996). Two fundamental aspects of parenting have been identified as important for children’s adjustment or maladjustment. The first of these has been identified as warmth, nurturance and acceptance or responsibility. This dimension has been shown to be bipolar. It has defined by parental affection, empathy and closeness on one pole and coldness, indifference and neglect on the other (Baumrind, 1968; Coopersmith, 1967). The second dimension has been defined by the amount and control, structure and involvement that caregivers display toward their children. This dimension has been differentiated in terms of effective, emphatic and developmentally appropriate management versus manipulative or punitivecare giving (Maccoby&amp; Martin, 1983).</p> <p><strong>1.2              </strong><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>It has been discovered overtime that self-esteem has been consistently related with parenting styles characterized by relatively low levels of acceptance. This study will investigate the various known parenting styles and how it affects children and adolescents both positively and negatively.</p> <p><strong>1.3              </strong><strong>Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>The following are the purposes of this study;</p> <ol><li>To identify various parenting styles adopted in Ugbowo Community.</li> <li>To investigate how these parenting styles affected self-esteem.</li> <li>The study will also find out how parenting styles and self-esteem influences.</li> <li>To find out the awareness of Ugbowo Community on parenting style.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4              </strong><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <ol><li>What is the level of awareness of Ugbowo Community on parenting style?</li> <li>What is the various adopted parenting style?</li> <li>Does parenting style affect self-esteem?</li> <li>Does parenting style affect academic performance?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5              </strong><strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This research is limited to the influence of parenting style on self-esteem amongst adolescents in Ugbowo Community, Egor Local Government Area of Edo State.

Every society takes appropriate measures to protect the lives and property of people living within its boundaries. Business and social activities may not go on freely without adequate security. This fundamental essence of security may the reason why societies from time immemorial made efforts to police their neighbourhoods in order to secure them from criminal victimization. Security has to do with the act of preventing and protecting in order to ensure that certain facilities, equipment, persons or activities are safe from damage, pilferage, destruction, murder or disruption. The history of crime control dates back to the period when public order was the responsibility of appointed magistrates, who were unpaid private individuals. The first paid public police officer was the praeffectus urbi, a position created in Rome in approximately  B.C (Roberg and Kuykendall, 1993). After the fall of the Roman Empire and the subsequent anarchy that followed, kings began to assume the responsibility for legal administration by strengthening the night watch.</p> <p>Roberg and Kuykendall, (1993) also pointed out that in the twelfth century in England, through ‘Frankpledged’ system which was based on an organization of tithings (ten families) and hundreds (ten tithings), men over the age of fifteen formed a posse comitatus, a group called out to pursue fleeing felons. Thus, the sheriffs who ensured that this Frankpledge system worked were responsible for policing the country.</p> <p>However, as societies became increasingly complex, social life was disrupted. Existing systems of law enforcement were inadequate to respond to the problems associated with these changes. As a result, night watch system was introduced. This system involved bellmen who walked round the city, ringing bells and providing policing services. The bellmen were later replaced by untrained citizens and much later by paid constables. However, in 1829, Sir Robert Peel established the first modern uniformed police force, the metropolitan police of London, whose primary responsibility was the prevention of crime. (Roberg and Kuykendall,</p> <p>1993)</p> <p>Vigilantism is not a recent development. Before 1900, many vigilant groups were formed in frontier areas of the United States. In 1851 and 1856, concerned citizens in San Francisco organized vigilante committees that forcibly restored peace and order. (world book encyclopedia, Encyclopedia Americana). In South Africa, vigilante activity is frequently justified as ‘filling a policing gap’ due to police inefficiency, corruption and conspiracy with criminals, practical failing in the criminal justice system. In Sierra-Leone, vigilante activities have been explained in terms of police ineffectiveness in combating crimes (Brownyn, 2001).</p> <p>In Nigeria, vigilantism existed in the pre-colonial era. Human Right Watch and Center for law enforcement and education report, (2002) noted that “vigilante and other self –defense groups currently operating in Nigeria have roots that reach deep into the country’s history. In the colonial era, some though not all independent local communities, especially in the South east maintained their own standing Army to defend their territory against the threat of invasion from neighbouring communities. Although there was no equivalent modern day structure at that time, some parallels can be drawn between these groups which were created by local communities for their own protection, and the more recently formed self –defense groups”.</p> <p>The proliferation of vigilante groups in contemporary Nigeria particularly in Ethiope East Local Government area of Delta State is a response to crimes and criminality that have not only increased in degree, scope and volume but also have witnessed an unprecedented change in techniques, mode of operation and sophistication between 1998 and 1999 (wake of fourth republic) and the apparent failure of the Nigeria police to rise up to the occasion. Igbo (2001) has stated that “the apparent failure of Nigeria police to control the increasing wave of crime has led to unilateral public action against crime and criminals in some major cities of Nigeria particularly in the South east of the country”. This is true in Ethiope East Local Government Area, where, presently, vigilante groups are used as a means of crime control due to increasing crime wave and the inability of the formal agents of crime control to bring them under control. In view of this, this study examined the contributions of vigilante groups in controlling crime in contemporary Nigeria, particularly in Ethiope East Local Government area of Delta State.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>In recent years, many communities in Nigeria have witnessed crimes of various descriptions. Ethiope East Local Government area of Delta State is not an exception. Thus, crime is becoming a serious problem in contemporary Nigeria. The police who are the primary agent in the fight against crime are ineffective. Their ineffectiveness may be as a result of the fact that they are under-staffed, under-equipped, corrupt and lack public cooperation. These have created problem of under policing in Nigeria including Ethiope East Local Government area of Delta State. Thus, violent and property crimes are committed on daily basis without detection and prosecution. Many people are being dispossessed of their valuable property and others are killed or maimed for life by armed bandits. Many people hardly sleep in their houses at night for fear of criminal victimization. Those who sleep in their houses at Night do so at their own peril.</p> <p>The increase in crime wave and the inability of the Nigeria police to deal with the situation effectively have given rise to the emergence of vigilante groups in its current form. These vigilante groups are to ensure the safety of both their lives and property and that of their families. Eke, (2002) noted that “from time immemorial, ordinary men and women have made several sacrifices to ensure the safety of both their lives and that of their families. That human impulse is not only common in Nigeria. Government in Western Europe, in Africa, and elsewhere was originally set up to offer protection to their subjects”.</p> <p>Thus vigilantism seems to be gaining more prominence as agent of crime control in Ethiope East Local Government Area. Several vigilante groups now operate in both rural and urban areas in Nigeria. Residents see vigilante groups as an outfit they can always rely on in terms of security. Put differently, the public is skeptical about the ability of Nigeria Police to provide adequate security services alone without the involvement of the public.</p> <p>This study, therefore, aimed at finding out the impact of vigilante groups on crime control in Ethiope East Local Government area of Delta State</p> <p><strong>1.3 Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>The broad objective of this study is to examine the contributions of vigilante groups in crime control in Ethiope East Local Government area of Delta State.</p> <p>The specific objectives are to examine:-</p> <ol><li>the formation of vigilante groups in Ethiope East L.G.A and the inability of police to control crime</li> <li>The relationship between people’s level of education and their reliance on vigilante services in Ethiope East L.G.A.</li> <li>The relationship between people’s occupation and their perceived effectiveness of vigilante groups in Ethiope East L.G.A.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5 Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The following null hypotheses were formulated to guide the study:</p> <p>Ho<strong>1: </strong>There is no significant relationship between the formation of vigilante groups in Ethiope East L.G.A and the inability of the police to control crime in the area</p> <p>Ho2: There is no significant relationship between people’s level of education and their reliance on vigilante services in Ethiope East L.G.A.</p> <p>H03: There is no significant relationship between people’s occupation and their perceived effectiveness of vigilante groups in Ethiope East L.G.A.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study has both theoretical and practical significance. From the theoretical point of view, this study will add to the existing literature on vigilantism. It will also build up a data upon which future research can be based or serve as a point of reference for similar studies. From the practical point of view, this study will show the security gap created in both rural and urban communities and how vigilante groups have tended to make up for this vacuum. To this end, this may stimulate the interest of the government in providing adequate police services in both rural and urban communities or modify and assist vigilante groups to complement security efforts of the police.</p> <p>In another development, this study will be of great benefit to law enforcement agencies and other stake holders in their quest for police reform. In general, it will stimulate further research in vigilantism and policing.</p> <p><strong>1.7. Scope of the study</strong></p> <p>This study covered Ethiope East Local Government Area of Delta State. It covered the activities of vigilante groups in Ethiope East LGA with regard to crime control.

Positive reward to workers for good performance by management is among the motivational tools employed by management to enhance productivity and maintain high standard products. Organizations that are indifferent to motivational tool suffer lack of productivity and standard products. To achieve productivity and standard products, team work is imperative. To achieve teamwork, a system of reward administration and implementation is pertinent. To this end it is imperative to investigate the relationship between system of reward administration and its implementation to establish the influence of reward administration implementation. On this premise, this study seeks examine the impact of reward administration implementation has on total quality management (TQM). The object of this study aims at understanding the influence of reward administration on total quality management.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>Title Page<br/>Approval page<br/>Dedication<br/>Acknowledgement<br/>Abstract<br/>Table of Content<br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 Background to the study<br/>1.2 Statement of the problem<br/>1.3 Research questions<br/>1.4 Objective of the study<br/>1.5 Significant of the study<br/>1.6 Definition of terms<br/>CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>2.1 Total quality management<br/>2.2 Operational requirement of TQM<br/>2.3 TQM level of installation<br/>2.4 Reward issues and performance appraisal<br/>2.5 Determinants of workers consciousness<br/>2.6 Review of theories<br/>2.7 Theoretical framework<br/>2.8 Study hypothesis<br/>CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY<br/>3.1 Research design<br/>3.2 Study of area<br/>3.3 Population of the study<br/>3.4 Sample size<br/>3.5 Sampling techniques<br/>3.6 Instruments for data collection<br/>3.7 Methods of data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR: DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS<br/>4.1 Demographic variables of respondents<br/>4.2 Analysis of research questions<br/>4.3 Hypothesis testing<br/>4.4 Presentation of data<br/>CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/>5.1 Summary of findings<br/>5.2 Conclusion<br/>5.3 Recommendations<br/>5.4 Limitations of the study<br/>References<br/>Appendices<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 Background To The Study<br/>Consequent upon the myriad of changes which have beclouded the operations of modern business organisations in recent times, including the fundamental and core changes in the nature of work and organisations, the dynamic nature of the competitive environment and the need to ensure a convergence of shareholders interests in the way the organisations are run, a need for new approaches in human resources management has arisen.<br/>The paradigm shift, in other words, includes “total”. Put differently, total quality management. This means that everyone in the organisation must be involved in the continuous improvement effort. The concept quality indicates a concern for consumer satisfaction. Management on the other hand refers to the people and processes needed to achieve the quality (Aragon, 2003).<br/>Subsequently, reward management deals generally with the handling of workers needs, drives and motivations in a way that will elicit the desired behavior from employees. This becomes more reasonable going by the submission of Brian Tracy (a world class management expert) in Omotosho, (2002) that an average worker will only put in 40% - 50% of his capacity to any job-function at a point in time. Therefore, for us to induce and trigger off exceptional performance of 70% - 95% from workers we need to motivate<br/>them using any or combination of the reviewed motivational theories as our foundation.<br/>From the foregoing, it becomes one of the ethical issues in staff management in Caritas University, that is, stimulating reward to emerge with total quality management implementation. Some experts contend that total quality management can only be implemented when there is a critical need for remunerative justice in organisation irrespective of teamwork syndrome.<br/>Again, the contradiction of an acceptable methodology in rewarding employees is both inevitable and not universal. Therefore, for total quality installation and implementation with a quest for objectivity (statistical tools) there is a need for identifiable and acceptable techniques of rewarding players in the total quality management mix. According to Dulewicz (2009), “there is a basic human tendency to make judgments about those one is working with as well as about oneself”. Appraisal, it seems, is both inevitable and universal. In the absence of carefully structured system of appraisal, people will tend to judge the work performance of others, including subordinates, naturally, informally and arbitrarily. The human inclination to judge can beat serious motivational, ethical and legal problems in the work place. Without a structured appraisal system, there is little chance of ensuring that the judgments made will be lawful, fare, defensible and accurate.<br/>For organizations to toe “total quality management” (TQM) and rewarding variables for its implementation, astute methods of determining<br/>the value of individuals not group needs to be delineated. Understanding the context of the research work, (de-unionized workers operating in a peripheral capitalist state, baptismal mission University), concentration on collective responsibility and collaborating effort is replaced by acknowledging individuals responsibility and achievement, even within the context of a team approach (Cole, 2002).<br/>On the above premise, the mechanics of this work is articulated on rewards as stimulating performance/motivation which makes or mark the implementation of total quality management not in the absence of performance appraisal as a veritable tool in assessing rather than control of processes of walk of paradigm shift.<br/>The thrust of TQM concept is mainly to help work organisation cope with changing environment and the need to integrate an organisations human resource strategy and it‟s cooperate strategy. There quality control should be conducted as an integrate part of management control.<br/>Thus, the purpose of this work therefore, is to examine the origin and development of the reward valuation model in juxtaposition with performance appraisal as technique for evaluating employees.<br/>1.2 Statement Of The Problem<br/>Work relation concern the control of the process wherein worker‟s capacity to labour is translated into actual work. In pursuit of profitability those who own the means of production adopt control processes to ensure<br/>that maximum effort is extorted from those who have to sell their labour for wages.<br/>Control strategy in relations may be located in the dimensions of bureaucracy-hierarchy, specialization and division of labour, impersonality and formalized rules as well as in the system of discipline and reward as occurred in the workplace.<br/>The direction of work, the procedures for evaluating workers performance and the exercise of the firms‟ sanctions and reward becomes subject with of the company policy work becomes highly stratified, each given its distinct title and description and impersonal rules govern promotion. Similarly the disciplinary system takes care of act of challenge, recalcitrance and resistance, which inherently threaten „order‟ whilst the pay system rewards compliance.<br/>Paying people for performance or compliance to the procedure for the installation and implementation of TQM in organisations particularly Caritas University remains a mixture of paradoxes. The contradiction arises from the never abating controversy about objectivity of the appraisal process on one part and the link between individual‟s performance and corporate goals on the other hand.<br/>Akata (2003: 211) argued that when objectives are stretched, employees easily become disenchanted but to otherwise is to encourage performance mediocrity. Akata further opined that different pay rate and bonuses to high performers of the quality implementation team and others who strive hard to attain average performance will feel aggrieved; Rewarding<br/>underperforming executives with fat performance related bonuses and the work force would grumble.<br/>On the above premise, it could be deduced that part from noting the human element in implementing TQM, other factors such as basic salary, cash allowance (housing, electricity, transportation, medical etc), fringe benefits (sale bonus/profit share, entrepreneurial reward, productivity bonus etc), cash awarded for loyalty, honesty, long service etc, and quality of leadership, workplace relationship and official recognition of employees ability and contribution to corporate growth and development has great influence on the level of quality expected from workers.<br/>Taking cursory look at the reward variables, a process of determining who gets what, and how, in terms of income. Quality implementation in Caritas University however tends to be fixed on problems anchored on perceived trust, mediocrity religious ethic and appliance of viable oppressive apparatus on non mediocre workers. This translates into almost general silence by rank and file staff amidst so much important welfare and corporate issues to discuss. This is explained only in the context of fear of being sacked and driven back to swollen labour market. To many staff, half bread is better than none. Thus no matter the dehumanizing conditions of service it is better than none. This is against the view of Alwitt and Berger, (1993) that rewarding quality has been translated into economic vote which ultimately influence the purchase and investment decision of individuals.<br/>Most academic staffs are beclouded by visible and invisible spies. The management system seems so operative that has attracted the slag hammer<br/>of the National Universities Commission (NUC). But still, it seems unabated. Student are not left out in this managerial mis-normed. History is empty with the record of academic and general behaviour stimuli in terms of reward of any kind. Thus monument of doubts have strange up in the mind of staff and students regarding the expected positive impact of the NUC forensic auditing. Is this obnoxious managerial flaw inherent that even NUC appears too gullible in removing it? Derven, 1990 and lawrie, 1990 advocated for standardized performance appraisal as the most crucial aspect to guarantee organizational life and growth.<br/>Total quality management calls for the elimination of performance assessments that rate employee in relations to each other and in mediocre criteria. Lack of performance appraisal has conferred on the managers of this University too power over employees and they most often abuse. Many managers fill performance assessment will let them document employee performance for possible reward, but some employee fear the assessment might used against them in some disciplinary actions. Performance assessments may give employees with grievances the documentation they need to prove that managers are treating them unfairly.<br/>Thus, the crux of this study, therefore, is to identify the inherent contradictions in the workability of TQM and the manipulation of the reward variables in furthering its implementation in Caritas University.<br/>1.3 Research Questions<br/>The following question shall guide this study.<br/>1. What is the relationship between pay, general performance reward and TQM implementation?<br/>2. Is there any standard appraisal system or mechanism in operation in Caritas University?<br/>3. Dose reward has impact on TQM implementation?<br/>4. What is the impact of management style on total quality management implementation?<br/>5.

The research is aimed at providing vivid and extensive insight on a wide range of the fundamental aspects of youth unemployment and rural crime. In this light very decisive steps were taken to analyse as possible all manner of issues enshrined in the study and understanding of the problems of unemployment and rural crimes in the lives of Ngor Okpala youth. In carrying out this study survey research design was used. Four research questions and hypothesis were formulated. The sample of 150 males and females was selected by probability random sampling techniques. The instruments for the study where the interview method and questionnaire containing nineteen open question, which were validated by the supervisor, the mothers were the respondents. The analysis of data was by use of frequency tables, percentages and chi-square. The major findings of the study were:</p> <p>Youth unemployment and armed robbery are related.</p> <p>There is a relationship between youth unemployment and drug abuse<strong>.</strong></p> <p>The unemployment situation is the brain behind burglary in Ngor Okpala</p> <p>Rural unemployment leads to youth gambling.</p> <p>The government should provide job opportunities and also ensure an equitable distribution of resources. The gap between the rich and the poor can be narrowed by creating employment opportunities for the citizens, provision of cheap food and shelter and ensuring that education is no longer a privilege but a right in these rural areas.</p> <p>2)       Achieving industrialization by establishing many industries in rural areas of Ngor Okpala, this will create more employment opportunities and reduce the high rate of rural crime.</p> <p>3)       Social amenities should be provided to rural areas especially in this area of study (the people of Ngor Okpala) because this is also a way of creating jobs and it will make many school leavers in the area to accept to work and reside in their rural homes without thinking about committing crimes.</p> <p>4)       There are empty lands in Ngor Okpala, what the government needs to do is to use them to encourage labour-oriented industries, production in the industries that will be established in order to achieve industrialization in our societies should be made labour-intensive instead of total use of machines. By so doing it will create an avenue for the rural youth to get employment and the rate of crime will be reduced.</p> <p>5)       Restructuring our educational system, pre-vocational courses like mechanics, electronics, woodwork, metal work, etc should be taught; these will make our educational products to be job-creators instead of job-seekers.</p> <p>6)       The government should ensure that there is equal distribution of wealth, political participation, economic activities and resources because there is a saying that “what is good for the goose is also good for the gander”. They should ensure that development is a multifaceted thing and not a one sided phenomena, the rural areas should be recognized to avoid crimes.</p> <p>7)       Most rural areas especially Ngor Okpala is traditionally based on agriculture and they take agriculture as their source of economy. So, the government should make agriculture more attractive. This can be done by developing agriculture and those in it should earn more wages, salaries so that it can attract the youth and at least create rooms for more jobs and the high rate of rural crime will be a thing of the past in Ngor Okpala LGA of Imo State.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p>Title page……………………………………………………....</p> <p>Certification………………………………………………………………i</p> <p>Dedication………………………………………………………………..ii</p> <p>Acknowledgement……………………………………………………...iii</p> <p>Abstract…………………………………………………………………..iv</p> <p>Table of Contents……………………………………………………….v</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p>1.1     Background to the problem…………………………………..1</p> <p>1.2     Statement of the problem……………………………………..2</p> <p>1.3     Purpose of Study/Objectives…………………………………6</p> <p>1.4     Research Question………………………………………………7</p> <p>1.5     Research Hypotheses……………….………………………….7       </p> <p>1.6     Significance of Study…………………………………………..8</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p> <p>2.1     Conceptual Clarification: Rural Area                              10</p> <p>          Rural crime                                                                    10</p> <p>          Types of rural crime                                                                 11</p> <p>2.2     Unemployment                                                                        13</p> <p>          Youth unemployment and crime                                    15</p> <p>          Types of youth unemployment                                                20</p> <p>          Effects of youth unemployment and rural                      22</p> <p>          Solution to unemployment and rural crime                   24</p> <p>2.3     Theoretical orientation/framework                                27</p> <p>          The Marxian theory of economic determinism                28</p> <p>          The differential opportunity                                           29</p> <p>          Marxist theory of unemployment                                   31</p> <p>          Theoretical frame work                                                   32</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>3.1     Scope of Study                                                                         37</p> <p>3.2     Research Design                                                            38</p> <p>3.3     Sample Size                                                                             38</p> <p>3.4     Sample technique                                                          39</p> <p>3.5     Data Collection technique                                                        39</p> <p>3.6     Data Analysis Technique                                                         40</p> <p>3.7     Limitation of Study                                                                  41</p> <p>3.8     Definition of Terms                                                                  43</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR:          DATA PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS AND</strong></p> <p><strong>INTERPRETATION</strong></p> <p>4.1     Data Presentation and Analysis                                               45</p> <p>4.2     Testing of Hypothesis                                                     68</p> <p>4.2.1 Testing of Hypothesis one                                                        69</p> <p>4.2.2  Testing of Hypothesis two                                              72</p> <p>4.2.3  Testing of Hypothesis three                                           77</p> <p>4.2.4  Testing of Hypothesis four                                             80</p> <p>4.3     Discussion of Research Findings                                   84</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND</strong></p> <p><strong>RECOMMENDATION</strong></p> <p>5.1     Summary                                                                                 87</p> <p>5.2     Conclusion                                                                     89</p> <p>5.3     Recommendation                                                           91</p> <p>          Bibliography                                                                            95</p> <p>          Questionnaire                                                                          100</p> <p>          Appendix</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER   ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    BACKGROUND TO THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The problem of youth unemployment and rural crime has over the years become an Area of interest and great concern to most nations of the world. It is the intention of this nations to completely eliminate or at least minimize youth unemployment and rural crime in their various nations.</p> <p>The menace of youth unemployment in Nigeria could be said to a recent occurrence because in the pre-colonial days great value and dignity was attached to labour as a means of acquiring wealth but now the end justifies the means. Even if unemployment existed it was not the intractable problem it is today.</p> <p>According to Balogun (2010:82), he opined that of Nigerian’s 150 million population 40 million are unemployed. As 45% of the population is between the ages of 15 to 40 years this means unemployment mainly affect the youth. The Nigeria ruling class is incapable of solving this problem, only the working class can take on the task of eradicating youth unemployment and rural crime</p> <p>Balogun   (2010), argued that it is estimated that over 3 trillion naira has been spent since 2003 just to combat youth unemployment and rural crime. The question is where has this money gone and why does the menace still persist  to  solve  the problem, the government buy a few thousand pepper grinding machines or five thousand bikes and distributes these to  hungry youths numbering millions. These methods gives rise to massive corruption and provide room for political patronage. This methods also has been used for close to 10 years now and what has it been able to achieve or deliver?</p> <p>With the extent of human and national resources Nigeria possesses, she ought not to know any poverty, let alone this extent of youth unemployment and rural crime.</p> <p>According to Chigunta (2002:89) these large-scale unemployment among youths is encouraging the development of street youths in Nigeria. the street youths, denied of legitimate means of livelihood, grow up in a culture that  encourages criminal behavior in rural and urban areas where they engages in various activities such as petty trading, casual work, stealing, pick pocketing prostitution, touting  and other illegal activities.</p> <p>Ngor Okpala is a local government area of Imo state Nigeria, its head quarters are in the town of Umuneke Ngor. It has an area of 56Ikm and a population of 159,932 at the 2006 census. Ngor-Okpala is a notable place in Imo state because of her locational position. Ngor Okpala is the largest local government in Imo state and one of the largest in Nigeria.</p> <p>Ngor is the fastest developing local government in Imo state. Ngor Okpala is blessed with natural mineral resources which has not been tapped. This prominent status of Ngor Okpala as a state local government Areas and its consequent of population explosion and the problems of youth unemployment and rural crime makes it unique for this study.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Youth unemployment and rural crime has been a threatening menace in Ngor Okpala as a whole, thus it has became necessary to give full attention as regards how to curb this ugly trend. With over 40 million Nigeria youth effectively unemployed in a population of 150 million, no doubt Nigeria has one of the highest youth unemployment in the figure of the world despite her economic potential. This situation  clearly  reveals  its social  essence when  we  consider  it  against  the fact  that  Nigeria has  45% of her population between  the  ages  of  15-45 years  and  due  to the extremely  low  life  expectancy of  45 years.</p> <p>However, Nigerian youth are the hardest hit by this menace of employment. With this figures in mind, it does  not  need the  wisdom  of Solomon to clearly understand  why there  is  so much  crime, spates  of  kidnapping, youth unrest and most significantly an  extremely  unstable social  economic structure   that  has  hitherto been  bedeviling  Nigeria  with  particular  reference to  Ngor Okpala.</p> <p>It is one of the major social problems facing all societies in Ngor Okpala. It creates and perpetuates poverty and frustration and even aids uneven distribution of national wealth.</p> <p>Moreso, it  also contributes to  low  productivity and lack of  economic growth  it  gradually contribute to  increase in the  level of  crime and other  anti-social behaviour in the  communities and  societies  especially  in Ngor Okpala local government of Imo State. As a result  of unemployment  the  youth  went  into  different  rural  crimes like robbing  cars on roads leading to  different villages in the  local  government.</p> <p>Nevertheless, in  my  community  Umuhu in Ngor Okpala local government there are recent cases of  unemployed youths  who  engage in crimes like drug abuse and intake  of marijuana, and  this motivates  them to  unleash havoc on innocent villagers . Also, they go ahead to steal domestic animals and disrupt rural market in disguised theft. There are also  reported cases of these  individuals raping  young innocent girls  and  also  committing  incest  taboo and other  abominable  acts.</p> <p>Consequently, the  above is  against  the  culture of the  people  of  Umuhu community and  Ngor Okpala local government  of  Imo State. This menace known as youth  unemployment and  rural  crime  is  potentially  dangerous  as it  sends disturbing  signal  to  all  segment  of Ngor Okpala local  government  area of  Imo State and  Nigeria at Large.</p> <p><strong>1.3       </strong><strong>PURPOSES OF  STUDY/OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>(i)           This  study  generally  investigate the  problems of  youth unemployment and  rural  crime with  particular reference to  Ngor Okpala local  government of  Imo State.</p> <p>(ii)          To describe the extent of youth unemployment and crime in Ngor Okpala local government of Imo State.</p> <p>(iii)        To determine crimes that are traceable to unemployment.</p> <p>(iv)         To examine  the  strategies employed  by the  government in  combating the  problems  of youth  unemployment and  rural crime  in the  location  of  study as well  as  the effectiveness of  control  mechanism employed.</p> <p>(v)          To proffer solution and recommendation to the problems of youth unemployment and rural crime in Ngor Okpala local government of Imo State.</p> <p><strong>1.4       </strong><strong>RESEARCH  QUESTION</strong></p> <p>(i)           What is  the truth  of the  assertion  that  more  youths  in the  society  especially  in Ngor Okpala take to  crime because of unemployment?</p> <p>(ii)</p>\n\nTHE PROBLEMS OF YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT AND RURAL CRIME<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE PROBLEMS OF YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT AND RURAL CRIME", "id": 57}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES, PREVALENCE AND EFFECT OF FEMALE PROSTITUTION IN NIGERIA TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS</strong></p> <p><strong>COLLEGE OF EDUCATION, EKIADOLOR-BENIN AS A CASE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>The study investigated into the causes, prevalence and effect of female prostitution in Nigerian tertiary institutions: a case study of College of Education, Ekiadolor-Benin.

These young people see selling of their bodies as the fastest way of getting income for their keeps. In the past those engaged in prostitution use to be women selling their bodies. However, today men have joined the trade of selling their bodies for different reasons including drugs, jobs or contracts and also good grades in exams. This is because sex consumers include politicians, bosses in offices, lecturers who find pleasure in exploiting the lower class by offering mouth watering opportunities in exchange for sex. (Alufohai, 2007). She further stated that some of the causes of prostitution are high level of poverty due to unemployment rate in the society, bribery and corruption. Family expectations and other problems are factors why men and women get involved in prostitution. Women most especially are pressured into the business to be able to cater for family and siblings education.</p> <p>Prostitution leads to the spread of STDs (sexually transmitted diseases), AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), HPV (human papiloma virus), herpes amongst others. Some women suffer trauma and pelvic pains, in most cases these women are subjected to drinking and smoking to ease off the pain and this habit could cause cancer which puts their lives in more jeopardy and increases mortality rate of the country. (Alufohai, 2007)</p> <p>A university don, Prof. Elizabeth Balogun, on Wednesday (2007) in Abeokuta, Ogun State, expressed her concern over the prevalence of prostitution among female undergraduates in the country. Balogun said the sex trade had become rampant on Nigerian campuses to such an extent that 80 percent of prostitutes that patronize night clubs, hotels and tourist centres in Ogun State are students of tertiary institutions. Prof. Balogun, a Biochemistry lecturer at the University of Ilorin, said this at a seminar organized by the National Association of Nigerian Students to mark its 31stanniversary where she delivered a lecture titled “Prostitution on our campuses: Effects and solutions.”</p> <p>The guest speaker, who expressed regret said, “It is absurd to the level that young undergraduate lady would leave normal academic chores of attending lectures and visiting libraries for further studies during the day, only to metamorphose in the evening into a call-girl or pimp. “There is no doubt that prostitution in the long run corrupts the quality of the nation’s future leaders and affects their values. Understanding that young females constitute appreciable percentage of the nation’s population, little could be expected from them productively if they had been turned into cheap sexual machines, with warped self-esteem and self- actualization. “Inordinate desire for affluence and desperation by many Nigerians, especially ladies lure them to engage in immoral and illicit activities, despite high level of religiousness which Nigerians overtly demonstrate. Even the present scourge of HIV/AIDS and the menace of ritual killers that find easy prey among prostitutes, have not been strong enough to curb the rising trend of the practice.” She urged the government to improve funding on education in order to drastically reduce cost of attaining higher education which will curb the rising trend of the practice.</p> <p>According to Alfred Obiora Uzokwe (2008) Prostitution is said to be one of the oldest professions in the world. It is alluded to in the bible and ancient civilizations, like Rome and Greece, had to contend with it. As I write, inspite of the penalties entrenched in the laws of most nations, against this illicit trade, it still flourishes. In most cases, though, those who engage in the trade are independent women, old enough to make decisions for themselves and willing to bear attendant repercussions. What happens, however, when prostitution becomes a pastime for young girls still dependent on their parents for subsistence? More specifically, what happens when the act of prostitution shifts from the cigarette smoke-filled rooms of brothels and the dark alleyways of major cities, to the esteemed halls of citadels of higher learning? Essentially, some of our young girls, sent to universities to acquire knowledge and become productive citizens in the nation, have found a vocation in prostitution.</p> <p>According to Punch Online (June 10, 2008) they now ply the trade right inside the university campuses. By day, they masquerade as students, attending classes and going to the libraries like other students but by night, they shed their academic garbs and don that of the oldest profession in the world. The Punch Online story sent cold chills down my spine and one is certain that when parents of young girls in Nigerian universities read this story, they will find themselves scampering after their children to ask some poignant questions. It goes without saying that every aspect of this news is bad for the universities as well as for the nation. Our female undergraduates are not only exposing themselves to danger, they are also mortgaging their future on the altar of quick money and instant sensual gratification. Furthermore, Nigerian universities that used to be the source of pride to those of us that passed through them, no longer bear any resemblance to the institutions we once knew. Standard of education has fallen; armed robbers and cultists have moved in and now the campuses are deluged by students-turned prostitutes.</p> <p>The researcher in her view said that the interest she developed in this issue stems from her belief that if not arrested, it will deal a devastating and final blow on the standard of education in Nigeria, summarily shattering, to smithereens, the moral fabric of a nation that is already in tatters. It is shocking that this malady has largely been left unchecked and is spreading like wild fire. \"The trend is ever becoming more dangerous in Nigeria today as prostitution is no longer a thing of the street and brothels but is fast turning higher institutions in the country into red light districts.</p> <p>Today, the Nasarawa State University is fast gaining a reputation as an abode for girls of easy going virtues despite the high prevalence of HIV/AIDs in the country and particularly in Nasarawa State. (George Okoh, 2007). He further confesses that if he had to guess where this illicit trade would be flourishing; Nasarawa State University would not have been on my list. But I guess that times have really changed immensely. Most people may be wondering why prostitution would be flourishing inside university/college campuses, under the very nose of university staff and security agents. One of the principle reasons believe, is that university campus authorities have failed to strike the right balance between ensuring student liberty and enforcement of existing campus codes of conduct. Saying that the students are adults that should know better, they let them call the shots. The problem is that with unbridled liberty and freedom, the students began to push the limits of acceptable behavior, making unrestricted foray into the sublime and dangerous. Taking advantage of the freedom bestowed on them as \"adults\", our young girls devised creative ways to trade in prostitution right inside the campuses. Investigations conducted by various newspaper correspondents’ show that the method of operation, employed by these girls, vary from campus to another and from one individual to another. The hardened ones, who see their campuses as too boring, do not operate inside the university campuses. Instead, they brazenly take their trade directly to their customers \"where the real action is\". In other words, at night, they taxi into nearby cities or towns, to hot spots that would give them maximum exposure to men willing to pay anything for sensual pleasure. Some walk the streets, when they get to town, until male customers, who are willing to patronize them, materialize. Because the girls do not fear for their safety or health, they follow the customers to their homes, brothels or nightclubs.</p> <p>According to Okoh, (2008) young female undergraduates of Colleges of Education, mainly between the ages of 18 to 25 years, take advantage of the proximity of their school to the major cities. The girls leave their campus dorms on Fridays, pretending to be going home for the weekend, when their actual destinations are high brow brothels, night clubs and the streets in different cities. Their sole aim is to go and pleasure, for money, men that some call \"aristo\"- a term of endearment for wealthy and powerful men. Okoh further reports that, \"In most cases, they [the girls] return back to the school, after the weekend, with large sums of money. To some of these girls, it's just having fun on the weekend but for the fact that in most times they sleep around and collect money from men they hardly know.\"</p> <p>        The world prostitution is the act or practice of providing sexual services to another person in return for payment. The person who receives payment for sexual services is called a prostitute and the person who receives such services is known by a multitude of terms including “John” prostitution is one of the branches of sex industry. The legal status of prostitution varies from country to country, from being a punishable crime to a regulated profession. Estimates place the annual revenue generated from the global prostitution industry to be over 100 billion. Prostitution is sometimes referred to as “the world’s oldest profession. Prostitution occurs in a variety of forms. Brothels are establishments specifically dedicated to prostitution. In escort prostitution, the act may take place at the customers’ residence or hotel room (referred to as out-call) or at the escort’ residence (called in-call). Another form in street prostitution. Sex tourism refers to traveling, typically from developed to under-developed nations of one type of human trafficking is defined as using coercion or force to transport an unwilling person into prostitution or other sexual exploitation.</p> <p>        Prostitute is defined from the Latin prostitute. Some sources cite the verb as a composition of “pro” meaning “up front” or “forward” and “situere” defined as to off up for sale. Another exploitation is that prostitute is a composition of pro and stature (to cause to stand to station place erect). A literal translation therefore would be to put up front for sale or to place forward. The online Etymology Dictionary states, “the notion of sex for hire is not inherent in the etymology, which rather suggests one exposed to lust or sex indiscriminately offered. The word prostitute was then carried down through various languages to the present day western society. Most sex worker activists group reject the word prostitute and since the late 1970s have used the term sex work instead. However, a sex worker can also mean anyone who works within the sex industry or whose work is of a sex nature and is not limited solely to prostitutes. In the early 17th century, there was widespread male and female prostitution throughout the cities of Isyoto, Edo and Osaka, Japan. Oiran were Courtesaus in Japan during the Edo period. The Oiran were considered a type of Yojo “woman of pleasure” or prostitute. Among the Oiran the Taju was considered the highest rank of courtesan available only to the wealthiest and highest rank of courtesaus available only to the wealthiest and highest ranking men. To entertain their client, Oiran practiced the arts of dance, music, poetry, and calligraphy as well as sexual services, and educated with was considered essential for sophisticated conversation. Many became celebrities of their times outside the pleasure district. Their art and fashion often set trends among wealthy women. The last recorded Oiran was in (1961). Although illegal in modern Japan, the definition of prostitution does not extend to a private reached between a woman and man in a brothel. Yoshiware has a large number of soap lands that began when explicit prostitution in Japan became illegal, where women washed men’s bodies. They were originally known as Toruko-buro, meaning Turkish bath. In ancient Greek society, prostitution was engaged in by both women and boys. The Greek word for prostitutes is porne derived from the verb pernemi (tonseu), with the evident modern evolution. The English word pornography, and its corollaries in other languages are directly derived from the Greek word porno. Female prostitutes could be independent and sometimes influential women.</p> <p>They were required to wear distinctive dresses and had to pay taxes. Some similarities have been found between the Greek hetaera and the Japanese Oiran. Some prostitutes in ancient Greece such as lais were as famous for their company as their beauty but some of these women charged extraordinary sums for their services. In ancient Rome, a registered prostitute was called a meretrix while unregistered one fell under the broad category prostibulae. There were some commonalities with the Greek system, but as the empire grew, prostitutes were often foreign slaves captured, purchased, or raised for that purpose sometimes by large scale prostitute farmers who took abandoned children. Indeed, abandoned children were almost always raised as prostitutes. Enslavement into prostitution was sometimes used as a legal punishment against criminal free women. Buyers were allowed to inspect naked men and women for sale in private and there was no stigma attached to the purchase of males by a man aristocrat.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>          Statistically, prostitution is an alarming problem to the human society. Prostitution is a form of violence against women, it is violation of human rights. With a higher instance of physical violence perpetrated        against them, female prostitutes are more likely to get murdered. This is a common occurrence across the country and contributes to the incidence of children without parents. Prostitutes have an increase incidence of sexually transmitted diseases. A study in Minecapolis, Minnesota revealed that only 15% of prostitutes who had prostituted for at least six months has an S.T.D. This figure does not include HIV/AIDS, Gynecological examination of the prostitutes in this study revealed an alarming incidence of positive pap tests. These women are at greater risk of cervical cancer and could spread the human papiloma virus among the population of the Minecapolis St. Paul Metropolitan area, either through direct transmission or indirect transmission.</p> <p>        The research reveals that rather than facing conditions of slavery men and women working as prostitutes are subjected to abuses which are similar in nature to those experienced by others working in low stratus jobs in the informal sector. However, the marginal position of sex workers in society excludes them from the international, national and customary protection afforded to other as citizens, workers or women. Their vulnerability to human and labor rights violations is greater than that of others because of the stigma and criminal charges widely attached to sex work. The report recommend that all national legislation which in intent or in practice results in the placing of sex workers outside the scope of the rule of law, should be repealed. The abolitionist approach declares that the institution of prostitution itself constitutes a violation of human rights. Raymond wishes to establish that all immigrant women working as prostitutes are victims f slavery and abuse. Average prostitution in Edo State was 70% female, 20%, male prostitutes and 10% customer. Whereas street prostitution accounts between 10 to 20% of the prostitution in Edo State. Research revealed that only 3-5% of the sexually transmitted diseases in Edo State relented to prostitution compared with 30-35% among teenagers. However, prevalent rate for prostitutes was approximately 50 percent in Edo State.</p> <p><strong>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The purpose of the study is to investigate into the causes, prevalence and effect of female prostitution in Nigerian tertiary institutions: College of Education, Ekiadolor as a case study.</p> <p>        Another objective of the study is also to find out whether poverty is a major cause of female prostitution in the Nigerian tertiary institutions. </p> <p><strong>1.4    HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <ol><li>Involvement of female students in prostitution leads to poor academic performance.</li> <li>Personal greed leads to student involvement in prostitution.</li> <li>Offering sex for grades is a form of campus prostitution.</li> <li>Involvement in prostitution causes neglect of academic work.</li> <li>Many female students of College of Education, Ekiadolor engage in prostitution.</li> <li>The economic status of a country affects the spread of female prostitution in Nigerian tertiary institutions.</li> <li>The friends one move with influence one into prostitution</li> <li>Prostitution affects health state and results in communicable diseases.</li> <li>Campus prostitution is now a common business in Nigerian tertiary institutions, especially College of Education, Benin City, Edo State.</li> <li>Poor  financial background of parents enhances the spread of female prostitution</li> <li>Corruption lead to female prostitution</li> <li>Poverty lead to female prostitution.</li> <li>Female students sell their bodies to teacher/lecturers because they want to get high grades in examination.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>         This study will help the government to re-evaluate its previous policies about prostitution and come up with a more realistic policies and programmes.</p> <p>Parents will also benefit, in that it will make them to become more alive to their responsibilities.</p> <p><strong>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The scope of this study covers the four schools in the College of Education, Ekiadolor-Benin which are school of sciences, school of arts and social sciences, school of vocational and technical studies, and school of languages.</p> <p><strong>1.8    DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Prostitution: </strong>The practice of engaging in relatively indiscriminate sexual activity in general with individual other than a spouse in exchange for immediate payment in cash or kind.</p> <p><strong>Youth: </strong>An individual that is aged between twenty and forty.</p> <p><strong>Contraceptive: </strong>A device, drug or chemical agent that is intended to prevent conception.</p> <p><strong>Abortion: </strong>It involves force termination of pregnancy by drugs or any other means.</p> <p><strong>Venereal diseases: </strong>It refers to those diseases got from sexual intercourse.</p> <p><strong>AIDS: </strong>Acquire Immune Deficiency Syndrome.</p> <p><strong>HIV: </strong>Human Immuno Deficiency Virus.</p>\n\nAN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES, PREVALENCE AND EFFECT OF FEMALE PROSTITUTION IN NIGERIA TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES, PREVALENCE AND EFFECT OF FEMALE PROSTITUTION IN NIGERIA TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS", "id": 58}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF FAMILY PLANNING IN THE CONTROL OF INCREASING POPULATION IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p><strong>(A CASE STUDY OF OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE)</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This research was designed to examine the significance of family planning towards the increasing population of Nigeria in Oredo local government area in Edo State.

The lack of family planning which led to an increase in Nigeria population is as a result of lack of women education, poverty etc.</p> <p>It is a common observation to everybody that what we often say is a blessing could turn to be a curse as in the case of the increasing population of a country. The only way this can be prevented is through the use of birth control or family planning and this is one of the major way in which Nigeria population can be reduced. One question that always comes to my mind is that if fertility is not controlled and it grows beyond its carrying capacity, then there will be a huge problem in population control, as we all know over populations a problem to a country especially the developing countries. The above mentioned facts has led the researcher into the topic; family planning as an agent of reduction of the increasing population in Nigeria, a case study of Oredo Local Government Area. </p> <p>        It is important to know that whatsoever happens in any society always begin from the family. However, another question that can really come to mind is this. What is family planning? Though many authors has defined it in various way. Family planning is defined as a process whereby parents or couples have their children by choice and not by chance by this we mean that couples can control the number of children they want and when they want them. Though more people use family planning than ever before. More than half of the couples in the developing countries use family planning today compared with 10% in the 1960s. This dramatic increase in family planning use has caused fertility to decline much more rapidly in the developing countries and if this is achieved it can lead to the attainment of optimal population which is the best type of population in both developed countries and developing countries. </p> <p>        Family planning helps save women and children’s live and preserves their health by preventing untimely and unwanted pregnancies reducing women’s exposure to health risk of child birth and abortion and giving women who are often the sole care givers more time to care for their children. As countries has modernized and become more urban and as women have achieved higher levels of education and have begun to marry late. Couples want fewer children. The growing availability of modern family planning method through the use of contraceptive such as pills, injections, intrauterine devices and sterilization etc, has made it possible for women and couples to space the births of their children and it as made it possible to have fewer children and this has help and will continue to help to reduce the over-population rate of Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM    </strong></p> <p>        Over a long period of time the issue of family planning as been neglected because so many believe that children are blessing from God and children are to be given birth by chance and not by choice which is the opposite of family planning and this as an effect on the Nigeria population.</p> <p>        Hence this research work is carried out in order to know if the people are still in the shadow of ignorance over the facts of family planning through the data collected and also to enlighten the populace of the importance, harmlessness of proper family planning to the society and to oneself.</p> <p><strong>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        The general purpose of this study is;</p> <ol><li>To enlighten the public on the meaning of family planning.</li> <li>To examine the family planning facilities available</li> <li>To examine the benefit of family planning to Nigeria as a country to oneself.</li> <li>To identify the barriers attached to the use of family planning.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        The findings of this study will be immensely important to all those connected with family planning control most especially the health works. Information gathered from this project will help educate the illiterate couples and also the literate couples, it will also give the general public on the importance of family planning in the society.</p> <p>        The researcher who will want to carry out further research into this project topic. The information available from this project will add to the pool of data or ideas to be used in planning and developing the general public. </p> <p><strong>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>1.     How profound is your knowledge in the issue of family planning?</p> <p>2.     Is the general public still ignorant to the issue of family planning in the modern world?</p> <p>3.     What are the effect or barriers of family planning to the society and to our self?</p> <p>4.     Does family planning has any barriers on women?</p> <p>5.     has there been proper awareness on the use of family planning in Oredo Local Government Area?</p> <p>6.     Does the government have a role to play in the issue of family planning? </p> <p><strong>1.7    SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        The focus and coverage of the research work is on Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.

It should be for the wealth group who has the needed recourse to career for the well-being of individual family. (2) on the part of the government, the public should be enlightened at regular intervals on how to live happily in a family. Government should also make people to be aware of the implication of polygamous system of marriage. </em></p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT</strong></p> <p>Chapter One</p> <p>Background of the study </p> <p>Statement of the problem</p> <p>Purpose of the study</p> <p>Significance of the study</p> <p>Scope of the study</p> <p>Basic assumption</p> <p>Chapter Two      </p> <p>Literature review</p> <p>Chapter Three</p> <p>Methodology</p> <p>Research Method</p> <p>Population of the study</p> <p>Sample/Sampling techniques</p> <p>Research Instrument</p> <p>Method of administration</p> <p>Method of data analysis</p> <p>Chapter Four</p> <p>Data analysis</p> <p>Discussion of the findings</p> <p>Chapter Five      </p> <p>Summary, Recommendations and Conclusion</p> <p>Summary</p> <p>Recommendations</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>References</p> <p>Questionnaire    </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        In the context of human society, a  family (from latin word familia) is a group of people affiliated by consanguinity (by recognized birth), affinity (by marriage) or co-residence and/or shared consumption (see nurture kinship). Members of the immediate family includes, spouses, parents, brothers, sisters, sons and/or daughters. Members of the extended family may include grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, nieces and/or siblings-in-law.</p> <p>In most societies, the family is the principal institution for the socialization of children. As the basic unit for raising children anthropologists generally classify most family organization as multifocal (a mother and her children); conjugal (a husband, his wife, and children also called nuclear family) a avuncular (for example, a grandparents, a brother, his sister and her children) or extended parents and children co-reside with other members of one parents family. Sexual relations among the members are regulated by rules concerning incest such as the incest taboo.</p> <p>Family is used metaphorically to create more inclusive categories such as community nationhood, global village and humanism. Generally is a field which aims to trace family lineages through history. Family is also an important economic unit studied in family economic. One of the primary functions of the family involves providing a framework for the production and reproduction of persons, biologically and/or socially. This can occur through the sharing of materials/substances (such as food), the giving and receiving of care and nurture (nurture kinship) jural rights and obligation and moral and sentimental ties. Thus ones experience of ones family shifts over time. From the perspective of children, the family is a “family of orientation”. The family serves to locate children socially and plays a major role in their enculturation and socialization. From the point of view of the parents(s) the family is a family of procreation, the goal of which is to produce and enculturation and socialize children. However, producing children is not the only function of the family in societies with a sexual division of labor, marriage, and the resulting relationship between two people, it is necessary for the formation of an economically productive household.</p> <p>Christopher Harris notes that the western conception of family is ambiguous, and confused with the household, as revealed in the different contexts in which the word is used and so many. There are different types of family units which are monoigamo8us and polygamous are inclusive. Monogamous family is based on legal or social monogamy. In this case, an individual has only one (official) partner during their life’s time or at any one time (serial monogamy). This means that a person may not have several different legal spouses at the same time, as this is usually prohibited by bigamy laws, in jurisdictions that require monogamous marriages.</p> <p>Polygamous family unit is a marriage that includes more than two partners when a man is married to more than one wife at a time, the relationship is called polygamy, and when woman is married to more than one husband at a time, it is called polyandry. If a marriage includes multiple husband and wives, it can be called polygamy, group or conjoint marriage. The effect of this marriage on the girl child is what the researcher is basing her research. This type of marriage is preferred in Nigeria, particularly, Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.</p> <p>Polygamy is the type of marriage system practiced in t he traditional Africa society whereby a man takes more than one wife at the same time. It is practiced because of the prestige it accorded a man, in the society in which he lives. Religiously, most religion encouraged the practice of marrying more than one wife for instance in slam you are encouraged to marry as many wives as you can, depending on your purchasing power.   </p> <p><strong>1.2    HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</strong></p> <p>        Oredo local government area is situated in the middle region of Edo state, politically Oredo is divided into nine villages or clans and has produced a lot of political figures in the state and the country in general, and Benin City is the administrative headquarter of Oredo local government area. The dwellers are the original producer of staple food such as cassava maize, yam, cocoa, etc. the Oba of Benin Omo Noba Nedo Uku Akpolokpolo Oba Erediauwa, Chief Sam igbe who is the Iyase of Benin Kingdom Late Chief Engineer Ima Igiehon, who was the Obayhayomwn of Benin Kingdom, Chief Gabriel Osawaru Igbinedion the Esama of Benin Kingdom , Prince Adun Akanzua and many other prominent princes and chiefs. It has an area of 249km2 and a population of 374, 671 at the 2006 census. The postal code of the area is 300.</p> <p><strong>1.3    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>        In every societies of the world there are some specific structure designated to meet the immediate nee3d of the society consequent upon this is Oredo settlement she has a robust nature of socialization which clearly defines the role of both sexes (male and female). Over the years position of women in Nigeria societies, especially in Oredo, has not be given a serious concern. The girl child’s education has not be given the priority attention especially in the polygamous family. She contributes to languish in social inequality (such as education) and relegated to the background. The resultant effect of this lack of fortune, the girl child is not given adequate attention she is retorted to both growth and development; this is as a result of the unhealthy waling that existed in polygamous family there are always constant quarrels, hatred, disunity, hostility as well as diabolism. Another striking effect inherent in weak or mismanagement of polygamous family is the audience of a broken home.</p> <p><strong>1.4    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>        The purpose of this study is to identify the effects of polygamous family unit on the child education in Oredo local government area.

According to Oichl and Datrymple (2009) when more than 50% of a community population are immunized against a disease, the possibility of epidemic is removed. Supporting this view, Ogbuibe (2005) pointed out that the entry point to be fill introduction of all elements of primary health care system, immunization against diseases in one of the fairly they elements of the child’s survival and development. The national programme of immunization was for certain target groups of the population mainly children within the large group of 0-2 years and pregnant mothers or women. It is target against the six deadly and childhood diseases. These diseases are tuberculosis, measles, poliomyelitis, tetanus, chicken pox and whooping cough. The high rate of mortality from disease preventable by immunization underscores the need for immunization was the most effective programme to reduce these diseases for which satisfactory immunization procedures have been established.</p> <p>When a disease is peculiar to certain area, health authorities may recommend immunization of all persons in that area particularly those who are likely to be exposed to it. To buttress this view, Anderson (2000) suggested that mass immunization against typhoid fever is not advocated but if an epidemic occurs in a community, health authorities may implore all susceptible persons to be immunized. The success of any immunization programme depends largely on the target population. It is pertinent to note that mothers are the persons in the issues of the children rearing pattern in our society whereby the mothers rather than fathers are the home keepers and know better about their children’s immunization status. Therefore, all children should be protected. All mothers should understand the importance of immunization to ensure this, Sohem (2005) recommended the vaccination of all new born children should be registered at all health clinics for routine immunization. This entails that they should undergo all stages of immunization.</p> <p>According to the oxford advanced learners dictionary (2004), immunization is the process of protecting an individual or animal from a disease especially by giving them an injection or a vaccine. Immunization is also defined as a process by which human beings protect themselves from, or against deadly diseases such as poliomyelitis, measles, tuberculosis, diphtheria, whooping cough, vaccination is also another name for immunizing living things against deadly diseases. Immunization is done to make the body resist invasion of pathogenic microbes like bacteria, protozoa and virus. In immunization, a small quantity of a dead parasitic organism is injected into the body of a healthy person (somebody that is free from that parasite organism), the body recognized the antigen as foreign response by realizing specialized protein called antibodies. These antibodies have specific protective properties and the body become immune against the disease that are caused by micro-organisms. Immunization can be active, positive, natural, or acquired.</p> <p>        Immunization is the act of protecting someone against a disease by the intake of inoculation of vaccine or other protective agents which stimulate natural body resistance. It could be active or passive. Immunization is the active which involves administering agents which stimulates the receivers’ own immunological mechanism who responds by producing reactions in his resistance to infect by the organisms from which the antigen was derived or obtained. This takes several weeks to produce effective protection hence, it has a prophylactic value but last forever. On the other hand, immunization is said to be passive by the giving of already made anti-bodies formed by another lost in response to natural injection. This has immediate protective and therapeutic value but last for a short period.</p> <p>        Parent especially the mothers in question do not get their children immunized. The superstition belief or idea that disease are caused by witches and wizards are strongly rooted in their mind, some believes that diseases are caused by evil spirit and the only way out for them to avoid it is by offering sacrifice and some believe that it is the sin that the parents have committed towards the gods that make the child to be like that and there is no solution to the sickness of the child.</p> <p>        Some parent know where and how to obtain it but do not take their children to the clinic for immunization while others that made attempts to take their children to the clinic for immunization may start and will not complete the normal dose they are supposed to give to that child. In a particular health center, i.e. Ikpoba Okha Health center in Edo State, between January 2007 to December 2010, fifty six thousand six hundred and forty two (56,642) children were registered for different types of immunization. Out of these only thirty four thousand six hundred and twenty two (34, 622) children completed their immunization, the remaining twenty two thousand and twenty (22,020) fall to complete their immunization. Some mothers later brought their children to complete their immunization after a long time. When they asked them why they did not bring their children ever since, the most population reason they gave was that, they were not chanced due to their jobs. They devoted much time to their jobs e.g. trading, government workers etc others said they came several times but in most occasions, the nurses asked them to go home that the health of their babies was poor.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>        The decision to carry out the study was due to the problem associated with immunization of children among the illiterate mothers in Esan West Local Government Area. In the past, many children died before the age of 5 or before the school age due to communicable diseases e.g. tuberculosis, diphtheria, poliomyelitis, whooping cough, measles, tetanus etc. they did not know that these disease could be prevented. These communicable disease were discovered by scientific researcher, clinics are established where the disease can be  prevented by treatment. Many people are not still making use of the clinic and health center, perhaps due to ignorance, inability of mothers to get the facilities or non availability of vaccine or lack of understanding.</p> <p><strong>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  </strong></p> <p>        This research work is an attempt to study the attitude of mothers towards immunization in Esan West Local Government Area in Edo State. The purpose of this study is to:</p> <ol><li>To find out why mothers refused to bring their children for immunization</li> <li>To know why some mothers started but refuse to complete the normal schedule</li> <li>To know or find out how many children register in the clinic and health center for the immunization during the period of January 2010 to December 2010.</li> <li>To know the number of children who started the immunization and completed the normal schedule</li> <li>To know the number of children that started the immunization but refuse to complete it.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY   </strong></p> <p>        This research is expected to be of great importance to parents and the general public in Esan West Local Government Area who will appreciate the implication of the problem of immunization and know the best way to handle them.

Any critical observer of Nigerians socio-economic condition will agree that the living condition of some people are below standard. It can be observed that majority of these street trading are exposed to danger, for instance female street vendors frequently become victims of rate, this is dangerous because forced sexual activity may cause infection that may cause irreparable damage to her reproductive system. This project therefore will examine street trading and rape in Oredo Local government Area of Edo State.</p> <p>        Oredo Local Government Area is one of the three local government areas that make up the state capital, Benin City with its administrative headquarter at king square in the city centre. The people there are mostly sole proprietors, small scale traders and also street traders and as such could not afford large scale enterprises, hence they embrace little that can yield income for them to cater for themselves and families. Some examples of the traders done on street are;</p> <p>1)   Sales of recharge cards</p> <p><strong>2)  </strong>Mini provision kiosks</p> <p><strong>3)  </strong>Retail shops</p> <p><strong>4)  </strong>Selling of corn</p> <p><strong>5)  </strong>Roasting of plantain (i.e. bole). Etc.</p> <p>Street trading according to Uwoyo (1995) is a trade done on a public road in city, town or village. It is as a result of low financial status of the people with the inability of creating lager business enterprises that can yield good income street trading in Oredo Local Government Areas is mostly caused by poverty. For example; a commercial motorcyclist popularly known as Okada Riders, with a family if 6 (six) children and whose wife finds it difficult to use the money gotten from his Okada Business to cater for his family will set up a little sole proprietorship business or give his wife little money to open any street trade to help the family. However in another view by Nwoyo (2005), street trading can also be caused by lack of education, high birth rate, frustration, etc.</p> <p>        Okeyo (1998) gave the following as the main criteria used to describe street trading:</p> <p>1)   It is usually sited on streets</p> <p>2)   It is usually a sole proprietorship business</p> <p>3)   Financial strength</p> <p>4)   Scale of value</p> <p>5)   Relative size and initial capital outlay</p> <p>Basically, as a manifestation of various attempts by the developing world to chart the course of new economic growth and development, it is also vital to note the prospects; Ogoke (2005) explained that in Nigeria, street trading constitutes the largest proportion of societal trade sector.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM  </strong></p> <ol><li>This work is designed to show the causes and the effect of rape.</li> <li>To examine the factor responsible for rape.</li> <li>This research work is also designed to suggest workable solution to the problems of street trading and rape.</li> </ol> <p><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <ol><li>To examine the factors responsible for street trading</li> <li>To enlighten people about the effect of street trading and rape.</li> <li>To bring government attention to street trading.</li> <li>To proffer solution to these factors responsible for street trading and rape.</li> </ol> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS </strong></p> <p>1)   What are the causes of street trading?</p> <p>2)   Does street trading effects the people in Oredo Local Government?</p> <p>3)   What are the reasons for rape</p> <p>4)   How can street trading be minimized in Oredo Local Government Area.</p> <p>5)   What are the role of parents in street trading?</p> <p>6)   What are the role of government in the street trading?  </p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>          The major significance of this study is to proffer solution to the menace of street trading and rape in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State. it is hoped that the study will help in minimizing problems associated with street trading and will increase the body of knowledge on the operation of street trading which is in form of sole Proprietorship business, it is also helped that the study will be useful to economic planners, sole proprietors, street traders and decision makers.</p> <p><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        This research work is limited to Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State. It is to examine the causes and the effect of street trading and rape in Oredo Local Government Area.

On the issue of health, Lawrence, (2006) on his own sees family planning as a health service that keeps couples decide whether to have children and if so, when and how many. Telling on the population size of any location. Frederick (2004) writes that “the population size of any location is the ratio of the sum total of the number of persons in an area to the size of the area they occupied per square M2.</p> <p>        The family is known to comprise of the father, mother and the children. The numbers of children given birth to by each family residing in any locality has either negative or positive impact on the overall population size in such geographical location. Apart from the above definitions of family planning, the writers see family planning as the process of controlling the number of children you have by using contraception.</p> <p>        Family planning and the problems of population control have been a major concern to both the government and individuals over the years, Nigeria in general and Edo State in particular have been experiencing a geometric increase in population and as a result government budget  and revenue allocation have equally increased. Sincerely speaking, for some couples of years back, Edo State government had made several efforts, especially at the grass root to sensitize people on the needs in family planning in addition to providing adequate basic facilities to meet the needs of the dwellers, it is annoying to see that all these efforts have not yielded positive results. This negatively could be as a result of illiteracy on the parts of the parents.</p> <p>        Autchinson in Osula, (2000) stated some other reasons for the alarming increase in population. The ever increasing population size is encouraged by several factors such as (i) problems of child spacing (ii) unwanted pregnancy resulting from frustrated youths (iii) pursuance of money (prostitutions)” etc it was in a bid to check this ugly situation that Edo State government is been using mass media, television, radio, workshop, seminars and so on to educate, enlighten and sensitize people on the needs for family planning and the dangers, disadvantages and problems of uncontrolled population rate.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>        This research work principally address the following problems:</p> <ol><li>Religious belief as a means of discouragement to family planning.</li> <li>Unwanted pregnancy resulting from frustration and pursuance of money by our youths. </li> <li>Problem of inadequate information.</li> <li>Financial predicaments ravaging some homes.</li> </ol> <p><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        The research is designed to find the means to control family planning that results to problems of population control. The study therefore has the following, as its specific objectives.</p> <ol><li>To find out if religious belief discourages people from family planning.</li> <li>To identify the causes of unwanted pregnancy resulting to control of population among our youths.</li> <li>To find out if inadequate information can lead to family planning.</li> <li>To find out if financial predicaments has role/roles to play in family planning/population control.</li> </ol> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>        Specifically, that study will attempt to provide answers to the following questions:</p> <ol><li>Does finance as a problem contributing to family planning resulting to problem of population control?</li> <li>Does religion belief discourage family planning?</li> <li>Is there any difference between unwanted pregnancy and frustration/pursuance of money to population control?</li> <li>Does inadequate information contribute to the problem of population control?</li> </ol> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        The study is aimed at investigating family planning and problem of population control in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State. The result of this finding will go a long way to enhance the positive attitude of couples in spacing out their children. It will also expose couples to the various contraceptives methods. The investigation will also serve as an eye opener to the government in providing adequate basic facilities, and finally, researchers in the field of population statistics, growth and control will find the findings of this study very useful.</p> <p><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>        The terms used in this study are defined within the context of the study.

Entrepreneurial development through education will advance the economy of the nation; much credence should be given to it and ingrained with focus on profitable personal development. Unemployment prevails in the country, hence, the growth of violence, poverty and segregation amongst citizens, because the educational system itself fails to empower the ones passing through it. This research work, therefore examines the strategies of entrepreneurial education carried out in two of the universities pioneering it; Federal University of Technology, Akure, and Covenant University Ota, the former being a public university and the latter a private university. The objectives of the study were to appraise if educational styles arouse interest of students in the industries of their discipline; to explore the effectiveness of entrepreneurial development strategy in education in universities that implements it; to see if the current university educational system stimulates entrepreneurial creativity in its students. The methodology adopted was a mixed analysis of quantitative and qualitative parameters based on the survey design which relied on primary and secondary sources ofgathering data, through the use of questionnaires and interview instruments. One hundred (100) questionnaires were administered, and they were all returned. The study adopted quota and simple random sampling technique. The data was analyzed and presented using tables and percentages. The findings of this research portrays a huge disparity between the perception and conceptualization of entrepreneurship in the graduates of each university used in the study, this further highlights the significant impact of the system of teaching entrepreneurship within the two universities. The study shows that entrepreneurial education should be taught with field oriented and practical approaches. It was discovered that graduates from Covenant University are more apt to creating value, and are more self driven and willing to use opportunities available to them whether or not they have an employment. The study recommends that there should be a working partnership, bridging the gap between the higher institutions and the industry. Lecturers should have field experience to aid communication and teaching of the courses and Universities should work toward becoming entrepreneurial hubs for students and young entrepreneurs. The government should also focus more on the youth age group for entrepreneurship development in the country amongst other things critical to the development of the nation.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p> Nigeria is bedeviled by a myriad of problems which, despite her oil wealth, inhibit her development and even threaten her continued existence as a sovereign state. Nigeria’s socio-political and economic circumstances give the significant indication that many of her problems stem from an origin of artificial colonial construct which lumped together a variety of separate peoples. Fragmentation of the nation is seen as a distinct possibility unless its citizens can be induced to accept a new sense of Nigerian identity, involving a commitment to the survival of the present state as a cohesive entity. This would necessitate a number of radical changes, not only in the political and economic structure of the country but also in the psychology of the people.</p> <p>Nigerians have lived through series of administrations underdifferent governments, and the question still arises, ‘is Nigeria a nation at all?’ A critical look at what the government calls reform reveals a personally instituted concept of governance, filling the seats of power with those they believe to be their kin, rather than have professionals in the positions of merit, and a breed of people typified by their integrity of heart, ingrained in the trainings and qualifications they have received in the course of service to the nation. The increasing number of those who are not gainfully employed or adequately educated in the country, remain preys as political tools of violence as it has been seen in the history of violence occurring in the country over a period of time. The country has depended much on oil as its major source of revenue for years, however, the current administration also fails to recognize that the future of the country may very well depend on the economy of its people(the youths), which is possibly the only untapped, ill harnessed, most lucrative resource of the country. If it remains this way in the next ten years, putting into consideration the effect of increased poverty, lack of employment, poor educational system, it is unpredictable what the result will be. The table below shows the statistical data of the rate of unemployment and the population rate from 2006 to 2011 in Nigeria. It is the result of a survey carried out by the National Bureau of Statistics and shows that persons aged 0-14 years constituted 39.6%, those aged between 15-64 (the economically active population), constituted 56.3%, while those aged 65 years and above constituted 4.2%. Analysis of employment data for the past 5 years show that the rate of new entrants into the labour market has not been uniform in the past five years.</p> <p>The rate was on the increase from 2007 to 2009 but declined significantly from 2009 to 2010. The rate increased again from 2010 to 2011. Within the five year period, there has been an average of about 1.8 million new entrants into the active labour market per year.</p> <p> Governments, or local leaders, who are generally not held accountable for how much money is spent, and how education systems are managed,</p> <p>Sufficiency attitude – What is provided for the poor is good enough</p> <p> Inadequate pro-poor infrastructure or support systems this makes it difficult to implement successful poverty eradication interventions</p> <p> A lack of systematic tracking of pro-poor interventions –  in this way, it is extremely difficult to know if the activities and programmes implemented have had any impact at all. Nigeria cannot combat the ills of the society just by raising its budget; there should be a strategic systematic approach to education that would bridge the gap between its service delivery and its effectiveness in the country.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Education in Nigeria is devoid of the element crucial to averting the surging rate of unemployment in the country, therefore the breeding of psychological dependence on direct access to money. Entrepreneurial development through education will advance the economy of the nation; much credence should be given to it and ingrained with focus on profitable personal development. Unemployment prevails in the country, hence, the growth of violence, poverty and segregation amongst citizens, because the educational system itself fails to empower the ones passing through it. This should be the core message of the evolving educational policy of Nigeria which is devoid of a system of education that emphasizes on the need to culture the country's young through the knowledge of rudimentary entrepreneurial development, common cultural heritage, and identification of exploitable strengths of structures, systems and cultures of others.</p> <p><strong>Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>1.     To appraise if educational styles arouse interest of students in the industries of their discipline.</p> <p>2.     To explore the effectiveness of entrepreneurial development course/training in education in universities that offers it.</p> <p>3.     To see if the current university educational system stimulates entrepreneurial creativity in its students</p> <p><strong>1.4 Research Questions</strong></p> <ol><li>Can unemployment problem in Nigeria be solved through entrepreneurial development? </li> <li>Is the entrepreneurial development programmes of government been able to lessen the unemployment problem in Nigeria?</li> <li>The role of entrepreneurs in economic development is to increasing per capital output and income of a country?</li> <li>Entrepreneurship facilitates the use of local raw materials and other resources?</li> <li>Entrepreneurship education promotes interdependence of business in a country?</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5 Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The focus of this study brings to the fore the crucial need for entrepreneurial education in Nigeria, putting more consideration on the educational system, strategies and its eventual social developmental effect in the society. The study highlights the problems of the level of education in the country and its equivalence to level of poverty in the society by virtue of lack of employment or knowledge of how to startup businesses. One of the MDG goals highlights education as a critical factor for reducing poverty and dependency in developed nations. Therefore, this thesis contributes to knowledge by identifying what is important to the economy, which is qualitative education focused on the needs of the economy per time, rather than the resolution of the United Nations to increase budgetary details or increasing the number of people that go through school. This is not the first paper on entrepreneurial education; however, it is the first to do a comparative study on what is being implemented by different universities to see its effectiveness in order to ascertain the strategy which would eventually help for the Nigerian economy in truly eradicating unemployment in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study examines the role of entrepreneurial education in the development of Nigeria, its significance in the reduction of unemployment in Nigeria and  including a comparison between universities that implement para-entrepreneurship educational systems. The study considered the undergraduates of the current university system, from levels one to the final year, those who gained admission into the university in the last five (5) years. This study period is considered to be relevant because of its immediate impact on the future of Nigeria, through which one can discover if the role education plays currently will facilitate national development. The study considers students and graduates of Covenant University, Ota and Federal University of Technology, Akure as case studies. It is a comparative study between the two universities; the former being a Christian private university, and the latter a federal university. The two universities have embraced entrepreneurial education as part of their curriculums for at least three (3) years.</p>\n\nENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION AS A TOOL FOR REDUCING UNEMPLOYMENT IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION AS A TOOL FOR REDUCING UNEMPLOYMENT IN NIGERIA", "id": 64}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES, PREVALENCE AND EFFECT OF FEMALE PROSTITUTION IN NIGERIAN TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS</strong></p> <p><strong>(A CASE STUDY OF COLLEGE OF EDUCATION, EKIADOLOR-BENIN)</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>The study investigated into the causes, prevalence and effect of female prostitution in Nigerian tertiary institutions: a case study of College of Education, Ekiadolor-Benin.

These young people see selling of their bodies as the fastest way of getting income for their keeps. In the past those engaged in prostitution use to be women selling their bodies. However, today men have joined the trade of selling their bodies for different reasons including drugs, jobs or contracts and also good grades in exams. This is because sex consumers include politicians, bosses in offices, lecturers who find pleasure in exploiting the lower class by offering mouth watering opportunities in exchange for sex. (Alufohai, 2007). She further stated that some of the causes of prostitution are high level of poverty due to unemployment rate in the society, bribery and corruption. Family expectations and other problems are factors why men and women get involved in prostitution. Women most especially are pressured into the business to be able to cater for family and siblings education.</p> <p>Prostitution leads to the spread of STDs (sexually transmitted diseases), AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), HPV (human papiloma virus), herpes amongst others. Some women suffer trauma and pelvic pains, in most cases these women are subjected to drinking and smoking to ease off the pain and this habit could cause cancer which puts their lives in more jeopardy and increases mortality rate of the country. (Alufohai, 2007)</p> <p>A university don, Prof. Elizabeth Balogun, on Wednesday (2007) in Abeokuta, Ogun State, expressed her concern over the prevalence of prostitution among female undergraduates in the country. Balogun said the sex trade had become rampant on Nigerian campuses to such an extent that 80 percent of prostitutes that patronize night clubs, hotels and tourist centres in Ogun State are students of tertiary institutions. Prof. Balogun, a Biochemistry lecturer at the University of Ilorin, said this at a seminar organized by the National Association of Nigerian Students to mark its 31stanniversary where she delivered a lecture titled “Prostitution on our campuses: Effects and solutions.”</p> <p>The guest speaker, who expressed regret said, “It is absurd to the level that young undergraduate lady would leave normal academic chores of attending lectures and visiting libraries for further studies during the day, only to metamorphose in the evening into a call-girl or pimp. “There is no doubt that prostitution in the long run corrupts the quality of the nation’s future leaders and affects their values. Understanding that young females constitute appreciable percentage of the nation’s population, little could be expected from them productively if they had been turned into cheap sexual machines, with warped self-esteem and self- actualization. “Inordinate desire for affluence and desperation by many Nigerians, especially ladies lure them to engage in immoral and illicit activities, despite high level of religiousness which Nigerians overtly demonstrate. Even the present scourge of HIV/AIDS and the menace of ritual killers that find easy prey among prostitutes, have not been strong enough to curb the rising trend of the practice.” She urged the government to improve funding on education in order to drastically reduce cost of attaining higher education which will curb the rising trend of the practice.</p> <p>According to Alfred Obiora Uzokwe (2008) Prostitution is said to be one of the oldest professions in the world. It is alluded to in the bible and ancient civilizations, like Rome and Greece, had to contend with it. As I write, inspite of the penalties entrenched in the laws of most nations, against this illicit trade, it still flourishes. In most cases, though, those who engage in the trade are independent women, old enough to make decisions for themselves and willing to bear attendant repercussions. What happens, however, when prostitution becomes a pastime for young girls still dependent on their parents for subsistence? More specifically, what happens when the act of prostitution shifts from the cigarette smoke-filled rooms of brothels and the dark alleyways of major cities, to the esteemed halls of citadels of higher learning? Essentially, some of our young girls, sent to universities to acquire knowledge and become productive citizens in the nation, have found a vocation in prostitution.</p> <p>According to Punch Online (June 10, 2008) they now ply the trade right inside the university campuses. By day, they masquerade as students, attending classes and going to the libraries like other students but by night, they shed their academic garbs and don that of the oldest profession in the world. The Punch Online story sent cold chills down my spine and one is certain that when parents of young girls in Nigerian universities read this story, they will find themselves scampering after their children to ask some poignant questions. It goes without saying that every aspect of this news is bad for the universities as well as for the nation. Our female undergraduates are not only exposing themselves to danger, they are also mortgaging their future on the altar of quick money and instant sensual gratification. Furthermore, Nigerian universities that used to be the source of pride to those of us that passed through them, no longer bear any resemblance to the institutions we once knew. Standard of education has fallen; armed robbers and cultists have moved in and now the campuses are deluged by students-turned prostitutes.</p> <p>The researcher in her view said that the interest she developed in this issue stems from her belief that if not arrested, it will deal a devastating and final blow on the standard of education in Nigeria, summarily shattering, to smithereens, the moral fabric of a nation that is already in tatters. It is shocking that this malady has largely been left unchecked and is spreading like wild fire. \"The trend is ever becoming more dangerous in Nigeria today as prostitution is no longer a thing of the street and brothels but is fast turning higher institutions in the country into red light districts.</p> <p>Today, the Nasarawa State University is fast gaining a reputation as an abode for girls of easy going virtues despite the high prevalence of HIV/AIDs in the country and particularly in Nasarawa State. (George Okoh, 2007). He further confesses that if he had to guess where this illicit trade would be flourishing; Nasarawa State University would not have been on my list. But I guess that times have really changed immensely. Most people may be wondering why prostitution would be flourishing inside university/college campuses, under the very nose of university staff and security agents. One of the principle reasons believe, is that university campus authorities have failed to strike the right balance between ensuring student liberty and enforcement of existing campus codes of conduct. Saying that the students are adults that should know better, they let them call the shots. The problem is that with unbridled liberty and freedom, the students began to push the limits of acceptable behavior, making unrestricted foray into the sublime and dangerous. Taking advantage of the freedom bestowed on them as \"adults\", our young girls devised creative ways to trade in prostitution right inside the campuses. Investigations conducted by various newspaper correspondents’ show that the method of operation, employed by these girls, vary from campus to another and from one individual to another. The hardened ones, who see their campuses as too boring, do not operate inside the university campuses. Instead, they brazenly take their trade directly to their customers \"where the real action is\". In other words, at night, they taxi into nearby cities or towns, to hot spots that would give them maximum exposure to men willing to pay anything for sensual pleasure. Some walk the streets, when they get to town, until male customers, who are willing to patronize them, materialize. Because the girls do not fear for their safety or health, they follow the customers to their homes, brothels or nightclubs.</p> <p>According to Okoh, (2008) young female undergraduates of Colleges of Education, mainly between the ages of 18 to 25 years, take advantage of the proximity of their school to the major cities. The girls leave their campus dorms on Fridays, pretending to be going home for the weekend, when their actual destinations are high brow brothels, night clubs and the streets in different cities. Their sole aim is to go and pleasure, for money, men that some call \"aristo\"- a term of endearment for wealthy and powerful men. Okoh further reports that, \"In most cases, they [the girls] return back to the school, after the weekend, with large sums of money. To some of these girls, it's just having fun on the weekend but for the fact that in most times they sleep around and collect money from men they hardly know.\"</p> <p>        The world prostitution is the act or practice of providing sexual services to another person in return for payment. The person who receives payment for sexual services is called a prostitute and the person who receives such services is known by a multitude of terms including “John” prostitution is one of the branches of sex industry. The legal status of prostitution varies from country to country, from being a punishable crime to a regulated profession. Estimates place the annual revenue generated from the global prostitution industry to be over 100 billion. Prostitution is sometimes referred to as “the world’s oldest profession. Prostitution occurs in a variety of forms. Brothels are establishments specifically dedicated to prostitution. In escort prostitution, the act may take place at the customers’ residence or hotel room (referred to as out-call) or at the escort’ residence (called in-call). Another form in street prostitution. Sex tourism refers to traveling, typically from developed to under-developed nations of one type of human trafficking is defined as using coercion or force to transport an unwilling person into prostitution or other sexual exploitation.</p> <p>        Prostitute is defined from the Latin prostitute. Some sources cite the verb as a composition of “pro” meaning “up front” or “forward” and “situere” defined as to off up for sale. Another exploitation is that prostitute is a composition of pro and stature (to cause to stand to station place erect). A literal translation therefore would be to put up front for sale or to place forward. The online Etymology Dictionary states, “the notion of sex for hire is not inherent in the etymology, which rather suggests one exposed to lust or sex indiscriminately offered. The word prostitute was then carried down through various languages to the present day western society. Most sex worker activists group reject the word prostitute and since the late 1970s have used the term sex work instead. However, a sex worker can also mean anyone who works within the sex industry or whose work is of a sex nature and is not limited solely to prostitutes. In the early 17th century, there was widespread male and female prostitution throughout the cities of Isyoto, Edo and Osaka, Japan. Oiran were Courtesaus in Japan during the Edo period. The Oiran were considered a type of Yojo “woman of pleasure” or prostitute. Among the Oiran the Taju was considered the highest rank of courtesan available only to the wealthiest and highest rank of courtesaus available only to the wealthiest and highest ranking men. To entertain their client, Oiran practiced the arts of dance, music, poetry, and calligraphy as well as sexual services, and educated with was considered essential for sophisticated conversation. Many became celebrities of their times outside the pleasure district. Their art and fashion often set trends among wealthy women. The last recorded Oiran was in (1961). Although illegal in modern Japan, the definition of prostitution does not extend to a private reached between a woman and man in a brothel. Yoshiware has a large number of soap lands that began when explicit prostitution in Japan became illegal, where women washed men’s bodies. They were originally known as Toruko-buro, meaning Turkish bath. In ancient Greek society, prostitution was engaged in by both women and boys. The Greek word for prostitutes is porne derived from the verb pernemi (tonseu), with the evident modern evolution. The English word pornography, and its corollaries in other languages are directly derived from the Greek word porno. Female prostitutes could be independent and sometimes influential women.</p> <p>They were required to wear distinctive dresses and had to pay taxes. Some similarities have been found between the Greek hetaera and the Japanese Oiran. Some prostitutes in ancient Greece such as lais were as famous for their company as their beauty but some of these women charged extraordinary sums for their services. In ancient Rome, a registered prostitute was called a meretrix while unregistered one fell under the broad category prostibulae. There were some commonalities with the Greek system, but as the empire grew, prostitutes were often foreign slaves captured, purchased, or raised for that purpose sometimes by large scale prostitute farmers who took abandoned children. Indeed, abandoned children were almost always raised as prostitutes. Enslavement into prostitution was sometimes used as a legal punishment against criminal free women. Buyers were allowed to inspect naked men and women for sale in private and there was no stigma attached to the purchase of males by a man aristocrat.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>          Statistically, prostitution is an alarming problem to the human society. Prostitution is a form of violence against women, it is violation of human rights. With a higher instance of physical violence perpetrated        against them, female prostitutes are more likely to get murdered. This is a common occurrence across the country and contributes to the incidence of children without parents. Prostitutes have an increase incidence of sexually transmitted diseases. A study in Minecapolis, Minnesota revealed that only 15% of prostitutes who had prostituted for at least six months has an S.T.D. This figure does not include HIV/AIDS, Gynecological examination of the prostitutes in this study revealed an alarming incidence of positive pap tests. These women are at greater risk of cervical cancer and could spread the human papiloma virus among the population of the Minecapolis St. Paul Metropolitan area, either through direct transmission or indirect transmission.</p> <p>        The research reveals that rather than facing conditions of slavery men and women working as prostitutes are subjected to abuses which are similar in nature to those experienced by others working in low stratus jobs in the informal sector. However, the marginal position of sex workers in society excludes them from the international, national and customary protection afforded to other as citizens, workers or women. Their vulnerability to human and labor rights violations is greater than that of others because of the stigma and criminal charges widely attached to sex work. The report recommend that all national legislation which in intent or in practice results in the placing of sex workers outside the scope of the rule of law, should be repealed. The abolitionist approach declares that the institution of prostitution itself constitutes a violation of human rights. Raymond wishes to establish that all immigrant women working as prostitutes are victims f slavery and abuse. Average prostitution in Edo State was 70% female, 20%, male prostitutes and 10% customer. Whereas street prostitution accounts between 10 to 20% of the prostitution in Edo State. Research revealed that only 3-5% of the sexually transmitted diseases in Edo State relented to prostitution compared with 30-35% among teenagers. However, prevalent rate for prostitutes was approximately 50 percent in Edo State.</p> <p><strong>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The purpose of the study is to investigate into the causes, prevalence and effect of female prostitution in Nigerian tertiary institutions: College of Education, Ekiadolor as a case study.</p> <p>        Another objective of the study is also to find out whether poverty is a major cause of female prostitution in the Nigerian tertiary institutions. </p> <p><strong>1.4    HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <ol><li>Involvement of female students in prostitution leads to poor academic performance.</li> <li>Personal greed leads to student involvement in prostitution.</li> <li>Offering sex for grades is a form of campus prostitution.</li> <li>Involvement in prostitution causes neglect of academic work.</li> <li>Many female students of College of Education, Ekiadolor engage in prostitution.</li> <li>The economic status of a country affects the spread of female prostitution in Nigerian tertiary institutions.</li> <li>The friends one move with influence one into prostitution</li> <li>Prostitution affects health state and results in communicable diseases.</li> <li>Campus prostitution is now a common business in Nigerian tertiary institutions, especially College of Education, Benin City, Edo State.</li> <li>Poor  financial background of parents enhances the spread of female prostitution</li> <li>Corruption lead to female prostitution</li> <li>Poverty lead to female prostitution.</li> <li>Female students sell their bodies to teacher/lecturers because they want to get high grades in examination.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>         This study will help the government to re-evaluate its previous policies about prostitution and come up with a more realistic policies and programmes.</p> <p>Parents will also benefit, in that it will make them to become more alive to their responsibilities.</p> <p><strong>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The scope of this study covers the four schools in the College of Education, Ekiadolor-Benin which are school of sciences, school of arts and social sciences, school of vocational and technical studies, and school of languages.</p> <p><strong>1.8    DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Prostitution: </strong>The practice of engaging in relatively indiscriminate sexual activity in general with individual other than a spouse in exchange for immediate payment in cash or kind.</p> <p><strong>Youth: </strong>An individual that is aged between twenty and forty.</p> <p><strong>Contraceptive: </strong>A device, drug or chemical agent that is intended to prevent conception.</p> <p><strong>Abortion: </strong>It involves force termination of pregnancy by drugs or any other means.</p> <p><strong>Venereal diseases: </strong>It refers to those diseases got from sexual intercourse.</p> <p><strong>AIDS: </strong>Acquire Immune Deficiency Syndrome.</p> <p><strong>HIV: </strong>Human Immuno Deficiency Virus.</p>\n\nAN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES, PREVALENCE AND EFFECT OF FEMALE PROSTITUTION IN NIGERIAN TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES, PREVALENCE AND EFFECT OF FEMALE PROSTITUTION IN NIGERIAN TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS", "id": 65}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>AN ASSESSMENT OF THE REHABILITATORY FUNCTION OF NIGERIAN PRISON SERVICE</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>The central thrust of this research is to assess the Rehabilitatory function of Nigeria</em> <em>prison using Makurdi prison. Prison have always been considered as rehabilitative and reformatory centre, However, in reality as a result of a number of factors this may not be completely successful as expected. It may become a breeding ground for criminals. This is the problem facing</em> <em>every society and Nigeria prison are not insulated from this problem. Against this backdrop this</em> <em>study attempts to empirically assess the rehabilitation in Nigeria prison with Makurdi (Medium security Prison ) as a case study. To achieve this sample size, of 20 prison officials and 80 inmates were selected through simple random sampling by the use of prison register. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected through the use of questionnaire and interview method. Also the analysis of data was through the combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis. This result of the data analysis showed that  the respondents varied in socio-demographic characteristics such as  age, sex, marital status, educational qualification, religion offence committed etc. Further, the data showed that many of the inmates said that there is Rehabilitatory scheme such as carpentry work, electrical work ,shoe making etc. Through some opined that despite the existing scheme it was only meant for convicts and only awaiting trail inmates  were excluded from t benefiting in such schemes. The data also showed that the few among the inmates</em> <em>who are</em> <em>convicts said that they would be better person on release and will enable them secure job either at formal or informal sector. Most of the inmates considered the prison as place of rehabilitation are inadequate, Also, the study showed that inadequate funding ,societal stigmatization, congestion, inadequate attention from government has contributed to the hitches of rehabilitation in Makurdi prison. Despite the aforementioned problems the prison still has been able to play the role of rehabilitation at a small measure. Finally, the study discovered that congestion of inmates, stigmatization of  convicts by the society has been a big challenge to the institution, On the basis of the findings the study recommended that issues of prison rehabilitation and reformation must be taken seriously in other to achieve the set objectives of rehabilitation which the prison was established.</em></p> <p> <strong>CHAPTER</strong> <strong>ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>                                                INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1  Background to</strong> <strong>the Study</strong></p> <p>       Prison is an institution designed  to securely house people who have been convicted of crime or are on awaiting trial. These individuals known as prisoners or inmates are kept in continuous custody on a short or long-term basis. Individuals who commit the most heinous crime are sent to prison for more years, the more serious the offence ,the longer the prison term imposed (Microsoft Encarta 2008).</p> <p>        Also according to McCorkle and Korn (1970)., Prison can be defined  as a physical structures in a geographical location, where a number of people living under highly specialized condition utilize the resources and adjust to the alternatives presented to them by a unique kind of social environment.</p> <p>A prison is seen as a total institution or a place of residence  and work  where a large number of  like situated individuals are cut off from the wider society for appreciable period of time together lead and enforce formally administered round of life.</p> <p>      Adelola, (1982), opined that the physical appearance of prison is of  tall wall supplanted with barbwires an iron gates antiquated buildings separated</p> <p>Prisons from its larger community outside. These isolated structures according to him are meant to accomplish the confinement aspect. While confinement is made to detach the prisoners from his previous infectious groups, this new, environment is expected to provide the prisoner with particular opportunities of rethinking, stock taking and repentance from old ways.</p> <p>         Historically, this type of punishment for crime had been determined by economic and political relationship rather than by the public police or any Penological theory. In early English or German law, a system of adjusting  wrongs and injuries existed. where by the offender was  able to buy off the vengeance against him and his kin by compensation, fines, mutilation, banishment ,enslavement and death were other types of  punishment for offenders, Long-term imprisonment was virtually unknown until modern times. In ancient Greece and Rome for example, Mamertine  prison, constructed in Rome in the  17th century B.C, consisted of  a vast network of dungeons under the cities main sewer (Morris 1978: 475). These subterranean laws held political dissident and criminals for periods of time in cramped, miserable conditions. However, the  practice of confining wrong doers for long period as</p> <p>in form of punishment was not wide spread until after 15th century (Microsoft Encarta, 2010).</p> <p>       More so, imprisonment as a form of punishment of offenders was not known to many pre- colonial communities in African. There were traditional institutions in Nigeria that served as prison before British rule. For example, the  ‘‘Evedo” of  Edo group and  “Ogboni” of  Yoruba  group houses respectively were all places for keeping those put away for some time while other forms existed among the Fulanis and Tivs  (Akeredulo Ale 1979:156)</p> <p>        Rehabilitation according to oxford advanced learner’s dictionary means to help some body returned to a normal life or therapy.</p> <p>       Rehabilitation  penology was said to have developed at the  beginning of the 20th century in England (Carten and Cook,1989). It was more concern with the criminal than mere punishment. In other words, an individual sentencing was aimed at removing the causes of his criminal behavior (Tamerbraun 19780.</p> <p>         Prison goals as laid down in the Nigerian Prison training manual state that prison service establishment, are based on the custodial and rehabilitative roles of prison of prison institutions usually, the resettlements of discharging</p> <p>prisoners into purposeful, meaningful community life is the major role and aim</p> <p>of the Nigerian prison. Accordingly, prison education and vocational training programmes have been at the centre of the process adopted by the institutions in the realization of these goals. One hidden agenda of  imprisonment has been to punish criminals for their crime and to deter offenders  from committing crime. The way prisoners perceive the objectives of  imprisonment, it is assumed will affect their responsiveness to prison  rehabilitation programmes, especially vocational training. But up till date  this continues  to be the  ideal picture of  Nigerian  prison and other prisons world wide.</p> <p>           According to Awake (2005), there are four reasons why law  breakers are put in prison to punish the offender. To rehabilitate the criminal, teaching him or her to be law abiding and productive after release , to protect the  society and prevent future crimes has been the  ideal role of Nigeria prisons.</p> <p>         Although prison policy called for  provision of  legal, religions, educational , vocational, and social welfare services, Nigeria’s prison system as in most third world  countries is grossly  inadequate. There is no systematic classification of prisoners, so that young and the old, and suspects  for minor offences most of  whom are pretrial detainees and  first time offenders incarcerated for  extended  periods and eventual release  upon acquittal  were</p> <p>inter-mixed with dangerous  and deranged criminals or repeat offenders. This  has worsened the role of  Nigeria prison to rehabilitate inmates or prisoner effectively.</p> <p>          However, the extent to which Nigerian prison fulfils these roles may be doubtful in view of the nature of the treatment of the offenders and resources available to accomplish these roles of rehabilitating inmate in prison. Therefore, the major concern of this study is to carry out an assessment of  the rehabilitative function of Nigeria prison to see whether Nigeria prison are accomplishing these set tasks  of rehabilitation for which they were established using the Makurdi Medium Security Prison to determine to what extent it has successful in performing this function of rehabilitation and to proffer solutions.</p> <p><strong>1.2  Statement of research</strong>  <strong>problem</strong></p> <p>       One begins to wonder whether the Nigerian prison  is performing  these role of rehabilitation as a set  objective considering the tremendous upsurge  in the number of crimal activities such as: arm robbery, burglar, economic saboteur, drug pushing ,pipe-line vandalism, coup d’état and other dissident whose action threatens the social fabric of the nation.</p> <p>        Also over the year, the prison as   rehablitatory institution has been subject of various studies. However, very  little attention has been paid to how the</p> <p>system of government and other external factors affects positively or negatively on rehabilitation in prison in Nigeria. There is a growing concern among the Nigerian public that prisons are fast loosing its value to the fact that it has failed to rehabilitate and reform criminals. Studies have shown that the condition of most Nigerian prison is unfavorable for the full realization of rehabilitation goals.</p> <p>         For instance, life in Nigerian prison is so regimented to the extent that it appears that the primary purpose is punctive. Once as put succinctly by Chiemeka B. (2005;5) is that  the current state of affair of  prisons can only  take  criminals off the street for a while, it seems that they do little, if any thing to deter  crime in the long term.</p> <p>   Some prisoners come out of the prison  and form a clique of hoodlums and engage in criminal activities that are more devastating and debilitating to the society. The work therefore, is designed to bring lime or make an assessment of the rehabilitative function of Nigeria prison in Makurdi.

(2004:8) rehabilitation refers to post- release efforts made to make it easier for the offender to resettle (or be resettled) in the society. Also according to the national Development Policy  of  Nigeria(1989:4) defined rehabilitation as a process whereby a disabled person is restored to the fullest physical, mental, psychological, social, vocational and economic usefulness of which the individual is capable. In my own view, rehabilitation could </p> <p>B.   <strong>mean</strong> to recivilize  an individual who have erred or breached a law to become a conformer to conventional rules.</p> <p>C.    <strong>Prison</strong>: (1997:33) define prison as A place or building delimited and declared as such by law of the state and created to ensure restraint and custody of individual accused or convicted of  violating the criminal laws of the state. According to M C Corke and Korn (1971) Prison can be defined as a physical structure in a geographical conditions utilize the resources and adjust to the alternatives presented to them by a unique kind of social environment. The researcher view the prison to be a building that houses people that are been accused or convicted of crime to serve as punishment and deference to potential offender or violators.</p> <p>D.   <strong>Prisoners</strong>: Prisoners according to oxford learners dictionary, a prisoner is a person who is kept in  a conformed place known as the prison as punishment while they are awaiting for trial. In my own understanding a prisoner is an offender or law breaker who is kept in the prison and undergoes some certain punishment as he awaits trail.</p> <p>E.    <strong>Punitive</strong>: Punitive according to the oxford advanced learners dictionary,</p> <p>F.    they are very severe measures or punishment that people find it difficult to pay ‘taxes’ which are intended as punishment.</p> <p>G.   <strong>Punishment</strong>: Punishment are rough treatment or an act of punishing, inflicting or imposing pains on an individual to deter others from committing crime.</p> <p>H.   <strong>Imprisonment</strong>: Imprisonment is to put somebody in a prison or in another place from which they cannot escape.</p> <p>I.       <strong>Inmates</strong>: An inmate according to the oxford advanced learners dictionary are persons living in instituted on such as a prison or a mental hospital.</p> <p>J.      <strong>Offender</strong>: An offender is a person who commits crime or who is a violator of law.</p> <p>K.   <strong>Rehabilitatory institutions</strong>: According to Ahire . (2005) Rehabilitatory  institutions are organization that have particular purpose that are aimed at helping somebody to have a normal useful life again after they have been very sick or in prison for a long time.                                  </p>\n\nAN ASSESSMENT OF THE REHABILITATORY FUNCTION OF NIGERIAN PRISON SERVICE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ASSESSMENT OF THE REHABILITATORY FUNCTION OF NIGERIAN PRISON SERVICE", "id": 66}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>EFFECTS OF STAFF MOTIVATION ON JOB PERFORMANCE</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The social nature of the human animal makes the phenomenon of needs a sine-qua-non. Because human needs are insatiable, there has always been a continuous craving by man to satisfy his ever-growing needs. Yes! The satisfying of man’s needs, does it motivate him to higher performance and subsequently breeding higher productivity? Has there been fairness or equality in the attitude of employees? Equally, has the employees been duly consulted on their needs as employees? These among other things and questions are what this research work seeks to explore and answer. At the end of this work, we may have ascertained the level of the effects motivation has on job performance with specific consideration of Intercontinental Bank Plc. Onitsha Branch.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The study of motivation and behaviour is a search for answer to the perplexing question about human behaviour (Hersey and Blanhers, 1979). The Motivation of people in organization through a popular subject of discussion in seminars, symposia, workshops and written professional journals and books, yet is one of the least understood concepts as a management technique (Francis and Milbourn, 1980). Often people do not know why others behave the way they do.</p> <p>            Why they are behaving differently at present and how they may likely behave in future under the same conditions (Herbey and Blench, 1979). It is the responsibility or organisational managers to motivate their subordinates and employees to raise their level of output.</p> <p>            Motivation is a force that is directed by the behaviour of people. It is thus a major factor that determines employees’ means of satisfying their needs as to improve their job performance. Financial institutions are specially considered in this project as areas whose success and survival depends strongly on the ability of the workers to efficiently utilize the available material resources in order to achieve the organisational goal.</p> <p>            For such task to be performed employees need a lot of incentives as well as a conducive working environment in an organization in order to spur up the workers to work harder for a greater achievement.</p> <p>            The job attitude of most financial institution workers in Nigeria and Anambra State especially has generated a lot of interest among scholars. The growing interest has always resulted to the seminars and workshops on job satisfaction and motivation. The main concern has always been on how to manage workers in order to put their maximum effort. So far the attempt made has not yielded the required result.</p> <p>            It is a common reason why Nigerian workers are always being described as “lazy” unproductive, redundant, non-challant and irresponsible.</p> <p>            Though there is a unanimous agreement on how to motivate a worker, I feel the worker has a need to be met and until this need is met, the worker’s attitude towards his work would remain bad. While some scholars have attempted to identify the various aspects of workers need.</p> <p>            Alao (1984:16) and Anikpo (1984:38) felt that some of these needs have made workers exhibit negative attitudes towards their job. As the case with the present situation in Anambra State where the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) embarked on a strike action following the refusal of the state governor, Mr. Peter Obi to increase the wages of staff that was agreed upon. The financial institutions are the most affected by this situation especially with the present state of financial crunch in the country and Anambra state in particular resulting in social unrest and holding up activities in financial institutions.</p> <p>            This research work therefore is set to answer questions raised above as well as to examine the views of scholars on the impact of motivation of staff on job performance with particular reference to the Intercontinental Bank Plc., Onitsha.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>            Motivation influences human behaviour in any work place. In recent years, it has been evident that there has been a general drop in the overall rating of performance of financial institutions. It is noted that in Nigeria that when workers are motivated, there will be a high productivity but in western countries other factors rather than money motivate workers.</p> <p>            Does this hold true in Nigeria? Have employees been duly consulted on their needs as employees in the financial institution? This research work is designed to study these problems.</p> <p><strong>1.3                Research Questions</strong></p> <p>       To carry out this research therefore, the following questions have been formulated by the researcher.</p> <p>1.         What motivate employees in the financial sector?</p> <p>2.         In what ways can employees in financial institutions be motivated?</p> <p>3.         What are the factors responsible for work attitudes in financial institution?</p> <p>4.         What are the possible solutions to the challenges facing employee in the financial institution?</p> <p><strong>1.4       Objectives of Study</strong></p> <p>            For some years most organizations and industries, both public and private, have showed concern on increased productivity and have produced a wealth of literature on the issues of motivation. Therefore the objectives of the study are as follows:</p> <p>(1)        To establish what motivates employees in the financial sector.</p> <p>(2)        To find out how employees of financial institutions can be motivated.</p> <p>(3)        To ascertain the factors responsible for work attitudes in financial institutions.</p> <p>(4)        To suggest the possible solution to the challenges facing employees in the financial institutions.</p> <p> <strong>1.5      Significance of Study</strong></p> <p>            This research is aimed at finding out how to make employees increase their performance and hence increase productivity. It is intended to contribute to the growing literature on work motivation here in Anambra State, especially on financial institutions. It is also hoped that the study will provide a practical guide to the solution of perennial labour unrest in Nigeria.</p> <p>            Another major significance of this research is its theoretical usefulness. Since the study is based on experimental data, it would yield insights that will affirm or challenge some of the basic assumptions of the classical theories of motivation.</p> <p>            In addition, this research will make meaningful contribution in the area of public especially those that affect financial institutions.</p> <p> <strong>1.6      Definition of Concepts</strong></p> <p><strong>Capital: </strong>This is defined as wealth which may be used for producing more wealth.</p> <p><strong>Labour: </strong>All human efforts of any kind, mental or physical, are known collectively as labour.</p> <p><strong>Money: </strong>Is something which people generally accept a payment.

It is worthy to note that this thesis is specifically tailored to appraise the performance of the centre and ascertain the extent to which these services have promoted the overall welfare and wellbeing of the inmates of the centre.  Moreso, this study strives to unravel various besetting the general operations of the centre. This study made specific recommendations that could improve the services of the centre vis-à-vis the development of the inmates. Essentially, this research work is divided into five chapters, so as to articulate and analyze all the major issues involved in the rehabilitation of the physically challenged in Enugu State.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>            The quest for the rehabilitation of the physically challenged has always been a major concern and challenge to many governments in different countries of the world especially among the African Nations. Every human society is undoubtedly faced with enormous problems of daily provision of certain services to its teaming populace. Rehabilitation of the physically challenged people on Nigeria has become an increasing societal problems basically because of ineffective social policy.</p> <p>            According to Isaac (2004), the physically challenged in Nigeria have bee confronted by chronic problems which often incapacitate their social and emotional development. In his words, the physically challenged are those who have non-sensory physical limitations, that is not because of sense organs like eyes or ears, but because of other organs like limbs, bones, joints, or muscles studies have shown widespread lack of adequate and sustainable care for the physically challenged in Nigeria society (Shamer, 2002). These problems facing the physically challenged in Enugu State are sequel to lack of inter-sectoral approach towards their plight. The need to improve the welfare and wellbeing of the physically challenged in our society led to the establishment of Emene Rehabilitation centre, whose sole mandate is to ensure complete and unconditional rehabilitation of the physically challenged.</p> <p>            But one basic question that should be of concern to every Nigerian is how the government has faired in providing supportive services to these people and to what extent has the Enugu State Rehabilitation centre rendered its services to the physically challenged? The centre mentioned above was established to render services to earn a living and contribute to the development of the society to which they are members.</p> <p>            However, it is regrettable that the centre has performed below expectation. In essence, this research study is designed to thoroughly and meticulously do an assessment of the services of the physically challenged in Enugu State Rehabilitation Centre. This is necessary if we really want to appreciate the plight of the physically challenged and improve their standard of living. This will create an enabling environment and provide a platform for the formulation of feasible socio-economic policies aimed at enhancing the overall status of the physically challenged in our society particularly in Enugu State. Most Nigerian children who are physically challenged would contribute meaningfully to society in all spheres of life if they are rehabilitated and reintegrated into the society.</p> <p> <strong>1.2      Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>            Over the years, there have been series of social policies by successive governments in the country which were designed to guarantee meaningful and sustainable development of every member of Nigerian society. Most of the target goals failed owing to ineffective framework as well as unfaithful implementation of the policies.</p> <p>            There are millions of Nigeria people who have been victims of this unfortunate circumstance following their physical limitations. They are always confronted with the problem of developing under rehabilitating economic, social or psychological conditions as many wallow in crises because of high level and rate of poverty in the society.</p> <p>            In Nigeria, the government ha designed child legislations and child welfare services as means of reducing the problem of the Nigeria children. There are lots of child legislations that stipulate the social welfare services that are provided to children in Nigeria. It is one thing to stipulate child welfare services, and another thing to provide the services to the children as stated in the legislations and policies. Looking at the Nigeria children who are supposed to be the direct beneficiaries of these child welfare services, one may actually provide especially to the physically challenged in Enugu State.</p> <p>            This work is basically tailored to elaborate on the welfare services of the physically challenged in the rehabilitation centre Emene in Enugu State. The researcher is set to appraise the services of the centre so as to establish whether the centre actually provide its services to the physically challenged in State. In other words, this research work will determine the factors that impede or promote the operations and performance of the centre. Effective rehabilitation of the physically challenged in Nigeria and Enugu State in particular has become a global issue in the contemporary time.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Research Questions</strong></p> <p>            There are a number of issues, and questions that this research study intends to verify and find answers to in the course of this research. To this extent, the following research questions will be employed.</p> <p>1.         What are the problems besetting the rehabilitation of the physically challenged in Enugu State?</p> <p>2.         What welfare services are available to the physically challenged in Enugu State?</p> <p>3.         What is the general attitude of the public towards the plight of the physically challenged?</p> <p>4.         What are the factors that impede the overall performance of the centre for the rehabilitation of the physically challenged in Enugu State?</p> <p>5.         What roles should Non-Governmental Organisations and civil society organizations play in the rehabilitation process?</p> <p>6.         What is the impact of social welfare services on the physically challenged in Enugu State?</p> <p><strong> 1.4      Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>            The general objective of this study is to assess the services provided to the physically challenged in Emene Rehabilitation centre. The specific objectives are as follows:</p> <p>1.         To ascertain the welfare services available to the physically challenged in Emene rehabilitation centre.</p> <p>2.         To determine various factors that impedes or promotes operations of the centre.</p> <p>3.         To find out the supportive legislations for the physically challenged in Nigeria.</p> <p>4.         To suggest strategies for effective rehabilitation of the physically challenged.</p> <p><strong>1.5       Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>            The prevailing socio-economic and psychological trauma of the physically challenged justifies this research study. In any academic research of this nature, the main significance of study could simply be of two folds, that is theoretical significance and practical significance.</p> <p><strong>The Theoretical Significance: </strong>This work will provide a tentative basis for future study of social welfare services and legislations available for the physically challenged in Nigeria. Given its precedence, other researchers will find this work a valuable resource material that will contribute towards the enhancement of the plight of the physically challenged. This work will also help in policy-making and formulation, as it will give ideas on how the existing legislations can be amended in order to be applicable considering the socio-economic status of the physically challenged.</p> <p><strong>Practical Significance: </strong>A very good grasp of the practical benefits of social welfare services and legislations will contribute immensely to effective rehabilitation of the physically challenged in our society. This research work is relevant to various organizations, agencies, and individuals, who may have the interest of the physically challenged at heart. In essence, it will give a first hand challenged to the government and on-governmental organizations who are responsible for the welfare of Nigerians who are physically incapacitated.</p> <p>            Finally, this work will assist the centre for the rehabilitation of the physically challenged in Enugu State to evaluate the degree of its rehabilitation programmes and services.</p> <p> <strong>1.6      Definition of Concepts</strong></p> <p>            The research will define some of the terms or concepts that are adopted in this research work. These concepts will include the following:</p> <p><strong>Physically Challenged: </strong>These are people who are notable to do things without external support.</p> <p><strong>Physical Limitations: </strong>This refers to the body incapacitation of a person.</p> <p><strong>Social Welfare: </strong>This is an organised system of social services and groups within satisfying standards of life and health, personnel and social relationship.</p> <p><strong>Physical Neglect: </strong>This is an act of omission that endangers a persons health or society.

The study identified the level of gender equality in Makurdi local government Area, Benue State. The objective of the study is to explain the causes of gender equality in Makurdi. To explain the roles and status of women in Makurdi local government area, Benue State. To determine or explain how gender equality hinder or affect the Social economic and political development of people in Makurdi. Data was collected from one source which is the primary through the use of questionnaire: Sample from the research is one hundred and twenty (120) people, which was gotten through random technique. Table 10 from the findings indicates that the status and roles of women in Makurdi local government Area of Benue State have considerately change after the Beijing conference, it shows that as much as 95(79.1%) respondents agreed that formal education for women in Benue State have increased over the years and teenage marriage declined. The study recommends that, there should exist a mutual relationship and inter-networking projects between local women groups, N.G.O’S and government agencies so that more women can be involved in the efforts towards achieving women empowerment. </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong>                       <strong>Background to the study</strong></p> <p>         The history of women equality in Nigeria can be traced to pre-colonial, colonial and post colonial to the present dispensation, globally, the struggle of gender equality occurred for over a long period of time by leading countries such as the United States of America, France and Britain (ojiakolor and Nwachukwu, 1998). Early efforts were made at the 4th world conference on women held in Beijing, china, between 4th _15th September, 1995 in order to adopt a women’s right charter which would allow women to compete favorably with their male counterparts and ensure global gender equality.</p> <p>       Despites the provision in the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, religion, ethnic group and state, it has been duly observed that the male folk in Nigeria have continued to treat women as inferior and subordinate.  Women have been grossly marginalized in organizations and public offices where leadership positions are reserved only for men, in most societies, the place of women no matter how educated they are believed to be, the kitchen. Toye olori,  (2005).</p> <p>      Going by statistics in Benue state, Angya (2003) holds that women have continued to be underrepresented in higher post in the civil service, judiciary executive and legislative arms of the government at the detriment of woman, although they have immensely contributed towards the nations socioeconomic development at least, women have remained the unheard voice, disempowered by un even distribution in the allocation of power, wealth and status. Women in Makurdi area of Benue state have been stratified, manipulated, relegated and marginalized against the back drop of a century were they represent a potent force in agricultural and economic production and also constituting an unprecedented percentage of global population.</p> <p>     There are various disparities in the socio existence of people due to the  differences based on their sexes and fair balance which would ensure that one sex has no advantage over the other is what is implied here to mean gender equality, it is against this background that this research work aims at assessing the impact of the fourth world conference and women held in 1995, Beijing, china, the declaration and the adoption of the plat form for action on the status with particular reference to Makurdi local government area of Benue state.                                                                 </p> <p><strong>1.2  Statement of the problem</strong></p> <p>       Gender inequality has remained a serious problem in all societies world over.  The debate on women equality has attracted vast attention in many countries recently, the united state of America, various demonstration and protests over rights against discrimination and violence against women have become salient in the country’s history. In Makurdi Benue state, the situation is not quite different, it more appalling. Over the years, Benue state have experienced a tremendous occurrence of gender equality given the fact that women have contributed significantly to the general development of their various societies yet their effort are not recognized.    This is more evident in rural communities were women are actively involved in the cultivation of food and cash crops to boost the economy of family and state, but their effort in this direction are often not appreciated and they lack the right to decide in the allocation of the resources they produce.</p> <p>     Women in Makurdi local government area of Benue state have always played five key roles which include that of mother’s agricultural producers, sex providers, house wives and community organizers, but despite their increasing population and crucial roles in the development process, the division of roles between males and females assigns the subordinate position to females. This is usually prescribed by the dominant culture where by customary practices are biased against women and only serve to further oppress and subjugate, them.</p> <p>    This undermining their individual self esteem, rural communities in Benue state have approved practices such as preference for the male child, degrading widowhood rites, physical abuse, molestation and sexual abuse etc. even in urban centre’s and civilized circles, the stereotyped, gender roles condition women into accepting social debasements and over playing their felinity by accepting the position of the weaker sex, and this over emphasizing the dainty nature of their sex.</p> <p>    In other words, the question on the lips of many is what changes has the world conference on women held in 1995 in Beijing, china brought to Makurdi local government area of Benue state are exposed has not really changed for the better compared to what it used to be during the pre-colonial era , therefore the negligence of women as a main gender classification in Makurdi local government area of Benue state and how the    Beijing conference have influenced their status gave rise to the study of this research project.</p> <p><strong>1.3    Research Question</strong></p> <p>        The following research questions will guide this study </p> <p>a.     What are the causes of gender equality in Makurdi local government    area of Benue state?  </p> <p>b.      What are the roles and status of women in Makurdi local government area of Benue state?</p> <p>c.    How does gender inequality hinder or affect the social economic and political development of Benue state.</p> <p>d.    To what extent do the Beijing declaration and the platform for action affect gender equality in Makurdi local government area of Benue state?</p> <p>e.     How can discrimination against women and all forms of gender based violence be curbed. Makurdi local government area of Benue state.</p> <p>f.  How can women be empowered in Benue state. </p> <p><strong>1.4       Objective of the study</strong></p> <p>            Based on the research questions, the objectives of the study can be concisely summarized as follows</p> <p>a)   To explain the causes of gender equality in Makurdi local government area of Benue state.</p> <p>b)    To explain the roles and status of women in Makurdi local</p> <p>Government Area, Benue state?</p> <p>c)    To determine or explain how gender equality hinders or affects the social economic and political development of people in Makurdi local government area of Benue state?</p> <p>d)   To determine the extent Beijing declaration and the platform for action affect gender equality in Makurdi local government area of Benue state?</p> <p>e)    To ascertain how discrimination against women and all forms of gender based violence can be curbed in Makurdi local government area of Benue state?</p> <p>f)      To examined ways of empowering women in Makurdi local</p> <p>Government Area, Benue state?</p> <p><strong>1.5       Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>          The study of gender equality is a very sensitive barometer of social problems and an indicator that sheds light on many important social problems, and the level of development a society has attained.</p> <p>In Makurdi local government area of Benue state, the process of the establishment of gender equality is going ahead in an inseparable unity with society’s economic political and cultural process.</p> <p>This study is significant because it will highlight the role of gender equality in societal development, similarly, it is hope that the findings and recommendations of this study will help many Non- governmental organization (NGO), and international organizations in devising and planning appropriate ways towards women empowerment and it will also influence policy makers to better status of women in Nigeria.</p> <p>Finally, this research is hoped to serve as a source of information to various authorities that could help for further research project would also serve as a reference point for the other researchers interested in gender related issues.</p> <p><strong>1.6       Definition of terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Gender</strong></p> <p>         Gender refers to those characteristics of men and women that are socially and culturally defined, that is the different behaviours, roles, expectations and responsibilities all men and women learn in the context of their own societies (American Health organization, 1997).</p> <p>            <strong>Women</strong></p> <p>The united nations (1986) defined women as the feminine components of the human species who apart  from serving as a vehicle  of nurturing human life also sere agents for  fostering a whole some political, social and economic development in any society, women are different from male counterparts, which reflects the genetic and biological make up of the sexes.</p> <p><strong>        Gender Mainstream</strong></p> <p>According to the united nations economic and social council (1997;2), gender mainstreaming is the process of assessing the implications for women and men of planned action, including, legislation, policy and programming in all and at all levels.</p> <p><strong>Gender Inequality</strong></p> <p>Gender or women inequality is defined by article one of the united nations convention on the elimination of all forms of violence and discrimination against women as any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effects or purpose of impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economical, social, cultural, civil or any other field.</p> <p><strong>Women Empowerment</strong></p> <p>According to sand brook (1993), women empowerment can be defined as a process which involves the transformation of the economic, social, psychological, political and legal circumstances of women.</p> <p>Women empowerment also refers to the dismantling of the cultural norms and traditional practices that devalue, disempowered and disposes women, the process must also necessarily include the expansion of women’s access to educational opportunities, facilities for skill acquisition and positions of authority (Win, 2005)</p> <p>             <strong>Stereo Types</strong></p> <p>These are over simplified but strongly ideas about the characteristics of males and females.</p> <p>       (Barsow 1986), they help maintain gender roles by shaping ideas about gender equality to which men and

of the central problems that cause conflict among families prevalent to the extent that a house holder (father) has to write his will before he dies. The common practice is that, women have no say in the property sharing as a member of the family.The objective of this study is to examine the definition of property rights in Ankpa community. To determine the positions of women with regards to property inheritance in Ankpa community. To ascertain the extent to which property as defined by Igala customary laws has affected the socio-economic development of women, and to recommend ways of tackling the issue. Data was collected from one source which is the primary through the use of questionnaire: sample for this research was one hundred (100) people, which was gotten through the simple random sampling technique.The findings revealed that females generally under the Igala traditions are properties themselves to be inherited by any man. Recommendations such as the amendment of the Igala customary law in relation to cultural approach to accommodate women’s property inheritance was made. There should also be an attempt on the part of the government to promote gender equality through legislature and other enlightenment programmes.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1.         Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>            Property inheritance including the rights of women to property, receives very little degree of attention in different parts of the world.</p> <p>The girl – child in most traditions of the world according to Ogbuagu in his reviews of gender studies in Nigeria, (2002). Is made to internalize the notion that, the girl is subordinate to male authority and subsequently cannot and should not claim rights with the boy-child. Ogbuagu, further states that, the girl-child is taught to be a good wife and mother in future. In addition the girl child is also perceived and actually made to believe that, she is a tool, an object or a possession to be owned and used to meet the male desires. These discrepancies between the old rules and facts are greater where women are concerned and its most harmful to their interest.</p> <p>Women’s legal rights to property according to Kenneth (2000) are examined on the background of the law of succession, inheritance and the family its paramount, to point out that no particular attentions has been paid to women in the making of any law in Nigeria (2002). According to her, the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria 1977, promulgated into law by the military force before they handed over power on the 29th of May 1999 to civilian administration has been generating controversies since its inception. The chief argument against the constitution as argued by Comfort is the imposition of these laws on the Nigerian people by the military. That the constitution does not pass the test of legitimacy and acceptability for it is not a process led participatory and open constitution. She further argues that, the way and manner in which the 1999 constitution. She further argues that, the way and manner in which the 1999 constitution was drafted made it possible especially for women to have any impact whatsoever in it.</p> <p>This customary law system where the women and her children are denied property and financial provision from the property of her husband’s and father’s upon dissolution of marriage either by divorce or death, exposes them to exploitation and abuse, customary norms are no longer always appropriate and their observation may simply serve to entrap women and children (females) in inferior position.</p> <p>It is upon this background that the researcher seeks to find out the extent to which women in Kogi state particularly in Ankpa local government area have rights to property inheritance.</p> <p> <strong>1.2.         STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Traditional beliefs and practices of especially the Ankpa local government area as conditioned by the customary laws have become such serious obstacles militating against the development of women in this area.</p> <p>A close look at the Ankpa women generally either single, married or divorce reveals that, they have no rights to property when compared to their male counterparts.</p> <p>A female heir is as good as a property to be inherited and thus, does not argue over her father’s properties with her brothers, a married woman works and owns everything to the husband, she claims no right in the husband’s house. A widow return empty to her parents especially, if she has no male offsprings. These are serious problems militating against women social, economical, political and psychological development and can be conveniently attributed to the sub-servient positions, women tend to accept in the society. This is because a person who is disenfranchised or lacks the right to property to enhance his or her status generally, be it social, political, economical,, educational and so on, remains dependent and often takes the back seat.</p> <p>These types of situation in which the Igala women in Ankpa local government area face impedes their development processes and greatly affects their quota of contribution to the overall development of the society.</p> <p><strong>1.3.         RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The research has set to investigate into the above stated problems faced by property inheritance and the position of women in Ankpa local government area as regards property rights.</p> <p>What defined these rules, its implication on women and the way out, to achieve this, the following questions will guide the research.</p> <p>i.       How are property inheritance defined in Ankpa local government area.</p> <p>ii.     What is the position of women with regards to property rights in Ankpa.</p> <p>iii.  What are the factors responsible for this?</p> <p>iv.  What are the implications of property inheritance or rights as defined by customary laws for social and economic development of women?</p> <p>v.     What measures are required to maintain women in the development process of Ankpa local government area?</p> <p><strong>1.4.         OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aims of this study are to find out how property inheritance has been shared and why property inheritance has been shared and why women under the Ankpa tradition and customary laws have no rights to property. How these affect women generally and proffer probable suggestion on the way forward.</p> <p><strong>The following will be the specific objectives of this work.</strong></p> <p>To examine the definition of property inheritance in Ankpa local government area.</p> <p>To determine the position of women with regards to property inheritance or rights in Ankpa</p> <p>To determine the factors responsible for this</p> <p>To ascertain how property rights as defined by Igala customary law has affected the socio-economic development of women.</p> <p>To proffer suggestions on how women could be mainstream in development processes.</p> <p><strong>1.5.         SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research is aimed at understanding property inheritance as been defined by the igala customary laws in Ankpa local government area.</p> <p>The research also aimed at determining the position of women with regards to property inheritance in Ankpa. And to provide solutions to the problems of women with regards to inheritance, right and contribution to national development.</p> <p><strong>1.6.         DEFINITION OF CONCEPTS</strong></p> <p>The concepts to the defined in this research include:</p> <p>·        Property</p> <p>·        Inheritance</p> <p>·        Rights</p> <p>·        Customary laws</p> <p>Property: Property is anything, objects or rights, which can be owned.

But despite these gains, the stark reality has not changed. There still are larger gender disparities in basic human rights, resources, and economic opportunity, and in political rights –the world over. Gender roles and relations to a large extent shape the process of urbanisation. The growth of cities and towns cause social, economic and environmental change that often go beyond city boundaries (Dankelman, 2003).The term ‘gender’ refers to economic, social and cultural attribute and opportunities associated with being male or female (UN-Habitat, 2003).</p> <p>Gender discrimination is the practice of letting a person’s sex unfairly become a factor when deciding who receives a job, promotion or other employment benefit. It most often affects women who feel they have been unfairly discriminated against, in favour of men.Women face job discrimination and segregation. They consistently find themselves in low-status, low-paying jobs with few opportunities for advancement. They are overrepresented among part-time workers and informal sector operators. Moreover, the kind of paid work that women are more likely to be involved in pays less than the jobs that are predominantly male oriented.</p> <p>Discrimination in workplaces is now one of the most debated issues around the world. There had been innumerous findings on and strong charges against discrimination (Kelan, 2009). In particular, gender bias has become a common occurrence everywhere in most of the developing countries (Kelan, 2009). Some reports also show that such discrimination happens even in developed countries, though the number of facts may be less compared to those in the developing and least developed countries. There are different forms in which discrimination may be evident at workplaces. In spite of the number of findings and reported cases in governmental and non-governmental institutions, the issue still remains beyond control. Environment around the office, the socio-economic status of women, the religious values and restrictions and above all the social psychology of the people can be figured out as the principal causes behind biasness (Sue, 2005). Unwillingness and lack of attention and supervision by the government adds to this to a great extent (Kelan, 2009). All these have led the issue being complicated more and more. It would be easier to realize the problems in implementing non-discrimination at workplaces in the light of the forms and specific aspects of biasness that women encounter generally (Kelan, 2009).</p> <p>Victims of gender discrimination lose motivation and morale necessary to perform their jobs effectively. According to a report written by Dankelman (2003), gender bias also leads to a loss in productivity. Things that may lead to this loss of morale and motivation could include jokes about an employee’s gender that imply inferiority, offensive jokes of a suggestive or sexual nature and jokes implying that an employee’s work is sub-par due to his or her gender. Though, Federal law prohibits this type of workplace harassment, whether by superiors or coworkers</p> <p>Women who have young children at home may experience push-back when interviewing due to family responsibilities. Although law prohibits a prospective employer from asking about family responsibility outright, it often comes out during the interview process anyway. This may provoke the hiring manager to pass over a qualified female candidate if he feels she will be torn between her home and job responsibilities. If the woman makes it into the position, her supervisor can view her employee file to see that she has young children signed up on insurance or other benefits. He then may choose to give her less responsibility or assign menial tasks to her that do not fit her job description (Sue, 2005). Although illegal, this practice still exists in offices today. Those discriminated against may feel such strong resentment and loss of self worth that they resort to destruction as a way to get back at the discriminatory employer or coworkers. Destructiveness may manifest itself as physical violence against others, destruction of property or propagation of malicious rumors about people in the company and the company itself (Sue, 2005).</p> <p><strong>1.2   Problem Statement</strong></p> <p>Women in developing countries receive less education than men. More so, women in general enjoy far less employment opportunities than men globally. Women and girls who are at the bottom of the social, economic and political ladder in these societies get even lesser opportunities to have a command over productive resources such as land or credit. So while demand of basic rights (be it education, employment or healthcare for women) determined to women, this denial, ultimately also harms the society, the nations at large too, by hampering development.It is against this background the researcher would determine the effects of gender discrimination on employment opportunities in women, as it affects the society at large.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Objectives/Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of gender discrimination on employment opportunity of women. </p> <p>This study ought to accomplish the following:</p> <p>1.  Examine the employment opportunities available to women in Seven-up bottling company, Ikeja Lagos.</p> <p>2.  Find out the response of women in Seven-up bottling company who experience gender discrimination.</p> <p>3.  Ascertain the level of stereotype on women in Seven-up bottling company due to gender discrimination.</p> <p><strong>1.4   Research Questions</strong></p> <p>1.  To what level are employment opportunities available to women in Seven-up bottling company, Ikeja Lagos?</p> <p>2.  To what extent do women in Seven-up bottling company, IkejaLagos  experience gender discrimination?</p> <p>3.  What is the most stereotyped job for women in Seven-up bottling company, Ikeja Lagos?</p> <p><strong>1.5   Significance of Study</strong></p> <p>This study amongst others will reveal the effect of gender discrimination on employment, thereby educating scholars, females in the society and the society at large.</p> <p><strong>1.6   Scope/Limitations</strong></p> <p>This study is limited to women in the Seven-up bottling company, Ikeja Lagos state. </p> <p>The major limitation is the time constraint for the gathering of relevant material for the research work. Moreover, since the responses of women formed the data for this study, there will be no proof to ensure that the information provided by the population sample is absolutely accurate.</p> <p><strong>References</strong>: </p> <p>Kelan, E.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDS), also known as chronic diseases are not contagious or transferable from one person to person. But it is contacted individually; they are four main types of non-communicable diseases that occur among the youths which are cardiovascular diseases (like heart attack and stroke), cancers, and chronic reparatory diseases (such as chronic obstructed pulmonary diseases and asthma) and diabetes, and others include hypertension, trauma, mental disorder, fractures, malnutrition, poisoning, fibromyalgia etc which in effect leads to damage of vital cells and tissues which may even leads to death. Non-communicable diseases have many different causes but they are never caused by bacterial, germs or other living organisms that attack the body, they are never spread from one person to person (WHO,  2002 and 2010). </p> <p>In the year 2010, there was an estimated number of 80 million deaths globally, of which 90% was due to non-communicable diseases, 1.7 millions deaths was as a result from  cardiovascular diseases (CVD) especially coronary heart diseases (CHD), and stroke, 7.6 million from cancer, 42 million from chronic respiratory diseases, and almost 1.3 million from diabetes (WHO Global Status Report on Non-Communicable Diseases, 2010:411). Mental health problems are leading contributions to the burden of disease in many countries and contributes substantially to the incidence and severity of many non-communicable diseases including VUD and cancer. </p> <p>Non-communicable diseases contribute substantially to youth (adult) mortality. It adds to health inequalities within Benin City, mainly affecting population largely because of inequalities in the distribution of major risk factor (Mackenbach, 2004). This topic will enhance the youths in Benin City on how to prevent and control the causes of non-communicable diseases among them. Especially through the making in of tobacco and alcohol which damages the respiratory system and heart against the pumping of oxygenated blood for the use of the body. </p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS </strong></p> <p>The problem associated with non-communicable diseases among youths in Benin City varies from one person to another. Health problem are associated with poverty, poor diet, and lack of essential resources among these are inadequate clean water, shelter, food, educational orientation and clean air. In addition, many developing countries and poor population are facing health problems. This is true of diseases especially non-communicable diseases. Globalization is an important determinant of non-communicable diseases epidemics since it has direct effects on national economic and health system (Moffow, R. H.,  2002).</p> <p><strong>1.3     </strong><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to examine the cause and effects of non-communicable diseases among youths in Benin City.

The causes and effects of commercial sex work among AkwaIbom girls in Uyo Local Government is the main concern of this study. The study seeks to find out the possible ways in which the problem of commercial sex work can be eradicated in the society. The study was empirically conducted where data was obtained through the primary and secondary sources. Instrument for data collection was questionnaire. Data was collected and analysed with simple percentage while the hypothesis stated were tested with percentage(%). The result in hypothesis one showed that, commercial sex work has implication on our general sexual health or wellbeing, that is the act of sex work has a negative effect on our sexual being. This hypothesis was accepted. In hypothesis two, which states that sex work is more likely to be caused by poverty. Based on the result, hypothesis two was therefore not accepted. Based on the result of this study a number of recommendations were made.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 Background Of The Study<br/>Commercial sex is basically sex for money. It is not restricted to any culture, its global and it transcends all age barriers as some cases girls as young as eight years are involved. Commercial sex has evolved over the last two decades, (National Behaviour Survey 2004). According to the National Behaviour Survey (2004), commercial sex work has indeed become complex in different ways as there are male sex workers in Nigeria who have sex with men for commercial reasons and there is an organization0 that support them which based in Ibadan, Oyo state.<br/>Commercial sex has particularly taken a worrisome and indeed despicable turn on the continent through trafficking in person and violation of people’s human right and these have become major issues in West Africa (Human Right Action, 1997). In recent time, commercial sex has become a lucrative business in Nigeria especially among the youths (Ikpe, 2008). Research has it that, 31% of sex workers are students particularly in Nigeria institutions (Onah, 2000). Onah (2000), is of the view that, there are different forms of sex workers, those that stay in the brothels, those that stand on the road side, those that operate from home etc.<br/>Furthermore, sex work has now become an occupation especially for the girls in countries like Netherland, Brazil, Norway etc, sex work serves as one of the sources of revenue for government, hence, taxes are paid to the government (Aday, 1990). Aday further says that, sex workers face systematic discrimination throughout the world and are therefore, at risk of variety of abuses, these include police extortion, arbitrary detention and other. Violations of their human and labour rights which in some cases even amount to slavery.<br/>In Nigeria, sex work is an illegal business because, the law prohibits its, but no active action has really been taken against it by the government (Onah, 2000). In AkwaIbom State particularly, Uyo local government, commercial sex workers can be found in hotels, bars, brothels and on the street, (Onah, 2000). Despite the efforts made by the government and other private organization to eradicate sex work in Uyo, it has rather grown to become one of the outstanding social problems that have really apprehended the people of Uyo (Onah, 2000). It is on this background that, this research work attempts to find a possible way of coping with this problem.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement Of The Problem</strong><br/>The people involved in commercial sex experience negative effect even though they still make out from it. Lex (1992), argued that, sex work has been identified as the core group for transmission of HIV/AIDS and STD; Thus, they face discrimination throughout the world.<br/>Due to the diseases that befall these people on daily basis, sex work has been considered a menace in the society and also violence against humanity, (Lex, 1992). These negative effects includes untimely death, frustration, unwanted pregnancy etc. one of the major challenges is that, some of these sex workers are illiterates, they neither attain seminars nor listen to news on television where they could be enlightened on the risk of their work. These work has then, become their life style, therefore, making it difficult for the government to cope with.<br/>In country like Nigeria, prostitution is termed as deviance and unhealthy in the society. It is also a big embarrassment to the government and the families who their youths are involved in such acts, such families will lack their respect from people in the society no matter their position in the society, (Onah, 2000). This research work then, seeks to investigate the effects and causes of commercial sex work among AkwaIbom girls.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Research Question</strong><br/>The following research questions will guide the study.<br/>1. What are the causes of sex work?<br/>2. What are the implications of commercial sex work on our general health?<br/>3. What are the age difference of sex workers?<br/>4. What are the general attitude towards commercial sex workers?<br/>1.4 Objectives Of The Study<br/>1. To ascertain the likely causes of sex work<br/>2. To find out the implications of commercial sex work on our general health.<br/>3. To find out the age difference of sex workers<br/>4. To identify the general attitude towards commercial sex workers.</p> <p><strong>1.5 Significant Of The Study</strong><br/>This significance of the study tends to treat both the theoretical and practical importance. Theoretically, this study will add to the already, existing knowledge of the causes and effects of commercial sex work among AkwaIbom girls in Uyo L.G.A. the study was written in order to know the causes and effects of commercial sex work and at the same time proffer solution to them. Moreso, the study will be a guide to future researchers in their research in knowing the causes and effects of commercial sex work and look for means of tackling those problems.<br/>Practically, this research work will enable the commercial sex workers to know the dangers surrounding their work, so as to stop the rising wave of sex work. This can be done by the government to make sure of creating employed youths. This study will also help in exposing and tracking down the people behind sex work.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Scope Of The Study</strong><br/>This research covers the causes and effects of commercial sex work in Uyo local government area.<br/>It will examine the challenges that are associated with sex work and how government can control the increasing number of sex workers in Uyo.</p> <p><strong>1.7 Definition Of Terms</strong><br/>For the purpose of clarification, the following terms are defined as used in this research work;<br/>AIDS: Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.<br/>Brothel: This is a house where men pay to have sex with sex workers or where sex workers live.<br/>Commercial sex: This is defined basically as sex for money.<br/>HIV: Human Immune Virus.<br/>Sex: Is an erotic attraction between two people or sexual intercourse that can lead to orgasm in female and the secretion of semen from the penis in male.<br/>Sex Work: This is defined as any sexual performance carried out by a person for payment of certain amount of money or in exchange of any material thing.

The tourism industry boasts of potentials capable of generating significant investments toward economic development (Kraal, 1993). In spite of enormous opportunities for wealth creation, growth of national income, foreign exchange earnings, labour intensive employment opportunities, government revenue and improved standard of living of people in general that abound in the tourism sector, the contribution of tourism to economic development in Nigeria leaves much to be desired. It is regrettable that despite strong evidence that the tourism sector has good potentials for socio-economic development, these have not yet been fully realized in the country. It is true that Nigeria has been generating revenue from the tourism sector, however, such revenue generated is highly insignificant compared to the potential the industry has.</p> <p>The fact that tourism in Nigeria has not got to the expected height is attributed to several factors. Due to her record of political instability and security challenges, she attracts low rate of international tourists. To get the best from our tourism resources and potentials as a country the time has come to recreate ourselves as a tourism destination. In doing so, there are certain critical factors that must be upheld as irreducible minimums. These include the push and pull factors which account for what motivate tourists in their choices of destination. Security is now an important motivation for travel. Today many scholars in the tourism industry advocate that being safe on holiday is an expected requirement for any visitor in a tourist destination. However it has been observed that places that develop an unsafe reputation can be substituted by alternative destinations that are perceived as safer for tourists. Many people are of the opinion that any tourist destination must offer certain facilities and services such as accommodation and security (Crompton, 1979 and Krippendorf, 1987).</p> <p>Tourism is sensitive to insecurity. The performance of the tourism industry is highly sensitive to rising crime whether real or perceived.  Therefore safety and security are vital to providing quality in tourism. They play major role in making travel choices. The success or failure of a tourism destination depends on being able to provide a safe and secure environment for visitors. It is true that when the environment is safe, the visitors are also safe and if the tourism industry emphasizes security, it will have a good chance of surviving. Though it is true that only a minority of tourists suffer criminal victimization while on holiday, it is important to explore variations in the crime experiences of different tourists. It is observed that crime patterns vary according to factors such as the nature of tourism, its scale, and the type of development, the season, as well as variations relating to the tourists themselves and issues associated with their behaviour.</p> <p>Cross River State, especially Calabar the state capital has witnessed as increase in tourist arrivals owing to its geographical location and the presence of both natural and manmade attraction. It is observed that increase in tourist arrivals in a particular destination often leads to increase in crime situation ranging from robbery, assault and murder, to kidnapping and burglary (Shaw and Mckay, 1972).  Crime rates typically increase with the growth and urbanization of an area, and growth of mass tourism is often accompanied by increased crime. The presence of a large number of tourists with a lot of money to spend, and often carrying valuables such as cameras and jewelries, increases the attraction for criminals and brings with it activities like robbery and drug dealings. Today, most streets within the hotspot locations where these industries are located are prone to high crime rates such that most tourists and residents found themselves being robbed and their belongings taken away. The presence of large number of tourists has led to changes in the social behaviour of youth and these often lead to gangsterism and other social vices. This view applies in the case of Calabar metropolis which have witnessed in recent times due to increased tourism activities, the rise of the Scolombo boys, a dangerous and mindless gang constituted by destitute or street boys and girls. They have been accused of looting shops, snatching handbags, and engaging in other criminal activities leaving residents, investors and tourists in fear. Moreso, during the carnival event which comes up December every year, crime such as rape, assault, robbery seem to dominate the entire areas. In most cases, the major streets constitute a harbour for cultist, armed robbers and kidnappers. Apart from this, no adequate measures have been put in place to arrest the perpetrators of crime and even when security measures are provided, no proper documentation is made with respect to the types of crime and the victims. This forms the crux of this research with specific reference to the tourist activities in Calabar during and after the popular Calabar carnival.</p> <p>There is a broad consensus that tourism development should be sustainable (WTO, 2004). The declaration by the United Nations of 2017 as the international year of sustainable tourism for development is a unique opportunity to advance the contribution of the tourism sector to the three pillars of sustainability namely economic, social and environmental, while raising awareness of the dimensions of a sector which is often undervalued. There is growing recognition that well-designed and well managed tourism can contribute to the three dimensions of sustainable development, to job creation and to trade. (Okoroafor, 1994 and Okoli, 1998). This declaration comes at a particularly important moment as the international community embraces sustainable development goals.</p> <p>For many   decades, successive governments have identified the need to diversify the economy and break the mono-product dependence on oil. Tourism no doubt is a veritable alternative to oil as a major revenue earner for the country. It is seen as a promising route towards boosting economic development (Common Wealth Currents, 1998). This underscores the timeliness of this research. The global economic meltdown and fallen prices of crude oil more than ever before, makes it imperative for alternative sources of revenue to be exploited. Tourism development ought to be one of the safeguards for a sustainable future in the event of an end of the crude oil mono-economic dependence.</p> <p>Despite this recognition, the challenge now has been to convert the available potentials into a dynamic reality. For tourism industry to contribute significantly to economic development in Nigeria, just as it does to some economies, due regard should be given to the issue of safety and security. It is in this context that this study identifies lack of safety and incidence of crime as a more serious threat to tourism than any other negative factors. For the present government to succeed in its agenda of repositioning the tourism sector as a major contributor to the economy of Nigeria, tackle the lackluster performance in the industry, it has to pay attention to issues that have been overlooked by previous regimes.</p> <p>Today, there is a growing concern among scholars that crime and disruptions in tourism destinations have made the hospitality industry more hostile than hospitable. Thus, as the importance of the tourism industry is recognized namely the revenue resulting for the host country, the possibility of any negative consequences such as the development of crime behaviour should also be pointed out.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Statement of the Problem </strong></p> <p>Tourism is expected to foster economic growth through foreign exchange earnings and increase in state revenue and at a second level, on the improvement in the people’s wellbeing in the areas of job creation, revenue and sustainable development (Nwidum, 2007). In 1995, tourism was responsible for over 100 million jobs world-wide and from 2005 onward, the figure was expected to increase to 300 million (Sheldon, 1997). However as observed by Etuk (2012), the performance of Nigeria in the tourism sector is still very poor when compared with the scorecards of other countries. In a country like Zimbabwe, tourism is the largest contributor to the G.D.P after manufacturing and agricultural sectors. Other countries like Kenya, South Africa and Gambia have impressive performance than Nigeria. Although many factors can be understood to threaten the development of tourism in Nigeria, such as infrastructural.</p>\n\nCRIME AND SUSTAINABLE TOURISM  IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CRIME AND SUSTAINABLE TOURISM  IN NIGERIA", "id": 74}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT<br/>Juvenile delinquency is seen as one of the menace that destroys life and property in our society today. Because of the nature of crime committed by juvenile parents, guidance, sponsors and well wishers are worried and disturbed about our future leaders. Crime associated with juvenile include: rape, stealing, kleptomanism, burglary, disobedience, homicide, truancy, vandalization and robbery etc. therefore, this study seeks to look at the nature and consequences of juvenile delinquency. The objective of this study aims at finding out why juvenile engage in delinquent act, why juvenile offenders continue in crime after being punished or sanctioned, what Nigeria government needs to do inorder to improve or educate juvenile about crime and the negative impact of crime on individual and society at large. However, the expected outcome of this study is that to reduce or eradicate juvenile delinquency in our society government and voluntary organization should be involved in the following ways: Government should provide employment opportunities for youths, greater thought should be given to setting up more amenities in the rural areas, stoppage of pornographic films and some American films, where our youths learns techniques in stealing and destroying properties, parents should adopt method of positive and negative reinforcement and government should educate or enlightening parent on the effects of unmet needs like starvation (food), parental care and affection etc. on their children to enable them (parents) make adjustment. Method of data collection used in this study was only questionnaire.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong><br/>Juvenile delinquency is that behaviour on the part of children which may, under the law, subject those children to juvenile court. Tappan (1972:12) assert that “the nature of juvenile delinquency sprang up from different abnormal behaviour such as stealing, drunkenness, burglary, robbery, rape, homicide, idleness, truancy, prostitution, disobedience, running away from home, kleptomanism and sexual promiscuity. Furthermore, it is nothing but a fact to say that juvenile offenders who after serving a good or complete numbers of his or her punishment in prison and still continue in deviance is because they are associated with adult prisoners. In this regard Mr. Sanusi, project Director of Lawyers continued Education Project (LAWCEP) maintained that “in our society, where the process of trial is delayed unduly, the young offender spends more time with hardened criminals than elsewhere.</p> <p>Different forms of delinquency have been with man as far back as we can think but modern trends have made them take a very sharp rise. Glucks (1959) found out that juvenile delinquency is not a new occurrence during adolescent years but rather a continuation of anti-social behaviours from childhood due to environmental subjections or family problems affecting his mental development. That is to say that there exit a close link between delinquency and the home environment of the juvenile. The earliest known code of laws (the Code of Hammurabi) took specific note of the duties of children to parents and prescribed punishments for violations. As legal systems were elaborated, the age of offenders continued to be important in defining responsibility for criminal behaviour.<br/>The Nigerian constitution of 1979 defines juvenile delinquency as “a crime committed by a young person under the age of 18 years as a result of trying to comply with the wishes of his peers or to escape from parental pressure or certain emotional stimulation’. Before a youth in Nigeria is classified a delinquent, he must have been arraigned before a juvenile court and proved to be guilty of some offences. Examples of such offences are habitual truancy, drug addiction, prostitution, stealing, cultism, armed robbery etc. The consequences that juvenile delinquency has caused to Nigerian society are not only devastating but numerous. They destroy both lives and property and they also retard the growth of this country.<br/>Juvenile delinquency has also contributed to the bad image of our country (Nigeria). For the fact that most of the delinquent want to get rich quick, corruption and ritual killings has become the order of the day in coming to our political sphere, they have turn politics into a do or die affair where thuggery and fighting is the norm. This has made politics in our country (Nigeria) a dangerous venture.<br/>1.2 Statement of the Problem<br/>If an investigation or a study is carried out about juvenile delinquency in Nigeria, the result will definitely show that cases like rampant stealing, armed robbery, prostitution, manslaughter, drug addiction, vandalization, truancy, murder, rape, cultism, burglary and kleptomanism and many other crimes and delinquent behaviour are common among the youth.<br/>Because of the alarming rate of juvenile delinquency in our country today, governments, parents, guidance, sponsors, teachers, moralists and well meaning Nigerians have all picked interest on its adverse effects in our society. Also the increasing waves of juvenile delinquency in our country place lives, properties and future of our youth at stake. For example, in 1989, records of crime as reported by the Lagos state police command revealed that youths between the ages of thirteen (13) and twenty one (21) were responsible for adult. 13,782 out of 26,259 crimes committed this year i.e. 1989 were juvenile. Such crime ranges from shop looting, drug abuse, fighting, raping and stealing etc.<br/>The similar report also indicated that in the same year (1989) out of 43,000 prisoners serving in various Nigerian prisons, over 23,000 of them were aged between the ages of thirteen (13) and twenty five (25) years. Therefore, this study seeks to look at the nature, consequences and extent of juvenile delinquency in Nigeria among our youth.</p> <p>1.3 Research Questions<br/>The following research questions were used to guide this study:<br/>1. Why do juvenile engage in delinquent acts?<br/>2. Why do juvenile offenders continue in crime after being punished or sanctioned?<br/>3. How can Nigerian government improve or educate youth or juvenile about crime?<br/>4. What are the negative impacts of delinquent or crime on individual and society at large?<br/>1.4 Objective of the Study<br/>The objective of this study is as follows:<br/>1. To find out the extent why juvenile engage in delinquent acts.<br/>2. To ascertain the extent juvenile offenders continue in crime after being punished or sanctioned.<br/>3. To find out what Nigerian government need to do in order to improve or educate juvenile about crime.<br/>4. To determine the negative impact of crime on individual and society at large.</p> <p>1.5 Significance of the Study<br/>The study looks at the nature and consequences of juvenile delinquency in Nigeria. In all ramifications, the study does not claim the fact that all Nigerian juvenile are criminals or culprits or law violators so to say.<br/>The study is very beneficial to learning and development processes and helps our youth to be aware of those things that may lead them to delinquent acts and avoid them. The study will also help parents, guidance, sponsors etc to know those things they need to do inorder to prevent their children from so called delinquent acts.<br/>The study goes a long way to unleash those things our government needs to do inorder to educate our juvenile and prevent them from future delinquent acts. In conclusion, this study is significant because it seeks to determine to what extent juvenile commit crime, why they continued in delinquent act and as well as the result of their delinquent acts to themselves and society at large.</p> <p>1.6 Definition of Terms<br/>Nature: This is defined as the usual way a person or an animal behaves that is part of their character.<br/>Consequence: This simply means a result of something that has happened.<br/>Juvenile: This refers to a person who has attained the age of 14 but is under 17 years.

Abortion is accepted and also rejected by different societies and people indulge in abortion for a lot of reasons. some indulge in abortion so that they can complete their education, some because of the fear of having a child outside wedlock while others indulge in abortion to avoid be labelled by the society as “loose”. The cross-sectional survey is the one adopted in this study and the sample size of this study is one hundred and seventy (170) possible respondents. The questionnaire was used for the collection of primary data. This study is divided into five (5) chapters, the first chapter is the introduction, the second chapter is the literature review, the third chapter is the methodology, the fourth chapter is the data presentation and data analysis and the fifth chapter is the summary, conclusion and recommendation. This study seeks to identify those factors that tend to induce abortion among female university students with focus on the University of Calabar. This study is beneficial to all categories of women, female students and the society at large. This study also identifies how abortion affects the society at large.<br/>7<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>Title page----------------------------------------------------------------i<br/>Approval

ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy associated with the death and expulsion of a fetus from a uterus before it reaches the stage of viability. An abortion may occur spontaneously, in normal parlance it is called a miscarriage, or it may be brought on purposefully in which case it is often called an induced abortion (www.britannica.com).<br/>The issue of abortion has attracted substantial attention in recent times in Nigeria and everywhere in the world; abortion has therefore become a global issue (Alimson, 2001). The major concern in most of the discussions on abortion and related situation draws heavily from the fact that abortion constitutes severe danger to a woman’s health, but at the same time when performed by medical specialist (i.e abortion specialists) abortions are safe for the woman, and relatively simple. Religious institutions are against the abortion process as they believe abortion is a process of committing murder and murderer are seen as sinners (Knight, 2003) Whey the society frowns at it is because of the inherent fact that if the phenomenon is<br/>14<br/>not regulated it would impact negatively on the population growth and also on the welfare of women (Barreto, 1992).<br/>Abortion is therefore forbidden in many societies especially the traditional ones. The “abrupt removal” or premature termination of babies are said to be as a result of certain factors.<br/>Most societies therefore recognize the importance of medical factors in pregnancy termination. According to the Oxford medical Dictionary, induced abortion can be performed for reasons that fall into four general categories.<br/>i. To preserve the life or physical or mental well-being of the mother.<br/>ii. To prevent the completion of a pregnancy that has resulted from rape or incest.<br/>iii. To prevent the birth of a child with serious deformity or genetic abnormality.<br/>iv. To prevent a birth because of the age of a women, therefore, a girl whose body has not formed property for child birth, or a<br/>15<br/>woman who has passed her child bearing age, as it could be dangerous for the two.<br/>Abortions that are performed to preserve the well-being of the female or in case of rape or incest are therapeutic or justifiable abortions. Induced abortion is accepted on some countries but in other countries it is highly forbidden.<br/>However, other factors (economic social, educational, and family size) have equally become prominent in respect to abortion or pregnancy termination. Both male and female students are supposed to be sexually responsible since a lot of student’s in today’s society are already sexually active, but females always carry the bulk of the responsibility as they are the ones who would be greatly affected by any mistake (Alimson, 2001). For instance, a female student who forget to take necessary pregnancy precautions and therefore gets pregnant may resort to an abortion for the following reasons.<br/>i. To complete her education,<br/>16<br/>ii. ii. To avoid becoming a mother prematurely, as well as the responsibility attached to it,<br/>iii. To avoid being negatively labelled by the society has been “loose”<br/>iv. Fear of having a child out of wedlock. (Almison, 2001:3).<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>If an investigation or a study is carried out on the category of people that indulge in abortion, the result will definitely prove that it is adolescents and youths. The minority will be older people (especially those who have passed the age of child bearing.).<br/>Several causes have been identified as inducing abortion other than medical. The phenomenon in most countries is frowned at. In Nigeria for example the abortion Act of 1967 as amended I n 1982 states the following;<br/>1. If the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman greater than if the pregnancy was terminated, the pregnancy should be terminated.<br/>17<br/>2. If the termination is necessary to prevent grave permanent impurity to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman, it should be terminated.<br/>3. If the pregnancy has not exceeded its 24th week and the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk greater than if the pregnancy were terminated of injury to the physical of mental health of the existing children of the family of the pregnant woman, it should be terminated.<br/>4. If there is substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from much physical or mental abnormality as to be serious by handicapped, the pregnancy should be terminated (George, 2004:7).<br/>The above Act therefore permits under certain conditions, the abortion of a pregnancy. Most women we the following conditions to involve in abortion which has negative effect.<br/>Mindful of the social stigma of having unwanted pregnancies, many young girls who become pregnant seek abortion as the only way to end unwanted pregnancies. This however, has serious health risks,<br/>18<br/>which sometime leads to death to young girls. For instance, unsafe abortion results in various complications such as haemorrhage, perforation of the uterus, secondary sterify and even death. It is also obvious that unsafe abortion has a devastating health impact as measured by deaths, illnesses, injuries and the cases of emergency care (Expanding Access to safe Abortion, 1993).<br/>Beside the risks of unsafe abortion, there are serious health risks involved child bearing as an adolescent or teenager. For instance, teenagers face greater risk of pelvic bone immaturity, prolonged labour and other wise difficult birth.<br/>The fear of been sent out of School or dropping out of school because of unwanted pregnancy makes undergraduate students involve in abortion and in order to abort the baby, they go to quack doctors because it is cheap or they take concoctions and this either kills them or destroys their womb. Money in this case is also a problem.<br/>George (2004) has clearly observed that about 72.5% of those involved in abortion are female students, 17.5% are unmarried<br/>19<br/>women, while abort 4.3% are housewives. It is this rate that has become a problem.<br/>Therefore, this study seeks to look at extent of determinant of induced abortion among undergraduate students, by looking at the reason why people involve in abortion and why it is still being patronized by members of the society.</p>\n\n THE DETERMINANCE OF INDUCED ABORTION AMONG UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  THE DETERMINANCE OF INDUCED ABORTION AMONG UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS", "id": 76}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong><br/>The influence of colonialism on Nigeria cannot be over emphasized. The influx of white explorers, traders and missionaries led to the development of settlements that differed from the traditional domestic environment. These new settlements were designed to reflect the norms, values and economic policies of the colonial masters.Africa, the land of blessed race, where the opportunists came to develop in order to colonize their resources for their good, was then left in vain hope(Allen, 2011).<br/>Although primarily established for white settlers, the new settlements known as urban areas or township also served as a refuge for appreciable number of Africans who had in some substantial degree emancipated themselves from the constraints of traditional society. Among them were professional men, clerks and shop keepers with at least primary education, growing numbers of wage-earners and large number of farmers receiving cash income from growing crops for world market (Fage, 1978).<br/>2<br/>The projection of industrial capitalism in Africa produced well-defined urban classes’ people with technical skills. They wanted to lift themselves into the twentieth century world modestly symbolized by radios and bicycles and to enjoy freedom based on knowledge and a more advanced mode of production. These ambitions were feasible only in an urban settlement. Aba is reputed as a big commercial city. It is predominantly inhabited by businessmen of various persuasions traders, big – time technicians and craftsmen, importers and exporters transporters etc. Even the few professionals like Teachers, Doctors, Lawyers, Accountants, and Engineers etc. have unwittingly imbibed the commercial tradition of the dominant group.<br/>In Aba you are either a businessman or you are nobody. In fact the influence of commerce is so pervading that the market unions have come to connote the defacto government or power broker in all of Aba. The defunct famous Bakassi Vigilante Group was composed of traders and craftsmen. The commercial nature of Aba has also influence the attitude and life style of most residents. The rat-race syndrome is very pronounced. Everything is measured in terms of its worth in money. People do not have time for anything else but money. Parents do not even have time for their children. In some cases the children are surrounded by paid cooks, drivers and house boy/maids who attend<br/>3<br/>to their needs while their parents are busy making money. This creates room for child abuse through neglect and over indulgence by parents. We can observe that the environment regulates the social, religious, academic and cultural inclinations of the child as other less fortunate children are abused through exploitation. For example, those employed as shop assistants may sleep in the shops. The typical day starts for such children of about 5.30am. The business continues up to 9pm since there is no legislation on shopping hours in Nigeria. Children serving as house helps are in similar situation. They wake up about 5:30 am and do household chores up to 7:30 am or even later. Some of these servants who attend school go to school already very tired. In some cases they walk a distance to school thereby worsening the situation. About 2.00pm when the school closes they go home to continue the household chores or carry clothes to sell in the streets. They come back late in the evening tired and sleep off. This routine is performed almost daily at the expense of the children’s studies. The child who hopes to grow up and become a professional is subjected to social constraints that are likely to obstruct his progress. Some of the constraints are child labour, street hawking, street begging, early marriage, child abandonment, child prostitution, child battering, sexual and physical abuse and therapeutic abuse by fake traditional healers (Ebigbo, 1988, Echezona, 1991). The environment is<br/>4<br/>characterized by models that cherish aggression act-rich syndrome, substance level ambition and disregard of Education.<br/>It is also necessary to note that the surrounding or environment of a student influences their performance. Learning and reading begins in school but the first foundation of the child begins at home (Binkley 2008).<br/>1.2 Statement of the Problem<br/>The poor academic performance of pupils in schools in Aba educational environment has recently become a cause for serious concern. It has been observed by the researcher that some senior primary school pupils cannot write or read a letter. Others attend as many as three schools within their primary school career due to constant failures in a bid to avoid the shame of repeating a class. It has also been observed by the researcher that in Aba and some other parts of Nigeria private school proprietors tend to boost the population of their schools by admitting students without a testimonial or statement of result and award fictitious results to ensure the promotion of such pupils to the next class.<br/>5<br/>This ugly development has been attributed to many factors such as teachers’ poor attitude to work; poor infrastructure, examination malpractice; lack of qualified teachers; truancy; poor motivation; Non-payment of salaries and the neglect of instructional media by teachers etc. The primary school features the highest number of impressionable learners and consumes a greater percentage of the government budgetary allocation to education, hence the need to investigate the influence of environment on the academic performance of pupils in Aba North L.G.A.<br/>1.3 Research Questions<br/>The following research questions were formulated to guide the research.<br/>1.) Does noise pollution hinder the development of memorization skills by pupils?<br/>2.) Does the presence of rich but illiterate businessmen discourage excellent academic performance or behaviour in class?<br/>3.) Do Pupils who indulge in so much domestic chores have poor academic performance than pupils who do not?<br/>6<br/>1.4 Objectives of the Study<br/>The general objective of this study is to investigate the influence of environment on the academic performance of primary school pupils. The following specific objectives are to guide the study:<br/>1. To determine the extent to which a noisy environment hinders the development of memorization skills by primary school pupils.<br/>2. To find outhow the presence of illiterate but rich businessmen affect the behaviour of primary school pupils towards learning.<br/>3. To ascertain the ways in which the home environment affects the performance of primary school pupils at school.<br/>1.5 Significance of the Study<br/>This study on the influence of environment on the academic performance of pupils in primary school will facilitate learning by enriching the knowledge of parents on the adverse effect of child labour and hawking on learning. It will create awareness on the importance of interaction and co-operation between parents and teachers for the success of pupils in learning activities. It will improve the attitude of pupils towards academic work through internal and external<br/>7<br/>motivation of teachers and parents. It will contribute to the volume of existing literature on the role of environment factors on pupils learning. It also will sharpen teachers understanding of the root causes of some academic problems in the primary school. The insight derived from that will help to prefer better solution to the problem. It will promote the development of the spirit of hard work, self-reliance and self-control among primary schools pupils.<br/>The result gotten from this study will challenge the ministry of education to live up to her duty by making the infrastructure available for the creation of better learning environment. This study will highlight the importance of community participation through the P.T.A. in school affairs to check deviant behaviour resulting from the environment. Finally, it also will highlight the danger of monetized value system with its attendant; ‘corruption’ because money is only useful and valuable in the hands of an informed person.<br/>8<br/>1.6 Definition of Concepts<br/>The following concepts were defined:<br/>Influence:<br/>According to the Sun Mobile Dictionary, the term influence is the “power to affect another”. The Oxford Advanced learner’s dictionary defines influence as “the effect that somebody or something has on the way a person thinks or behaves or on the way that something works or develops”. The concept influence, as related directly to this study, refers to the power the environment has on the academic performance of pupils,more especially, in Aba North Local government area of Abia State.<br/>Environment:<br/>The Sun Mobile Dictionary defines Environment as “surrounding, things, conditions, etc.” The Oxford Advanced learner’s dictionary defines it as “the conditions that affects the behaviour and development of somebody or something; the physical conditions that somebody or something exists in”. In essence, the concept environment refers to thesurrounding of primary schools in<br/>9<br/>Aba North LGA. It can also be defined as the conditions that affect the behavior and development of pupils especially in primary schools.<br/>Academy:<br/>The Sun mobile dictionary refers to the concept academy as a “school”. A school on the other hand is a place of learning. A school is a place where children are thought (Oxford mini School Dictionary: 2007). A primary school can therefore be called an Academy.<br/>Performance:<br/>The Oxford advanced learner’s dictionary defines the term performance as “How well or badly you do something”. Performance as directly related to this study can also be defined as how well or badly pupils of Primary schools do in there academic work.<br/>Academic Performance:<br/>This can be define as the score a child or individual obtain in test or examination based on his or her learning experiences.<br/>10<br/>Socio status:<br/>This is the total state of an individual based on inequality in terms of occupation, level of education and other societal issues defined by the environment.<br/>Socio- culturalbackground:<br/>This is the social and cultural makeup of an individual in relationship with his or her environment.<br/>Education:<br/>This is a formal instruction or training given to a child in school. According to the 6th edition of the Oxford dictionary, it is a process of teaching, training and learning, especially in schools or colleges to improve knowledge and develop skills.</p>\n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT ON THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT ON THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS", "id": 77}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></li> </ul> <p>Juvenile delinquency is an age-long problem. It is a social problem that has fathered enormous trends in our society and it cuts across the globe. It has also recently taken new dimensions in villages, urban, suburban areas and in schools. The problem increases and becomes less manageable especially now that the economy of the nation is almost in a state of collapse.</p> <p>Juvenile delinquency has to do with a crime committed by youths and it means different things to different people depending on how the society sees it. Reports of juvenile delinquency abound on the front and back covers of our dailies and the offences committed by the youths range from stealing, pilfering drug abuse, sex, armed robbery and other deviant behaviours. This has given parents, social workers, the police, psychologists, sociologists and the government a great deal of concern about the possible causes and ways of preventing delinquent acts.</p> <p>On the reasons for juvenile delinquency, some are of the view that the family is the root cause of juvenile delinquency because of the laxity in the up bringing of children. Others think that the causes of juvenile delinquency stem from the individual youths, that is peer group pressure, the environment the children interact with, poor socio-economic background of the parents, broken homes, watching movies and reading pornographic materials etc.</p> <p>In Akwa Ibom State, the incidence of juvenile delinquency is probably not different from the trends elsewhere in Nigeria. perhaps it was because of the attitude of the youths in the State that made the state government to enact a law in 1997 making it an offence for any school child to roam the streets during school hours. To implement this law, a task force had been set up to monitor the truancy of these children and any child(ren) arrested for violating this law was made to pay a fine by the parents before being released.</p> <p>Experience has also shown that most of our youngsters go delinquent because of the hard effect of the economic depression on different families as the children are allowed to fend for themselves by selling.</p> <p>Since there are no confirmed statistical records to indicate the number of delinquents in Akwa Ibom State and especially Uyo Urban, the trends in juvenile delinquency, offences committed, sexes most prone to delinquency and age trends in delinquency, it calls for a survey of the Remand Home Uyo on the incidence of juvenile delinquency so as to establish authentic situation and records.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENTS OF THE PROBLEM:</strong></p> <p>In contemporary Nigeria Communities especially the urban ones, children no more respect elders and their behaviour deviate from standard expected by the society.</p> <p>There has been a general belief that adolescents exhibit a lot of problem behaviours because they think of themselves as independent and self-reliant, they always seek adventures, which makes them to involve themselves in all sorts of misdeeds and delinquent acts.</p> <p>Juvenile delinquency is one of the areas which poses problems to the Nigeria Government and the general public as a whole. Truancy among our juveniles has become a problem that almost every family and school has faced. Also drug addiction has found its way into the Nigerian society and is thriving among the youths. There seems to be an absence of a sense of value of those thing such as respect for elders, respect for human life and property, and other things which are traditionally thought to be noble. Sexual laxity and teenage pregnancy are other areas that demand attention from the adult world. Teenage pregnancy is more rampant now than ever before, with its resultant effect of dropping out of schools and causing untold hardship to parents. Children now become mothers when they are not adequately able to cope with parentage psychologically, emotionally, financially and physically. </p> <p>If youths are allowed to go delinquent, they might constitute a nuisance or menace to the government and the general public as a whole. The presence of a delinquent child in the family raises the anxiety of the parents. The future of the country is in jeopardy if the character of our youths is paralysed with the delinquent offences and social ills because a delinquent child today is likely to become a criminal adult tomorrow, hence there is no hope for a better future  of good and dynamic leaders in Nigeria as a whole and Akwa Ibom State in particular. It is against this background that this study is carried out to find out the root causes and possible ways of reducing the incidence of juvenile delinquency among our youths.</p> <p><strong>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The specific objective of the study is to find out how parental characteristics are related to the cases of juvenile delinquency among young children.</p> <p>Other are</p> <ol><li>To find out socio-economic factors that are associated with juvenile delinquency.</li> <li>To find out the offences which juveniles in the remand Home are accused most of committing.</li> <li>To know the variability in delinquency with regards to sex and age of the youths.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <ol><li>This study which focuses on the incidence of juvenile delinquency in socio-economic classes of parents, the rate of juvenile delinquency among the sexes and age bands, will be useful in providing statistics on juvenile delinquency in Uyo urban.</li> </ol> <ol><li>It will be valuable to the government in helping to determine where to channel its resources in an attempt to check juvenile delinquency.</li> <li>This research is expected to contribute in the area of helping to the dimension of juvenile delinquency in our society and will help in bringing in limitation on the cause and the consequence of this social problem.</li> <li>The study will also help guidance counselors decide on strategies to use in providing assistance in respect of some deviant behaviours among the youths as well as educating parents on how to help their children.</li> <li>Most significantly, it will identify the needed strategies and demand that could be used by parents, law enforcement agencies and others in checking their problems in our societies especially in the urban areas.</li> <li>It will also be of immense importance to researchers who may wish to carryout more studies on various aspects of juvenile delinquency in Akwa Ibom State.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5    SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is limited to Uyo Remand Home. It is also limited to the distribution of juvenile delinquency in terms of age ranging from 6-17 years.

Exploitation include at a minimum, prostitution or  other  forms of sexual exploitation, forced  labor or services, slavery or practice similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of  organs (Palermo Protocol, 200).</p> <p>Thus, three main elements are at the core of t his definition and they include: the actual act of trafficking including  the recruitment transportation,  transfer, harboring or receipt of  persons, associated acts such as the threat  or the use  of force or other  forms  of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or  of a position of weakness or vulnerability and exploitation including at a minimum the exploitation for prostitution (or  other forms of sexual exploitation ) forced labor or services, slavery  or practices similar  to slavery, servitude or the removal of  organs.</p> <p>The vulnerability of prospective victims are exploited in many respects;  the victims most  of t hem  are pre-teems, teenagers and almost female are taken far away from  their homelands  to cities within their country or across national boundaries and exploited for optimum economic benefits. Many of them are engaged in cheap labor such as domestic servants, hawkers, beggars, prostitutes or put into other forms of servitude akin to slavery. Expectedly, the global outcry generated against this phenomenon is informed by the obvious human degradation which accompanies this racketeering.</p> <p>The suffering and indignity meted out to trafficked victims in the process of transporting them and at the various detonations, especially those aboard, had become a huge source of embarrassment to Nigeria’s integrity as a nation with responsibility to safeguard the interest of its nationals as well as to states often fingered as affected by this social malaise. Many states in Nigeria are often affected by internal trafficking. Internal trafficking of young girls and children is not a new phenomenon. It has been going on with the trafficking of people from rural communities to major cities such as Lagos, Abuja, Kano, Kaduna, Calabar, Warri and Port-Harcourt, predominantly for exploitative domestic work, scavenging, begging and prostitution (Otibor, 2014).</p> <p>The incidence is a little more precarious in Lagos, the commercial nerve center of Nigeria with a surging population of about 9.1 million. The busy schedules of families who are mainly working class, makes high demand for domestic servants imperative. Who are often sought from Cross River, Akwa Ibom State, Imo and Ebonyi states (Ocibor, 2014.</p> <p>Women trafficking are best noted for their sexual exploitation which is quite high. It brings high profit and is a low risk trade for those who organize it, but detrimental to victims and non-victims. This trade, which the former UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan described as an outrage and a worldwide plague is conducted throughout the world with near impunity, in many cases, carries penalties far less severe than drug trafficking. People are said to be snared into trafficking by many means. In some cases, physical force is used. In some other cases, false promises are made regarding job opportunities or marriages in foreign countries to entrap victims (Emena, 2015).</p> <p>Today, human trafficking involves the movement of victims, usually women and children across borders legally legally or illegally. These victims may be either documented or without documentation as they head into an unknown destination, and in most cases the person being transported is unaware of the consequences thereof.  And sometime victims may be oblivious of unintended consequences such as arrests and deportation while in transit to the new destination. Many of the forms of women trafficking involve the movement of people from one to another often unknown to the victim. In many cases, this involves victims being lured by better opportunities in the form of jobs elsewhere (Eka, 2013).</p> <p>The negative effects of poverty, exacerbated by political instability and mismanagement of the economy, poor cultural practices have had the consequence of human right violations, in the form of an increasing number of persons being forced into bondage by traffickers in Nigeria. Akwa Ibom State has gained notoriety a one of the main sources and transit of human trafficking. It is against this backdrop that this study will be focusing on the socioeconomic effect of human trafficking in Nigeria, using Akwa Ibom State as a case study.</p> <ul><li><strong>Statement of Problem</strong></li> </ul> <p>The phenomenon of the human trafficking has been attracting local, national and international attention of world leaders, academics, the mass media, advocacy groups, the clergy and humanity in general. This is against the back drop of the fact that the trafficking of humans has a number of far-reaching socio-economic, health and political consequences. Several factors such as poverty, unemployment, ignorance and unplanned family size have been adduced trafficking has continue to thrive.</p> <p>From available statistics, we can say that 500,000 women are brought into the United States of America and Europe yearly for sexual and domestic servitude. Of the over 70,000 African victims of human trafficking, Nigerian account for 70 percent of those trafficked to across Europe alone. Human trafficking spread across many states in Nigeria. One of the worst affected states in Nigeria is Akwa Ibom State. Akwa Ibom State is a state endowed by abundant oil resources that generates colossal funds for the state yet poverty, illiteracy and unemployment still persist for traffickers to exploit.</p> <p>Besides,the state boast of high rate of literacy for a social malaise such as human trafficking to thrive.  Okon (2012) observes that Akwa Ibom State is now leading in human trafficking and child labour, pushing Edo State to the second place. Uwah (2009) argues that the trafficking of women in Akwa Ibom State began as an economic arrangement; a simple survival strategy adopted by families desperate a reprieve from biting economic hardships.</p> <p>While Ita (2011) observes that numerous factors such as poverty, level of ignorance and family size among other things account for why girls and women fall easy prey to the antics of trafficking in Akwa Ibom State. As it is well known, poverty is an inherent and factual reality especially in the Niger Delta. In Nigeria, the World Bank(1995) reported that over 45 cent of the country’s population is said live below the poverty line. Similarly, Collins (1999) observed the reality that in most poor homes parents can barely meet the legitimate needs of their children. He added rather painfully that the financial distress of most poor parents them vulnerable to the deceit trafficking who promise their children juicy and supposedly rewarding jobs only to cajole them into prostitution and forced labor abroad.</p> <p>Admittedly, the trafficking of women with all its ramifications is tantamount to a debasement of womanhood. Given the dehumanizing treatment which trafficked women receive, the phenomenon of the trafficking of women is beginning to attract attention from several quarters. The concern and attention which the menace of human trafficking has begun to attract stems from the realization that the phenomenon, being a national and international crime, means that no one country or government has the power and the resources to eradicate it all alone. The effects of human trafficking have been realized to be devastating, dehumanizing and uneconomical. It should however be noted that such effects of human trafficking are numerous besides encompassing every facet of the victims, and non-victims lives (Uwah, 2009).</p> <p>It is in view of these foregoing problems that this study seeks to x-ray the socioeconomic impact of human trafficking in Akwa Ibom State, and Nigeria in general. In doing this, a number of questions are raised.</p> <p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions are therefore raised to guide the study:</p> <ol><li>What are the causes of the trafficking of women in Akwa Ibom State?</li> <li>Is there a correlation between poverty and women trafficking in Akwa Ibom State?</li> <li>What is the relationship between unemployment and women trafficking in Akwa Ibim State?</li> <li>Is there a causal relationship between crime and the trafficking of women in Akwa Ibom State?</li> <li>What is the impact of literacy on the trafficking of women in Akwa Ibom State? <ul><li><strong>Objective of the Study</strong></li> </ul></li> </ol> <p>The main objective of this study is to assess the issue of women trafficking in Nigeria. While the subsidiary objectives are as follows:</p> <ol><li>To ascertain the phenomenon of human trafficking in Nigeria;</li> <li>To find out the causal factors of human trafficking in Akwa Ibom State;</li> <li>To examine the socioeconomic effects of human trafficking;</li> <li>To evaluate the pattern of human trafficking in Nigeria as well as measures taken to tackle the negative trend in Nigeria;</li> <li>To make useful recommendation drawn from the findings. <ul><li><strong>Research Hypotheses</strong></li> </ul></li> </ol> <p>The following hypotheses are hereby formulated to guide the study:</p> <p>H1: There is a significant relationship between poverty and the phenomenon of human trafficking in Akwa Ibom State.</p> <p>H2: There is a significant relationship between illiteracy and the phenomenon of human woman trafficking in Akwa Ibom State.</p> <ul><li><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></li> </ul> <p>Human trafficking ranks among the social malaises tarnishing the image of Nigeria so much so thea study of this nature is appropriate. Besides, this study is also significant because it sought to investigate the various ramifications of this social problem that effects not only Akwa Ibom State, but Nigeria as a whole as well as the society in general. More so, research of this nature will help states such as Akwa Ibom, Edo Cross River, Delta, Abia and other states most affected to tackle the reoccurring human trafficking problem.</p> <p>The issue of human trafficking has been receiving accentuated discourse in various international for a, especially those organize by the United Nations Organisation and some Non-Government Organisation (NGOs). This makes the issue of human trafficking very significant and this study timely, relevant and appropriate. Beside, the issue of human trafficking is one of poverty research areas prescribed by the United Nations.Thus, making this research significant in no small measure.</p> <p>Furthermore, this study will very useful to such organizations such as the United Nations, International for Migration (IOM). The Congressional Research Service, International Labour Organization (ILO), the European Union, The Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women (GAATW), UNICEF and the National Agency for the Prohibition of Traffic in Persons (NAPTIP) and WOTCLEF, as they are all engrossed in the battle to tackle the menace of human trafficking.Just as the study will also be very useful to all the countries, and Policy-makers involved in the anti-human trafficking battle. This study will be useful to related or subsequent studies in this regard as it will through its findings add to existing literatures on this issue.</p> <ul><li><strong>Scope and Organization of the Study</strong></li> </ul> <p>the scope of this study covers all issues of human trafficking in Akwa Ibom state and</p> <p>Nigeria,in general, as well as all related issues relevant to this study. This study is organized in chapters, precisely five chapters. This is made up of distinctive but inter-related chapter, logically linked. Chapter one treats the introduction of the study; chapter two covers the literature review; chapter three treats the methodology; chapter four covers the data presentation and analysis; and chapter five the conclusion of the study.</p> <ul><li><strong>Define of Concept</strong></li> </ul> <p><strong>Human trafficking: </strong>  This involves the act and attempted act of recruitment and transportation of persons (both male and female) within or across borders.</p> <p><strong>Women trafficking: </strong>This refers to the recruitment and transportation of women across national or  international borders either voluntarily or involuntarily, for sexual or domestic purposes. It also includes  the purchase, sale, transfer, receipt or harboring of young girls and women through deception for  the purpose of subjecting the women and girls to involuntary servitude. In this study, trafficking of women and female trafficking will be used interchangeably.</p> <p>Women Traffickers: These are organized criminal rings involved in the smuggling (illegal transportation) of women across national borders to regional destinations (e.g. Europe and ItaIy). They are commonly referred to as “Trolley”, “ItaIo” “Sponsors”, “Madame” and “Boss”, etc.</p> <p>Trafficked persons: These are persons, male and female, recruited and transported within or across national borders for the purpose of sexual or domestic services.</p> <p>Internal trafficking: This is also referred to a domestic trafficking. It involves the recruitment and transportation of persons within the borders of a country, either from rural to urban areas or from one State to another, for purposes of sex work, child labor, or domestic services.</p> <p>External trafficking (Cross-border trafficking): External trafficking is also referred to as “international trafficking” and involves the movement of people across national, continental and international borders for the purpose of sex work, child labour and domestic service in exchange for monetary reward (Akor, 2007:7-8).</p> <p>Victims: Persons who suffered for at tacked or are injured or killed as a result of a crime, disease or actions of other people.</p> <p>Non-Victims: Those who do not directly suffered from attacks or are injured or killed as a result of a crime, diseases or actions of other people.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF POPULATION GROWTH ON THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF POPULATION GROWTH ON THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT", "id": 79}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Background of the Study</strong></li> </ul> <p>Christian healing represents “a specific mode of therapy which has been well cultivated since ancient times, being an offshoot of the Judaic tradition”.1 Most Dictionaries denote healing as an adjective derived from the verb, to heal, which means “to cure a disease or disorder”, “to restore to soundness”, “to make whole and healthy” (chambers 20th Cent. Dict). Thus, healing in its common sense usage would mean the removal of the factors that cause disease and infirmity.</p> <p>There is the religious or the spiritual aspect of healing which both the biblical and Annang traditions so must revere (Ps 42:11; 43:5; 67:2) in spite of advance in modern technology and medical science. Both the Judeo-Christian and Annang anthropology stress the fact that a human being needs healing as a socio-religious entity for his whole being. It is perhaps, in the light of this that one can understand the overall significance of Christian healing ministry as a sign of profession of faith. Hence, it is developed in the church as an authentic sign of witness of faith, and an occasion through which God publicly manifests His glory in the situation of His people. It is a moment of distinctive profession of faith.2</p> <p>Meanwhile, the search for faith healing seems to be presently dominating African Christianity. In Annangland, it has reached that magnitude whereby new churches, healing centres and prayer houses are being opened daily, all claiming the power to heal and work miracles. With the word of Udoette, “almost all the so-called prophets in the NRMs in Nigeria claim to have the gift of healing and ability to work miracle”3</p> <p>The new churches, ministries and centres so founded are usually filled beyond capacity by eager seekers for God’s immediate intervention in their lives. In a bid not to lose out on membership and to attract new ones, many of the older churches have incorporated miracle healing services into their programme of activities. Thus, as observed by Umoren, “many ‘healers’ have emerged, and whether in prikate homes or at public prayer assemblies, testimonies or “reports” of miracles abound”.4</p> <p>It is certainly not an exaggeration opining that most of these churches, healing centres and “healers” jostle for space in the media, at beeches, at street corners, and in abandoned buildings. They are also found at open spaces, in school halls, hotels, restaurants, rented apartments and passenger buses where they eagerly advertise their new-found power, and “make it happen” through all kinds of extraordinary manifestations. Their target groups are businessmen and women, the sick, the demon possessed, those in need of life partners and children from marriages (especially male children), pregnant women eager to have safe delivery, those who want financial breakthroughs, those who want to be delivered from sin and sinful attitudes, those who out of fear seek supernatural protection from enemies and unseen forces, the unemployed, workers who desire job security, those unjustly treated by others in need of God’s vindication, people in search of success and progress, travelers wary safety in their journey, those in search of lasting solutions to teething family, neighbourhood and communal problems. In short, people who have all kinds of need, whether spiritual or material.5</p> <p>Nevertheless, of all these needs, the search for good health in mind and body receives the highest attention. A common African adage which the Annang people have adopted states that <em>nsongidem ade imo</em> (health is wealth). Without good health, all other human needs count as nothing. Thus, most miracle seekers are in search of God’s miraculous intervention in one bodily ailment or another. For such people, it is no harm trying “this or that healer” if “the hospital or the other healer” does not bring them expected relief from illness or even some assurance against illness. So they go in search of miraculous healing anywhere they hear “it is happening”. Aware of the seriousness of this search for good health and in view of the generally poor state of health facilities in many parts of Annangland miracle preachers have readily made the sick their special target group.</p> <p>It is certainly not an exaggeration to opine that, sickness and other forms of human sufferings have been present in human society and have become part of man’s concept of life. There has always been in the depth of man’s heart the burning desire to be free from all forms of human sufferings. There has been a serious effort by the modern man to combat and eliminate this problem. The society today is investing time and money more in the prevention of sickness as a means of evading it. Sickness has been a dominant phenomenon and it is not as if it is recent in the history of man.</p> <p>Large number of the sick approaches Jesus during his public ministry, either directly or through friends and relatives, seeking the restoration of health. The Lord welcomes their request and the Gospels contain not even a hint of reproach for these prayers. The Lord’s only complaint is about their possible lack of faith.6</p> <p>It is common in the scriptures to see Jesus surrounded by sick people of various kinds. He was never hesitant in curing them. He looked at sickness as an ailment that attacks both the body and soul of man and hence approached each that came his way as an integral entity. While he was always concerned to heal the sick in body, he invariably paid close attention to the mind and spirit of the sick man. So curing for Jesus has a lot to do with the faith of either the sick person or the faith of his or her relative or friends. “If you can! Everthing is possible to one who has faith” (Mk 9:23; Mk 6:5-6; Jn 4:48).</p> <p>No doubt, God has continued this healing ministry in his church through the prayers of the church presented in his ministers. The church has never ceased to ask for healing on behalf of the sick in her liturgy. The sacrament of anointing of the sick has been there to strengthen the sick. The instruction on the prayers for healing right mentions this concern of the church for the sick.</p> <p>The church has never ceased to celebrate this sacrament for its members by the anointing and the prayer of its priests, commending those who are ill to the suffering and glorified Lord, that he may raise them up and save them. 7 </p> <p>Making reference to the important part of the prayer used by the church for the anointing of the sick, the document confirms the intention of the church regularly expressed in her prayer for the sick. The church prays:</p> <p>Make this oil a remedy for all who are anointed with it; heal them in body in soul, and in spirit, and deliver them from every affliction.8</p> <p>As it is reflected in this short prayer of healing for the sick person, the intention of the church in the celebration of this sacrament goes beyond the physical healing.</p> <p>Before Jesus left the world to go back to his Father, he entrusted to his followers the mission he received from his Father and gave them the authority and power to heal the sick and preach the good news.</p> <p>He summoned his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits with power to cast them out and cure all kinds of diseases and sickness (Mtt 10:1; Lk 9:1-2; Mk 6:7). </p> <p>The church from her time of commissioning has witnessed many people who are gifted with the charism of healing. The ministry of these healers should not be defined outside of the whole process of church’s healing ministry. Their healing ministry has to be part of the church’s profession of faith. That is why it must operate within the church’s guideline for her ministry to the sick. The church’s concept about human sickness must therefore be the foundational base for treating every case.</p>\n\nCHALLENGES AND PROSPECTS OF CHRISTIAN HEALING MINISTRY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CHALLENGES AND PROSPECTS OF CHRISTIAN HEALING MINISTRY", "id": 80}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Background of the Study                                                          </strong></li> </ul> <p>The issue of welfare services in Nigeria exist with the motive of assisting the handicapped persons to help themselves.  Government has the right to protect and foster the interest of the citizens by finding solutions to the social problems of the handicapped persons in the society. Handicap refers to problems a person with disability or impairment encounters in interacting with the environment; it may be caused by physical, mental or sensory factors and render a person abnormal in society. However, the World Health Organisation defines the term “handicap” as any restriction or lack of ability to perform an activity in a manner or within a range considered normal for a human being (World Health Organisation, 1996).</p> <p>Cultures round the world have nearly similar perceptions or ideas of what a ‘normal’ human body is, when there is deviation from that ‘normal’ the society can react in any of the following manner; shock, embarrassment, pity and denial. Being handicapped may range from a person’s inability to walk on both feet unaided, talk, hear, to seeing without glasses which makes the impaired persons to suffer an inferiority complex as well as limitations in the degree of participation in the normal life of the community either by being partially or totally excluded (Momoh, 1997). Apparently, there is no society that exists without the handicapped or disabled persons. Their powerlessness or vulnerability stems from inability to compete or equate with other members of the society as a result of some physical impairment. However, the government and even the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have put in place some welfare services and packages in order to bridge the gap between the handicapped and non-handicapped persons in the society.</p> <p>Welfare on the other hand includes all such activities as its objective and embraces not merely a section but the whole society as its field of operation. The welfare services by the government include areas like health, education, housing, transportation and social security. To fulfil these responsibilities, the government has to develop vision, mission, ethic statements and guidelines to serve as a yardstick to measure its success (Ekpe and Mamah, 1997). Thus the government has a vital role as the handicapped individuals and groups are dependent on the government for protection, care and survival. Welfare services whether in Nigeria or elsewhere is an essentiality in the society. Welfare is the general good of the whole society without any reference to a particular evil or evils, and without any distinction between high and low, and rich and poor. It is the poor and the needy, the helpless and the under-privileged, the underdeveloped and the unfortunate who require to be attended to and all welfare activities are meant to supply this attention and care so that they may attain normal average standard of life activity. Any state or government worth the name has to look to the welfare of the people, including of course the poorest and the helpless (Ade, 1986)</p> <p>However, various efforts have been made to improve the life of the handicapped persons in the society. For instance in Akwa Ibom state special schools are established where they can receive both educational and vocational training. This can make the handicap persons capable of fending for themselves and contributing positively towards the growth of the society. Also, the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Welfare (MWASW) in Akwa Ibom state provides rehabilitation centres such as co-operative industries of Nigeria, shoemaking workshop for the handicapped, Itu leprosy clinic, Arts and craft training centre, St. Joseph’s remedial training centre and St. Louis centre. All this is put in place in order to eliminate begging, starvation, delinquency, ignorance and dependency (Dailysun Newspaper 24; 12; 2014).</p> <p>According to a recent survey carried out by the World Health Organisation (WHO), it is estimated that about 10% of any given population are Persons with Disabilities (PWDs). In Nigerian terms, this translates into 14million people out of a population of more than 140million people (National Census figures, 2006). Thus, the WHO organise and co-ordinates programmes such as the Community-based rehabilitation (CBR)  which focuses on enhancing the quality of life of handicap people and their families; meeting basic needs; and ensuring inclusion and participation. It is a multi-sectoral strategy that empowers handicap persons to access and benefit from education, employment, health and social services. CBR is implemented through the combined efforts of people who are handicapped and disabled, their families and communities, and relevant government and non-government, health, education, vocational, social and other services.</p> <p>Handicap persons could be adopted by one or more groups or volunteers to their school fees, train them in any vocations, provide walking aids like boots, callipers, crutches, wheelchairs, tricycles etc. All these are practical social issues that the community members should adopt as part of community participation in CBR projects in their different communities. Nigeria as a whole being a component community is obliged to embrace meaningful programme approved by WHO committed to the benefit of the less-privileged and the handicapped members of every society. There is need for a convention that will establish or consolidate norms for the provision and protection of people who are handicapped. Such convention should highlight the important aspect at the national level of legislative, administrative, judicial and constitutional measures to ensure that people with handicap problems will fully realise and enjoy their human rights in the area of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.</p> <p>Inspite  of aides provided by the government, observable evidence show that the most of the handicapped people in Uyo metropolis still go around begging for alms to survive which sometimes causes nuisance in the streets, school premises, churches etc. In this part of the Country, begging as a way of life was and is still frowned at. Each family retained and helped its handicapped member(s) as it was almost a taboo for a family to allow its members to beg for alms. These handicapped persons should not be kept within the family and cared for; they should be given some vocational education like weaving, bag making, mat making, carving etc in order to make them useful members of the Society (Ijere, 1978).  This study therefore intends to unfold the possible ways and means to render essential welfare services to the handicapped persons in Uyo metropolis of Akwa Ibom State of Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2     </strong><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Over the years studies conducted by scholars in Nigeria have shown that handicapped persons often suffer so many challenges ranging from deprivation of welfare services, inferiority complex as well as limitations in the degree of participation in the normal life of the society. According to CLEEN foundation report (2004), some factors responsible for handicapped conditions are birth defects and health issues, oil pipeline explosions and road accidents etc. Persons who are handicapped have long been exposed to prejudice, discrimination and deprivation of essential welfare services as a result of their inability to cope at the same level as able-bodied people in similar circumstances.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates put the number of Handicapped persons at 19 million of the country’s population. In Nigeria, a lot of people view handicapped persons as a curse. They are discriminated against even within the family. This resultant attitude has denied this Nigerians of their rights to the dignity of the human person, and to the development of their full potential, as well as participation in the development of the Society. The issue of welfare services on handicapped persons is currently generating some concerns in the society (Nigeria) and the conspicuously insufficient empirical research on this topic especially in Uyo metropolis are factors that stimulated a strong interest for this research. Also, to highlight to the Government and other Agencies the need for provision of essential welfare services to handicapped persons as well as fill in the gaps of knowledge and ways in which the handicap persons in Uyo can be independent and socially integrated in the society.</p> <ul><li><strong>Objectives of Study</strong></li> </ul> <p>As a result of the inability of handicapped persons to participate in the normal life of the family and the community, they become maladjusted because of a feeling of inequality, lack of prestige and other concomitants of “not belonging”. Handicapped persons in our society have provided challenges to those who provide for their education and rehabilitation. Provision for and modifications of services to accommodate them have created problems which have stimulated innovation and imagination in the quest for appropriate solutions.</p> <p>The Objectives of this study is therefore aimed at achieving the following:</p> <ol><li>To examine the role played by the government and other organisations for the betterment of the handicapped persons in the State.</li> <li>To seek ways in which policy makers could formulate laws against the discrimination of handicapped persons in the State.</li> <li>To highlight possible welfare services made available for the handicapped persons.</li> <li>To identify the effectiveness as well as weaknesses of welfare services on the handicapped persons.</li> </ol> <ul><li><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></li> </ul> <p>The significance of this study cannot be overemphasized; First, this study will go a long way to enlighten individuals especially the handicap persons on their rights and benefits put in place for them by government in the society.</p> <p>Second, the study will assist guardians, social workers and the Nigerian masses to adopt measures which will assist handicap persons in improving their standard of living and general wellbeing. Third, the research will serve as a source of reference to others who may want to carryout similar research in a more detailed format.</p> <p><strong>1.5     Scope and Limitations of the Study</strong></p> <p>In this study, the problems and challenges of the handicap persons in Uyo metropolis will be critically examined. Also, the vital welfare services and programmes put in place by the government to cater for their basic needs will be discussed. However, the study will be limited to three selected sampled streets in Uyo metropolis since it has a wide geographical coverage. The reason for selecting three streets is because of limited time and schedule. Thus, the sampled streets selected will represent the study sampled population within Uyo metropolis.</p> <p><strong>1.6     Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The hypothesis is a tentative statement of the expected relationship between two or more variables that need to be proved empirically. The study will formulate and test the following hypotheses which are stated in Null (Ho) and alternative (H1) forms.</p> <p>Ho:    There is no significant relationship between social marginalisation and handicapped persons.</p> <p>H1:   There is significant relationship between social marginalisation and   handicapped persons.</p> <p>Ho:    There is no significant relationship between lack of vocational training and handicapped persons.</p> <p>H1:    There is significant relationship between lack of vocational training and handicapped persons.</p> <p>Ho:   There is no significant relationship between inadequate health care services and handicapped persons.</p> <p>H1:    There is significant relationship between inadequate health care services and handicapped persons.</p> <p><strong>1.7     Definition of Concepts</strong></p> <p>The definition of concept in this study will enable readers of the work to understand the meaning of terms used in the study.</p> <p><strong>WELFARE SERVICES</strong>: These are those organized activities that are primarily and directly concerned with consideration of protection and improvement of human resources which include social services, social assistance, children welfare, public health, education, recreation, labour and housing.</p> <p><strong>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION</strong>: Vocational education is education within vocational schools that prepares people for a specific trade.

The<br/>study adopted the functionalist theory as the theoretical framework<br/>for this study adopted the descriptive method and made use of the<br/>questionnaire and semi-structured interview as methods of data<br/>collected. On the causes of single parenthood in Makurdi local<br/>government area, the study reveals that, divorce is the cause of<br/>single parenthood. On the effects of single parenthood in Makurdi<br/>local government area, the study reveals that, parenthood affects<br/>children education. Also, on the possible solutions to the problem of<br/>single parenthood, the study findings suggest that, orientation and<br/>parental counseling as ways of solving the problem of single<br/>parenthood. Base on the research findings, the study concludes that,<br/>the family lays the psychosocial, moral and spiritual foundations in<br/>the overall development of the child. Thus, parenthood is a<br/>responsibility requiring the full cooperation of both parents who must<br/>ensure the total development of their children. This analysis becomes<br/>necessary because life in a single parent family can be stressful for<br/>both the child and the parent. Furthermore, the study recommends that,<br/>there should be enforcement of child right act and relevant laws to<br/>protect children from single parent homes and help them develop<br/>better. Also, financial and moral support to children from single<br/>parenthoods can help solve the hardship children from poor single<br/>parent homes face as some of their needs can be sorted out which will<br/>help solve the problems that will hinder their development in the<br/>society. Also, scholarship should be granted by the government to<br/>children from single parent homes in order to give them the basic<br/>education that is distorted as a result of parental separation and<br/>enhancetheir development.</p>\n\nTHE SOCIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF SINGLE PARENTHOOD<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE SOCIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF SINGLE PARENTHOOD", "id": 82}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>   </p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>There is a wide concern for the high rate of abnormal behaviour evident in our youth as a result of home video films they are exposed to.</p> <p>          This research was undertaken to find out the significance of home video in the life of these youths, with particular reference to Social Science Faculty of the University of Benin.  This research is of immense importance because it examines the crucial problem of home video and its influence in the life of its audience.  The researcher has demonstrated that home video is highly influential and since youths are easily influenced, whatever message home video carries is definitely copied by youths.</p> <p>          On the basis of these findings, certain recommendations were made which would be beneficial to the government and all agencies concerned with home-video and upbringing of youths.</p> <p><strong> CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <ol><li><strong>Introduction</strong></li> </ol> <p>Since the beginning of humanity, man has sought to preserve memories through the creation of artifacts that will transcend our own lifetime and so assume ourselves some form of posterity, perhaps even eternality.  Writing had been the major complex medium of preserved reality until the end of 19th century, new forms of external memory appeared, first came photography that brought a total new sense of realism to images, then sound transmission and finally came moving images which gave the mission that life could be recorded brought the era of television, then followed by films.</p> <p>Films as a form of mass media are means for delivering impersonal communication to a vast audience Macionis (2007).  Films have an enormous effect on our attitudes and behaviour.  Films are forever modifying our behaviour, altering our attitudes and opinions.  It also influences our choice of interpretation and perception of reality.  Its persuasive power is capable of taking emotional possession of her audience.  When films are tagged the major and most persuasive mass media today, it is the principal leisure activity of most adults and children.  Countries have sought to own a film industry and Nigeria is not an exception.</p> <p>Nigeria has a movie/film industry valued at over three hundred and thirty billion naira, Zik Zulu Okafor (2009).  The industry is Africa’s largest movie industry in terms of number of movies produced per year.  When home video made its debut in 1992 with “Living in bondage”, its success promised so much.

particular reference to Social Science Faculty of the University of Benin.  This research is of immense importance because it examines the crucial problem of home video and its influence in the life of its audience.  The researcher has demonstrated that home video is highly influential and since youths are easily influenced, whatever message home video carries is definitely copied by youths.           On the basis of these findings, certain recommendations were made which would be beneficial to the government and all agencies concerned with home-video and upbringing of youths.  CHAPTER ONE Introduction Since the beginning of humanity, man has sought to preserve memories through the creation of artifacts that will transcend our own lifetime and so assume ourselves some form of posterity, perhaps even eternality.  Writing had been the major complex medium of preserved reality until the end of 19th century, new forms of external memory appeared, first came photography that brought a total new sense of realism to images, then sound transmission and finally came moving images which gave the mission that life could be recorded brought the era of television, then followed by films. Films as a form of mass media are means for delivering impersonal communication to a vast audience Macionis (2007).  Films have an enormous effect on our attitudes and behaviour.  Films are forever modifying our behaviour, altering our attitudes and opinions.  It also influences our choice of interpretation and perception of reality.  Its persuasive power is capable of taking emotional possession of her audience.  When films are tagged the major and most persuasive mass media today, it is the principal leisure activity of most adults and children.  Countries have sought to own a film industry and Nigeria is not an exception. Nigeria has a movie/film industry valued at over three hundred and thirty billion naira, Zik Zulu Okafor (2009).  The industry is Africa’s largest movie industry in terms of number of movies produced per year.  When home video made its debut in 1992 with “Living in bondage”, its success promised so much. The industry has grown quite popular over the years.  Thus, since Nigerian home videos became ubiquitous, its impact on viewers especially youths has been the subject of considerable research. It is often difficult to encounter someone who haven’t at one point seen a home video.  The nature of videos produced are absolutely captivating that her audience are held hostage by its glitz.  Nollywood has been an issue of constant debate as regards to its connection to the attitude and behaviour of youth vis-à-vis the content of the movies. It has a lot of emphasis on interpersonal violence and acquisitive lawlessness, a role both in inciting aggressive behaviours.  Youths learn to be aggressive by imitating the actors much as they learn cognitive and social skill by imitation as children.   Youths exposed to violence reveals the danger of demonstrating socially undesirable behaviour and criminal techniques.  Sexual and romantic films have a profound effect.  Sexual passions are aroused and amateur prostitution is aggravated.  The proliferation of cheap, dehumanized sex and violence in films are bound over the long run to have a harmful effect not merely in encouraging more violent actions but gradually deadening the sensibilities of those exposed to such films.

To examine the aspects of our value system and culture which have or have not been projected properly in or by home videos. To find out if actors portray themselves as decent and reliable role models. To determine the level of connection between movie and fashion. 1.3     Research Questions/Hypotheses           The following hypotheses will be tested: That frequent exposure to violent messages in movies leads to aggressive behaviour and lawlessness. Movies do not showcase our cultural values and traditional teachings properly. That movies with lustful or sexual content leads to increase in promiscuity. That movie actors and actresses influence youths as regards indecent dressing. That movies generally impact negative knowledge in youths. Justification of Study The findings of this study will help in throwing more light on the influence of movies on youths.  It is expected that the study will arouse the consciousness of individuals to the fact that movies have influence on youths’ behaviour which could be morally acceptable or unacceptable.           Finally, it is expected to help the appropriate authorities in reducing the negative influence of movie messages on youths. 1.5     Operational Definitions of Major Concept Mass Media:  This term refers to the various means of communication to the public.  It includes radio, televisions, etc, but here it is used to explain films and home videos.  It is called mass because the message reaches out to more than one person at a time.  It is directed to a large dispersed audience, which is how home video operates.

It is in light of this that Caldwell (2009) coined the term “educare”, to help widen the scope described. The new expansion of childhood now includes child minding centres for infants, kindergarten and nursery schools. Let us take our minds back to the word, ‘Kindergarten’. Can you remember? We first saw that word in our discussion on the historical background on the concept and practice of early childhood. Then we saw the word was actually coined by the German educator, Friedrich Froebel. In his conception, “kindergarten” literally means. “Child’s garden”. Internationally, “educare” or childcare in a group setting could be offered in a crèche, day-care or childcare centres, nursery and kindergarten schools. However, as previously noted, the usage of these terms varies from country to country, depending too on their philosophical inclination for the custodial nature of monitorial infant education. Importantly, early childhood education especially kindergarten or nursery goes beyond mere provision of childhood services; it also improves the general welfare of the child. It also improves the general welfare of the child. It is also in line with this that we will in this unit look at the place of child welfare in early childhood education, as well as parental role.</p> <p>Early childhood education in most nations is also offered in day care centres, nursery and kindergarten schools. Until recently, with increasing modernity, there were two types of nursery schools in Nigeria. These are the “Akara” school and the traditional Western-type nursery and day care centres. The first was typical of low-income families. The “Akara’ school was usually poorly organised and often run by unqualified teachers. However, in more recent times, it is fast disappearing, even though there are yet in existence, sub-standard nursery schools. Formal education for the Nigerian child actually begins in nursery school or kindergarten. Formal nursery education is described by the Nigerian National Policy on Education, (NPE, 1998:11), as that school-like activity given in an institution for children aged three to five. This is with an aim to promoting school readiness. Basically, the programmes of Nigerian early childhood education could be said to provide socialization and custodial roles, and, as most parents believe, they actually aim at giving the child a head-start in formal school, the expectation is a smooth transition to the primary stage of learning. Generally, early childhood education or pre-education in the Nigerian context includes the crèche, the nursery and the kindergarten.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>        The research which deals with the knowledge and attitude of early childhood education students towards the study of early child education as a course of study in Colben is relatively a new department in the Nigeria educational system hence there was the problem of insufficient materials in the field.</p> <p>        Also, another problem of the study is the poor attention giving to early child education in Nigeria by the government as early childcare education is left in the hands of the private individuals in the country. Lack of adequate funding, infrastructure is another problem of early childcare education in Nigeria.  </p> <p><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objective of the study is to find out the knowledge and attitude of early childhood education students towards the study of early child education in Colben in Ovia North East Local Government Area, Edo State.</p> <p>The specific objective includes;</p> <p>1.   The concept of early childhood education.</p> <p>2.   The importance of early childhood education Nigerian.</p> <p>3.   The role of parents in early childhood education.</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1.   Does students have positive attitude towards the study of early childhood education in College of Education, Ekiadolor –Benin in Ovia North East Local Government Area?  </p> <p><strong>2.   </strong>Are the students aware of the importance of early childhood education?</p> <p><strong>3.   </strong>Does lack of adequate facilities affect early childhood education among Colben Students?</p> <p><strong>4.   </strong>Does government help to finance early childhood education in Nigeria? </p> <p><strong>5.   </strong>Does early child education enhance the cognitive development of the child?</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study of early childhood education differ from country to country. Essentially, day care and crèches provide supervision and care for infants and young ones during the day time so that their parents can hold their jobs. This first phase of childcare and education is from birth or 3 months to 3 years. The first idea of day care centres were warm, safe environments where children could be cared for. It was also aimed at creating opportunities for these young toddlers to interact. In other words, besides the custodial roles played by day care centres and day nursery, there has been increasing evidence that young children in such centres can benefit substantially from involvement in some form of playful learning activities.</p> <p>Early childhood education is also important in fostering children’s cognitive and physical development. This is outside the expected custodial roles. In the same vein, the aim of childcare from birth till 3 years in Argentina centres on social and psycho-emotional development. On the other hand, Nursery schools or kindergarten actually known as Maternal Schools are designed to promote intellectual and social experiences for children. Like it is with the case in day care or day nursery, the objectives of nursery school also emphasizes social skills and at other times, there is focus on intellectual development. Significantly, for Nursery schools that follow the Montessorian ideal, the objective is to employ a carefully designed set of materials, so as to create an environment that fosters sensory, motor and language development.</p> <p><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>The study is set out to determine the attitude and knowledge of students towards the study of early childhood education in College of education, Ekiadolor-Benin, Edo State. Therefore, the study is restricted only to Colben student in Ovia North East Local Government Area, Edo State.</p> <p><strong>CHILD LABOUR: A CASE STUDY OF CHILDREN IN BENIN CITY</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>This study examined child labour in Edo State with focus on Benin City. This was examined on their everyday activities on the major streets and especially in the social-cultural settings in which they grew up. Oral interviews were conducted on children randomly drawn from two (2) Local Governments’ Areas in Benin City, (i.e. Oredo and Ikpoba Okha) as the sample for the study. The total number of children in the two (2) Local Government were thirty six (36) five (5) experts and adults were also interviewed. The names of the markets are Oliha market in Oredo Local Government and Oka Market in Ikpoba Okha Local Government. The research instrument used as an unstructured interview. The questions sought personal data such as name, age, home address, school etc. it also examined various aspects of the children. The findings show that many of the children suffer a lot of hardship in order to survive. The findings further reveal that majority of the children engage in hawking on the major roads, working as bus conductors, as “any work” and pushing wheel barrows I the market places.</em></p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT</strong></p> <p><strong>Chapter one      </strong></p> <p>Introduction</p> <p>Background of the study</p> <p>Research question</p> <p>Purpose of study</p> <p>Significance of the study</p> <p>Scope of study</p> <p>Limitation of the study</p> <p>Definition of terms</p> <p><strong>Chapter two      </strong></p> <p>Literature review</p> <p>Summary</p> <p><strong>Chapter three   </strong></p> <p>Methodology</p> <p>Population of the study</p> <p>Sampling techniques</p> <p>Research instrument</p> <p>Validity of instrument</p> <p>Procedure for data collection</p> <p>Method of data analysis</p> <p><strong>Chapter four     </strong></p> <p>Analysis of data</p> <p><strong>Chapter five     </strong></p> <p>Summary, Conclusion and Recommendation</p> <p>Suggestion for further research</p> <p><strong>Reference</strong></p> <p><strong>Questionnaire</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <ol><li><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></li> </ol> <p>A case of child labour in societies today is not a new phenomenon as some might have argued. According to a school of thought, child labour is not alien to our cultural values. It is part of our traditional culture whereby a child is expected to help the parents in augmenting the meager income or resources by selling or hawking farm produce like pepper, tomatoes, okro, vegetables etc on the street or in the nieighbourhood. This practice is to train child, the ability to be self sufficient and helping in giving him courage to face future challenges in marriage either as a woman or man (Adamson, 1993).</p> <p>Even though this line of argument is not generally acceptable among the scholar, it was however acknowledge that child labour if there has been any benefit derived by the child morally, has become a monster threatening the lives of this vulnerable, Nigerian child in the contemporary time of ours (Bouhdiba, 1982). Increased incidences of child labour in urban and metropolitan cities across Nigerian in recent times has received a lot of attention from the press, Non-governmental organization (NGO) poets, musicians, visual artist and researcher in our higher institution of learning. One of the major factors responsible for the increase according to Gwon (1991) is the distmalling of the traditional culture which by extended family system regards child care as a community responsibility but has been destroyed by capitalistic culture or orientation of our modern times. In Benin City a capital of Edo State, child labour has significantly increased from insignificantly number, it was soe years back to a worrisome state which deserves a drastic and urgent attention from all the stakeholders in child development – the parents, government and the society. Though there are no statistical figures to backup the increase, the number of children seen daily on the streets in Benin metropolis as petty hawkers, touts, bus conductors, car washers, wheel barrow pushers etc is a clear indication that the menace of child labour is gradually becoming a complex and intricate problem. It is on this basic that this project will attempt to study the daily life of children in Benin City and the traumatic experiences they pass through daily.                </p> <ol><li><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></li> </ol> <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the daily harrowing life experiences of the children on the street of Benin City trying to eke out a living. This study was also carried out to know the extent the environment, which the children lives contributed to his predicament in terms of his psychological and personality development. It is a known fact that most parents has adjusted their responsibilities to the children hence they took the streets to fend for themselves.</p> <p>This study hoped to bring to the force the health hazards inherent in this act thereby enlighten the parents not to just bring the children but also make appropriates provision for their well being. Finally, the study hoped to assist the appropriate authority responsible for children welfare, to see to it that most of the identified problems are addressed thereby making the child truly a future leader responsible and capable of occupying the position the future has for him.</p> <ol><li><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></li> </ol> <p>Child labour is common in most part of the state capital Benin City which comprises three (3) Local Government Areas. But for the purpose of this project, two (2) Local Government Areas namely; Oredo and Ikpoba Okha Local government Area will be focused on, due to its prevalence in these areas.  </p> <ol><li><strong>SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY</strong></li> </ol> <p>Child they say are the hope of tomorrow. It is therefore important and necessary to engage in efforts that will enhance their well being by drawing to their present predicaments; thereby helping the government to form formulates policies that will protect the rights of these weak members of the society in order to guarantee a better future.</p> <p>This project will go a long way in creating awareness among the populace of the needs to take adequate care of their children and expose the danger inherent in the works these children engaged in. it will also help in changing the perspective of some of the parent who believed that nothing is wrong in child labour since they are in support of the family or train the child to be independent.</p> <p>   Equally too, it will go a long way in documenting the types of child labour prevalent in Benin City and help the child welfare ministry to find appropriates solutions that will discourage the children in engaging in this act. Finally, it will serve as a document for future researchers who might be interested in the activities of the children in Benin City or other parts of the state.</p> <ol><li><strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></li> </ol> <p><strong>Abuse</strong>: Any violation of a child’s right or anything contrary to what principals of 417 and 9 of the undeclaration of 1`959 on children is more or less child abuse.</p> <p> Any Work: A slang given to children running errands in the University Benin Campus for gratification.</p> <p><strong>Conductor</strong>: A person who calls for the passengers and collect fares on bus.</p> <p><strong>Networking</strong>: Is a process of fishing out organizations working in any area of child abuse and neglect and child welfare and linking up one another.

This has been giving the government and parents a lot of causes for concern. Some analysts have likened the cause for concern of this problem to the incessant strike action embarked upon by teachers as a result of irregular payment of salaries. Others attribute it to lack of seriousness on the part of the students. These facts may not be far from the truth. The analysis however, cannot be said to be thorough without researching on student’s family background which goes a long way to affect their performance in school. This is what the study intends to make a research on. To spread the scope and concept of family and extended family system and its impacts on secondary school students performance in school. in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State the effects of extended family system on students performance has been prevalent, the performance of students from extended family has not been too impressive and since the system is practiced in Nigeria and Africa in general students cannot do without socializing with other family members.      </p> <p>        According to Humbling and Matters (1976), “Hunanbings are basically social creatures created by society primarily through family’s influence” society creates the individual; the individual does not create the society. Therefore, in the local government man is allowed two or more wives and this is known as polygamy. Polygamy has constituted academic problems to students. Finally, extended family system has some positive impacts on students since it is the commonest family unit in the society. Members who are financially buoyant assist students who are related to them thereby enabling them to meet some of their needs in school. Against, this background, extended family system is one of the numerous traditional practices which western civilization has not been able to erase in the local government and it may be with us for a long time even in the presence of western threat.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>        In this research attempt will be made to look at the problems students face in some secondary schools in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State as a result of extended family system. The study will also include some suggestions which can help to improve on their performance in school.</p> <p><strong>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        The aim of this study is to analyze the problems associated with extended family system in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State. And to highlight some factors that gave rise to the system. The study also aims at giving recognition to families as the center of the society and how the family also influences student’s performances in school.</p> <p><strong>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        The poor performances of students in school are as a result of extended family system. Therefore is important to study these problems so that the researcher will be in a better position to give appropriate advice to people concerned.</p> <p>        This study will be of importance to social studies teachers as they would in the position to act as counsellors to the students. This work will make parents to be aware of various factors responsible for student’s poor performance in school. Nevertheless, parents have always blamed poor student’s academic attainment on laxity and lack of interest on the part of the teacher.</p> <p><strong>1.5    SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>        In this study, I have limited myself to some secondary schools in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.

As individuals, women have participated in essentially all of the activities in human societies. As a group, however, women have been identified with particular roles ascribed to them by their societies. Marriage and motherhood are the traditional roles of women. This is not in denial, but women should have a wider choice of ways of life.<br/>Throughout history, women generally have fewer legal rights and career opportunities than men. Wifehood and motherhood were regarded as women’s most significant progressions. Historically, they have been considered not only intellectually inferior to men but also a major source of temptation and evil. In Greek mythology, for example, it was a woman, Pandora, who opened the forbidden box and brought plagues law described women as children, forever inferior to me. (Compton’s Encyclopedia, Edition, P.1, 350). <br/>Early Christian theology perpetuated these views. It Jerome, a 4th century Latin father of Christian church, said “Women is the gate of the devil, the path of wickedness, the sting of the serpent, in a word….. a perilous object” Thomas  Aquinas, the 13th century Christian theologian, said that women were “ created to be man’s helpmeet, but her unique role is in conception…. Since for other purposes, men would be better assisted by other men. Bedn (2000) however has it that gender inequality have hampered the full participation of women in social development, and further agues that the rapid economic and social development in our societies requires greater participation of everybody, including women in all spheres of human endeavour.<br/>The adoption of this system of inequality was never the result of deliberation, or fore whatsoever of what would be best for humanity or the good order of society. It simply arose from the fact that from the dawn of human bondage to some man.<br/>The ancient India, for example, women were not deprived of property rights or individual freedom, but Hinduism, which evolved in India after 500 B.C, required obedience of women towards men. Women had to walk behind their husbands. Women, they could not own property and widows could not remarry. Samuel Kramer, in his book “the Goddesses and the theologians. A reflection on women’s right in ancient Sumer, 1952, PP4-5, noted that after enjoying the privilege of able to own a property, being educated and legally able to take more than one husband, Sumerian men achieved the right and status of women from that of men.<br/>When, in the 19th century, professional opportunities for women in Global west began to decline, the required education preparation, particularly for the practice of medicine, increased. This tended to prevent many young women, who married early and bore many children, from entering professional careers. Although home nursing in hospitals was done exclusively by men, Women predominate informal employment jobs that lack formal contracts, security, benefits or social protection (international labour organization, 1Lo, 2002).<br/>In most pre-industrial societies, domestic chores were relegated to women, leaving “heavier” labour such as hunting and plowing to men. This ignored the fact that caring for children and doing such tasks as milking cows and washing clothes also required heavy, sustained labour. The findings of Ekpo (2008) supported Witz’s (1992) demarcation strategy as male dominated all occupational sphere, controlling and directing the affairs of females. All those reveals female subjection in traditional African Societies.<br/>Closing this gender gap constitutes achieving gender equality, which can be defined as a stage of human societies development, at which the rights, responsibilities and opportunities of individuals will not be determined by the fact of being born male or female, in other words, a stage where born men and women realize their full potential” (Lopez- Claros and Zahidi 2005, P.1). Based on above argument, the purpose of this research study is therefore to examine religion, occupation and education as agents of subordination of women in Akwa-Ibom, and the world at large. The role of religion education and occupation the realization of this harmonious balance between all artifacts of life cannot be over emphasized.</p>\n\nWOMEN SUBORDINATION IN RELIGION, OCCUPATION AND EDUCATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " WOMEN SUBORDINATION IN RELIGION, OCCUPATION AND EDUCATION", "id": 86}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>AN ASSESMENT OF MAINTENANCE CULTURE IN NIGERIA AIR FORCE PRINTING PRESSES</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>The maintenance culture in Nigeria is nothing to write home about.  That is the reason why many factories collapse as a result of lack of preventive maintenance culture which leads to collapse of buildings, equipment’s, machines and the factory as a whole. Maintenance break down or preventive is very necessary for the continuing survival of a factory.  It is with good maintenance culture that appropriate sound and functional machinery, equipment and tools can be maintained which would facilitate continuing operation of and industry.  In a situation when parts are allowed to break down without replacement or servicing there would be system break-down which could lead to disruptions of production.  If equipment is not up to date and functional quality products and or services cannot be produced. In Nigeria, greed, non-challant attitude corruption and some other factors seriously impede maintenance culture and hence disruptions of production activities in factories.  When this occurs customers are not provided with choice and sometimes non-existence of the products or services is experienced.  Employees also suffer from the effects of non-maintenance culture in Nigeria.Infrastructural development is the basis and bedrock of any development effort in the world today. It is important to stress that, it is not enough for facilities of development to be put in place; it is more than enough for these facilities to be adequately and properly maintained so that the purpose for which they are meant would be accomplished. However, the attitude of people towards public facilities is that of government property that do not belong to anybody (Adeleye, 2009). To this extent facilities that were meant to benefit the masses are just rotting away, being wasted without being put to any good use as people are not interested in making such facilities sustainable. The result therefore, is that public facilities do not last long due to lack of maintenance. This shows that without a strong maintenance culture, infrastructural development will amount to nothing. The phrase maintenance culture could therefore be seen as an important one that should be defined to have a proper understanding of what it stands for in the process of sustainable development. Ajibola (2009) defines culture as “The shared belief and values of a group; the beliefs, customs, practices and social behavior of a particular nation or people”. He defined maintenance as “The work that is done regularly to keep a machine, building or a piece of equipment in good conditions”. He expatiated further that maintenance is a combination of actions carried out to retain an item in or to restore the item to an acceptable condition. When it comes to aircraft, the issue of age, you can think about it but again what you must focus on really is the serviceability.You could have an aircraft, maybe 52 years old. But it is still being effectively utilized for war. It’s your maintenance schedule. If you give it the best of maintenance, sometimes an aircraft that is even 20 years old may even be airworthier than the ones that are just about two years old.It depends on maintenance approach and the culture that you have been developed over the years.The role of aircraft maintenance, simply put, is to ensure that aircraft presented “on the line” for flight operations comply with:all legal requirements (e.g. continuing airworthiness requirements, airworthiness directives, certificate of release to service, type certificate and supplementary type certificate),operational equipage requirements (e.g. oxygen systems, first aid, and flotation devices), and appropriate equipment for the type of operation being flown (e.g. communication, navigation and surveillance).Furthermore, where maintenance is conducted under contract by a third-party maintenance and repair organization, each airline customer may have other specific requirements (e.g. additional safety features, technical solutions, and issues such as in-flight entertainment and seating aircraft discrepancy (physical degradation or failure) attributed to the actions of the aircraft maintenance technician”. Rankin (1997), in examining the experience of the Boeing organization, reports that improper maintenance contributes to 15 per cent of commercial jet accidents. Based on Boeing’s experience, Marx (1998) calculated that in the USA alone the number of commercial aircraft dispatched each year with a maintenance error is roughly 48,800. It is in this view the researcher want to assess the maintenance culture of Nigeria air force printing presses</p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>It is with good maintenance culture that appropriate sound and functional machinery, equipment and tools can be maintained which would facilitate continuing operation of and industry.  In a situation when parts are allowed to break down without replacement or servicing there would be system collapse which could lead to disruptions of production.

Worldwide, government and non- governmental organizations frown at FGM having seen it as an infringement on the physical and psychosexual integrity of the female child. Nigeria was said to have the highest absolute number of cases of FGM in the world, accounting for about one-quarter of the estimated 115– 130 million circumcised women worldwide (UNICEF 2001). The prevalence rate of FGM was put at 41% among adult Nigerian women (Okeke 2012). Nigeria is a country in West Africa bordering the Gulf of Guinea between Benin and Cameroon. It has an area of 923,768.00 sq kilometers with a population of 140,431,790 according to the 2006 National Population census (National Bureau of Statistics 2006). The male constituted 71,345,488 while the female were 69,086,302 (National Bureau of Statistics 2006). This study was donein a tertiary hospital in Edo State, one of the 36 states of Nigeria. Edo State has a population of 2,398,957with the female being 1,215,487and the male 69,086,302 (National Bureau of Statistics 2006). It is majorly inhabited by the Edo’s who are noted for high level of literacy in terms of formal education and is reputed to have produced the reasonable number of professors in Nigeria (Adesina 2008).The 2008 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey showed that 30% of female surveyed between ages 15- 40years had undergone female circumcision with the Yoruba and igbo ethnic groups having the highest percentage (58.4% and 51.4% respectively) (National Population Commission 2009).Olamijulo et al., reported the prevalence of FGM among children examined at the child welfare clinic, Wesley Guild Hospital, Ilesha, Nigeria to be 66.3%.The following states in Nigeria have prohibited this act since 1999;Abia, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Ogun, Osun and Rivers. However, with increasing awareness of the complication of FGM, there is a recent ban on the practice in Nigeria as a nation in year 2015. The prevalence rate is therefore expected to progressively decline in the younger age groups. FGM practiced in Nigeria is classified into four typesas follows; clitoridectomy or Type I, this involves the removal of the prepuce or the hood of the clitoris and all or part of the clitoris. Type II or “sunna” is a more severe practice that involves the removal of the clitoris along with partial or total excision of the labia minora. Type III (infibulation), involves the removal of the clitoris, the labia minora and adjacent medial part of the labia majora and the stitching of the vaginal orifice, leaving an opening of the size of a pin head to allow for menstrual flow or urine. Type IV or other unclassified types include introcision and gishiri cuts, hymenectomy, scraping and/or cutting of the vagina, the introduction of corrosive substances and herbs in the vagina, and other forms. Consequences of female genital mutilation include increased risks of urinary tract infections, bleeding, bacterial vaginosis, dyspareunia, obstetric complications, psychological problems such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, low self-esteem, etc (Behrendt and Moritz, 2005), Abdulcadir and Dällenbach, 2013), Amin et al.,., 2013), Andersson et al.,., 2012), Andro et al.Female genital mutilation is classified into four major types (WHO, 1996). The most common type of the female genital mutilation is type 2 which account for up to 80% of all cases while the most extreme form which is type 3 constitutes about 15% of the total procedures(WHO, 1996; Oduro et al., 2006). Types 1 and 4 of FGM constitute the remaining 5%. The consequences vary according to the type of FGM and severity of the procedure (Onuh et al., 2006; Oduro et al., 2006). The practice of FGM has diverse repercussions on the physical, psychological, sexual and reproductive health of women, severely deteriorating their current and future quality of life (Oduro et al., 2006; Larsen, 2002). The immediate complications include: severe pain, shock, haemorrhage, urinary complications, injury to adjacent tissue and even death (Onuh et al., 2006; Oduro et al., 2006; Larsen, 2002). The long term complications include: urinary incontinence, painful sexual intercourse, sexual dysfunction, fistula formation, infertility, menstrual dysfunctions, and difficulty with child birth (Akpuaka, 1998; Okonofua et al., 2002; Oguguo and Egwuatu, 1982). The physical and psychological sequelae of female genital mutilation have been well highlighted in many literatures (Onuh et al., 2006; Oduro et al., 2006; Badejo, 1983; Klouman et al., 2005; ACHPR, 2003; Ibekwe, 2004). Recently, there has been serious concern on the increased rate of transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) following this practice (WHO, 1996; Klouman et al., 2005). The practice is also a violation of the human rights of the women and girl child. FGM categorically violates the right to health, security and physical integrity, freedom from torture and cruelty, inhuman or degrading treatment and the right to life when the procedure results in death. It constitutes an extreme form of violation, intimidation and discrimination. Despite its numerous complications, this harmful practice has continued unabated, notwithstanding that Nigeria ratified the Maputo Protocols and was one of the countries that sponsored a resolution at the 46th World Health Assembly calling for the eradication of female genital mutilation in all nation (Klouman et al., 2005; ACHPR, 2003; Idowu, 2008).</p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The practice of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is regrettably persistent in many parts of the world. This occurs commonly in developing countries where it is firmly anchored on culture and tradition, not minding many decades of campaign and legislation against the practice (Onuh et al., 2006; WHO, 2008). Female genital mutilation comprises any procedure involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for cultural, religious or other non-therapeutic reason (WHO, 2008; WHO, 1996). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that between 100 and 140 million girls and women worldwide are presently living with female genital mutilation and every year about three million girls are at risk (WHO, 2008). It is in view of this that the researcher intends to assess the effect of female genital mutilation.</p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study is on an assessment of female genital mutilation in Nigeria with emphasis on Edo state.

Yet capital scarcity is norm in most developing nations like Nigeria. With this in view, this study examines the determinants of capital flight in Nigeria. In executing this crucial study, annual time series data, between 1980 and 2014 is used and error correction model (ECM) is employed after Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) unit root tests as well Johansen cointegration analysis has been applied to the variables. In identifying the determinants of capital flight in Nigeria, the study employs the Residual method of measuring capital flight. Of the six variables modeled as the determinants of capital flight in Nigeria; exchange rate, real interest rate, external debt stock, economic openness and political instability are found to account for capital flight. Real gross domestic product is found not to be a significant determinant of capital flight in the country. The study recommends policy options aimed at abating capital flight as well as raising investment levels in the country.</p> <p><strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>According to (Ajilore, 2010) capital flight refers to any illicit movement of capital away from a domestic to a foreign economy. (Ndikumana and Boyce, 2002) also defined capital flight as residents’ capital outflows, excluding recorded investment abroad.(Schneider , 2003) defines it as that part of outflow of resident capital that is motivated by economic and political uncertainty. This implies that such political uncertainty will involve likely change of government or governmental policies as denoted by country instability and all forms of minor and major changes in the political circumstance of the country. According to (Noor et al,2015), the movement of capital from domestic to foreign economy could be normal or economically good if it is of capital export or foreign direct investment. These flows of capital abroad, which are subjected to regulation and do not endanger national economy, would foster economic growth of a nation. However, the illicit movement of capital away from domestic to foreign economy would worsen the capital scarcity problem especially in emerging economies; thus, contributing to economic contraction as well as collapse of the financial markets. </p>\n\nDETERMINANTS OF CAPITAL FLIGHT IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DETERMINANTS OF CAPITAL FLIGHT IN NIGERIA", "id": 89}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The developed economies of the world have advanced in the goal of achieving a balance between population growth rate and economic resources. In view of this, measures have been taken which include family planning, sex education, among others in controlling such growth. The major aim borne in mind towards effecting this policy is the general standard of living of citizen. To this effect, modern family planning method in addition to natural family planning mode have been developed and improved upon in the recent past. Family planning has become an important population issue of many countries. It is considered as part of national population/health policies or programmes. Inspite of the hue and cry in and outside Nigeria about family planning or birth control, many people are still confused about its meaning, the method involve, advantages and disadvantages and the factors hindering its wide application in Nigeria. Improving reproductive health is central to achieving the sustainable Development Goals.(SDGS) on improving maternal health, reducing child mortality eradicating extreme poverty, promoting gender equality and empowering women to have access to safe and effective methods of fertility control. The promotion of family planning so that men and women can avoid unwanted pregnancy is central to the world health organization (WHO) work on improving maternal health and core to achieving the S.D.G.S (Cleland Bernstein, Ezeh, FaundersGlasier and Inms 2006).</p>\n\nGENDER DIMENSION IN THE USE OF FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " GENDER DIMENSION IN THE USE OF FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES", "id": 90}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Aging is both a ‘natural’ and ‘universal’ process; but growing old can be as peaceful as it can be traumatic, especially in a transitional society. The perception of the younger generation towards the aged is a global phenomenon. How the aged are perceived goes a long way in determining how they are treated or cared for. These perceptions are often informed by ideas and their manifestations are embedded in a culture of a given society across the globe (Atchley and Barusch, 2004). Perception of the aged is therefore culture bound.  The increasing numbers of older people, especially in Africa, unfortunately is taking place in a situation where the society is least prepared for challenges that older people are presenting and shall present as the demand to meet their needs grow (Adedokun, 2010). This increasing nature of the older people has been greatly attributed to improvement in education and healthcare services. The range of problems that older people in Africa are facing is constantly increasing as societies are locked up in conflicts, experience economic recession and hardship, natural disasters, diseases and deterioration in family relationships. The negative attitudes that society has towards older people has meant that solutions are being sought for all other population groups except older people (Nhongo, 2006).</p>\n\nPERCEPTION AND CARE OF THE AGED AMONG THE ADOLESCENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PERCEPTION AND CARE OF THE AGED AMONG THE ADOLESCENTS", "id": 91}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p> THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN NIGERIA POLITICS (A CASE STUDY OF EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA) </p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT </strong></p> <p><em>Political participation is at the heart of Democracy.

In the traditional era, alcohol played complex roles in the socio-cultural relationships of different communities. It was used for rituals, marriage ceremonies, chieftaincy enthronements, etc. It was mainly consumed by male adults for pleasure while females and youths were culturally restrained from drinking. Excess consumption was not a norm and intoxication attracted negative sanctions. In the contemporary Nigerian society, patterns of consumption are changing rapidly following the socio-political and economic development of Nigeria, giving rise to new norms of alcohol use. This review examines the impact of alcohol consumption on health behavior of youths and the changing patterns of alcohol consumption. It concludes by exploring the consequences of these effects of alcohol consumption on the health behavior of youths and suggests some remedies for contemporary Nigerian society. </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Alcohol consumption appears very rampant in schools and in the society at large. It seems to be the source one of the country's major health challenge as well as social problems. The impact of alcoholism on youth has remained a source of worry to parents, schools, society and even the government because of the attendant misbehaviours that usually follow it have negative effect on the society and educational advancement cum achievement of the students. Current trends suggest that overall drug use is on the decline, but the proportion of youth continuing to initiate illicit substance use remains troubling. According to a recent survey, youth perception of harm associated with illicit substance use (e.g., marijuana) remains low, whereas abuse of inhalants is at a recent all-time high (Johnston et al., 2005). In 2004, approximately 1.4 million adolescents reported past year methamphetamine use (SAMHSA, 2005), and nearly 2.1 million youth across the United States engaged in marijuana use for the first time (Johnston et al., 2005).As a result of these trends, researchers increasingly have targeted adolescent substance users. There are various locations where students have access to alcohol such as beer parlours, clubs, parties and so on. It has been observed that people across cultures and countries have different reasons for drinking alcohol. Some people drink in other to conform to the norm of a particular group while adolescents majorly engage in alcohol drinking for ego assertion birth as a result of desire to be independent. For other adolescents they engage in drinking in other to reduce frustration, relieve boredom, fatigue and in addition they perceive that it could help them to escape harsh realities of their world. Some youths intake of alcohol is influenced by their parents, personal gratification and temporary adaptations are also reasons while young adults venture into alcohol consumption which is usually festered by family background crisis such as divorce or separation. Hence, such young adults are exposed and lack significant adults in their life to check their socially undesirable behaviours. Several scholars and researchers has attributed alcohol consumption to a lot of reasons and factors. World Health Organization (2004), posited that alcohol consumption are usually due to environmental factors, friends or peer group, social wellbeing and uncontrollable drinking habits of an individual. Again it is not uncommon to find students consume alcohol because of curiosity, urge and desire to achieve success in a competitive world, emotional disturbances such as anxiety due to stress, subculture and advertisement influence. Bennett (1997) viewed alcohol as a drink that is as dangerous as cocaine and heroin. He went further to note that the unfortunate thing about it is that, unlike other similarly dangerous drugs, it appears to enjoy greater acceptance and its consumption is often openly applauded by the government, press and manufacturers. This could be as a result of the resources which the government in form of tax receive and higher sales made from it. It is noticed that even at the periods of economic depression ; breweries continue to record and declare heavy profits and parts of which also goes into expansion of the production plants. WHO(2004), stated the side effect of alcohol on individuals and society at large. These effects are numerous and include the following; psychological disorder, untimely death and health problems to mention in summary. Regardless of these negative effects, Nigerians celebrate every joyful occasion with alcoholic drinks; be it naming ceremonies, birthday parties, promotions and even burial ceremonies. All these are factors that enhance the consumption of alcoholic substance by adolescents. Johnson and Johnson (2000) identified some of the factors further such as dysfunctional families, cheap availability of alcohol, hereditary, gender, race, and ethnicity. According to Quine and Stephenson (1990) posited that the attitude of parents towards alcohol will also affect how children will feel about the depressant. Invariably many students who consume alcohol are from families where there low levels of parenting and emotional support and also a lack of control and monitoring of a child's behaviour, poor family communication, inadequate family problem, solving and nagging at home. In which case, an individual's family background plays an important role in the attitude of students' alcoholism. Religious affiliation has also been found as an important factor that determines alcohol consumption among students. It is usually believed that religious groups have rules, ethics and guidelines that guide them. Most religion advocate mediation in all things, this principle could hence be transferred to the issue of alcohol consumption. In this study conducted by Jenkins (2013), he found out that religiously affiliated students reported less alcohol consumption than the non religion students. In a survey carried out in Ibadan, religion was found to have a significant relationship with a significant relationship with alcohol consumption(Adenuga&amp;ijagbone,2012). Young people join different peer groups and identify themselves with these groups by participating in their activities so as not to be rejected. According to Mello(1996) he found out that alcohol consumption among students is on the increase and that they are mostly influenced to drinking alcohol by their friends and these on the other affect attitude towards school. A young person who is attached to a peer group that values anti-social activities inevitably finds it difficult to resist the encouragement of peer group members in such negative behaviour. Environmental influences on alcohol includes acceptance of alcohol use by the society, through mass media, role models and this acceptance is demonstrated by lack of formal laws enforcement and social disapproval for those who engage in dangerous drinking or create problems while drunk. This has a way of sending messages to the younger generation that such behaviour is accepted; as it intoxicates behaviours (including assaults, vandalism and public nuisance). Alcohol consumption is a serious public health challenge worldwide, including in Nigeria. Although the level of alcohol consumption differs widely around the world, the burden of disease and death remains significant in most regions, with Europe and America having the highest alcohol attributable fractions at 6.5% and 5.6%, respectively. Recent evidence also indicates that alcohol consumption is now the world's third largest risk factor for disease and disability; almost 4% of all deaths globally are attributed to alcohol. However, alcohol is the most commonly used psychoactive drug in both young people and adults in Nigeria. Some of the factors contributing to alcohol consumption among Nigerians include the absence of alcohol policies, easy access to alcoholic drinks, and lack of implementation of a minimum drinking age by both the government and the brewers.</p> <p>According to Bada and Adebiyi, it is not rare for Nigerian secondary school students to consume alcoholic drinks; this consumption could be due to their curiosity as adolescents, an irresistible urge, emotional disturbances such as anxiety, the subculture, and the influence of advertisements. Several previous studies have shown the prevalence of alcohol consumption among the Nigerian population, but they did not explore adolescent students’ understanding of its negative health effects. For instance, Lasebikan and Ola found that the prevalence of lifetime alcohol use was 57.9% and that of current alcohol use was 27.3% among a sample of Nigerian semirural community dwellers. Through in-person interviews with Nigerian adults, previous research by Gureje et al revealed that the lifetime prevalence of alcohol consumption was 56%. A recent study by Alex-Hart et al  showed that the prevalence of current alcohol consumption among a sample of Nigerian secondary school students was 30.6% and that 38.1% of current drinkers had also been drunk in the past 30 days, with 17.2% being drunk very frequently.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Alcohol consumption negatively affects human health across the lifespan. Previous studies show that alcohol consumption is associated with a burden of diseases such as cancer, pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis, tuberculosis, pneumonia, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, malignancies, psychiatric morbidity, and injury. Although 18 years of age is the legal limit for alcohol consumption per policy in many parts of the world, sociocultural influences seem to hinder strict adherence to this public health policy in Nigerian society. It is in view of the above that the researcher intends to investigate the influence of alcohol on health behavior of youth in Ojo barracks</p> <p><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objective of the present study was therefore to investigate the influence of alcohol on health behavior of youth in Ojo barracks in Nigeria. Specifically, the study sought to attain the following sub-objectives</p> <p>i)             To ascertain the effect of alcohol on the health behavior of the youth</p> <p>ii)           To examine the impact of alcohol on mental imbalance amongst youth in Ojo barracks</p> <p>iii)          To ascertain if there is any relationship between alcoholism and the health behavior of the youth</p> <p>iv)         To examine the role of government in curbing the rate of alcoholism amongst the youth in Ojo barracks</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>To aid the successful completion of the study, the following research hypotheses were formulated by the researcher;</p> <p><strong>H0:  </strong>alcoholism does not have any effect on the health behavior of youth in Ojo barracks </p> <p><strong>H1:  </strong>alcoholism does have an effect on the health behavior of youth in Ojo barracks</p> <p><strong>H02: </strong>there is no significant relationship between alcoholism and the health behavior of youth in Ojo barracks in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>H2: </strong>there is a significant relationship between alcoholism and the health behavior of youth in Ojo barracks in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is believed that at the completion of the study the findings will be of great importance to the guardian of this youth to educate them on the health dangers of alcoholism, the study will also be of importance to government agencies and parastatals that are charge with the responsibility of regulating the age restriction to sales of alcohol to under age. The study will also be of great importance to researchers who intend to embark on a study on a similar topic as the findings of the study will serve as a reference point to further research, finally the study will also be of great importance to students, teachers, lecturers, and academia’s as the study will also contribute to the pool of knowledge on the subject matter and also contribute to the existing literature.</p> <p><strong>1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>  The scope of the study covers influence of alcohol on health behavior of youth in Ojo barracks. But in the cause of the study, there were some factors which militate against the scope of the study;</p> <p><strong>a) AVAILABILITY OF RESEARCH MATERIAL:</strong> The research material available to the researcher is insufficient, thereby limiting the study  </p> <p><strong>b) TIME:</strong> The time frame allocated to the study does not enhance wider coverage as the researcher has to combine other academic activities and examinations with the study.</p> <p><strong>c) Organizational privacy</strong>: Limited Access to the selected auditing firm makes it difficult to get all the necessary and required information concerning the activities.  </p> <p><strong>1.7 OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS </strong></p> <p><strong>Influence: </strong>Social influence, in social psychology, influence in interpersonal relationships.

It affects hundreds of the millions of people, many of whom are mothers and fathers for two thirds of citizens in every nation. It is treating as number one; it creates social illness for people. It is also a principle roots of the problems of many young people who become involve in various criminal activities like drug peddling. Advance fee fraud (419) and it disturbs the sleep of millions and for the millions of others. It could be just around the corner. <br/><br/>According to Encyclopedia America volume 27 (1974) it state that, unemployment is a state of person who wants to work, but does not have a job. It can be seen as a structural problem where the production capacity of the economy is far below the level of absorbing the available manpower. The unemployment can also be said to mean those people who are able and eager to work, but for whom no suitable works are available.<br/><br/>According to ADRIAN SINFIELD unemployment devalues or debases the standard or quality of life in the society. He elaborates further in the following ways: <br/><br/>The working force would not be able to leave unsatisfying or unsatisfactory jobs because of fear they could not be able to get another and as a result o these, the number of frustrated and alienated workers increase. <br/><br/>Divisions within society are likely to grow. The unemployed and those unsatisfactory or unsatisfying works may blame weak groups in society for their problems. Immigrants and ethnic minority may be used as scapegoat with the result that racial tension increases. <br/><br/>Sinfield believes that high level of unemployment reduce the chances of equality of opportunity been achieved. <br/><br/>John Lea and Jock Young said that unemployment among the youths leads to the marginalization of some members of society because those who are unemployed feel they have to stake in the society. Since they are not in any union, they lack the institutional means to express their discontent. Many social problems have been linked to unemployment “Sheila Allen and Alan Watson” says links between unemployment and a wide range of social problems have been made by academicians, politicians, and journalists, ill health, premature death, attempted and actual suicide, marriage breakdown, child battering, racial conflict and football hooliganism are of the examples that have been cited if we look critically, we could understand that all these problems are being caused by unemployment and it can be seen as an effect on individual rather than society. However, clearly, they also have implication for society because of unemployment does not cause or contribute to these problems, than it may threaten the stability of society by undermining the family and causing racial tension and crime. <br/><br/>Unemployment is probably the most widely feared phenomenon of our times affirms the organization for economic cooperation and development (OECD). <br/><br/>The extent and consequence of this phenomenon are known, writes the commission European Communities, but dealing it is “auduous” it is specter says one expert that is, returning to taunt the street of the old continent. <br/><br/>Unemployment is an old problem, for centuries people have been finding themselves involuntary without work. Once the job was finished tens of thousand of people used in large construction project then becomes unemployed at lest until they find themselves in some other jobs. In the mid term they led a rather precarious life to say the least. <br/><br/>During the middle age “even though a problem of unemployment in the modern sense did not yet exist” in those days anyone who did not work was considered as vagabonds. During later as 19th century many British analysts associated with the unemployed primarily with the roughs and a vagrant who slept out or walked the street at night explains Professor Burnelt. <br/><br/>The discovering of unemployment “took place near the end of 19th century or the beginning of the 20th century. Social commissions were instituted to study and resolve the problem such as the selected committee of British house of common on distress from want of employment. In 1895, joblessness had become a social plague. The new awareness grew dramatically particularly after the First World War. The conflict with its frantic arms production had particularly eliminated unemployment. But beginning in the 1920s, the Western world faces a series of recession culminating great expression that began in 1929 and struck all the industrialized economy of the world. After the second world war, many countries experienced a new economic boom, and unemployment dropped, but the beginning of today’s unemployment can be easily traced back to the mid 1960 says the organization for economic cooperation’s and development, the labour market suffered a new blow caused by the oil crisis of the 1970s and the computerized information explosion with consequent layoff, unemployment has begun relentless ascent cutting into even those white colours and managerial sectors once considered secure. Economic distinguishes between a numbers of types of unemployment; Frictional, cyclical and structural unemployment. <br/><br/>Frictional Unemployment: This type of unemployment does not usually seen as serious problem because it occurs when a worker changes job but does not adapt immediately to the new job. <br/><br/>Structural Unemployment: Generally leads to include as an important constituent, that element of unemployment, which is due to the insufficiency of means of production in relations to the employment availability’s. Structural unemployment can also occur when jobs are available and there are workers seeking employment, but workers do not match the job.<br/><br/>Cyclical Unemployment: In the broad sense the term covers not only cyclical unemployment proper, but also seasonal unemployment: this is a type of unemployment whereby throughout the period, the number of unemployment far exceeded the number of vacancies, that is, the supply of labour exceed the demand of workers by employers. The concepts of cyclical unemployment do not imply that unemployment will fall to comparatively low in the future. It is momentous to note that we have both rural and urban unemployment. <br/><br/>To the rural areas employment, which is the main form, under utilization of labour in developing countries. It comprises those people who are doing some work but could do more, yet are not seeking extra work. It includes many unpaid household workers and family workers in agriculture. If the number of people working on a farm holding is increased but more land is not cultivated, there is going to be some disguised unemployment. Urban unemployment on the other hand takes form of visible under employment, which comprise those people who are doing work which is below their capacity. A person who is trained but cannot find work that is suitable to his ability and take unskilled jobs for instance is visibly underemployed, if he or she is actively seeking better work. <br/><br/>Unemployment has hit all sectors of the economy one by one. For instance agriculture with its increased in mechanization, which puts people out of work, then industry, which has been affected by the energy crises from the 1970s on and now, the services sector, commerce education a section previously considered unassailable. Twenty years ago unemployment rate in excess of 2 or 3% would have caused great alarm. <br/><br/>Today an industrialized nation is well if unemployment is kept below 5% or 6% and many developed nations have higher rate. <br/><br/>Unemployment is not just a matter of facts and figures individual drama are the result for the plague that strikes men, women, and unemployment can prove to be tremendous burden especially if his been out of work for a long time will it difficult to have a job and sadly. Some have never been employed again. <br/><br/>Furthermore, while the proportion of young men and women out for more than one year appears to have stabilized in the year April, 1985 to May 1986. The proportion of unemployment for three or more years increased to encompass nearly 100,000 young would be workers. In addition to a doubling of total youth unemployment displacement of the young unemployed into prolong durations of joblessness. <br/><br/>With the advent of rising and persisted unemployment among young people, attempts to explain it cause. As Ashton (1987) points out that such explanation were sought first in demographic changes in the composition in the working population and later in the high wages paid to young workers. <br/><br/>Ashton notes further that growth in the supply of young people to the labour market was in fact at peaked in 1979, before the sharp up turn in rate of youth unemployment in the early 1980s. Thus, an over supply of young people in the labour market can be best only a partial explanation of widespread youth unemployment. <br/><br/>In Nigeria, many years ago secondary school leaver’s after they might have passed their West Africa School Certificate Examination (WASCE) looked forward to the future with confidence. Such school leavers may secure employment easier either of his choice or near choice with promotion prospect. He may decide to go on to continue his higher education or enter any training institution. Unlike the secondary school leaver, the university graduate could choose from a range of opportunity. The University graduate held an opportunity to either go into government service, public cooperation or to commercial company like a bank. <br/><br/>In the past fifteen years, at least since 1970s, there have been high job markets for the secondary school leavers, in 1980s the University graduates have been hit with unemployment. In fact, this unemployment problem what has happened to the output of the secondary schools and universities. However, the concern of this study is to find out or to investigate into the cause and also to find out a possible solution to this enormous problem that threatens the core of out nation’s life stream. This research is also carried out to reduce the problem of unemployment among youths.<br/><br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/><br/>One of the main characteristics of urban unemployment in the developing countries is that, the proportion of the young who are affected is generally large. In nearly every case the unemployment rate in the range of 15-34 age groups are equal to or more than, double the rate for the population as a whole, whose unemployment rate is already considerably influenced by the rate for young people. The present study becomes relevant because one of the most important problems facing Nigeria in general and Edo State in particular is that of employment creation. It is very pertinent that those that suppose to constitute labour force should be able bodied youths who are still under the age of 15-45 years. <br/><br/>In our country today, those who can be found in this trauma (unemployment) were mainly the youths, those that posses their secondary school certificate and university first degree do not have a place in labour force. This unemployment problem had actually pushed some youths to be hardened criminals, armed robbers, drug traffickers, football hooligans marriage breakdown, racial conflict, attempted and actual suicide. <br/><br/>In Edo State, youth unemployment had lead to the manifestation or violence in the society, for instance the Egor People Congress (EPC) members are unemployed youth, significant percentage of armed robbers are unemployed youth. Youth unemployment has created a balance deficiency in the overall function of Nigeria society, between ages 18-64 which are suppose to be working population of enlarge percentage whereby unemployment rate makes it impossible for this population to work. The dependent population which in fact is higher in percentage shall be sufficiently reimbursed, leading to mass poverty poor natural income. <br/><br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/><br/>It is significant because it will add to already existing body of knowledge of youth unemployment. <br/><br/>It is significant because it will look into the cause and effect of youth unemployment in Egor Local Government in South Nigeria providing visible solutions to unemployment in that area. <br/><br/>It will bring to light various factors contributing to unemployment thus providing probable instrument to policy makers. <br/><br/>It will classify, locate and verity variables while are expected to form pre-conditions of unemployment making problem solving possible. <br/><br/>JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY <br/><br/>This study is justified by its relevance in the area of contribution to the existing literature or materials and helping to solve problem of unemployment in the society. <br/><br/>RELEVANT RESEARCH QUESTION<br/><br/>What is unemployment? <br/><br/>Who is youth? <br/><br/>Who is unemployed? <br/><br/>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/><br/>To determine the major causes of youth unemployment in Benin, Nigeria. <br/><br/>To elicit the relationship (if there is any) between the overall economic characteristics of the country and youth unemployment. <br/><br/>To elicit the effectiveness or impact of youth unemployment on the Nigeria industrial sector.<br/><br/>To advice and give recommendation where necessary to the policy makers in the country on one hand and youths of the country on the other hand. <br/><br/>DEFINITION OF CONCEPT<br/><br/>In the field of social research, there is the need to clarify the meaning of concepts especially the way the investigation made use of them operationally. However, Goode and Halt (1952) defined concepts as logical constructs derived from sense expression, perception of even familiar complex experience. For the purpose of this research, the investigation would make the following research concepts. <br/><br/>Employment: it is a means of having a job or other gainful occupation. <br/><br/>Unemployment: it is important to remember that unemployment cannot simply be defined as the number of people without jobs. Such a wide definition would include children who are too young to work, pensioners who are retired and housewives and others who chose not to take up paid employment. Therefore it is state of a person who wants to work but does not have a job. <br/><br/>Again, for the purpose of this research and in spite of our recognition of different definitions of youths in the literature on the subject, we shall restrict the concept to those young people between the ages of 10-30 years. They constitute about 65% of the total population in Nigeria. They also constitute the majority of the total work force in the country. <br/><br/>Youth Unemployment: this is a total aggregate of able –bodied youth that found themselves in the dilemma of unemployment. <br/><br/>Visible Unemployment: this consists of those who are doing no work, but are trying to get work. The numbers involved may not be very large, but they may include people who have obtained some education and cannot find suitable work. <br/><br/>Residual Unemployment: this is associated with physical and mental disability. There is no country without residual unemployment and because of this; no country can achieved full employment. <br/><br/>Seasonal Unemployment: this has to do with climate that is labour being employed temporarily due to unfavourable climate condition. <br/><br/>Voluntary Unemployment: where a person decided not to work either because the salaries is not sufficient or because of being a housewife. <br/><br/>Disguised Unemployment: this is the main form of under – utilization of labour in developing countries. This usually occurs where a person is too qualified for the job he is doing, it comprise of those people who are not seeking extra work. <br/><br/>Mass Unemployment: this is another type of unemployment, which look with trade cycle. It is usually characterized by a general fall in aggregate monetary. This happened during the period of depression. <br/><br/>Structural Unemployment: this occurs when jobs are available and there are workers seeking employment, but the workers do not match the jobs. <br/><br/>There are two types of unemployment <br/><br/>Regional: exist where the workers do not live in the area where suitable vacancies are available. <br/><br/>Sectoral: exist where the unemployed person lacks appropriate skills or qualified of full skills. <br/><br/>GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY <br/><br/>The study will primarily be restricted to the resident of Egor local government area of Edo State. Thus it will be a micro study within the local government aimed at finding out the caused and affects of youths unemployment. The major limitation in this study will be the financial constraints coupled with the time limitation, as a result of my pursuit of academic activities. <br/><br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/><br/>Youth unemployment in Edo State has been on the use since the colleges of second republic with vices of corruption and austerity. Then in Egor Local Government rural urban community where industrial activities are not developed and the people are semi – skilled works, traders and farmers.<br/><br/>METHODOLOGY <br/><br/>This research is designed to embrace both unemployed males and females residing in Egor Local Government of Edo State. <br/><br/>I have selected these sets of people because in hope that with their practical experience as unemployed people they will be able to offer more useful information required for this research.<br/><br/>The streets are as follows: <br/><br/>Uwelu Road <br/><br/>1st Otawere Avenue <br/><br/>Ojo Street <br/><br/>Otete Road <br/><br/>Immaculate Way <br/><br/>2nd Otawere Avenue <br/><br/>Oviasogie Street <br/><br/>Iyamu Street <br/><br/>Uwasota Road <br/><br/>In each street, thirty (30) respondents will be picked and it should be noted that the sampling frame of this research work is one hundred and twenty respondents (120) which comprise the four streets. <br/><br/>1.11 RESEARCH DESIGN <br/><br/>However, in this research, the research method to adopt in this study is the survey method in order to justify the study.

It is completely impossible to talk of a society free from juvenile delinquency. Juvenile delinquency has long been recognized and wide spread problem in the country. Children of under 18 years involving themselves in criminal activities together with the adult counterpart, but because these children have not attained maturity, which is 18 years in Nigeria, they cannot be regarded as criminal. But rather they are referred to as juvenile delinquents (Cohen, 1995). <br/><br/>As has been observed earlier, juvenile delinquency is a term demoting various offenses committed by children or youths under the age of 18. Children’s offenses typically include delinquent acts that would be considered crimes if committed by adults and status offenses, which are less serious misbehaviour such as truancy and parental disobedience. Both are within the jurisdiction of the juvenile count, more serious offenses committed by minors may be tried in criminal court and be subject to prison sentences (Igbinovia, Okonofua, Omoyibo, Osunde and Obaro, 2005). The recent increase in female involvement in deviant acts have reached unprecedented height that fear grips the populace of this country as to worth pointing out that in Nigeria where violet crimes by female are fast the delinquent is no longer desprised or seen as a deviant but is highly respected and advertised. They are the glamour girls. Juvenile delinquency cases are those referred to juvenile courts for acts defined in the status of the state as violation of status law.<br/><br/>Since ancient times enlightened legal system have distinguished between juvenile delinquents and adult criminals. The immature generally were not considered morally responsible for their behavior under the code Napoleon in France for example; limited responsibility was ascribed to children under the age of 16. Despite the apparent humanity of some early status, however, the punishment of juvenile offenders until the 19th century was often serve. In Nigeria like in the US, many child criminals were treated as adult criminals. In many instances, child offenders were processed through the adult courts, sentences for all offenders could be harsh and the death penalty was occasionally imposed. The first institution expressly for juvenile, the House of Refuge, was founded in New York city in 1824 so that institutionalized delinquents could be kept apart from adult criminals. By the mid-19th century other state institution for juvenile delinquents were established, and their population soon included not only young criminals but also less serious offenders and dependent children (Obaro, 2008).<br/><br/>The concept of study is as a result of the astonished effect of the problem of delinquency caused by juveniles coupled with its associated problems. I decided to carry out a detailed survey of delinquent female student in selected female secondary school in Oredo Local Government Area since our society has for long been plagued into social problems such as poverty, exploitation man by man, child base and neglect, problem of the aged, drug abuse, prostitution, truancy, rape incest, burglary, stealing and juvenile delinquency.<br/><br/>Juvenile delinquency has long been in existence with it wide spread problem in the country. These children engage themselves in arininal activities together with adult but because they have not reach maturity age which is 18 years, therefore, they are referred to as juvenile. These children are sometimes beyond parental control, they wonder about and become delinquency (Obaro, 2008). A juvenile is typically defined as some one between the age of 7 and 17 and three types of juvenile come under the courts youthful offenders are those who engage in behavior for which adults can be tried in a criminal court. All predatory crimes are included here. The second type is the status offender, these who violate the juvenile court code rather than the criminal code. Behavior such as truancy running away from home and breaking the curfew is included here. Finally, the court deals with minors in need of care those who are neglected or abused and in need of the court’s care. These juveniles do not fall into the juvenile court. The range of behavior defined as delinquent tends to be broad perhaps as many as percent of all young people have engage in behavior that would fall under the jurisdiction of juvenile court (Obaro, 2008).<br/><br/>Although juvenile comes in different ways, at different times and in different sector. So, for the purpose of this work, I will only consider and limit my study to female student in selected secondary school in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State, Nigeria as a developing country needs to look inward in issues like these so as to enable appropriate policies to be taken to reduce and control juvenile delinquencies because if not checked properly, these children will not be useful to themselves and the society at large.<br/><br/>1.2STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/><br/>Juvenile delinquency has reached an alarming rate. Juvenile delinquency has long been recognized and wide spiral problem, in the country. Hence this study is to determine the various factors that causes juvenile delinquency in the society and the negative effect it has on the child and the society at large. A situation were children of under 18 years involving themselves in criminal activities together with the adult counterpart, but because these children have not attained maturity which is 18 in Nigeria, they do not refer them as criminals.<br/><br/>1.3PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>The objectives of this study is to determine the prevalent delinquent behaviours among female secondary school students – in relation to social economic factors and religion factors and to determine the factors influencing them.<br/><br/>The specific objectives of the study are:<br/><br/>To determine whether socio-economic status of the parents influence juvenile delinquency of female students.<br/><br/>To determine whether religious affiliation influences delinquent behaviours.<br/><br/>To determine whether living environment influence delinquency of female student.<br/><br/>To determine whether family background influence the behavior of female juvenile delinquents.<br/><br/>To prevent juvenile delinquency/prefer solutions to the problem of juvenile delinquency among females.<br/><br/>1.4SCOPE OF STUDY<br/><br/>This study covers female juvenile students in secondary schools in Benin City the female students within the age bracket of 12 to 17 years of age. <br/><br/>1.5SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/><br/>The study will be of benefit to children’s parents, policy makers and government<br/><br/>It will also be of benefit to children and caregivers as they will be exposed to factors necessitating delinquency among female students or children and taking measures to avoid it.<br/><br/>Government and policy makers will also benefit as the contribution from this study will help introduce new measures of presenting and eradicating delinquency among female student<br/><br/>Couples will benefit from this study in that it will give them the knowledge on how to socialize their children and make them have regards for social norms.<br/><br/>1.6HYPOTHESES<br/><br/>Socio economic status of parents will not influence juvenile delinquency of female students<br/><br/>Religious affiliation will not influence juvenile delinquency of female students<br/><br/>Family background will not influence juvenile delinquency of female student<br/><br/>Living environment will not influence juvenile delinquency of female students.<br/><br/>1.7OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/><br/>Deviant Behaviour – Is socially defined and varies by time, place and social group. Behavior that is defined as deviant violate strongly held social norms.

Furthermore, any person who has lost the power of self-control over the use of drugs is considered a chronic drug abuser.<br/><br/>Many individuals having problems with drug abuse also suffer from issues like mental health disorder, most often drug abuse is an attempt of a person to “self medicate” the emotional or mental problem that has plagued them. Studies have shown often times that drug abuse can accelerate mental disorder. Often times a person who is living with drug abuse will not even recognize that they have a form of mental illness. Through drug abuse, they may be self medicating and even realize it.<br/><br/>People who experience drug abuse in combination with the mental illness may be resistant to treatment and recovery because they may deny the problem when confronted with their behaviours. Many a time drug treatment intervention may be required to address the drug behaviour and the problems it is causing that the person will be confronted with facts they cannot ignore. The elementary stage to treat the drug abuse is often simply a symptom greater, deeper, underlying problem.<br/><br/>1.2 THE CONCEPT OF DRUG ABUSE <br/><br/>What is drug and what is drug abuse? Drugs are substances, which interact with our body system to modify the physiological and biomedical process of the body. Drugs which exert their major effects on the brain and psychological functioning resulting in such effects as sedation, stimulation or change in mood or behaviour are called “psychoactive substances (Burns, 1988), and are potentially habit forming.<br/><br/>The maladaptive use of such substances, such as when they are medically necessary, when they are used against legal prohibition, or when there is a maladaptive or excessive use of socially acceptable drugs (e.g. alcoholic, kolanut), resulting in significant impairment in personal, social and occupational functioning, constitute the phenomenon of drug abuse (Odejide and Morekinyo, 2004). <br/><br/>Why Do Some People Develop a problem but others don’t?<br/><br/>Substance use disorder is an illness that can affect anyone; rich or poor, male or female, employed or unemployed, young or old, and any race or ethnicity. Nobody knows for sure exactly what causes it, but the chance of developing a substance use disorder depends partly on genetics-biological traits passed down through families. A person’s environment, psychological traits, and stress level also play major roles by contributing to the use of alcohol or drugs.<br/><br/>Researchers have found that using drugs for a long time changes the brain in important, long lasting ways. It is as if a switch in the brain turned on at some point. This point is different for every person, but when this switch turns on, the person crosses an invisible line and becomes dependent on the substance. People who start using drugs or alcohol early in life run a greater risk of crossing line and becoming dependent. These changes in the brain remain long after a person stops using drugs or drinking alcohol. Even though your family member has an illness, it does not excuse the bad behaviour that often accompanies it. Your loved one is not at fault for having a disease, but he or she is responsible for getting treatment.<br/><br/>What are the Symptoms of Substance use Disorders?<br/><br/>One of the most important signs of substance addiction or dependence is continued use of drugs or alcohol despite experiencing the serials negative consequences of heavy during or alcohol use. Often, a person will blame other people or circumstances for his or her problem instead of realizing that the difficulties result from use of drugs or alcohol. For example, your partner may believe he was fired from jobs because his bosses didn’t know how to run a business perhaps your loved one has even blamed you. People with this illness really may believe that they drink normally or that “everyone takes drugs. These false beliefs are called denial, and denial is part of the illness.<br/><br/>The media often portray people with substance use disorders as unemployed, unproductive, criminal, and homeless. However, many people who are dependent on alcohol or drugs do not fit this stereotype; they have jobs and live with their families.<br/><br/>Other important symptoms of substance use disorder include Tolerance. A person will need increasingly larger amounts of alcohol or drugs to get high.<br/><br/>Craving: A person will feel a strong need, desire, or urge to use alcohol or drugs, will use alcohol or a drug despite negative consequences, and will feel anxious and irritable if he or she can’t use them. Craving is a primary symptom of addiction.<br/><br/>Loss of Control: A person often will drink more alcohol or take more drugs than he or she meant to, or may use drugs at a time or place he or she had not planned. A person also may try to reduce or stop drinking or using drugs times, but may fail.<br/><br/>Studies over the past two decades have tried to determine the origins, and pathways of drug abuse-how the problem starts and how it progress. Many factors have been identified that help differentiate those more like to abuse drugs from those less vulnerable to abuse. Factors associated with greater potential for drug abuse are called “risk” factors, while those associated with reduced potential for abuse are called “protective” factors. However, most individuals at risk for drug abuse do not start using drugs or become addicted. Also, a risk factor for one person may not be for another. Gender may also determine how an individual responds to risk factor. Researcher on relationships within the family shows that adolescent girls respond positively to parental support and discipline, while adolescent boys sometimes respond negatively. Research on early risk behaviours in the school setting shows that aggressive behaviour in boys and learning difficulties in girls are the primary causes of poor peer relationships. These poor relationships, most individuals at risk for drug abuse do not start using drugs or become addicted. Also, a risk factor for one person may not be for another. Gender may also determine how an individual responds to risk factors. Research on relationships within the family shows that adolescent girls respond positively to parental support and dispelling, while adolescent girls respond positively to parental support and discipline, while adolescent girls sometimes respond negatively. Research on early risk behaviours in the school setting shows that aggressive behaviour in boys and learning difficulties in girls are the primary causes of poor peer relationships. These poor relationships, in turn, can lead to social rejection a negative school experience, and problem behaviours including drug abuse.<br/><br/>What are the early signs of risk that may predict later drug abuse?<br/><br/>Some signs of risk can be seen as early as infancy, children’s personality traits or temperament can place them at increased risk for later drug abuse. With drawn and aggressive boys, for example, often exhibit problem behaviours in interactions with their families, peers, and others and others they encounter in social settings. If these behaviours continues, they will likely lead to other risk. These risks can include academic failure, early peer rejection, and later affiliation with deviant peers, often the most immediate risk for drug abuse in abuse adolescent.<br/><br/>Studies have showing that children with poor academic performance and inappropriate social behaviour at ages seven (7) to nine(9) are more likely to be involved with substance abuse by age 14-15.<br/><br/>Children’s earliest interactions occur within the family and can be positive or negative. For this reason, factors that affect early development in the family are probably the most crucial children are more likely to experience risk when there is:<br/><br/>Lack of mutual attachment and nurturing by parents or caregivers;<br/><br/>Ineffective parenting;<br/><br/>A chaotic home environment.<br/><br/>Lack of a significant relationship with a caring adult; and<br/><br/>A caregiver who abuses substances, suffers from mental illness, or engages in criminal behaviour.<br/><br/>These experiences, especially the abuse of drugs and other substances by parents and other caregivers, can impede bonding to the family and threaten feelings of security that children need for healthy development.<br/><br/>Other factors-such as drug availability drug trafficking patterns, and beliefs that drug abuse is generally tolerated-are risks that can influence young people to start abusing drugs.<br/><br/>Drug Abuse<br/><br/>This is characterized by taking more than the recommended dose of prescribed drug such as barbiturates without medical supervision or marijuana, cocaine, heroin or other illogical substance. Legal substances such as alcohol and nicotine are also commonly abused by many people.<br/><br/>Drug abuse is defined as any substance of biological or chemical origin which when taken into the body may modify one or more of its functions (WHO 1996).<br/><br/>Drug abuse is a widespread problem that distracts people from all socio-economic levels. It occurs when a person feels the need to use a drug repeatedly for diverse purpose.<br/><br/>Drug addiction is said to be present when a person continues to abuse a drug after serious problems related to the drug use have occurred, consequences which can be severe. Dependence (psychological and sometimes physical) characterized by a compulsion to use a drug to experience psychological or physical effects. Drug dependencies take several forms, tolerance, habituation and addiction.<br/><br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/><br/>It goes to show from all indication that the issues of drug abuse it’s a cosmopolitan subject to all of human race. Despite the obvious negative impact on health and its social consequences involved in drug abuse and the social unacceptability that accompanies drug use numerous individual have indulged in its use. In Nigeria, the question remains, why are drugs sold freely and bought without doctor’s prescription?<br/><br/>Campaign’s on the increase on the dangers inherent in abuse of drugs been broadcasted b the media house (television, radio). The central problem of this research is to critically determine the of drug abuse on the mental health of the individuals in the society. Moreso, after carefully and critically exploring the role of drugs abuse on mental health. This study seeks to give answers to the following questions:<br/><br/>What are the factors that encourage the use of drugs among people in the society?<br/><br/>What is the relationship between mental health and drug abuse?<br/><br/>Is drug use/abuse the major cause of deviant behaviour exhibited amongst lunatic in psychiatric hospital in Benin?<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/><br/>The objective of this study was to give answers or give explanation to the research problems as stated. Therefore, this research aims at carefully determining the role of drug abuse on mental health amongst psychotic patient in psychiatric hospital, Benin City. The research also aims at high lightening factors which may encourage the use of drug among. Patient in psychiatric hospital, this would either be defective socialization, economic status e.t.c. It is also the goal of this research to determine the relationship that may exist between mental health and drug abuse.<br/><br/>Finally, the research is geared towards giving explanation and determining of drug abuse is the major cause of mental illness exhibited among psychiatric in the society.<br/><br/>RESEARCH QUESTION<br/><br/>The following are the research hypothesis that this study would want to verify:<br/><br/>Does drug abuse play a major role on youth culture/<br/><br/>Does drug abuse in a youth culture encouraged by the need to conform?<br/><br/>Is there a relationship between youth culture and drug abuse?<br/><br/>Is drug abuse the major cause of deviant behaviour exhibited among patients affected by mental illness?<br/><br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/><br/>It is the aim of this research that the study improves upon past studies done on the impact of drug abuse on mental health problem as prevalent in psychiatric hospital, Benin City. And it is hoped that the findings of this study would go a very long way to advance opinions relating the nature of drug use among youths and the necessities involved in the formation in the formation and membership of a youth subculture. <br/><br/>Finally, it is also hope that the findings of the research would stimulated and encourage further interest into the research of this study by making it available in clear and comprehensive statement, recommendations on measures, of controlling drug abuse among youths and other members that are partakers. <br/><br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>It is pertinent to point that what constitutes drug abuse was determined in the cause of this study. The types, nature of, and the effect of these drugs or otherwise, substances have on the society at large. Substance abuse is both a precipitating fact and a consequence of homeless. Prevalence estimates of substance use among homeless individuals are approximately 20-35 percent; as many as 10-20 percent are “dually diagnosed” with an additional mental health diagnosis. In the United States, less than one quarter of individuals in need of substance abuse treatment actually receives it; structural and interpersonal barriers to accessing substance abuse treatment are exerbated by the realities of homelessness. Thus, homeless persons have a higher need for treatment than in the housed population, yet can expect to face more difficulties in accessing the help they need. However individuals with substance used disorders-particularly those who are dually-diagnosed-pose a substantial challenge to the substance abuse treatment community; the first challenge is in the engagement process, (Drake, 1991).</p>\n\nEFFECTS OF DRUG ABUSE ON MENTAL HEALTH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF DRUG ABUSE ON MENTAL HEALTH", "id": 96}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>1.1BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/><br/>The choice of this topic came just at the right time when female involvement in criminal acts and juvenile delinquency has reached an alarming rates. It is completely impossible to talk of a society free from juvenile delinquency. Juvenile delinquency has long been recognized and wide spread problem in the country. Children of under 18 years involving themselves in criminal activities together with the adult counterpart, but because these children have not attained maturity, which is 18 years in Nigeria, they cannot be regarded as criminal. But rather they are referred to as juvenile delinquents (Cohen, 1995). <br/><br/>As has been observed earlier, juvenile delinquency is a term demoting various offenses committed by children or youths under the age of 18. Children’s offenses typically include delinquent acts that would be considered crimes if committed by adults and status offenses, which are less serious misbehaviour such as truancy and parental disobedience. Both are within the jurisdiction of the juvenile count, more serious offenses committed by minors may be tried in criminal court and be subject to prison sentences (Igbinovia, Okonofua, Omoyibo, Osunde and Obaro, 2005). The recent increase in female involvement in deviant acts have reached unprecedented height that fear grips the populace of this country as to worth pointing out that in Nigeria where violet crimes by female are fast the delinquent is no longer desprised or seen as a deviant but is highly respected and advertised. They are the glamour girls. Juvenile delinquency cases are those referred to juvenile courts for acts defined in the status of the state as violation of status law.<br/><br/>Since ancient times enlightened legal system have distinguished between juvenile delinquents and adult criminals. The immature generally were not considered morally responsible for their behavior under the code Napoleon in France for example; limited responsibility was ascribed to children under the age of 16. Despite the apparent humanity of some early status, however, the punishment of juvenile offenders until the 19th century was often serve. In Nigeria like in the US, many child criminals were treated as adult criminals. In many instances, child offenders were processed through the adult courts, sentences for all offenders could be harsh and the death penalty was occasionally imposed. The first institution expressly for juvenile, the House of Refuge, was founded in New York city in 1824 so that institutionalized delinquents could be kept apart from adult criminals. By the mid-19th century other state institution for juvenile delinquents were established, and their population soon included not only young criminals but also less serious offenders and dependent children (Obaro, 2008).<br/><br/>The concept of study is as a result of the astonished effect of the problem of delinquency caused by juveniles coupled with its associated problems. I decided to carry out a detailed survey of delinquent female student in selected female secondary school in Oredo Local Government Area since our society has for long been plagued into social problems such as poverty, exploitation man by man, child base and neglect, problem of the aged, drug abuse, prostitution, truancy, rape incest, burglary, stealing and juvenile delinquency.<br/><br/>Juvenile delinquency has long been in existence with it wide spread problem in the country. These children engage themselves in arininal activities together with adult but because they have not reach maturity age which is 18 years, therefore, they are referred to as juvenile. These children are sometimes beyond parental control, they wonder about and become delinquency (Obaro, 2008). A juvenile is typically defined as some one between the age of 7 and 17 and three types of juvenile come under the courts youthful offenders are those who engage in behavior for which adults can be tried in a criminal court. All predatory crimes are included here. The second type is the status offender, these who violate the juvenile court code rather than the criminal code. Behavior such as truancy running away from home and breaking the curfew is included here. Finally, the court deals with minors in need of care those who are neglected or abused and in need of the court’s care. These juveniles do not fall into the juvenile court. The range of behavior defined as delinquent tends to be broad perhaps as many as percent of all young people have engage in behavior that would fall under the jurisdiction of juvenile court (Obaro, 2008).<br/><br/>Although juvenile comes in different ways, at different times and in different sector. So, for the purpose of this work, I will only consider and limit my study to female student in selected secondary school in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State, Nigeria as a developing country needs to look inward in issues like these so as to enable appropriate policies to be taken to reduce and control juvenile delinquencies because if not checked properly, these children will not be useful to themselves and the society at large.<br/><br/>1.2STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/><br/>Juvenile delinquency has reached an alarming rate. Juvenile delinquency has long been recognized and wide spiral problem, in the country. Hence this study is to determine the various factors that causes juvenile delinquency in the society and the negative effect it has on the child and the society at large. A situation were children of under 18 years involving themselves in criminal activities together with the adult counterpart, but because these children have not attained maturity which is 18 in Nigeria, they do not refer them as criminals.<br/><br/>1.3PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>The objectives of this study is to determine the prevalent delinquent behaviours among female secondary school students – in relation to social economic factors and religion factors and to determine the factors influencing them.<br/><br/>The specific objectives of the study are:<br/><br/>To determine whether socio-economic status of the parents influence juvenile delinquency of female students.<br/><br/>To determine whether religious affiliation influences delinquent behaviours.<br/><br/>To determine whether living environment influence delinquency of female student.<br/><br/>To determine whether family background influence the behavior of female juvenile delinquents.<br/><br/>To prevent juvenile delinquency/prefer solutions to the problem of juvenile delinquency among females.<br/><br/>1.4SCOPE OF STUDY<br/><br/>This study covers female juvenile students in secondary schools in Benin City the female students within the age bracket of 12 to 17 years of age. <br/><br/>1.5SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/><br/>The study will be of benefit to children’s parents, policy makers and government<br/><br/>It will also be of benefit to children and caregivers as they will be exposed to factors necessitating delinquency among female students or children and taking measures to avoid it.<br/><br/>Government and policy makers will also benefit as the contribution from this study will help introduce new measures of presenting and eradicating delinquency among female student<br/><br/>Couples will benefit from this study in that it will give them the knowledge on how to socialize their children and make them have regards for social norms.<br/><br/>1.6HYPOTHESES<br/><br/>Socio economic status of parents will not influence juvenile delinquency of female students<br/><br/>Religious affiliation will not influence juvenile delinquency of female students<br/><br/>Family background will not influence juvenile delinquency of female student<br/><br/>Living environment will not influence juvenile delinquency of female students.<br/><br/>1.7OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/><br/>Deviant Behaviour – Is socially defined and varies by time, place and social group. Behavior that is defined as deviant violate strongly held social norms. However, what is seen as a deviant behavior in one society, may be regarded as a behavior that is acceptable in another society.<br/><br/>Juvenile – A juvenile is a young person that falls under the age of 18, whose attitude/behavior is seen as a delinquent act. But, if such behavior is exhibited by an adult is seen as a crime.<br/><br/>Juvenile Delinquency – These are the behavior of young people showing the tendency to commit crime. In other word, juvenile delinquency are behavior exhibited by children under the age of 18 that does not conform to societal norms, and if committed by an adult is crime and attract several punishment as stated by the law.<br/><br/>Female – This is a woman/girl that can give births to another child.<br/><br/>Student – This is any person who is studying at a school for the purpose of acquiring knowledge for the betterment of higher future and that of the society.<br/><br/>Female Student – A woman/girl that is studying at a school for the purpose of gaining knowledge to herself and to better the society.<br/><br/>Delinquency – Bad/criminal behavior that is usually associated with young people. Delinquency is a behavior of a person under the age of 18 that does not conform to society accepted norms of the society.<br/><br/>Socio Economic Status – Socio economic status shows that various strata/level that an individual is located in the society. In other word, it is the class position of a person which can either be upper class, middle class and lower class.<br/><br/>Religion Affiliation – These is the belief that is perculiar to a religion that is the doctrine that guides the affairs of members in a particular type of religion.<br/><br/>Living Environment – This is the area in which an individual, group live which can either be urban, rural or city. That is, a place where people live and get their basic needs.<br/><br/>Family Background – These is the units in which an individual is born into which can either be nuclear family, polygamous etc. activities of family background can be traced by generation.</p>\n\nINCIDENCE OF JUVENILE DELINQUENCY AMONG FEMALE SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INCIDENCE OF JUVENILE DELINQUENCY AMONG FEMALE SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS", "id": 97}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1       </strong><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></div> <div>This research work is on the effects of Drug Abuse among University undergraduates in Nigeria.

The study was hinged on four major objectives which were to ascertain the state of women reproductive services, determine whether women have access to reproductive healthcare services, Identify the challenges facing women access to reproductive healthcare services and Suggest ways that can enhance women access to reproductive healthcare services in Dustin-Ma local government area. Andersen Health Behavioural Model was used as the major theoretical framework to explain women access to reproductive healthcare services. Questionnaire and key informant interview were used as the primary instrument of data collection. The sample size of the study was 110 respondents. Inferential statistical tools such as tables and percentages were used to analyze the data collected. The findings of the study indicated that women in Dutsin-Ma are aware of maternal healthcare services in their areas and they have adequately utilized it. The study therefore observed that, women in Dutsin-Ma have access to maternal healthcare services because they are cheaper and affordable. The major challenges facing women and access to maternal healthcare services were financial constraints, ignorance, husband’s restriction, not listening to media sources and socio cultural beliefs of the people. The study therefore recommended that women should be educated and sensitized with their husbands, on the importance of maternal care and socio cultural disposition, also  women should be empowered, maternal charges should be subsidized  for all and finally government should bring maternal healthcare services to the door steps of women building of more maternal health centers and good road networks. </em></div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1         </strong><strong>Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>Health is central to community well-being, personal welfare and has strong influence on people’s earning capacity. It is fundamental to people’s ability to enjoy and appreciate all other aspects of life. Health care utilization is use of healthcare services by people. The healthcare utilization of a population is related to the availability, geographical access, quality, cost of services, perceived benefits, as well as to social-economic and cultural structure, and personal characteristics of the users.(Chakraborty et al., 2003; Onah et al., 2009).The joys of motherhood is childbearing, it is a source of sorrow to many households as many women lose their lives during child birth. Every single day, Nigeria loses about 2, 300 under five years old and 145 women of childbearing age (Federal Ministry of Health, 2005). Discussions on reproductive and sexual health rights which had hitherto been a ‘taboo’ in traditional African societies are on the increase according to African scholars (Aniekwu, 2006). While the right to health has been an internationally recognized human right, reproductive health rights gained formal acceptance only in 1993 and the need for women to have access to quality reproductive health services such as medical care, planned family, safe pregnancy, delivery care, treatment and prevention of sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV/AIDS is increasingly gaining recognition in Africa at large and Nigeria in particular (World Health Organization, 2004).</div> <div>Despite this recognition, reproductive health of women is still one of the major health challenges worldwide particularly in resource-poor countries such as Nigeria. Women represent a vulnerable population group as a result of biological and gender-related differences. Reproductive ill-health accounts for 20% of the global burden of ill-health of women compared to 14% for men (World Health Organization, 2008).According to Shiffman (2007), the health status of countries has been assessed using women reproductive health indicators such as maternal mortality rates, antenatal care coverage, and proportion of delivery supervised by skilled birth attendants, unmet need for family planning among others. This clearly underscores the fact that, all efforts must be on deck by both government and non-governmental organization to ensure that women have access to reproductive health service. The International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), both set goals to reduce maternal mortality and improve access to reproductive health services. The MDG target number 5 to reduce maternal mortality by three-quarter and achieve universal access to reproductive health by the year 2015.(World Health Organization, 2004).</div> <p>The current population ofNigeria is 189,689,126 people based on the latest United Nations estimate. Nigeria population is equivalent to 2.55% of the total world population (world population prospects, 2015).Abouttwo-third of the population live in rural areas, and most rural dwellers are involved in the agriculture sector. Ibrahim, M. K. (2005). In 2008, the adult literacy rate for both sexes was 74.8%. Nigeria has a high total fertility rate estimated at 5.5 births per woman (compared to a world average of 2.5). The fertility preference of Nigerian women is closely related to the number of living children.</p>\n\nASSESSMENT OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE SERVICES FOR WOMEN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE SERVICES FOR WOMEN", "id": 99}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT </p> <div><em>The study examines the causes and the implications of broken homes on child development.

Also various suggestions were obtained on how to curb or mitigate the incidence of divorce.</em></div> <div> CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION 1.0 Background of the Study <div>The family is the oldest institution in history and remains the most irreducible nucleus of all known societies. It is established by the institution of marriage, ensures the reproduction of human species and confers executive conjugal right on couples. According to Aku (2007), the family is regarded as the oldest institution on earth that plays an important role in human society. It is a universal social institution, but the types vary from one society to the other and also from one culture to another.</div> <div>The variations in family composition gives rise to the different types of family, namely; extended and nuclear family. In the pre-colonial African society the extended family system was most cherished, unlike in the western societies, which cherished the nuclear type of family. In Nigeria today, the family is increasingly oriented towards nuclear type where it consists of father, mother and children,however, there are modifications as the nuclear extended types of families accommodate some extended family members like grandparents, siblings’etc grand-parents.</div> <div>In general, the family whether nuclear or extended, performs functions such as, procreation, sex regulation, socialization, security, emotional support etc.</div> <div>The family usually begins with marriage. It creates new social relationships, roles, rights and obligations not just between the spouses or partners but between the kinsmen on both sides of the couple. Marriage is a union between man and a woman or women such that children born to the woman are recognized as legitimate offspring of both parents (Igbo, 2003).</div> <div>In Africa, marriage is usually accompanied with elaborate ceremonies which are primarily aimed at enhancing the stability of the union. Among such ceremonies are religious rituals, payment of bride wealth, and involvement of spouses’ families among others, which seem to make divorce a rare phenomenon in pre-colonial times (Aku, ibid).</div> <div>In most cultures marriage ismeant to be a lifelong contract,but the stability that characterize pre-colonial African families seems to have disappeared with the alarming incidence of divorce and separation. It would appear that families in contemporary time are confronted by a myriad of pressures which are yet to be properly addressed (Fumerayem, 1991).</div> <br/><div>Some pressures sometimes result in failed marriages, either through divorce or separation. Failed marriages could also mean homes where there is persistent conflict or where there is residential separation between spouses who were hitherto living together in legitimate marital cohabitation. </div> </div>\n\nA STUDY ON EFFECTS OF BROKEN HOMES ON CHILD DEVELOPMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A STUDY ON EFFECTS OF BROKEN HOMES ON CHILD DEVELOPMENT", "id": 100}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>The study, “Sport coaching and peace building” is aimed at raveling the role of sport as a unifying agency and a tool for bringing about peace and development thereby reducing crime and delinquency in Nigeria, a case study of Plateau state. Nigeria is a complex nation and multi regional, ethnic, political, religious and culturally diverse population. The problem of integration still remains a challenge (among others) to the country. The researcher employed structural functionalism as a theoretical frame work. The study employed descriptive survey design and data was collected using questionnaire and interview. Questionnaires were distributed to a total sample of (120) respondents which were selected for the study using stratified random sampling technique. Total of (15) respondents were also interviewed. The findings revealed that sport has achieved in its role as a unifying agent in Nigeria. Sport teaches good morals, sport contribute to the physical and mental development of the youths, sport help to prevent youth from delinquent behaviours, sport contribute to social development of the community. The researcher recommends that private individuals, organizations and government should invest in sport to encourage its development, policy makers should make and implement policies that would encourage the participation of students in sport, and grass root sport should be encouraged.  The researcher concluded that sport programmes under the supervision of good coaches should be a multi agency approach in building peace and development process.</div> <div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>Coaching develops people through improving their performance (Criesfield et al., 2005). Sport is a recognized instrument for promoting peace, as it disregards both geographical borders and social class. It also plays a significant role as a promoter of social integration and economic development in different geographical, cultural and political contexts (Criesfield et al, 2005)<strong>.</strong></div> <div>The use of sports for purposes of development has been increasingly important topic particularly in post-conflict societies (Giulianotti, 2011). The research on role of sports and particularly football in building peace is becoming even more important for sport organizations, donors as well as policy makers in variety of countries in the world. However, the empirical findings in this regard are not conclusive as in some situations in some countries sports contributes to social harmony while in some others it feeds conflict (Gasser and Levinsen, 2004; Giulianotti, 2011). This is because there is non-agreement in the literature on the role of sports in peace building. First, sport was viewed as mechanism to increase antagonism between rivalry groups and may reinforce division if not properly controlled (Majaro‐Majesty, 2011) of ethnicities and; second sport could facilitate social inclusion and integration (Gasser and Levinsen, 2004). In particular, there is a gap in the literature on how sport can be used more productively as a peace building device in post conflict countries.</div> <div>Armstrong (2002:1) observed that, to the people of a nation suffering from a decade – long civil conflict, football, in this case sport could be seen by some as an ideal solution to providing a focus of national unity to a society fragmented by both ethnicity, regionalism, and age groupings. The word “sport” etymologically is derived from its Latin root ‘desporto’, meaning “to carry away”. This historical origin implies diversion from instrumental routines and suggests recreation. In historical terms, the idea that participation in sport has some utility (other than being enjoyed for its own sake) can be traced to the mid-nineteenth-century. United kingdom Middle-class reformers in the area of education and urban welfare began to develop the idea that sport participation, appropriately directed, could be involved in the development of character, work directed, could be involved in the development of character, work discipline, teamwork, fair play, and other socially approved characteristics.   </div> <div>Falola, (1998) shown that Sports began to be justified in education, youth detention centers, and by urban agencies, in attempt to affect the character and behavior of participants. These ideas spread to developed countries, and also became a part of the system of colonization, where the British games tradition was often transferred to colonized population.</div> <br/> <div>Organized sport is still justified in these same terms as evident in the mission statement of any youth sport organization – what the organization claims will be taught to the participants involves a great deal more than sport.</div> </div>\n\nSPORT COACHING AND PEACE BUILDING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SPORT COACHING AND PEACE BUILDING", "id": 101}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div><em>The research is an analysis of the socio-cultural impact of childless married couples, and it was carried out in Fagge local government area of Kano state. The study explored ways of reducing pressure both from the family and the society as a whole with particular reference to examining the existing causes and effects of infertility in the society. The instrument for data collection used for this research was questionnaire. The sampling techniques used for this study was cross- sectional survey research design. One hundred and thirteen (113) respondents were randomly selected. The data collected were analyzed using tables and percentages. From the analysis of the data, the major findings among others include; women are not fully blamed for the  cause of infertility like it use to be, majority of the population are aware of the medical treatment for infertility but choose not to sought for it. It is also found out that there is negative attitude of childless couples towards child adoption and seeking medical treatment as a solution to their problem. In view of these findings, the study recommend among others that: 1) mass enlightenment of the public could help increase the knowledge of the causes of infertility among married couples and also reduce feeling of inferiority complex among childless couples; 2) childless couples should seek for medical treatment jointly instead of allowing one partner to carry the burden alone among others.</em></div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>                                               INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1       Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>            Marriage is a universal phenomenon in Africa and among Nigerians it is a union between a man and woman that brings together families, communities, and ethnic groups (Ekong 1988). The system of marriage varies from people to people, and what is considered as the importance of marriage varies, however one general belief is that marriage is aimed at procreation, that is to say marriage and procreation are inseparable. Approximately 70-80 million couples worldwide are currently infertile (Bos<em> et al</em>., 1995; Boivin<em>et al</em>., 2007) and it can be estimated that tens of millions couples are primarily infertile or childless</div> <div>Procreation is one of the major functions of the family. Every man takes a wife apparently to have children, and where this purpose is not forth coming into fulfillment, it results to tension in most cases which lead to misunderstanding and disputes in the family. Other reasons or purpose for marriage include: sexual satisfaction, companionship and economic incentive. Many wives try to ensure the procreation of children to its fullest limit. For most people bearing children is very important, and the inability to do so is a great life problem. There are men and women who have children in their previous relationship, but are desperately in need of another child.</div> <div>            For most of history, childlessness has been regarded as great personal tragedy involving much emotional pain and grief, especially when it results from failure to conceive or from the death of a child (Mail, Charlene, 1986); this is because children are seen as a symbol of self-fulfillment both socially and economically. According to Ebigbola (2000), modernization has not weakened the deep-rooted tradition of having children as soon as possible after marriage; this is because they are needed for so many reasons, which are both socio-cultural and economic. Recent studies conducted in societies in Egypt, Nigeria, Mozambique and the Gambia reviewed that women who are childless are often segregated and excluded from social gatherings or despised (Kabsa 1994,Gerrits, Okonofu,Sundby 1997). Where ignorance prevails, childlessness is usually blamed on the woman. In a more recent study in Benin City, Nigeria, Omage (2013) reported that childless women are regarded as worthless and deserved to be divorced. This in itself adds to the high level of negative emotional and social effects of childlessness.</div>\n\nSOCIO-CULTURAL IMPACT OF CHILDLESS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SOCIO-CULTURAL IMPACT OF CHILDLESS", "id": 102}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>The aim of this research was to examine the role of police-community relations in combating crime in Nasarawa Local Government, Kano State. However other specific objectives are to examine the role of police-community relations in combating crime; to assess the relationship between the police and community in combating crime; to examine the challenges of police-community relations in combating crime; and to provide suggestions on how to improve the police-community relations in combating crime. The study employed the survey research design and the stratified random sampling technique was used in selecting respondents. The qualitative and quantitative methods were used in collecting data from respondents. Questionnaires were distributed to 120 respondents while 16 interviewees were captured in the in depth interview. Findings revealed that patrol, surveillance and guards were the role of police-community relations in combating crime. More so, findings revealed that there exists a mutual relationship between the community and the police. Furthermore, it was revealed that corruption, negative attitude of the police towards the people and inhuman treatment towards the people are the challenges of police-community relations. Additionally, these challenges however have led to other social problems such as loss of lives and property, lack of mutual understanding between the police and community, loss of confidence in the police force, loss of the dignity of the Nigeria Police Force. Finally, findings provided strategies in which police- community relations can be improved. These strategies include recruitment of qualified personnel, establishment of institutions that will sanction corrupt practices among police officers, public enlightenment, and maximum cooperation between the police and the public in combating crime. </div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0       Introduction</strong></div> <div>The community relies upon the police to “protect and serve”, and the police in return rely upon the community’s support and cooperation in order to be effective. When there is good police–community relations, police have a better understanding of the public’s concerns (especially those that are crime related),and citizens are more inclined to report crimes that occur to the police, provide tips/intelligence to law enforcement, willingly serve as witnesses, and are happy to participate in jury trials. By extension preventing crimes before they occur or minimize their impact, instead of simply react to calls for service. Good police–community relations prevent the possibility that the public thinks that police are simply a mechanism for intelligence collection.</div> <div>            Police-community relations refer to the ongoing and changing relationship between the police and the communities they serve. This includes issues of cooperation, race relations, and fear of police, violence, and corruption. In other words, no matter how well equipped the police department may be, its efficiency and effectiveness will largely remain a potential if it fails to establish a good relationship with its host community (Ross, 1995).Peel (1829) undertook the reorganization of the London police with the Metropolitan Police Act of 1829, he and the two key commissioners that he appointed, Charles and Richard emphasized that the police should work in cooperation with the people to protect the rights, serve the needs, and earn the trust of the members of the community (Critchley, 1967; Reith, 1952). Writing at the turn of the century, Lee (1971) discussed Peel’s principles of law enforcement. According to Lee, police officers are “public servants in the fullest sense of the term” (Ross, 1995).</div> <p>The concept of police-community relations has gained a secure level of acceptance in the law enforcement establishment and in urban government. Acceptance, in a working sense, means that proposals to establish and maintain such programs have a fair chance of success (Cox, 1996).The concept of Police-Community Relationships (PCRs) is very important to understanding of the role of the police in society and the ways in which communities can render assistance to the police in discharging these roles as effectively as possible. For example, in order for the police to carry out their crime control, peace/order maintenance, traffic control and emergency management functions effectively, it must work with residents of their host communities and see themselves as partners in the same community. If the community residents have cause to suspect the police or consider them as an army of occupation they will withdraw their cooperation and unrest will reign in such a community. Therefore, “Police-community relationship must be two-way partnerships” because “in a democratic society, the legitimacy of the police depends on broad and active public acceptance and support” (Dempsey and Forst 2008: 288). </p>\n\nTHE ROLE OF POLICE-COMMUNITY RELATIONS IN COMBATING CRIME<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF POLICE-COMMUNITY RELATIONS IN COMBATING CRIME", "id": 103}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <p>This research was initiated to assess the role of citizens in community policing in Dutsin-ma Local Government Area of Katsina State. The specific objectives include: to examine the nature of crime in Dutsin-ma Local Government Area; to identify the factors that facilitate crime in Dutsin-ma Local Government Area of Katsina State; to identify the challenges of formal agencies of crime control; to assess the roles of citizens in community policing and crime prevention in Dutsin-ma; and to suggest possible ways of increasing the effectiveness of community in Dutsin-ma. The study employed the survey research design. Questionnaires were distributed to a total of 120 respondents while 12 respondents were captured for the in depth interview. The study employed the stratified random sampling technique in selecting the wards under study as well as the respondents. Findings revealed that the types of crime perpetrated in Dutsin-ma Local Government Area include burglary, armed robbery, rape and the abuse of drugs and substance. More so, findings revealed that factors such as unemployment, poverty, greed/ redundancy among youth and the use of drugs and substance facilitate crime in Dutsin-ma Local Government Area of Katsina State. Similarly, it was also revealed that the challenges of formal agencies of crime control include lack of logistics, inadequate crime control equipment and facilities in execution their duties and corruption among officers. Furthermore, it was revealed that the roles of citizens in community policing and crime prevention in Dutsin-ma includeformation of vigilante groups, collaboration with formal agencies for crime control, rendering of physical, social and financial support to crime control agencies and provision of good communication network to crime control agencies. Finally, findings revealed that, there a significant relationship between the roles of citizens in community policing and extent of criminal activities within Dutsin-ma; there is a significant relationship between criminal activities and the socio-economic development of the society. Community policing can be improved in certain measures and recommendations are put in place: good means of communication/relationship with formal agencies, frequent night patrols, citizen’s participation in community decision making and awareness creation on security cautiousness.</p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1 Background of the Study</strong></div> <div>In the past, traditional communities have increasingly used informal remedies to compel non-offending third parties to prevent or take action or investigate crime, drug and disorder in their neighbourhood. However, today, preventing and resolving neighbourhood crime and disorder is the responsibilities of law enforcement agencies and other formal government authorities(Roehl 1998).</div> <div>The importance of citizens in crime prevention and order maintenance efforts became apparent in the mid-1970s, as concerns about street crime and residential burglaries began to rise and it became obvious that the police and other security agencies could not control and prevent crime effectively. With the formation and early success neighbourhood and block watch efforts, citizens themselves realized they could do something about the local crime problems that concerned them most. Aubow and Emmons (1981) labeled this the \"Community Hypothesis\". Stating that neighbourhood residents could be mobilized to participate in collective crime prevention, which get residents to take greater responsibility for local problems, rebuild informal social control and reduce crime and fear of crime.</div> <div>Presently, criminal activities seem to be on the increase while the police force appears to become dysfunctional despite government huge expenditure on crime control. But this dysfunctionalism or inability of the prosecutorial agent of the state to combat the crime phenomenon is usually blamed on poor numeric strength, lack of sophisticated crime control equipment, poor welfare package, poor training of personnel, lack of assistance/information from civil society, poor budgeting allocation among others. This explains why the efficiency of the police as a law enforcement agency is very much in doubt. These further stresses on the importance of citizens in community policing in preventing crime in order to compliment the efforts of the police force and other security agencies.</div> <div>Community policing is a complimentary security management strategy for  the prevention and control of neighbourhood crime(Monsuru and Rafiu 2016). The outcomes of the partnership between police and community however differ. Thus, the effectiveness in the way through which community policing is implemented an any given community will largely impact on the outcome of the approach whether it will be successful or not(Young &amp; Tinsley, 1998). These partnerships are very essential because the police are only one of the agencies responsible for addressing community problems, and other agencies need to take responsibility and respond to crime prevention and problem solving in partnership with police at all level (ibid).</div> <p>Community policing is anchored on a systematic relationship between the police and the entire citizenry. According to Ikuteyijo (2009), community policing entails community partnership in creating a safe andsecure environment for all.Police roles and functions are not simply law enforcement but also include tackling a huge range ofcommunity problems (Okeshola and Mudiare 2013). <br/></p>\n\nROLE OF CITIZENS IN COMMUNITY POLICINGIN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ROLE OF CITIZENS IN COMMUNITY POLICINGIN", "id": 104}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div><em>The aim of this study was to examine the public perception of drug abuse among the youths of Sabon-Gari area of Zaria city, Kaduna State. In order to achieve this aim, four research objectives and some research questions were formulated to guide this study.</em></div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.0 Background of the Study</strong></div> <div>According to Wikler (1990:78), drug abuse, “is the overwhelming involvement with use of drugs, getting an adequate supply of it and a strong tendency to resume use of it after stopping for a period”. Also, the Encyclopedia of Social Science (2000:143) captured drug addiction as “behavioral pattern of compulsive drug use characterized by an overwhelming involvement with procurement and use of the drug and the high tendency of the user to relapse to drug use after a period of abstinence”. Consumption of psychoactive substance is an age-long phenomenon. In all known history and culture, psychoactive substances like alcohol, kola-nut etc have been in use for several reasons- energizer, elevation of mood, reduction of hunger, stress, and anxiety (James, 1999; Reids, 2006).</div> <div>In America, Asia and Europe, these substances were used for energizer and food. For instance in San Francisco, Thio (2003:289) documented the wide use of cannabis by Chinos laborers for prolonged farming activity in their plantation. Similarly in Peru, Boliva and France, there was extensive use of opium, cocaine, cannabis etc for treatment of several ailments like stomach disorder, headache, fatigue, body pain and above all to wade off hunger (Mamman, 1993). The wide acceptance and use of these drugs resulted to devastating consequences like morphine addiction among veteran soldiers, escalated theft, homicide, promiscuity, etc (Cornwell and Cornwell, 1997). Sequel to this development, multifaceted programme like drug demand and</div> <div>supply reduction programmes, drug education, drug treatment and rehabilitation centers were put in place to tackle the scourge of drug addiction and its associated problems in America, Asia, and Europe.  </div> <div>Drug use can be defined as the appropriation of drugs by an individual taking into cognizance the medical and cultural norms of a given society (NAFDAC 2000, in Haladu, 2003). Haladu explained the term drug abuse as excessive and persistent self-administration of a drug without regards to the medically or culturally accepted patterns. it could also be viewed as the use of a drug to the extent that it interferes with the health and social function of an individual. World Book Encyclopedia (2004) defined drug use as the non-medical use of a drug that interferes with a healthy and productive life. Manbe(2008) defined drug abuse as the excessive maladaptive or addictive use of drugs for non-medical purpose.</div>\n\nPUBLIC PERCEPTION OF DRUG ABUSE AMONG YOUTHS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF DRUG ABUSE AMONG YOUTHS", "id": 105}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This research was set out to thoroughly assess the perception and impact of campus dating among students of Federal University Dutsin-ma, Katsina State. The major objectives of this study were to: examine the nature of romantic relationship in Federal University Dutsin-ma; examine the perception of campus dating in Federal University Dutsin-ma; identify the social factors that facilitates dating amongst students; examine the positive and negative impacts of campus dating on students’ academic performance; and proffer suitable measures on ways to improve students’ academic performance. The study employed descriptive survey design and data was collected using questionnaire and interview.The findings revealed that, dating is a form of romantic relationship in which two people are emotionally and sexually attracted to each other. More so, findings revealed that dating in Federal University Dutsin-ma is a social exchange between two unmarried persons. The findings also revealed that, the social factors that facilitate dating among students are academic pursuit,peer pressure, socio-economic background, parenting style and the need for high prestige. Finally, findings revealed that, dating has both negative and positive implications. According to the findings, the positive impacts include improve in CGPA, ease of academic stress, improvement in emotional health and strengthening of self-esteem/confidence. The negative impact of dating includes prevalence of dating violence, sexual implications and high level of disrespect among students. It is therefore recommended that students should concentrate on their studies and avoid every form of relationship. Victims of dating violence should seek medical help. Parents should monitor their children in the universities. Stake holders in education should develop a curriculum on relationship education for institutions of learning to enable students understand the dangers associated with early relationship. The University authorities should enforce proper dress codes to reduce sexual attraction. University staff should help inculcate moral values into the students by organizing seminars, debates, conferences and other related activities to help them build their academic potentials and resist deviant activities.</div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1         </strong><strong>Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>Education is an essential part of human life which contributes greatly to the development of an individual (Luqman,2012). Through education, an individual becomes fully developed in all aspect of life (Luqman,2012). Academic success is a proof of commitment to an individual’s pursuit. Academic performance is a scholarly effort rendered in order to achieve academic success (Ames, 1992, Puklek, and Peklaj, 2006). Commitment towards academic pursuit influences greatly, a student’s academic performance. A student’s academic performance could be distorted by such factors as peer-group influence, recreational activities and dating (Lisa,2007). Dating could be of benefits and also result into negative consequences to students’ performance.</div> <div>According to N’jole (1993) dating fulfils a number of specific functions that can enhance people’s socio-psychological development and ultimately promote a society’s continuity. Dating functions can be either manifest, the purpose are visible, recognized and intended or latent, the purpose are unintended or not immediately recognized. Dating is the organized means by which most people moved from being single to begin single coupled (Spielmann, Maxwell, MacDonald, andBaratta,2013). Dating is a somewhat ambiguous phenomena used in different vocabulary. Terms like “dating”, “going out”, “going-around”, “hanging-out”, “going-steady”, and “being-involved” often lack clear definition and agreement. According to Encyclopaedia Britannica, (2009), dating is a social engagement between two persons that often has a romantic character. Sociologists describe the dating process as a marriage market, in which prospective spouses compare the assets and liabilities of eligible partners and choose the best available mate. In this sense, who a person trades with depends on what resources he or she brings to the exchange (Gavin 2012).</div> <div>Dating has been in existence among countries of the world. Dating is not a new phenomenon but what it is referred to is relative (AlevDegimand Tao Fu 2015). Naturally, every individual would want to love and be loved. To most people, dating is based on an assumption that dating provides important experiences and valuable lessons that will eventually help selects mates and construct happy marriages. Dating doesnot really serve as a training ground for marriage, the behaviours that tend to characterize dating are not the sorts of activities that necessarily prepare one for the everyday demand of married life (John 2012). The nature of dating in the 1700 is different from the nature of dating in the 21st century; dating in the 1700, males and females follows dearly defined expectations in meeting and in time spent together (Eli, Chin Ming,Kathleen and Grace(2013). Parents were very strict to their children especially their daughters. Some societies like Ghana, Togo castrated their daughters as a way of avoiding pre-marital sex and births (Emmanuel 1998; Hanny Lightfoot-Klein 1989). Contrary to this period, dating in the 1900 differed. Economic and educational innovations which enable young people to interact with the opposite sex away from the watchful eyes of parents. The expansion of commercial recreation, technological innovation contributed to these changes in dating patterns. One of the things that most distinguishes modern dating from traditional dating is the prevalence of sexual activity in dating relationships (Newman 1958; Nievera 2013).</div>\n\nPERCEPTION AND IMPACT OF CAMPUS DATING AMONG STUDENTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PERCEPTION AND IMPACT OF CAMPUS DATING AMONG STUDENTS", "id": 106}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div><em>This work is focused on finding the impact of conflict on agricultural output in Guma Local Government Area of Benue State.The study reviewed literature that relates to the concept under study, its effect and solutions.The study also reviews three theories: Functionalism, Marxism and Human need theory.But only human need theory propounded byJohn Burton were used to back up the study.The findings in this work are gotten by administering questionnaires to respondents in the five Council Wards of Guma Local Government Area. Hundred (120) questionnaires were administered and only one hundred and five questionnaires were retrieved. This study find out that there was massive destruction of crops, farmlands and market centers during the crises between Tiv-farmers and Fulani herdsmen in Guma Local Government Area thereby resulting to hardship, hunger and starvation in the area.To prevent the incessant crises between Tiv-farmers and Fulani herdsmen Government should provide grazing land to the herdsmen.Once this is done, I strongly believe that there will be a lasting peace between Tiv-farmers and Fulani herdsmen. And this will pave way for rapid economic growth and development in the area. I appreciate the Benue State Government under the leadership of Samuel Ortom for the recently signing of the anti-open grazing bill.

Since independence from Britain in 1960. Nigeria has recorded a major conflict; the civil war (Biafra war) and several intra national wars in different parts of the country. According to Aliyu(2004) ,”conflict in Nigeria is of diverse types and have been on rapid increase since after the civil war of 1967-1970.These conflict are mainly attributable to resources control and divergent, value system in the country (Olabode and Ajibade,2010). </div> <div>Some of these conflicts have been characterized as crises of identity (Isa, 2001), or competition for control of political space. Alubo (2005), provides us with some examples of ethno-religious and communal conflicts thus; the Ife- Modakeke communal conflict of Oyo/Osun state in 1999,Hausa/Fulani and Kataf of ZangonKataf in Kaduna State 2000, Ijaw  and Istekiris of Warri in Delta State,1999;Hausa/Fulani and Yoruba ethnic clashes in Oyo and Lagos respectively in 1999/2000; Jukun/Chamba and Kuteb, Jukun and Tiv in Taraba State, 1998/1999; (Isa,2001).More so, Nigeria in the recent times has been faced with other insecurity problems among which include; Niger Delta militant in the southern part of the country and Boko Haram insurgency in the northern part of the country. Benue state on the other hand has been faced with a lot of security challenges and of recent the herdsmen-farmers conflict.</div> <div>According to Jibo et al(2001), some cases of communal crises in Benue state to include Jukun and Tiv, Ipav and Ukan, Tiv and Ibo, Masev and Idoma and the rest. Otite  and Albert  (1999:378) pointed out that the pursuit of access to the variety of limited resources which includes chieftaincy positions, powers, rival status, grass land, markets, water spots for animals, rival claim to land, government policies, leadership of political parties and the rest. By individuals differentiated in different categories in defined socio- physical environment give rise to conflicts.</div> <div>            A study of major source of conflict in Benue valley revealed that land matter accounted for the highest percentage (42.9%) of conflict followed by political (32.08%) and the chieftaincy matters (28.3%) respectively. A high percentage of conflict arising from the disputes has to do with land matters and conflict between Fulani herdsmen and Tiv farmers over grazing land. The state played a key role in the conflict of land in three (3) critical levels, viz: (1) the state inability `to address the indigene and settler phenomenon in the Nigerian constitution.

Furthermore, it was also revealed that effects of divorce ranges from poverty, delinquency among children, crime, hunger and starvation among victims. The study however recommended that certain strategies should be adopted so as to enhance a divorce free society: there should be an elaborate form of mutual understanding between couples; religious and traditional ruler should engage in public enlightenment of the masses on the effects of divorce on the individual and society at large; government should implement and strengthen policies so as to improve the educational sector in the delivering of knowledge; government should enact laws and policy that will create job opportunities for the masses; citizens should undergo the process of re-socialization and re-orientation.  </em></div> <div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>Marriage is an important institution in every society; it provides the means for the satisfaction of sexual relation and have rules and regulations of sexual competition and interest in the society. By ordering and channeling the satisfaction of sexual urge and channeling procreative energies, marriage helps the society to reduce the potential volume of conflict and other social problems associated with sexual deviance.</div> <div>Marriage is a building block upon which all families are built upon, without marriage there will be no families. Today, the institution of family is in continues decline due to increase in domestic violence and high rate of divorce. Unestimated number of people have witnessed several occurrence of divorce and in several ways and at different circumstances with sad things like domestic violence, violence against women.</div> <div>In Nigeria, in recent years, marital instability is one of the problems bedeviling the society and especially rampant among the Hausa communities. This may be due to the nature and customs of Hausa people and external influence on Hausa culture.</div> <div>Furthermore, cases of child marriage and other forms of marriages arranged by parents are more in Hausa communities which may cause marital instability and to some extent divorce. This divorce may lead to serious social problems such as, family dissolution, inadequate socialization which in turn may lead to deviance and delinquency.</div> <div><strong>1.2 Statement of The Research Problem</strong></div> <div>Marriage is a fundamental issue that brings about family union, and that the intense and close interaction creates a primary unit that functions as a major source of sustaining affection and love for each other i.e. for both parents and children. It also provides a means of legitimizing the husband/wife relationship as it legitimizes the sexual satisfaction.</div> To this extent, divorce is seen as a distortion to the stability of the society because is a hindrance to the socialization of children Due to neglect and incapability of the parents, the children may likely to have a low level of socialization, lack of proper education, high level of juvenile delinquency.

The study examined the factors responsible for youth involvement in cigarette smoking and its effect on the health and general well-being of youths in the study area. The study employed the quantitative and qualitative research methods to obtain data from the respondents. The stratified random sampling technique was used to select 100 respondents for the study.  Questionnaires and indepth interviews methods were used to obtain data from the respondents. Findings of the study revealed that the major factors responsible for cigarette smoking among youths include the need to feel sociable, to chase bore-dam and to feel warm. It was also discovered that smoking carried a lot of consequences ranging from health related issues, to possibility to influence youths into anti-social behaviour. The study recommended that policy frameworks be draw up by the government towards discouraging tobacco companies from operating in the country. also, public enlightenment and sensitization on the negative effect of cigarette should be stepped up.</em></div> <div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>Smoking is a practice in which a substances such as, tobacco, marijuana or cannabis is burned and the smoke tasted or inhaled Akintaro (2015). It is primarily practiced as a route of administration for recreation of drug use, as combustion release the active substances in drugs such as nicotine and makes them available for absorption through the lungs. It can be done as a part of rituals to induce trances and spiritual enlightenment, (Lock, Reyndds and Tansey, 1998). Smoking is one of the most common forms of recreational drug use. In recent times, tobacco smoking is by far the most popular form of smoking ahead of pipes, cigars and chewing tobacco and is practiced by over one billion people in the majority of all human societies resulting in nearly 2 billion people, that is a third of the world’s population being exposed to pulmonary tuberculosis pathogen (Philips 2010; World Health Organization, 2002).</div> <div>Smoking is one of the most common addictions of modern times. It has been implicated as an etiological agent for various chronic diseases, including a variety of infection, cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illness such as chronic obstacle pulmonary disease, that have impairment in the balance between cells growth and cells death, which, put together, are leading the cause of morbidity and mortality in today society (Zhonget al, 2008; Mehta et al, 2008). Unless smoking cigarette patterns are reserve, the world health organization estimated that by 2020-2030, cigarette smoking will be responsible for 10million death per year, with 70percent of them occurring in the developing counties like Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, Egypt, Senegal and many other countries in Asia, Latin America (WHO 2001; Suriyaproum et al.; 2007).</div> <div>Smoking has been shown to be a leading cause of premature mortality and morbidity resulting in several millions of deaths globally. It has been predicted that if the pattern currently seen among youth continues, a lifetime of tobacco use would result in the deaths of 250 million children and young people alive today, most of them in developing countries (WHO, 2012). National Population Commission (2009) submitted that Nigeria is one of the most populous countries in Africa, with an estimated population of 162 million people of which youth are estimated to be more than 30%. In Nigeria, the prevalence of tobacco use among adults(12.3% males &lt; 1% in females) is generally lower than in more developed countries, however, prevalence among youth tends to be higher than among adults, a mean lifetime smoking prevalence of 26.4% was reported among secondary school students with values ranging from 7.2% to 42.9% (Odukoya, Odeyemi, Oyeyemi and Updhyay, 2013).</div> Cigarette smoking has been associated with an extensive list of health disorders as well as reduction of life expectancy (Detels 2002; Doll et al 2004). On the average, cigarette smokers lose about 15 years of their life (WHO 2008)  and an estimated 4 million.</div>\n\nTHE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF CIGARETTE SMOKING AMONG YOUTH<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF CIGARETTE SMOKING AMONG YOUTH", "id": 109}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div><em>This study aims at assessment of pulic perception of women participation in politics in Dutsin-ma local government area of Katsina State. The study investigate the factors that influence participation of women in Nigerian politics among these factors are: Educating women equally with men, empowering women economically eliminate some cultural beliefs and the review of gender discriminatory laws. The study engages both primary and secondary source , including field survey, personal interview and questionnaire. The respondents (male and female) were selected from Dutsin-ma local government of Katsina State through quota sampling from the administration of questionnaires. The study reviews that the patriarchal system and male domination of the society, which relegate women to subordinate roles, has created women inferiority complex and alienated them from the mainstream politics in Dutsin-ma local government of KatsinaState.TheNigerian political culture of thuggery and gangsterism has made the political terrain too dangerous for most women to venture into mainstream politics, besides stigmatization of women politician by fellow women discourages the political participation of the former which Religious beliefs and institutional arrangement that restrict women to family responsibilities in the country coupled with lack of finance to encourage women participation have created a legacy that limit women political participation in Dutsin-ma local government area. Consequently, the study emphasizes the need to address these factors that entrench women subordination in Nigeria politics, these include domestication of international laws, the review of gender discriminatory laws, empowering women economically, educating women equally with men, the reformation of all Religious statutory and customary laws and practices that perpetuate women subordination in the country and the explicit specification and modalities of affirmative actions on women participation in politics as well as clear guidelines for implementation in the constitution of federal Republic of Nigeria.</em></div> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1  </strong><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></div> <div><strong>Introduction</strong></div> <div>This work assesses the public perception of women participation in politics in dutsin-ma local government area of katsina state.</div> <div>Political participation according to Anifowose (2004), is a sin-qua-none for democracy, as democracy involves a commitment to equal opportunity for male and women to be involved in decision making in their immediate society.</div> <div>      Political participation involves these voluntary activities such as attending rallies, vying for position and party office, involving campaigns, voting and expressing oneself to political stimuli. However, the pursuit of these democratic principles, according to Anifowose (2004) shows that women are generally less empowered and apathetic. In general, participation are lower among women than men. Women are less well informed about issues and less able to identify public figures, less able several point of view, less likely to be concerned with issues in elections, Anifowose (2004).</div> <div>      For a long period of time, it is seen as if women largely accepted as “natural” the difference in their opportunities as relatively few women raise their voice in protest. Recently however, more and more women in countries have established women movement to protect and change not only discriminatory practice against themselves and society and began to participate in political affairs of their country. In some countries, women have struggle to gain political leadership, thus as rightly pointed out by Anofowose (2004), in 1979 Mrs. Margret Thatcher became great Britain’s first woman prime minister, the republic of Ireland voted into office Mrs. Mary Bobinson  as women president. In other nations like India, Srilanka , Pakistan, Philippines and Israel, women have also occupied some sensitive political leadership position. Similarly, in Rwanda and South Africa 56.3% and 42.5% respectively of their national parliament comprised of women (international parliamentary union IPU, 2010). The Nigerian women have not been left out in this struggle as women organization are formed for “consciousness raising” campaigns to help women discover and develop new orientation (Lane,1958:209) Greinstein,(961:345).</div> <div>      A few Nigerian women have shunned apathy and demonstrated interest in the political affairs of their country. In 1999, for instance Hon (Mrs.), Margret Icheen who emerged as the speaker of Benue state house of assembly, became the first woman speaker of a house of assembly in Nigeria and the African continent. The farthest Nigeria has gone in achieving this is the appointment of 13 female minister by president Goodluck Jonathan, (UN women, 2014). Although, in the southern part of the country, the participation of women in politics has been on the increase in recent time, with the emergence of female deputy governor in Osun, Ekiti, and Lagos state. However in the north, little or nothing has been achieved in respect to political participation of women (Afolabi MM, 2009), making a study of this nature very imperative. </div>\n\nAN ASSESSMENT OF PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF WOMEN PARTICIPATION IN POLITICS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ASSESSMENT OF PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF WOMEN PARTICIPATION IN POLITICS", "id": 110}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>POVERTY AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE</strong></p> <p><strong>(A STUDY OF DUTSINMA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA)</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>This study was initiated to investigate the relationship between poverty and access to justice in Dutsin-ma local government.

Findings revealed that trial processes are very poor in Dutsin-ma, and that trial processes and accessibility is beneficial and affordable to only the rich. Also, Findings revealed the factors responsible for the denial of justice which included poverty, corruption, distance, inordinate court delays and lack of information. Findings further revealed that there should be rule of law, an institution/ organization that will help sanction corrupt practices among court’s officials, creation of job opportunities, public enlightenment, and establishment of more court. There is a significant relationship between poverty and access to justice. More so, it was revealed that there is a significant relationship between poverty and corruption. </em></p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT</strong></p> <p>Title page</p> <p>Abstract</p> <p>Table of contents</p> <p>List of tables</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE:</strong> INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.0       Background to the study</p> <p>1.1       Statement of the problem</p> <p>1.2       Aims and objectives</p> <p>1.3       Significance of the study</p> <p>1.4       Scope  and limitation of the study</p> <p>1.5       Hypothesis of the study</p> <p>1.6       Definition of terms</p> <p>1.7       Organization of chapters</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO:</strong> LITERATURE REVIEW AND THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</p> <p>2.0 Introduction</p> <p>2.1 An overview of justice</p> <p>2.2 The need for justice</p> <p>2.3 Judicial process</p> <p>2.3.1 The police</p> <p>2.3.2 The court</p> <p>2.3.3 The prison service</p> <p>2.4.

Yet nowadays the concept of ‘justice for all’ remains one of the most fundamental and widely articulated principles of contemporary societies (British Government, 2002). Justice is the true basis of society, there is no such thing as abstract justice for the simple reason that whatever pattern of justice exists in a particular society is tied to the attitude of its people and the effectiveness of the organs for the administration of justice. In this regard, the ordinary citizen is important. According to Aristotle, (quoted by Benjamin, 1899: 4). Man, it is said when perfected is the best of animals, but when separated from law and justice, he is the worst of all.  This means that Law and justice are indispensable commodities in any given society. In effect, access to justice suggests above all the possibility to access the infrastructures of justice: to have a judgment, rather than just be arrested (PRI Malawi, 2000). Laws are made for him/her and for the common good of the society in which he/she lives. It is therefore in relation to him him/her that the efficiency of laws should be tested in terms of: </p> <p>i.        How he/she perceives the law.</p> <p>ii.      The access that he /she enjoy or do not enjoy to the judicial process.</p> <p>iii.    His specific experiences as he/she encounters the justice system.</p> <p>iv.    His capacity to understand his own rights and means of those rights.</p> <p>To ensure freedom, equality and justice, the citizen must be seen to be equal before the law, must be educated to understand their duties and rights, they must be protected, equal opportunity for growth and development must be ensured, and they must have equal access to political, social and economic resources for the realization of potentialities and their safety and security must be ensured.</p> <p>Justice must be made more accessible to the common man in particular and all sundry in general if the society is to be perceived as geared towards a human face society with abundance opportunity and an effective strategy for poverty reduction.</p> <p><strong>1.1       Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Judiciary is said to be the last resort of the common man. For that, it is the courts that interpret laws and apply in different circumstances. The protection of individual person; his rights and properties depend upon the judicial structures made available, accessible and affordable. It is commonly noted that in many cultures there is reluctance, particularly among the poor, to become entangled with the courts. This is sometimes attributed to the strong stigma attached to any encounter with the law, no matter how innocent’ (Anderson, 2003:16).</p> <p>To this extent therefore, access to court and its service remain a pre-condition for the protection of the fundamental human rights and economic development. This is because court system which is remote, unaffordable, delayed, or incomprehensible to ordinary people effectively denies them legal protection. The research was motivated by the fact that there are a number of positions in relation to judicial process. While there is a stand that court service are available for all, including the poor, others did not subscribe to this opinion, but that poverty is a great barrier to access justice. In essence, of all the social phenomena that have a significant impact on human rights, poverty probably ranks highest (Mubangizi, 2005). The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reports indicate that access to justice is crucial to human rights enforcement and is increasingly recognized as a component of poverty reduction programmes (UNDP, 2004).</p> <p>The research therefore looked into these issues with a view to provide a systematic explanation about the problem of poverty and access to justice.</p> <p><strong>1.2       Aims and Objectives</strong></p> <p>On the grounds that there is unequal access to justice among people in many societies characterized by an imbalance between the poor and rich, and to ensure equality in every society, one of the most prominent principles of the rule of law and democracy, access to justice should be improved for the poor. In concrete terms, development of access to justice for the poor is likely to help poverty reduction (DFID, 2000 and UNDP, 2004). The aim of this research is to provide an explanation about the relationship between poverty and access to justice in Dutsinma local government.</p> <p>The specific objectives of the research include:</p> <p>1.                  Identify the spread and availability relative distance of court services.</p> <p>2.                  Review the trial process and determine its ease and affordability to the citizens.</p> <p>3.                  Make an assessment of poverty in relation to access to justice.</p> <p><strong>1.3       Significance of Study</strong></p> <p>This research is significant in a number of ways. </p> <p>First, issues related to court and its services will be brought to focus for public assessment and consumption. </p> <p>Second, it is significant for use by policy makers, government officials, social and political analysts, non-governmental organizations and students.</p> <p>The research will no doubt guide the students who want to undertake research on similar topic or area. Hence it will serve as reference for students and others interested in the area<strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>1.4       Scope and limitation of the study</strong></p> <p>It is important to note that the central focus in this research is to understand and explain the relationship between poverty and access to justice in dutsinma local government communities in Katsina state of Nigeria. The research limited itself on factors related to court trial and the accessibility of court services to people. Other areas such as the police activities will not be treated thus, it remains open for further researches.</p> <p>In addition the research limits itself to dutsinma local government area by use of sampling; all these were necessitated due to time and resource constraints. It is equally hoped that, accurate and reliable information will be obtained.</p> <p><strong>1.5     Hypothesis of the study</strong></p> <p>This research adopted the following hypothesis in order to guide the study.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis I</strong></p> <p><strong>H0: </strong>There is no significant relationship between poverty and access to justice.  </p> <p><strong>H1: </strong>There is a significant relationship between poverty and access to justice. </p> <p><strong>Hypothesis II</strong></p> <p><strong>H0: </strong>There is no significant relationship between poverty and corruption.</p> <p><strong>H1: </strong>There is a significant relationship between poverty and corruption. </p> <p><strong>1.6       Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Justice: </strong>Refers to the quality of being just and fair, the administration of law or the act of determining rights and assigning rewards and punishment; in other words, it may mean treating people justly and fairly.

This is attributed to lack of knowledge of several modifiable risk factors (excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, lack of exercise etc) and non-modifiable risk factors (age, hereditary, race and sex). Literatures reviewed on HBP hold that no specific cause for the disease in question has been discovered. This study set out to assess the level of awareness of risk factors for high blood pressure; level of youth engagement in unhealthy lifestyles and dietary habits; level of knowledge of preventive and control measures for high blood pressure; and possible strategies for enhancing youth awareness of risk factors for high blood pressure as well as it's preventive and control measures among students of Ahmadu Bello</div> <div>University (ABU), Zaria. The ―Health Belief Model‖ was adopted for the study with its basic assumptions that people were afraid of getting serious illness and that health related behaviors reflect the level of threat perceived; that is a person's perceived seriousness and susceptibility of an illness provokes the likelihood of preventive action. The functionalist theory was also adopted. Data were collected from three hundred and ninety-eight (398) undergraduate students in both Main and Kongo campuses of ABU. Eight in-depth interviews were conducted. Findings from the study revealed poor knowledge of most risk factors associated with high blood pressure among students; poor dietary habit with most students consuming carbohydrate foods mostly for breakfast, lunch or dinner weekly; high rate of snack foods and sugared drinks consumption on daily bases; low rate of students‘ engagement in regular physical activities. On consumption of alcohol, findings revealed that about 51% of students who consumed alcohol had parent(s) who do not consume alcohol indicating that youth alcoholic habit may not be associated with parental influence. On the other hand, parental influence on cigarette smoking proved to be likely as about 54% of students who smoke cigarette indicated having parent(s) who smoke cigarette as well. Also, about 78% of students who consume alcohol and 100% of those who smoke cigarette were males, revealing part of the reasons why the male gender is said to be more prone to high blood pressure compared to the female gender. About 52% of students who indicated ever being diagnosed of HBP were from polygamous homes. Furthermore, students‘ knowledge of preventive measures for high blood pressure was revealed to be below average. The qualitative data also revealed that no health education sessions or any form of awareness on high blood pressure with particular reference to students (youth) either during the daily health education sessions held at the university sick-bay or during the annual orientation for new students. Findings from the study showed that there is urgent need for awareness campaign on risk factors for high blood pressure in the university and possibly the wider society, and further recommends annual health seminars by respective faculties and places of worship, information on risk factor for HBP through fliers and bill boards by the University Health Service and the Guidance and Counselling.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>Background to the Study</strong></div> <div>High blood pressure otherwise called hypertension is a major threat to public health.

Despite the benefits of this immunization, it has been reported that there is still resistance to polio immunization. It is based on this, that this study was undertaken to assess the level of acceptance of polio immunization in Kaduna State being one of the endemic States in Nigeria, This study was premised on Symbolic Interactionism and Conspiracy Theory. Survey and in-depth interviews were the techniques used for data collection. Four hundred respondents were selected and the collected data were analysed using statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) version 16.0. The findings revealed that acceptance is generally high in the study area and is greatly influenced by many factors such as religion, income, educational attainment of the respondents, birth position of the children, gift as motivating factor, as well as the role of religious, community and health workers. The non-acceptance was found to be more common among the Muslims of low income status. This study recommends that detailed sensitization programme through various media facilities should be carried out periodically to emphasize the reasons for the importance of paying more attention to polio immunization.</em></div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>Background of the Study</strong></div> <div>Poliomyeliti<em>s</em>, is an infectious disease caused by poliovirus, a member of the genus <em>Enterovirus</em>. There are three serotypes of poliovirus: that is, 1, 2 and 3, these three serotypes are mainly different in their virulence. The serotype 1 is the most virulent of the three types, while serotype 2 and 3 are more sporadic (National Primary Health Care Development Agency, 2015). Human cells contain specific protein receptors to which poliovirus may attach and thereby enter susceptible cells. The virus infects cells of the oropharynx, the tonsils, the lymph nodes of the neck, and the small intestines. Infection progresses through cycles of virus replication, resulting in destruction of the infected cells. Once infection is established, poliovirus can enter the bloodstream and invade the central nervous system through the blood/brain barrier, by spreading along nerve fibers, or by both routes (WHO, 1999). When non-immune persons are exposed to wild poliovirus (Wild Polio Virus is caused naturally and not caused by vaccine containing live virus) the results may include inapparent infection without symptoms, mild illness, aseptic meningitis, or paralytic poliomyelitis</div> <div>The Poliovirus can be spread to others by droplets from the upper respiratory tract during the early days of infection. More commonly, infected persons pass large numbers of virus particles through their faeces, from where they may be spread indirectly, or directly to infect others .</div> <div>Poliomyelitis is a serious public health problem. It has persisted in a few countries from where it has spread to a large number of countries and posed threat to health as it did earlier between the 1950‟s and 1980‟s. In the developing world, the disease presents a constant threat to underfives, resulting paralysis with devastating.</div>\n\nASSESSMENT OF POLIOMYELITIS IMMUNIZATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF POLIOMYELITIS IMMUNIZATION", "id": 113}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Women in most parts of Niger State face constraints in obtaining and utilizing quality maternal health services. This study was carried out to identify the availability, quality and patterns of utilization of maternal health services in Primary Health Care (PHC) facilities in Niger State, Nigeria. Utilizing the cross-sectional survey design, the political economy and the Health Belief Model theoretical perspectives, data were collected from 903 women of childbearing age, 69 married males and 24 maternal health care providers in 24 Primary Health Care centres located in six Local Government Areas in the state. The women of childbearing age were selected through a combination of cluster, systematic and purposive sampling techniques while the married males were selected based on availability and willingness to participate. The Primary Health Care facilities and the maternal health services providers were selected based on their location and service provision in the selected study communities. Data were obtained from the women of childbearing age through the questionnaire. In-depth interview and focus group discussions were utilized to collect data from the maternal health services providers and married males in the study communities respectively. Primary Health Care facilities were assessed with the aid of a United States</div> <div>Agency for International Developments‟ adapted maternal health services evaluation tool. In addition, focus group discussions elicited information on perceived causes of maternal health problems, maternal health behaviour of mothers and men‟s responsibilities in maternal health care. Findings revealed that most of the PHC centres were dilapidated. Some of the roofs were blown off and leaking, while the doors, windows and floors of some PHC clinics were damaged. There was shortage of medical equipment, consumables and drugs for basic maternal health services. Most of the clinics (75%) had only low level trained health personnel like Community Health Extension Workers and Environmental Health Officers as only six clinics had trained midwives provided through the Midwifery Service Scheme and the SURE-P programmes of the Federal Government. It was observed that the available facilities were poorly managed while the 2-way referral system was poorly implemented and in some instances non-existent. Similarly, there was poor community participation in the health facility management. More than 90% of the women of childbearing age were 18-41 years old, 84.9% had 1-4 children and only 44% practiced family planning. From the findings, 33.7% had no formal education and 15.8% had only primary education. Similarly, 29.7% and 10.3% of their husbands had no formal education and primary education respectively. Women and husbands‟ level of formal education was found to have influenced the utilization of maternal health services by women. Prolonged labour (19.3%), hypertension in pregnancy (18.9%), bleeding in pregnancy (12.6%), anaemia (11.5%), postpartum haemorrhage (8.8%) and retained placenta (6.8%) were common maternal health problems reported by women during their most recent pregnancies. Some women (3.3%) required 3-5 hours of walking to reach the nearest Primary Health Care centre and only about 50% always get attended to in the clinics. Provision for emergency obstetrics care (EmoC) was non-existent in most Primary Health Care facilities. Although most women utilized the antenatal care services (83.1%), only 60.5% delivered in the clinics. Very few utilized the postnatal, family planning and immunization services because many felt that these services are not necessary. Injectable contraceptives were the commonly utilized method of family planning.</div> <div>Although husbands usually pay for services utilized by their wives and occasionally gave other supports for services utilized, their consent was a strong condition for service utilization by women. Most women attended the antenatal clinics more than the recommended four times because of the health workers‟ inadequate knowledge of the new approach. Younger women utilized maternal health services more than the older women. Male dominance had significant impact on maternal health service utilization as most women required the permission and financial support of their husbands for service utilization. Similarly, ability to pay for maternal health services significantly influenced utilization of the services. Women who were gainfully employed utilized the services more than those not gainfully employed on account of their economic strength. It is therefore recommended that actions should be taken by members of the community, government and non-governmental organizations to renovate Primary Health Care facilities. The facilities should be adequately supplied with basic medical equipment, consumables and drugs to improve service delivery. The State and Local Governments should employ and equitably distribute more midwives Primary Health Care facilities to improve the quality of services at various levels of care. Also, public enlightenment on maternal health services utilization and male responsibilities should be effectively carried out in all communities especially among the Nupe and Hausa whose wives hardly utilize the ANC services. Women empowerment programmes should be put in place to improve the women‟s economic power, maternal health services should be made free as earlier proclaimed by the government. There should be effective community participation in facility management and other health care activities to encourage service utilization.</div>\n\nPATTERNS OF UTILIZATION OF MATERNAL HEALTH SERVICES IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE FACILITIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PATTERNS OF UTILIZATION OF MATERNAL HEALTH SERVICES IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE FACILITIES", "id": 114}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Recruitments selection and placement function is an important task of personnel management.

Excessive population growth, in particular, has often been considered a major obstacle to rapid progress in economic development and hence to the betterment of people’s living.</p> <p>By January, 1982 the world population had passed 4.5 billion and hence marks optimistic projection by United Nation which place the figure at (9.1) billion by the end of 2050 over four-fifths of the population will inhibit the developing world and (90) percent of the increase will occur in the third world nations. This view in turn raised great global concern especially in countries where population was deemed too high. Population policies to reduce fertility rates were formulated and family planning programmes have been regarded as the best means of achieving these goals.</p> <p>Various attempts to encourage men in many societies to participate actively in family planning programmes have continued to receive low attention especially in developing countries, Nigeria inclusive, (United Nation, 1977). That in many cultural situations, the adoption of family planning is likely to be considered as a process of innovative behaviour. This means that the various cultural and religious beliefs as well as traditions are generally involved in shaping individual reproductive behaviour and family size norms. Isiugo, (2003) observed that, unlike women, Nigerian men desire more children and less likely to approve family limitation. </p>                                                          \n\nTHE ATTITUDE OF MEN TOWARDS FAMILY PLANNING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ATTITUDE OF MEN TOWARDS FAMILY PLANNING", "id": 116}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>The poor state of some rural community is becoming an unpleasant sight in this present age where development has suddenly become the order of the day even in the government of the nation.

Literature in this respect on rural development efforts by Local Government Council was reviewed. Similarly, development theory of growth by W.W Rostov served as frame of reference. For the purpose of this research 185 questionnaires were administered to the respondents within the community using simple random sampling with the aid of two research assistants. The results were analyzed using statistical package for the social sciences. The hypothesis tested on whether there significance relationship between the roles of the local government on community development in Warra, Ngaski local government shows that there is a significance relationship between the roles of the local government and community development. Similarly, the findings of the research work revealed that Ngaski local government council played a vital role in community development in areas of road constructions, agricultural empowerment and health care service delivery to the people. Furthermore, the challenges faced by community people in areas of community development efforts were insufficient fertilizer to the farmers and also lack of maintenance culture of the community development projects. Based on the findings of the research, the following were recommended: that the community dwellers should be less money conscious and should focus on maintenance of the projects placed on ground, ensurance of the collaboration of the community dwellers and local government council among other recommendations.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The reason for the creation of local government anywhere in the world stems from the needs to facilitate development at the grassroots. The importance of local government is a function of the ability to generate sense of belonging, safety and satisfaction among its populace. All forms of government, regimes or political system have so far ensured the attainment of this goal. Such strategies for ensuring national administrative development and political efficiency as found in the concept and practice of local government has been essentially regarded as the path to, and guarantor of national integration, administration and development in Nigeria’s socio-political context. With multiplicity of culture, diversity of languages and differentiated needs and means, the importance of such organization in fostering the needed national consciousness, unit and relative uniformity as well as well as preservation of peculiar diversities cannot be over emphasized.</p> <p>Local government is the tier of government closets to the people which is vested with some powers to exercise control over the affairs of the people in its domain (Lawal, 2000:60). Local government is expected to play the role of promoting the democratic ideal of society and coordinating development programs at the local level. It is also expected to serve as a basis of socio-economic development in the locality.</p>                                                          \n\nROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNCIL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL COMMUNITIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNCIL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL COMMUNITIES", "id": 117}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>THE NATURE AND CONSEQUENCE OF LABELING DEVIANT IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p><strong>Abstract </strong></p> <p>The aim of the article is to provide a theoretical nexus between social values, deviance and security in Nigeria. In Nigeria today, society at large is threatened by deviance, crime, conflict and violence which are violations of societal values and norms of security and welfare of the citizenry. People now show an increased interest in personal well-being and a decreased interest in the welfare of others. Citizens are not safe and secure on the streets, in their homes and offices. The paper posits that there should be a renewed awareness regarding social values and norms of security and welfare of the citizenry as taking precedence over all other subjects. Societal values and norms, and security and welfare of all citizens must be articulated. The paper challenges the collective lethargy of the state and the citizenry about societal values, norms and security, and effective measures to protect the rights to living and well being of all members of society, and so maintain a safe and secure environment for all citizens. </p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT</strong></p> <p>Title page</p> <p>Approval page</p> <p>Dedication</p> <p>Acknowledgment</p> <p>Abstract</p> <p>Table of content</p> <p> <strong>CHAPETR ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0   INTRODUCTION </strong></p> <p>1.1        Background of the study</p> <p>1.2        Statement of problem</p> <p>1.3        Objective of the study</p> <p>1.4        Research Hypotheses</p> <p>1.5        Significance of the study</p> <p>1.6        Scope and limitation of the study</p> <p>1.7       Definition of terms</p> <p>1.8       Organization of the study</p> <p><strong>CHAPETR TWO</strong></p> <p><strong>2.0   LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPETR THREE</strong></p> <p>3.0        Research methodology</p> <p>3.1    sources of data collection</p> <p>3.3        Population of the study</p> <p>3.4        Sampling and sampling distribution</p> <p>3.5        Validation of research instrument</p> <p>3.6        Method of data analysis</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></p> <p><strong>DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION</strong></p> <p>4.1 Introductions</p> <p>4.2 Data analysis</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></p> <p>5.1 Introduction</p> <p>5.2 Summary</p> <p>5.3 Conclusion</p> <p>5.4 Recommendation</p> <p>Appendix</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      </strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>The security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of Government (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999). But in Nigeria today the state and citizens are subjected to violations of core values and norms, and exposed to danger even by the very governments that are maintained with their taxes. The problem of security is more disturbing because government functions have been personalized by the ruling class, and national interest and security of the nation have been equated with interest of the privileged class and elites. It is common knowledge that the security organizations have distorted views of their constitutional roles, their commitment to the people of this nation, and their tendencies to be part and parcel of different regimes’ illegalities, oppression, exploitation and extortion of the common citizens (Imobighe, 2003). Deviance or crime is concerned with the process whereby values, beliefs, norms, actions or conditions come to be viewed as deviant or criminal by others. Deviance and crime can be observed by the negative, stigmatizing social reaction of others towards these violations. Criminality, corruption, conflict, cultism, violence and terrorism, and all illegalities, oppression, exploitation and extortion of the common man, can be deviant behaviours. The issue of power cannot be divorced from a definition of deviance or crime because some groups in society can deviantize or criminalize the actions of another group by using their influence on legislations (Goode, 2004). Psychopaths and sociopaths are some of the favourite “deviants” in contemporary popular culture. From Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, to Dr. Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, to Dexter Morgan in Dexter, to Sherlock Holmes in Sherlock and Elementary, the figure of the dangerous individual who lives among us provides a fascinating fictional figure. Psychopathy and sociopathy both refer to personality disorders that involve anti-social behaviour, diminished empathy, and lack of inhibitions. In clinical analysis, these analytical categories should be distinguished from <em>psychosis</em>, which is a condition involving a debilitating break with reality. Psychopaths and sociopaths are often able to manage their condition and pass as “normal” citizens, although their capacity for manipulation and cruelty can have devastating consequences for people around them. The term psychopathy is often used to emphasize that the source of the disorder is internal, based on psychological, biological, or genetic factors, whereas sociopathy is used to emphasize predominant social factors in the disorder: the social or familial sources of its development and the inability to be social or abide by societal rules (Hare 1999). In this sense sociopathy would be the sociological disease par excellence. It entails an incapacity for companionship (<em>socius</em>), yet many accounts of sociopaths describe them as being charming, attractively confident, and outgoing (Hare 1999).</p> <p> Society is made up of individuals who share common culture, and occupy a particular geographical area, (Zanden, 1996). Notwithstanding the fact that, socialization process is a powerful mechanism, that shapes the behavior of people of, and living in the same society, the distinctive, and unique nature of human personality, make individuals from the same society to behave differently. As a result, some members of one, and the same society conform to the expected patterns of behavior, as dictated by culture of that society whereas, others deviate. Deviation from norms, and rules is what is referred to as deviance, and crime respectively. Conventionally, societies do not allow deviation, and crime unchecked. They do reward comformity for re- enforcement purposes, and condemn deviation for deterrence, and corrective reasons. According to Clinard and Meier, (1998), The notion of deviance is connected to that of social control, possibly because an act that violates a group’s norm is usually followed by the group’s reaction or sanction in a negative form.Chukwukere, (undated), argued that, as long as human society comprises individuals, and the relationship between these individuals components is generally guided by cultural norms and rules of behavior, and as long as the cultural norms are never observed by all the people involved in the society, culture must take deep interest in the diverse processes of social control. Chukwukere’s argument is cogent, taking into cognizance the constituted interplay between society and culture and the influence of the culture via socialization especially, culture’s tendency to impose social sanctions, by rewarding conformity, and punishing deviance.Tanimu, (2003),maintained the ubiquitous nature of deviance. Thus, it becomes an illusion to anticipate comformity by all members of the society. Having such a conception renders the universal nature of deviance questionable. Decades ago, Durkheim, acknowledged the impossibility of deviance or crime free society, especially in periods of rapid social change, or in his jargon, anomie. Consequently, he suggested a collectiveresponse to deviance – social control– toensure moral bound to boundless desires of individuals. Absence of crime or deviance, implies social solidarity, as there is complete consensus over norms and values. For Durkheim, though, this situation is not only impossible to achieve, but the very idea is not congruent with the values placed on individualism in a modern society.Thus, Durkheimasserted that the existence of crime is unavoidable, and as Roshier, pointed out, responses to it must be collective. In the specific case discussed by Erikson, it could be asserted that the deviance of the dissenting group was not a necessary precondition for the acceptance of the new moral boundaries. If no split had occurred, then expectedly,the moral boundaries would have been universally agreed upon, anyway.It should be noted that, deviance, crime, and social control or social sanctions are key areas of criminological enterprise.As Jock Young [1998:451] aptly opined, criminology in general has much to offer to social science: Many of us were attracted to the discipline [criminology] because of its theoretical verve, because of the centrality of the study of disorder to understanding society, because of the flair of its practitioners and the tremendous human interest of the subject. many of the major debates in the social sciences in the 1960s and 1970s focused quite naturally around deviance and social control (quoted in Bell, 2010:157). Similarly, Tierney (2010:1) shared the same view with Young by opening his introductory remark with the following argument: Since the late 1960s the area of study broadly described as criminology hasexpanded enormously in Britain. Nowadays all sorts of writers, researchers andteachers make many and varied contributions to issues of crime and social control,and represent various political and theoretical positions. This paperdiscusses social control, its genesis, typology, and some of its theoretical explanations. Much of the work has been adapted from Clinard and Meier’s, (1998), Sociology of Deviant Behavior, but other literature has beenreviewed to enrich the paper with adequate insight into the subject of social control, and related concepts </p> <p><strong>1.2      </strong><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The social understanding of the study of deviance and crime examine cultural norms; how they change over time, how they are enforced, and what happens to individuals and societies when norms are broken. Deviance and social norms vary among societies, communities, and times, and often sociologists are interested in why these differences exist and how these differences impact the individuals and groups in those areas. What is deviant to one group may not be considered deviant to another. Sociologists define deviance as behaviour that is recognized as violating expected rules and norms. It is simply more than nonconformity, however; it is behaviour that departs significantly from social expectations. Sociologists stress social context, deviance is looked at in terms of group processes, definitions, and judgments and not just as unusual individual acts. Furthermore, they recognize that established rules and norms are socially created, not just morally decided or individually imposed. It is in view of the above that the researcher intend to explore the nature and consequences of labeling deviant in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3      </strong><strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p> The main objective of the study is to investigate the nature and consequences of labeling deviant in Nigeria. But to aid the completion of the study, the researcher intend to achieve the following specific objectives;</p> <p>i)             To ascertain the consequence of labeling deviant in Nigeria </p> <p>ii)           To evaluate the social consequences and implication of lebeling deviant in Nigeria</p> <p>iii)          To examine the relationship between Social Values, Deviance and Security in Nigeria </p> <p>iv)         To examine the implication of labeling deviant in Nigeria society</p> <p><strong>1.4      </strong><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p> The following research hypotheses were formulated by the researchers</p> <p><strong>H0: </strong>there is no significant relationship between Social Values, Deviance and Security in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>H1: </strong>there is a significant relationship between Social Values, Deviance and Security in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>H0: </strong>there is no significant implication of labeling deviant in Nigeria society</p> <p><strong>H2: </strong>there is a significant implication of labeling deviant in Nigeria society</p> <p><strong>1.5      </strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>It is believed that at the completion of the study, the findings will be of great importance to security management agency as the study seek to explore the consequence of labeling deviant in Nigerian society, as the study intend to give insight into the psychological implication of labeling deviant. The study will also be useful to researchers who intend to embark on a study in a similar topic as the study will serve as a reference point to further research. Finally, the study will be of importance to students, teachers, lecturers, academia and the general public as the study will add to the pool of existing literature on the subject matter and also contribute to knowledge.</p> <p><strong>1.6      </strong><strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of the study covers the nature and consequence of labeling deviant in Nigeria. But in the cause of the study, there were some constrain which limited the scope of the study;</p> <p><strong>a) AVAILABILITY OF RESEARCH MATERIAL:</strong> The research material available to the researcher is insufficient, thereby limiting the study  </p> <p><strong>b) TIME:</strong> The time frame allocated to the study does not enhance wider coverage as the researcher has to combine other academic activities and examinations with the study.</p> <p><strong>c) Finance</strong>: Limited Access to the required finance makes it difficult to broaden the scope of the study;</p> <p><strong>1.7 OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS </strong></p> <p><strong>Deviant </strong></p> <p>In sociology, deviance describes an action or behavior that violates social norms, including a formally enacted rule, as well as informal violations of social norms </p> <p><strong>Behavior </strong></p> <p>Behavior  is the range of actions and mannerisms made by individuals, organisms, systems, or artificial entities in conjunction with themselves or their environment, which includes the other systems or organisms around as well as the (inanimate) physical environment. </p> <p><strong>Labeling </strong></p> <p>Labelling or labeling is describing someone or something in a word or short phrase. For example, describing someone who has broken a law as a criminal. Labelling theory is a theory in sociology which ascribes labelling of people to control and identification of deviant behavior. </p> <p><strong>Labeling deviant </strong></p> <p> In sociology, labeling theory is the view of deviance according to which being labeled as a \"deviant\" leads a person to engage in deviant behavior. Originating in Howard Becker's work in the 1960s, labeling theory explains why people's behavior clashes with social norms.</p> <p><strong>1.8 ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work is organized in five chapters, for easy understanding, as follows </p> <p>Chapter one is concern with the introduction, which consist of the (overview, of the study), historical background, statement of problem, objectives of the study, research hypotheses, significance of the study, scope and limitation of the study, definition of terms and historical background of the study. Chapter two highlights the theoretical framework on which the study is based, thus the review of related literature. Chapter three deals on the research design and methodology adopted in the study.

Results of the null-hypotheses showed that   Null hypotheses one, two, three and four were rejected. Among the findings of the study were: celebrities’ dressing styles have significant influence on students’ socialization in tertiary institutions; celebrities’ dressing styles have significant influence on clothing utilization of students’ in tertiary institutions; celebrities’ dressing styles have significant influence on fashion trend of students’ in tertiary institutions; celebrities’ dressing styles have significant influence on clothing accessories of students’ in tertiary institutions. It was concluded that: Students’ of tertiary institutions tend to socialize based on their peers who conform to celebrities’ dressing styles. The researcher recommended among others that students should have good relationship with each other irrespective of individual outfits and clothing should not be the bases of determining social status of their fellow students.</p> <p> CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION 1.1         Background to the Study </p> <p>Clothing is anything that is worn on the body which includes garments, jewelry, cosmetics, tattooing, shoes and others.  Clothing is also a form of artistic expression that reflects the cognitive, moral and social aspects of human life (Kiran, Malik, Riaz, 2002).  Humans expressed that during the present dynamic age, there was probably no other sphere of human activity being important to such an extent, in which values and life styles are reflected more than they are in the clothes that we choose to wear.  An individual’s dress is a kind of “sign language” that communicates a complete set of information and is usually the basis on which immediate impressions are formed.  Style of clothing that people wear, the fabrics, designs and colours can speak a lot about the way an individual thinks and live. Erwin et al (1979) recognized that no single conceptual framework was adequate in interpreting the significance of dress.  Rather conceptual network of information that assists in apprehending the importance of clothing.</p> <p>Ibrahim (2013) stated that change in clothing is inspired by fashion designers who decide to showcase their products in magazines, catalogues, newspapers and travels, cultural events such as stage play or life performance and art exhibition or a costume exhibit is also an inspiration. Similarly, clothing choice and practices are an important human activity that constitutes the selection, acquisition and utilization of clothes. These activities are affected by social reasons, values, goals and self-concept. </p> <p>Celebrities are well-known personalities who are famous as a result of their achievements. According to Schlecht (2003), Celebrities are people who enjoy public recognition by a large share of certain groups of people. These recognition and achievements are usually known both locally and internationally. The Celebrities take different forms ranging from actors like Julie Robert, Rihanna, Beyonce, Morgan Freeman, models like Naomi Campbell, Agbani Darego, Genevieve Nnaji, sports like Tiger Woods, Venesa and Serina Williams, Raphael Nadal  entertainers like Oprah Winfrey, Toke Makinwa, Amber Rose, Kim Kadashian, and musicians like Tuface Idibia, Di’ja, P-Square, Nicky Minaj, Omawunmi, Davido, Tiwa Savage etc. These celebrities and their visual fashion statements affect dresses of youth and also the fashion industry which is evident in specific fashion replications (La Ferla, 2006).  </p> <p>The celebrities mode of dressing are usually that of the western wears and these celebrities unintentionally start trends, photographers snap hundreds of pictures and after the photos have been published, new fashions are born. It is often seen that interviews of these Celebrities are read with keen interest by young people. Young boys and girls are eager to know the personal aims and attitudes of these people. The youth observe the celebrities closely and then imitate them in every instance of their life. The youth pay great attention to their advice even more than their parents, teachers and their well-wishers (Norton, 2006). Clothes with Celebrities names and pictures are one of the examples. Young boys and girls imitate the mode of dressing to gain some sort of psychological satisfaction. Celebrities who are viewed on television, movies, satellite, newspapers are all powerful tools of communicating dress sense and clothing styles to students (Kiran,Malik, Riaz, 2002).</p> <p>Dressing patterns of these celebrities are usually done in a manner that suits their personality. Schuster (2011) explained that one of the easiest way to show celebrities personality without saying a word is through their style of dress because the image the project as they walk can immediately set the right tone for their performance. The mode of dressing comes in the form of romantic wears and colours that cling so much on them making them appear bold and sexy on stage. People will always have one thing in common; they want to look nice, they want to be aware of the current trends and their appearance to be appreciated.</p> <p> 1.2         Statement of the Problem </p> <p>The practical function of clothing is to protect the body from dangers in the environment. Clothing protects against many things that can injure the naked human body but today, humans have shown extreme inventiveness in devising clothing. Strange appearance has come to characterize the dress pattern of students on the campuses of tertiary institutions in Nigeria. Fayeye (2008) opined that clothing, dress pattern or adornment is an aspect of human physical appearance which has social significance apart from food and shelter, clothing is listed as one of the basic physiological human needs. This most essential need of man has now posed a great deal of problem to people especially the students of tertiary institutions who dress indecently against the acceptable norms of the society.  Omede (2011) stated that there is hardly any tertiary institution in this country that is not faced with this nauseating problem and further stressed that ways students on campuses particularly, the females dress seductively leaves much to be desired.  </p> <p>In Nigeria, tertiary institutions have been battling with this serious challenge of how students appear on campus and attend school functions. Many institutions tried adopting measures such as dressing code in order to curtail such dresses which institution feel is absolutely inappropriate to wear in public but these measures has not solved the problem because student still look strange in some of their outfits and even accessories which they use to compliment the outfits. These dress sense gives the authority a source of concern. These students attend lectures with garments that expose sensitive body parts likes low necklines showing their burst, skinny jeans trousers below waistline which is tight-fitting down to the ankle and skimpy tops revealing their pants. The male students wear T-shirts with jeans hanging below waist line (sagging) due to short crotch of trousers and fastened tightly at the middle of the two bottom lobes revealing their boxers and sometimes they could also have what is known as “carrot trousers” (pencil cuts) which takes the same form with that of the ladies (very tight from waist to their ankle). This pattern of dressing has made some students never to be seen as responsible due to the fact that it reveals their body contours which are provocative.  Students dresses most times, expose a lot of figure faults which hardly makes them look appreciable there by defeating the essence of clothing (concealing figure faults).</p> <p>Furthermore, dresses and accessories of celebrities are usually imported and found in high exclusive stores or boutique with a high price tags placed on them. Students whom are still dependents to parents unnecessarily border themselves to buy such clothing and at this point their purchasing behavior becomes more of impulsive buying and credit purchase which becomes detrimental to their academic needs.</p> <p>Celebrities’ clothing are outfits that are not easily gotten or seen anyhow in markets, students have to go extra miles of ordering online for a particular design or style. Others who wish to have but couldn’t order, go in search for the cheapest look alike just</p> <p>to have some form of identity with celebrities. </p> <p>Use of time is also an issue of concern to the study because students so much engaged with beauty and fashion hardly have good time management, most times their so much engrossed in what is trending and social activities in institutions at the expense of their studies. It is on this note that the researcher intends to investigate on the extent to which celebrities influence the clothing choices of students within tertiary institutions in Nigeria.</p> <p> 1.3         Objectives of the Study </p> <p>The main objective of this study was to ascertain the influence of celebrities’ dressing styles on students’ choice of clothing and socialization in tertiary institutions.</p> <p><strong>The specific objectives were to:</strong> </p> <p>1)            ascertain the influence of celebrities’ dressing styles on students’ socialization in University of Lagos.</p> <p>2)            ascertain the influence of celebrities’ dressing styles on clothing utilization of students’ in University of Lagos</p> <p>3)            ascertain the influence of celebrities’ dressing styles on fashion trend of students’ in University of Lagos. </p> <p>4)            ascertain the influence of celebrities’ dressing styles on clothing accessories of students’ within University of Lagos.  </p><p>   1.4         Research Questions </p> <p>The following research questions were raised to guide the study:</p> <p>1)         What influence do celebrities’ dressing styles have on students’ socialization in University of Lagos?</p> <p>2)         What influence do celebrities’ dressing styles have on clothing utilization of students’ in University of Lagos?</p> <p>3)         What influence do celebrities’ dressing styles have on fashion trend of students’ in University of Lagos?</p> <p>4)         What influence do celebrities’ dressing styles have on clothing accessories of students’ in University of Lagos?</p> <p> 1.5         Research Hypotheses                                                       </p> <p>The following Null Hypotheses were formulated for the study:</p> <p>H01 Celebrities’ dressing styles have no significant influence on students’ socialization in University of Lagos.</p> <p>H02 Celebrities’ dressing styles have no significant influence on clothing utilization of students’ in University of Lagos</p> <p>H03 Celebrities’ dressing styles have no significant influence on fashion trend of students’ in University of Lagos.</p> <p>H04 Celebrities’ dressing styles have no significant influence on clothing accessories of students’ in University of Lagos.  </p><p>   1.6         Significance of the Study </p> <p>This research will be of immense relevance to parents/families, students, tertiary institutions and to the society at large on issues regarding people’s appearance and outfits. This study is beneficial to parents/families to ensure that children from an early stage should be disciplined on how to dress properly and not exposing their bodies unnecessarily, while they become students on campus they should also be cautioned not to confirm to ungodly pattern of dressing and to help them to be conscious of their figure and find what really fits them. </p> <p>Tertiary institutions are beneficiaries to the study due to the fact that it will help reduce cases of teacher-student and student-teacher harassment on campuses, make student appear more decent and modest in their outfits. The school authorities will have less issues dealing with cases of indecent dressing or having to impose any form of dress code in tertiary institutions.</p> <p>Clothing lecturers of tertiary institution will have this study as a secondary source of information to teacher concerning good clothing practices that will assist to improve the image of students by making them dress-up according to what rally fits their structures.</p> <p>The society is also benefitting from this study because it has every tendency to improve patronage of local productions of clothing and not clothing’s of celebrities thereby improving economy of Nigeria.  Challenges and cases of rape and sexual harassment in the society will be highly reduced thereby coping issues of crime in the society. </p><p>   1.7         Basic Assumptions of the study </p> <p>This study was based on the following assumptions that students:</p> <p>1)                  are influenced by celebrities mode of dressing.</p> <p>2)                  dressings are not in conformity with culture or religion</p> <p>3)                  derive psychological satisfaction when dressed  like celebrities.</p><p>   1.8         Delimitations of the Study </p> <p>The study was delimited to celebrities (actors, actresses and musicians) dressing styles and their influence on students choice of clothing and socialization in tertiary institutions in Nigeria. The state is considered an educational state as various institutions are situated in major cities of Nigeria. It has attracted people from all parts of the country and internationally making the state a cosmopolitan state and relevant to be used for this study with much emphasis on students of University of Lagos. These students cut across all Faculties of the University and they were mostly young adults  whose  mode  of  dressing are assumed to be highly influenced by current trends which formed bases for delimiting the study to these group of students.</p>                                                          \n\nINFLUENCE OF CELEBRITIES’ DRESSING STYLES ON STUDENTS’ CHOICE OF CLOTHING AND SOCIALIZATION IN TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INFLUENCE OF CELEBRITIES’ DRESSING STYLES ON STUDENTS’ CHOICE OF CLOTHING AND SOCIALIZATION IN TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS", "id": 119}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE </strong></p> <p><strong>1.0   INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   GENERAL INTRODUCTION     </strong></p> <p>The statistical analysis of poverty as a disease in Nigeria is a project of interest that is relevant to be discussed, checked, and if possible enhance the complete eradication of poverty in a society like Nigeria. The level of poverty in Nigeria has been massive, pervasive, and chronic, engulfing a large proportion of the society.</p> <p>According to the Federal Office of statistics [Socio-Economic profile of Nigeria (1996], which stated that though, the concern about poverty in Nigeria has been very tremendous, but there is yet to be a significant and positive change in the socio-economic development of Nigeria.</p> <p>Resulting from large scale poverty, human conditions have greatly deteriorated, real disposable incomes have dwindled, while malnutrition rates are on the increase in Nigeria. Resulting from the rate of population growth which has outstripped the rate of food production and the rate of increase in the social services, the quality of nutrition as well as of educational and health services has deteriorated a great deal.</p> <p>The concern for poverty is therefore two dimensional. Overtime, a sizeable reduction in poverty is important, both in its own right, and as a first step to providing the means for the self-improvement of the most disadvantaged group in the society. If this task can be attained, there is a tendency of reducing by half, between 1992 and 2015, the proportion of people whose income is less than one dollar a day.</p> <p>(Source: Federal office of statistics (2005); Poverty profile for Nigeria, March 2005).</p> <p>The policies most likely to achieve these objectives are those that stimulate growth and employment, and in doing so, provide incomes for the poor, and use some of the resources generated to make adequate social provisions for the people who cannot benefit directly from rising incomes.</p> <p>However, according to Ahmad and Hemming (1991), the macro economic stabilization and structural adjustment policies that are necessary for growth may have adverse effect on the poor people in the short run. To avoid further impoverishment of the majority of the population, therefore, there is need to put in place policies that will protect the poor from the immediate consequences of adjustment.</p> <p>As such, policies and programmes aimed at poverty reduction need to address basic issues about the nature and magnitude of poverty as a disease in Nigeria. But, since I will be using the southsouth geopolitical zone of Nigeria as my case study, it will be most appropriate to premise the discussion of the project on the zone.</p> <p>Regardless of the fact that the southsouth geopolitical zone of Nigeria is an oil producing zone and serves as a source of  wealth to Nigeria, the level of poverty in the zone is still as alarming as it is in the other zones of the country. Though, being the second zone with the lowest poverty incidence with 58.2% in 1996, and 35.1% in 2004, poverty as a disease is still evident, and endemic in the zone, particularly in the rural areas of the zone, and, this is often due to the mismanagement of the zone’s share of allocated revenue from the Federal Government’s Revenue by the leaders in charge of the affairs of the southsouth geopolitical zone.</p> <p>1.2       <strong>RATIONAL FOR THE STUDY</strong>                                      </p> <p>One of the rational for this project is to know the level of poverty, and to address the issues of poverty as they relate to the human, ad socioeconomic development in the southsouth geopolitical zone of Nigeria.</p> <p>Another rational for the study is to assess the existing poverty programmes in the southsouth zone of Nigeria with a view to suggesting improvements. Examples of such programmes are:</p> <p>National poverty Eradication Programme (NAPEP); National Economic Empowerment, and Development Strategy (NEEDS); Small, and Medium Scale Investment Equity Insurance Scheme (SMIEIS); among others.</p> <p>1.3    <strong>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY </strong>             </p> <p>One of the aims and objectives of the study is to reduce by half, between 1992 and 2015, the proportion of people in the zone whose income is less than one dollar a day. This aim can only be achieved through the creation of employment opportunities, income generating programmes, and skill acquisition programmes by the Government, inorder to improve the living conditions of the people.</p> <p>Another aim and objective of the study is to improve the health services standard in the zone, inorder to reduce: the spread of diseases, and the death rate, and consequently, increase the life expectancy of the people in the zone.</p> <p>This task can only be achieved through the provision of well-equipped social infrastructure interms of health facilities in strategic areas throughout the zone, as well as ensuring that drugs, and treatment are readily available, and affordable for the poor masses in the zone.</p> <p>Another aims and objective of the study is to improve the Educational Standard in the zone, inorder to reduce the level of illiteracy; and consequently, increase the level of literacy among the people in the southsouth geopolitical zone of Nigeria. This task can be achieved by the Government through the provision of social infrastructures like schools for all ages, which would as well be well-equipped with the appropriate facilities and trained personnels (teachers) that will be in charge.                         </p> <p>Above all, the aims and objectives that is the most paramount is the provision of the basic necessities of life by the Government. These basic necessities include items such as: food, clothing, shelter, transportation, social amenities like pipeborne water, good roads, Health and Education services, among others, in order to improve the poor standard of living of the people. All these mentioned aims and objectives can be achieved by the Government through the formulation of certain programmes and policies that would stimulate growth, employment, skill acquisition, and income generating opportunities, among others.</p> <p>1.4   <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY </strong>          </p> <p>The significance of the study: The statistical analysis of poverty as a disease in Nigeria (a case study of the southsouth  geopolitical zone of Nigeria) is a project that will be able to investigate, and analyse how pervasive, and chronic poverty is in Nigeria, and particularly, in the southsouth geopolitical zone of Nigeria.</p> <p>It will also be able to investigate the causes of poverty as a disease in Nigeria and the remedial actions that could be taken to be able to reduce or eradicate poverty in the country.</p> <p>The findings from this investigation will also enable the Government to formulate suitable policies and programmes that would address the issues of poverty and how they relate to the human, and socioeconomic development. This would consequently, provide a meaningful and at least average standard of living for the masses, especially the poor masses in the southsouth zone, and in the country as a whole.          </p> <p>1.5    <strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>Research hypothesis is defined as a conjecture or supposition that motivates a research. Hence, the research hypothesis of this project are listed in the next subchapter.</p> <p>1.6    <strong>HYPOTHESIS OF STUDY </strong>       </p> <p>The general hypothesis for this project are the issues of poverty and reasons surrounding the situation of poverty as a disease which has engulfed every strata of the Nigerian society over the years. For the purpose of this project the following areas which address the issues of poverty as they relate to human development will be critically examined in the course of the research.  </p> <p>a)           Poverty</p> <p>b)           Absolute poverty</p> <p>c)            Relative poverty</p> <p>d)           Poverty line</p> <p>e)            Measures of poverty</p> <p>f)             Socioeconomic indicators</p> <p>g)            Disease</p> <p>h)           Statistical analysis</p> <p>i)             Statistical analysis of poverty as a disease.</p> <p>j)             Causes of  poverty</p> <p>k)           Poverty alleviation programmes j</p> <p>l)             Constraints to the effectiveness of poverty alleviation programmes.</p> <p>1.13    <strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS </strong>  </p> <p>a)       <strong>POVERTY:</strong></p> <p>According to the Nigeria Millennium Development Goals (2005 report). This is defined as a situation that is essentially about human deprivation. Hence, it is about lack or limited access to essential capabilities that could facilitate a long and healthy life, becoming more knowledgeable, maintaining an adequate standard of living, and participating meaningfully in decisions that affects one’s life.</p> <p>b)           <strong>ABSOLUTE POVERTY</strong>:</p> <p>This is defined as the lack of resources to consume certain bundle of goods and services. Such a bundle of goods and services may contain what could be considered an objective minimum which include the basic necessities of life such as food, shelter, clothing, among others (Source: Federal Office of Statistics (FOS): [Socioeconomic profile of Nigeria (1996].</p> <p>c)            <strong>RELATIVE POVERTY</strong>:   </p> <p>According to the Federal Office of statistics: [Socioeconomic profile of Nigeria (1996)], this is defined with respect to living standards that prevail in a particular society. Hence an advantage of relative poverty line is that it reflects changing perception of acceptable minimum living standards. Thus, while electricity, pipe borne water, indoor sanitation, are considered essential in very rich societies, they may not be so in poorer ones.</p> <p>d)           <strong>POVERTY LINE</strong>:</p> <p>According to the Federal Office of statistics: [Socioeconomic profile of Nigeria. (1996)], Poverty line is defined as a proportion usually fifty percent (50%) of average income.</p> <p>e)            <strong>MEASURES OF POVERTY</strong>:</p> <p>As it is defined by the Federal Office of statistics: [socioeconomic profile of Nigeria. (1996)], this is the measure by which poverty levels in a society can be quantified and classified. There are basically two common measures of poverty and they are headcount ratio and poverty gap respectively.</p> <p>i.             <strong>HEADCOUNT RATIO</strong>: According to Baridhan (1973), and Ahluwalia (1976), this is defined as the ratio of individuals or households whose income fall below the poverty line.</p> <p>ii.           <strong>POVERTY GAP</strong>: This is a traditional measure of poverty which measures the average deviation of the incomes of the poor from the poverty line.</p> <p>f)             <strong>SOCIOECONOMIC INDICATORS </strong></p> <p>These are defined as what is said to constitute the means or measure or pointer for assessing an event, be it social, economic or demography. There are mainly two types of socioeconomic indicators, and they are social indicators and economic indicators.</p> <p>i.             <strong>SOCIAL INDICATORS</strong>: Are defined as a construct based on observations and usually quantitative ones, that tells something about aspects of social life of interest or about changes taking place in that aspect of social life. Examples are: Qualitative education, proper medical care, Good an convenient standard of living, among others.</p> <p>ii.           <strong>ECONOMIC INDICATORS</strong>: Are defined as derived quantities obtained in respect of economic statistics.                     </p> <p>g)            <strong>DISEASE</strong>:</p> <p>Is defined as an unhealthy condition of the “mind or body” the words in quotes could be the social or economic conditions of a society.</p> <p>h)           <strong>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS</strong>:  </p> <p>Is defined as the scientific study, collection, compilation, analysis, presentation and graphical representation of a given set of data.</p> <p>i)             <strong>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF POVERTY AS A DISEASE:</strong></p> <p>This is defined as the statistical analysis of the measures of human deprivation that has as a disease engulfed the socioeconomic system, of a society, and as a result has hindered human development and socioeconomic development of the society.</p> <p>j)             <strong>CAUSES OF POVERTY:</strong></p> <p>This is defined as the socioeconomic vices in a society, that causes or leads to lack of, or inadequate access to the basic necessities of life to an individual, or in a household or a society as a whole.</p> <p>k)           <strong>POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROGRAMMES:</strong></p> <p>According to the Nigeria Millennium Development Goals (2005 report) this is defined as programmes that have been formulated with certain policies backing them by the Government, inorder to reduce the level of poverty or completely eradicate poverty in a society like Nigeria. Examples of such programmes are: National Poverty Eradication programme (NAPEP), National economic empowerment, and development strategy (NEEDS), small and medium scale investment equity insurance scheme (SMIEIS), among others.</p> <p>l)             <strong>CONSTRAINTS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROGRAMMES:</strong></p> <p>These are defined as certain factors that were not checked thoroughly by the Government before the formulation of the policies and programmes of some of the poverty alleviation programmes. This as a result has caused the ineffectiveness, and inefficiency of the poverty alleviation programmes. Examples of such factors include: poor coordination of programmes, lack of consistent policy in governance, failure to involve the beneficiaries at both the conception and implementation stages of the programmes, among others.</p> <p>1.14    <strong>SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope involved in this study included laborious ones like the conducting of census on a target population, for example: the core poor, moderately poor, and the Non-poor and the administering of questionnaires to collect microhousehold data as related to poverty levels in the zone, and the use of suitable statistical techniques for analyzing the collected data, by scholarly statisticians, inorder to provide reliable results that are valid and objective in nature.</p> <p>Another scope involved, included the research made from books that highlighted instances of poverty in certain areas of the zone.            </p>                                                          \n\nTHE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF POVERTY AS A DISEASE IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF POVERTY AS A DISEASE IN NIGERIA", "id": 120}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The family as a universal social institution exists in all human society.

It forms the basic unit of social organization and it is difficult to imagine how society could function without it. Although the composition of the family varies, for example in many societies two or more wives are regarded as the ideal arrangement, such difference can be seen as minor variations.</p> <p>In general, therefore, the family has been seen as a universal social institution, as an inevitable part of human society. On the whole it has been regarded as functional both for the individual and society as a whole (Haralambos and Heald 1984).</p> <p>The study of the family involves several theories, but the functionalist and conflict theories are the two most fundamental. The functionalists are interested in the functions that are performed by the family. The family according to the functionalist view, is the most stable social institution and is therefore ideal for the performance of the following functions:</p> <p>(i) The family, through the process of socialization, nurtures and prepares children to be productive members of society.  (ii) It equips them with the cultural values and skills necessary for the society to survive continuously. (iii) Family members receive their basic needs, such as emotional and physical care, from their families. In most societies, there are groups or organisations that take up the responsibility of caring for or protecting the members of the society under certain circumstances. The family, however, seems to be the most appropriate of them all, especially regarding daily living in an impersonal environment caused by rapid changes (Magill, and Hector, 2000 ed).</p> <p>From the foregoing, the family is supposed and expected to be an arena of love, peace, harmony, and tranquility, where members will naturally find a haven of rest after a tension soaked and stressful working day. It is expected to be the protector and guardian of its members from external aggression among other roles. However, research and observation show that the family has become another place of tension, multifarious problems and a danger Zone (Ekiran 2004)                         </p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Early attempts to explain delinquency centred on biological and psychological factors, seeking to explain crime and delinquency in terms of some deficiency or imbalance within the individual who engaged in the behaviour. Noting that criminal and delinquent behaviour patterns were found under certain circumstances and in certain areas more frequently than in others, sociologists began to look at the social milieu in which the acts took place (Sanders 1996)     </p> <p>The family represents the primary agent for the socialization of children. The family is the first social group a child encounters and is the group with which most children have their most enduring relationships. The family gives a child his or her principal identity and, of course, even his or her name. The family teaches social roles, moral standards, and society’s laws, and it disciplines children who fail to comply with those norms and values. The family either provides for or neglects children’s emotional, intellectual, and social needs; the neglect of these basic needs can profoundly affect the shaping of a child’s values and attitudes (Bartollas, 1990). One of the apparent voids that exist in the life of a child who is delinquency prone is pronounced supportive and affectional needs that go largely unmet. According to Berman (1989), if the mother is ineffective, indifferent or cruel, the child sees her as one who rejects his needs and responds to her as the one who hates him. Her own dependency needs may be such that she finds the infants needs intolerable. This type of mother most often is helpless, confused, disorganized and dependent. She feels there is no one to satisfy her dependency needs and therefore feels unable to care for the needs of her children. The father also poses a serious problem to the child, since he may either ignore the child or belittle him and be harsh or cruel. This father is devoid of or lacking in his capacity to give love or tender interest to the family.</p> <p>Some observers of social life have argued that the family no longer functions as a useful social unit. They contend that divorce, single-parent families, isolation, role conflict, out-of-wedlock births, unemployment, alcohol and drug abuse, and violence are some of the problems affecting the family today (Baltimore, K Freudenthal 1998). The importance of given the family as a contributory factor to delinquency has varied through the years Karen Wilkinson has classified the attention given to the family into three periods: 1900-1932, 1933-1950, and 1951-1972. In the first period, the role of the family as a contributory factor to delinquent behaviour was emphasized. A broken home was considered a major cause of delinquency, and a great deal of research was done to measure its influence. Studies done in the United States in 1981 for example, indicated that there was one divorce for every two marriages. Even though most people who get divorced ultimately remarry, the ratio of divorced people to married people living with their spouses more than doubled from 47 per 1,000 in 1970 to 100 per 1,000 in 1980. The rise of the divorce means that single-parent families have been increasing (Bartollas 1990).</p> <p>Isolation also is a major problem affecting many families. This is as a result of urbanization, increased mobilization, dehumanizing jobs, and the disintegration of communities, neighbourhoods, and support networks. The declining impact of the extended family, which traditionally offered numerous advantages to children because it relived some of the pressures of parenting, has further contributed to the problem of isolation.</p> <p>Violence has been a major characteristic of the family in the past, and it is no stranger to family life today. Marital violence is rapidly becoming recognized as a pervasive problem that affect nearly a third of the world’s population (Gelles and Straus 1988). A study in Delaware (U.S) found that 12 percent of those surveyed reported having hit a spouse with a hard object, while 22 percent has used a hand. Furthermore, more than 60 percent of the couples reported at least one violent act in their marriage. With a seeming general acceptance of violence within the family, it is not surprising that some parents also act out their aggressions on their children.</p> <p>Inadequate supervision and discipline in the home have been commonly citied to explain delinquent behaviour. Hirschi (1969) found that the rate of delinquency increased with the incidence of mothers employed outside the home. He attributes this finding to the fact that unemployed mother spent more time supervising their children’s activities and behaviour. Nye (1960) reports that the type of discipline were associated with high rates of delinquent behaviour, for both strict and lax discipline and unfair discipline were associated with high rates of delinquent behaviour. McCord, McCord and Zola (1979) further found a relationship between inconsistent discipline and deviant behaviour. Nye adds that the disciplinary role of the father was more closely related to delinquent behaviour than was the disciplinary role of the mother.</p> <p>The foregoing observations are some of the problems plaguing the family, and which are responsible for deviant acts in children. Since the family is the first social group a child encounters and is the group with which most children have their most enduring relationships. The family teaches social roles, moral standards, and society’s laws, and it disciplines children who fail to comply with those norms and values. Where these are missing due to improper socialization, violence or one of those problem affecting the family, it becomes a problem both for the individual and society as a whole. Also, the fact that children learn most of their behaviour from the home, it is clear that whatever they are exposed to in the home, they tend to exhibit to the society. On the whole, the rate of delinquency appears to increase with the number of unfavourable factors in the home. That is, multiple “handicaps” within the family are associated with a higher probability of juvenile delinquency than single handicaps.                                         </p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>General Objective</strong></p> <p>To establish the relationship between family instability and deviance in children</p> <p><strong>Specific Objectives</strong></p> <p>i.             To determine the relationship that exists between divorce/separation and deviance in children.</p> <p>ii.           To demonstrate the relationship between parents’ attitude toward their children and delinquency.</p> <p>iii.          To find out if peer influence engenders juvenile delinquency.</p> <p>iv.          To find out if family size causes deviance in children.</p> <p>v.            To make policy recommendations on how to combat deviance in children.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The significance of the study is to add to existing knowledge on family instability and juvenile delinquency in Nigeria, it will serve as a basis for further research on the subject matter, and finally, to serve as a guide for policy formulation aimed at addressing the problem of juvenile delinquency in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>The scope of the study will be within the ambit of teenagers in Lagos State, particularly in Birrel Boys Approved School (Sabo), Girls Remand Home (Idi-Araba), in Yaba, Mushin, and Ajeromi Ifelodun Local Government Areas in Lagos State.</p> <p>This will be done in the time frame of two months, July – August 2006, in order to gather information on family instability and its effects on children.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong><strong>CONCEPTUAL CLARIFICATION</strong></p> <p>In this section, operational definitions of all the major concepts as they are to be used in the study will be done, so as to give meaning and clarity of purpose to the study.</p> <p><strong>Delinquency: </strong>Refers to behaviours for which a juvenile can be formally sanctioned; collectively, those behaviours include status offenses and those behaviours prohibited under criminal law (Magill and Hector, 1995).</p> <p><strong>Deviance: </strong>Refers to an act or behaviour which departs from a generally accepted pattern of behaviour; a behaviour or act that aberrates from that which is considered a norm (Magill, and Hector, 1995).</p> <p><strong>Divorce: </strong>Refers to the termination of marriage by legal, customary or religious procedures (Census Manual, 2006).</p> <p><strong>Family: </strong>A family consists of a group of people who identify themselves as being related to one another, usually by blood, marriage, or adoption, and who share intimate relationships and dependency. Lamanna, and Reidmann, (1991) define a family as “any sexually expressive or parent-child relationship in which people-usually related by ancestry, marriage, or adoption: (i) Live together with commitment (ii) Form an economic unit and care for any young, and (iii) Find their identity as importantly attached to the group</p> <p><strong>Juvenile: </strong>According to the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, a juvenile is a young person who is not yet an adult.   </p> <p><strong>Juvenile Delinquency: </strong>Refers to any act in violation of criminal law, committed by a person defined under the law as a Juvenile, which if it had been committed by an adult will be treated as crime or criminal conduct (Alemika, and Chukwuma, 2001).</p> <p><strong>Separation: </strong>Refers to a situation where a couple is shut off from cohabitation, especially by Judicial Decree (Census Manual, 2006).</p> <p><strong>Socialization: </strong>This will be looked at from two perspectives: the society and the individual.</p> <p>i.             From the societal perspective, it is the process of fitting new individuals into an organized way of life and an established cultural tradition.

OBJECTIVES: (1) Identify the proportion of parents who agreed, were neutral, and disagreed that they had access to enough information to make a decision about immunizing their child; (2) examine how parents who agreed and disagreed differed with respect to sociodemographic characteristics, and their attitudes about immunizations, their child's healthcare provider, immunization requirements/exemptions, and immunization policymakers; and (3) identify if differences exist in specific immunization concerns. METHODS: A sample of parents with at least one child aged &lt; or =6 years (n=642) was analyzed using data from the Health Styles survey conducted during July and August 2003. Odds ratios and the Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test were used for analysis. RESULTS: Response rate for Health Styles was 69% (4035/5845). The largest proportion of parents agreed they had access to enough information (67%) compared to parents who were neutral (20%) or who disagreed (13%). Compared to parents who agreed, parents who disagreed were more likely to be less confident in the safety of childhood vaccines (odds ratio [OR]=5.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]=3.3-8.9), and to disagree that their child's main healthcare provider is easy to talk to (OR=10.3, 95% CI=3.7-28.1). There was a significant linear trend in the percentage of parents expressing immunization concerns among those who agreed, were neutral, and who disagreed they had access to enough information (p&lt;0.05; df=1). CONCLUSIONS: While most parents agreed that they had access to enough immunization information, approximately a third did not. Perceived lack of information was associated with negative attitudes about immunizations and toward healthcare providers. Basic information about the benefits and risks of vaccines presented by a trusted provider could go a long way toward maintaining and/or improving confidence in the immunization process. </p> <p> CHAPTER ONE 1.0     INTRODUCTION </p> <p>Immunization is recognized as a safe and effective method of preventing disease (National Advisory Committee on Immunization, 1998); however, not all parents choose to immunize their children and not all couples choose to maintain or update their own immunization status. The goal of this thesis is to understand why young couples (parents or future parents) make the decisions they do and how they arrive at those decisions. Health scientists need to acquire an understanding of the experience of people in relation to their environments for the purpose of increasing their potential for health. Improved health policies may be developed if we can understand how to serve our populations better as a whole. It is more useful to put into place policy that will be meaningful and followed, than blanket statements that do not put the population's needs first. This study contributes to a better understanding of the thought processes behind persons who choose to delay or refuse immunizations irrespective of the policy environment. The area of immunization is as complex as a mosaic, and true to this metaphor, every tile of information contributes to the overall picture while remaining distinct. This thesis is presented as another <em>tile.</em> Currently in Amuzi community in Obowo L.G.A, mainstream immunization is voluntary, though strongly encouraged and freely dispensed to all citizens. Changes are on-going in mandatory immunization policy provincially. Alberta and Saskatchewan pride themselves in not having moved to mandatory laws due to the public health delivery systems in place. (Personal communication, P. Hasselback, January, 2002). As long as most people comply, the herd immunity remains strong and the risk for developing vaccine reventable diseases remains low. However, certain groups in the population do not agree with immunization for a variety of reasons. Some of these reasons include theological constraints, belief structures that favor \"natural\" immunity, beliefs that immunization is dangerous to children, mistrust in pharmaceutical companies and a belief in alternative health therapies such as provided by naturopaths and chiropractors.</p> <p>What about apathy? Funk and Wagnells (1982) describe this as indifference and lack of interest. Do couples feel immunization is important? Do they think about it during their daily lives? What will our future generation of parents do to contribute to herd immunity when they have never seen the diseases the vaccines are designed to prevent? What will happen when the next generation feels overly confident that they will not be touched by these diseases because they are perceived as a \"Third World problem\" or when they do not understand the ramifications of the diseases? Lack of knowledge of our own immune systems in the general population is high. Because of the complexity of interactions between anatomical structures and biochemistry most laypersons shrug their shoulders when asked how basic immunological functions occur.</p> <p>Policies encouraging health education may emphasize the importance of citizens taking a pro-active role in understanding their bodies and what they can do to remain healthy. In  this day of reduced health care budgets more emphasis needs to be placed on prevention of disease. Immunization is an integral cog to the wheel. An analysis of this issue indicates a need for more knowledge to guide health care workers and policy-makers in contributing to immunization.</p> <p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this project is to ascertain the beliefs of young couples regarding immunization for their children or future children.</p> <p>The overall objectives of this qualitative study are to:</p> <p>a. Determine the theological constructs of young couples who refuse or delay immunization among their children or future children for religious beliefs.</p> <p>b. Determine the beliefs of young couples who engage in alternative health practices and refuse or delay their children's or future children's immunizations.</p> <p>c.

Philosophy which was helped to reduce the high rate of youth’s migration to urban areas for search of social amenities. The work will evaluate the youth contributions so far towards the development of this area. The hypotheses tested includes the following: that youth efforts in community development projects are appreciated by other members of the community, that the major factor militating against youth participation is land dispute. Different method of data collection was adopted to obtain information from the public. Questionnaire was designed and distributed to different respondents. The questionnaires involved 100 respondents, the entire hypothesis were accepted and analyzed. Finding of these tested hypotheses could be seen in chapter four of this research work. Based on these findings, suggestions aimed at eliminating these inherent problems have been advanced in chapter five of this research work. Recommendations were made in the following directions: that youth should be told how the community funds are being controlled or expended, that youths should be given free hands of initiate new projects, to supplement the effort of formal education system through training and impacting self-reliance skills that can make the youth more job creating than seeking, that youths should act in the various capacities as agents. They should be instrumental to most enlightenment campaigns in the rural areas. That it is necessary to re-educate the youth on the important impact they owe their community in development activities. By so doing, they serve as channels for introduction of modern ways of living and doing things.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The aim of rural development is to get rid of poverty. Youth involvement in community development programme has been as long as man’s existence. Their contribution towards community development in a given area like Oredo Local Government has much to be desired. It is generally accepted in most developing countries like Nigeria, that government alone cannot develop all the rural communities as at when due. Apart from leadership, there are other things that are against the attainment of a meaningful, progressive and just society that we have been longing for but failed to respond decisively. Although these are few books that cover the role of youth in community development or nation building. This study will treat all aspects of the topic as evidence to show whether or not youths played effective contributive role in the development of rural areas Oredo Local Government is not an exception, this is because they need the help or support of the youths to assist the nation in achieving self sufficiency in areas like food production and the realization of structural transformation of the Agricultural sector (Doorbus, 2001).</p> <p>It is a common thing that “youths are the leaders of tomorrow”, it could therefore be seen that the contributions of youths to rural development is very important, hence people look up to the youths for active leadership, self reliance, honesty, selfless service, industrial knowledge, patriotism and discipline. Generally, youths constitute about 2/3 (two-third) of the active population, by youth we mean those young active and powerful or dynamic people in the society under the ages of forty. They have some qualities, which includes responsibility to challenges (Oadire, 2010).</p> <p>The community does show that government alone cannot provide all the development needed by themselves,, as a result the communities are to mobilize themselves by using the resources at their disposal to provide amenities through self-help and popular participation; we cannot over emphasize the effect of youth class or cooperative organization in carrying out such a task, no wonder BEJA says “there is hope that our country will still grow and survive into a great nation despite the ills of our times and that hope is in the youths”.</p> <p>The researcher will attempt to state the energetic nature of youth class in Oredo Local Government. The hope of the rural communities is to have access to the provision of the basic social amenities. But the way of achieving this hope cannot be guaranteed by the government alone, but through the help or contribution of the rural developers, moreover no community should see rural development as the sole responsibility of the community development officers, in order not to experience law level development, unemployment, starvation and poor health care, government can no longer or finds it difficult to satisfy all these needs due to the enormity of the task on her, hence from time immemorial, youths have been assisting the elders in the development of their areas. Their participation is very essential and this further boosts national development. </p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>THE PEOPLE: </strong>Majority of the people that stay within Oredo Local Government area are from Edo (Bini), though there are people from other parts of the State being among the indigenes. The number of people residing there is relatively more compared to other local government due to development that has come to the place.</p> <p>The culture of the people is rich and unadulterated, which has its origin in Edo (Bini). It has its statutes, morals, beliefs and values, social, religious and political institution. There are also ancestral cults to which every person is born into; to deny them is to deny one’s birth right and citizenship. Their cultural values also affect their marriage, ceremonies, new yam festivals, burial ceremonies and their cultural dances.</p> <p>Their main occupation they practice is farming and palm wine tapping, crops grown there includes yam, groundnut, etc. Though there are many white-colar jobs due to development of the area but their main occupation is farming.</p> <p><strong>The Youth: </strong>The youth have a storage formation where they come together and talk on pressing issues concerning the community. They help in keeping the law of the land and try to influence the decision of the leaders through their reactions.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>This study is to investigate the various problems in Oredo Local Government and how the youth can be involved in the developmental process in their community. This study will also focus attention on how the result of the investigation could be applied to the problems on ground. An attempt would be made to identify the immediate and remote causes of the problem.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1.                 Do the members of the community appreciate youth efforts towards community development projects?</p> <p>2.                 What is level of youth involvement in community development project in Oredo Local Government Area?</p> <p>3.                 What is the level of awareness and consciousness of youths towards the improvement of their communities?</p> <p>4.                 Does land dispute stand as a militating force to youth participation in community development?</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>In this kind of study, there are bound to be argument for and against as to the qualification of youth’s participation in community development activities. To avoid being biased, hypotheses became necessary to be designed, tested and to serve as guidelines.</p> <p>The hypotheses to be tested in this study are as follows:</p> <p>1.                 That youth’s efforts in community development project are appreciated by other members of the community.</p> <p>2.                 That there is increasing rate of youth involvement in community development projects in Oredo Local Government Area.</p> <p>3.                 That the level of awareness and consciousness of youth towards the improvement of their communities has increased.</p> <p>4.                 That the major factor militating against youth participation is land dispute.</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The major purpose of this study is to consider the role of youths in the development of their rural and local communities.</p> <p>1.                 To analyze the various factors contributing to the effective mobilization of youths for participation in community development.</p> <p>2.                 To bring into light the efforts of the youths in bridging the gap of development between the rural communities and urban centres.</p> <p>3.                 To evaluate the different functions performed by the youths and community leaders in ensuring the successful execution of a project.</p> <p>4.                 To determine the extent of involvement of youths in community development.</p> <p>5.                 It is also the objective of this research work to find out how existing unity among the youth in our rural area can promote peace.</p> <p>6.                 The study will look into the activities of the youths in the development of their rural communities and to suggest ways of improvement.</p> <p>7.                 To access the contribution of the youth in terms of financial and social organization in uplifting the living standard of the people.</p> <p>8.                 To find out and suggest ways and means through which the government, social workers and other social agencies can be involved for effective development.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong><strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>For the purpose of proper understanding, this study shall have its main focus on the rural areas (communities) within the shores of Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.</p> <p><strong>1.7</strong><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The researcher believes that this study is of great importance. It will be of good use to know the degree of youth involvement in self help projects. This study will make people know that youth possess productive talent ability of which they need to be harnessed for the execution of community development projects.</p> <p>It is significant because most teachings and learning are carried out today by youths whose studies are focused on involvement in developmental process such as adult literacy programme to discipline, reading, writing among illiterates in the community.</p> <p>The result of this study is likely to provide useful data for exports in youth research.  </p> <p><strong>1.8</strong><strong>LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>There are many limitations encountered in the process of gathering the necessary information for this research work. Thus;</p> <p>a.                 Information was obtained through interviews during which some of the respondents felt reluctant to answer some questions relating to their activities in the area where they lived.</p> <p>b.                 There was inadequate finance to carry out most of the work expected to be done during the data collection.</p> <p>c.                  Another problem was time wasted where information were hardly retrieved.</p> <p>d.                 Time was yet another factor that posed a set back to information gathering for this research work, since it was done along side with normal school lectures, as a result, time was too short for comprehensive collection of data.</p> <p>e.                  Lack of sufficient literature highlighting youth activities in the area of rural development was another limitation.</p> <p><strong>1.9</strong><strong>OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>The researcher wishes to define the major concepts in this research work which include:</p> <p><strong>a.</strong><strong>Role: </strong>This is defined according to Oxford Advanced Learner’s English Dictionary as a prescribed functions or functions an individual is expected to do in any given situation; it could also mean the part played on a real life situation.</p> <p><strong>b.</strong><strong>Youth: </strong>Youth can be defined as young people who have stopped being children but are not yet fully accepted as adults. They are usually called youth because they are strong, young, dynamic and very active in the society.</p> <p>The rational youth policy defines youth as all those within the age range of fourteen and forty (14 – 40) years. By implication, anyone above forty years of age is not a youth and should not be regarded as such. It is assumed however that any person or persons within 14 – 40 years can contribute their quota to the development of their communities. Therefore any attempt by any organization or community to isolate them in the formation of their development association is bound to fail. So it is advisable to include youth in such organization in order to achieve success.</p> <p><strong>c.</strong><strong>Rural Development: </strong>The role of youth in rural development cannot be fully understood without the definition of the key words in the concept of rural development.</p> <p>Rural is defined as a local/community/village setting while development connotes the act or process of developing or being developed. The concept of rural development stems from the fact that most rural set up are under developed, hence it was designed to promote better living condition for the whole community especially the rural communities. Rural development has acquired so many definitions from individuals and different schools of thought (Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary of Current English, 2nd ed.).</p> <p>According to the United Nation (1966), the term community development is the process by which the efforts of the people themselves are united with those of government authorities to improve the economic, social and cultural condition of communities to integrate those communities into the life of the nation and to enable them to contribute fully to national progress. For the purpose of this study, community development is an organized communal effort designed to raise the standard of living of the inhabitants of a particular area, which may include physical and non-physical structures. It is also a way of accomplishing local betterment through willful cooperation and mutual understanding between the members of the community.</p>                                                          \n\nTHE ROLE OF YOUTHS IN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE ROLE OF YOUTHS IN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT", "id": 123}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The study investigated effects of insurgency on universal basic education in Borno state and other states in Nigeria. Basic education is the first level of education for children at primary 1 level to basic 9 which is the Junior Secondary School level in Nigeria. However, achieving education for all Nigeria children, Borno state need a secured teaching and learning environment. The study examined the effects of insurgence activities such as abduction of pupils and attacks on teachers in basic schools of Borno State. The sample for the study was 270 teachers of basic schools selected on the basis of 10 teachers from each of the 27 local government areas that constituted Borno State. The instrument for data collection was a 20 items questionnaire title: Effect of insurgency on Basic Education Questionnaire. Two research questions were formulated, data collection were converted to mean, standard deviation was used to answer the research questions. It was therefore recommended that the Nigeria government should provide free and compulsory education to all Borno State internally displaced children through provision of scholarship from basic school level to university, the government should show higher commitment to ensuring security in the states and schools.  </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>The nation Nigeria has witnessed brutal confrontation and massive assault from terrorist group which is undoubtedly the most blood-thirsty and destructive, both in terms of brutality mindless of the savagery and flagrant disobedience to the principles of peace and stability. Nigeria has witnessed insurgency from this terrorist group called Boko-Haram from 2009. They haveunleashed terror and fear in the minds of every Nigerian. There is massive destruction of government’s properties, burning of schools, bombing/burning of churches, mosques and other public places.</p> <p>Historically, Borno State, which was founded in 1971 initially comprised the present Borno State and Yobe State. Prior to the advent of insurgency, has been relatively peaceful, multicultural and dynamic state in Nigeria. The state is fortunate to have human and natural resources which has created many opportunities for its indigenes and other Nigerians to live in harmony. Borno State started experiencing the global trend of insurgency from 2009 (Adamu, 2014). Which led to the gruesome killings of innocent Nigerian citizens perpetrated by an insurgent group called Boko Haram (Adamu, 2014). Since 2009, they have disrupted educational system in Borno State with huge negative effects on basic education. The insurgent group dislikes children attending schools and also commit criminal offences ranging from kidnapping of school pupils and attacking teachers in schools (Adeyemi, 2014). There is major destruction of schools activities in the state. In the recent past, they used under aged girls to carry out suicide bombing of major shopping malls, cinema halls and bus terminals. Moreso, abduction of school children and the elderly were also common in their recent styles of mindless attacks.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Empathically, many basic schools in Borno State and other northern states had experienced several attacks from the insurgent group. Some basic schools especially in Baga towns in northern part of Borno State have been closed down for two (2) years (BSMOE, 2015). The problem could be traced down to when the Boko Haram group used religion to set up rules in the community unnoticed, advanced it with violence to the state level and metamorphous into an insurgent group and disturbed the peace of the state.</p> <p>Moreso, basic education in Borno state have been experiencing serious problem prior to the insurgence, there were shortage of classes for teaching and learning, shortage of instructional materials and teachers (NUT, 2007). This has indicated that basic school is underfunded by the state government, lack of payment of teachers’ salary which led to frequent strike by basic school teaches are also a concern to many families (NUT, 2008).

The researcher had the obligated responsibility of attending lectures and writing this project. Time was rather limited.</p> <p>Insufficient funding also posed difficulties in the course of this study as a self-sponsored student without financial assistance from friends and relatives.</p> <p>The study was also limited by lack of current literature in the polytechnic library. The researcher has to source vastly for information with which this study was carried out.</p> <p>Irrespective of these limitations, the researcher did his best to overcome these limiting factors, therefore, the reliability and authority of this research should not be underserved by its potential users.</p> <p><strong>1.9     Operational Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>In order to ensure clarity of terms and the understanding of the meaning of some important terms used in the study, the following operational definitions are given;</p> <p><strong>1.</strong><strong>Education:</strong> Education can be defined as a tool for building a united, independent, wealthy egalitarian society which is capable of maintaining the traditions and value (Adesina, Fegbongbe &amp; Talabi, 1983).      </p> <p><strong>2.</strong><strong>Basic Education: </strong>Basic education can be as the beginning of acquisition of desirable skill, knowledge and attitude in a formal school system.          </p> <p><strong>3.</strong><strong>Universal: </strong>Universal can be defined as the programme that is meant for all arms of the society such as the poor and the rich, the physically challenged and all the school dropouts people in Borno State.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong><strong>Insurgency:</strong> An insurgency is a rebellion against a constituted authority.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong><strong>insurgent:</strong> A person who rises in forcible opposition to lawful authority, especially a person who engages in armed resistance to a government or to the execution of its law.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong><strong>Boko Haram:</strong> The term “Boko Haram” come from the Hausa word book meaning “western education” and the Arabic word Haram figuratively meaning sin (literally “forbidden”). The name loosely translated from Hausa means Western Education is Forbidden.</p> <p><strong>7.</strong><strong>School: </strong>A school can be defined as an institution for the instructions of children or people under college age.</p>                                                           \n\nTHE EFFECT OF INSURGENCY ON BASIC EDUCATION IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF INSURGENCY ON BASIC EDUCATION IN NIGERIA", "id": 124}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The study investigated the level of knowledge of sex education among in-school adolescents in Benin City looking at the influences which gender, class level and school-type whether single sex school or mixed sex school has on the level of knowledge of sex education. Cross sectional survey research design was adopted to study 120 students who were selected to represent the population which comprise all in- school adolescents in Benin City. A self-developed questionnaire was used to collect data from 120 student of which 58 were males while 62 were females. The data was analyzed using percentages and frequency count and also modified Okafor’s (1997) criteria for describing level of knowledge of sex education was adopted. The conclusion of the study is that the level of knowledge of sex education among in-school adolescents in Benin City was high, with gender and school type whether single or mixed school having no influence on the level of knowledge of sex education, and with class level influencing significantly the level of knowledge of sex education.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The advancement witness in the world today in education, technology, communication, agriculture, population growth as well as in urbanization cannot be all round blessings as it has its own disadvantages. This confirms the popular saying that ‘‘whatever has an advantage has a disadvantage.’’ Such trend of advancement in areas like technology, transportation, trade, labour and capital mobility, global media and financial system among others according to Tejvan (2013) are factors which have caused globalization.</p> <p>One dimension of globalization argued by Steger (2009) is cultural globalization which according to Wikipedia refers to the transmission of ideas, meanings and values around the world in such a way as to extend and intensify social relations. In other words, cultural globalization brings about cultural integration and interdependence which implies that no nation can be indifferent to any other. For us here in Nigeria this is crystal clear as it can be seen in our dressing, greeting, language as well as its negative effects such as decline in religious scruples and the deterioration of moral standards which has led to a state that can best be describe as cultural disintegration.</p> <p>Few decades ago, virginity of a girl until she is married was rewarded and various taboos were created around premarital sex. This trend has gradually changed as the incidence of adolescents and youth engaging in sexual intercourse is high and may constitute a problem (Isiugo-Abanihe, 1993). This behaviour as opined by Isiugo-Abanihe (1993) is prevalent among students of secondary schools and higher institutions of learning in Nigeria and may be due to various customs and observances as well as other factors such as family background, peer pressure, media influences, globalization, economic situations and education background of parents (Akinleye&amp;Oniogade,1998). This is not to say that our culture before the globalization movement was without shortcomings.</p> <p>Traditionally, adolescents in most of our culture were not given any information on sexual matters, with discussion of such issues being considered as taboo. Such instructions as were given were traditionally left to a child’s parents and often this was put aside until just before a child’s marriage. Most of the information adolescents have on sexual matters were obtained informally due to the above scenario from friends and media much of which are highly deficient especially during the period following puberty when curiosity of sexual matter is most acute. This curiosity becomes increasingly evident by the increasing incidence of teenage pregnancy, abortion and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among adolescents and youth. School desertion is one consequence of teenage pregnancy which according to Montenegro (2000) jeopardizes the education and training of the teenager which in turn perpetuates the cycle of poverty. This is perhaps why Lingram (2003) noted that adolescents are considered to be in a state of crisis.</p> <p>Most adolescents are at high risk in one or more self-destructive behaviour such as unsafe sex, experimentation in sex, failure or dropping out of school due to teenage pregnancy and childbearing. Some of the behaviour according to Igbokwe (2012) could be sometimes attributed to lack of basic education concerning sex and sexuality thereby making the knowledge of sex education imperative.</p> <p>Although formal sex education have been introduced by many countries to be taught as a full course as part of the curriculum in secondary schools as efforts to ameliorate problems associated with sexuality, it is partially taught as only one unit within a more comprehensive school subject such as Biology, Home economics, Health science or Physical and health education in Nigeria. This to a large extent has an impact on the sexuality knowledge of in-school adolescents.</p> <p>Sex education is very important to adolescents and our secondary schools is the place where young boys and girls are trained both in character and in learning (Herman, 1999) but suffice is to say that sex, abortion, teenage pregnancy and other juvenile delinquency have made the above objective unrealistic considering the likelihood that adolescents in secondary schools in Benin City may not be an exception.</p> <p>It is against this background that it becomes important to ascertain the knowledge of in-school adolescents in Benin City.</p> <p><strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>          The problem associated with lack of inadequate knowledge on sex and sexuality matters are enormous which are evidently obvious in the incidence of teenage pregnancy, abortion among adolescents, sexually transmitted infection (STIs), school desertion caused by unwanted pregnancy, poverty perpetuation due to jeopardy of education which results from pregnancy, child abuse and neglect, child battering, child mortality and maternal deprivation frequent among offspring of teenage parents among others.</p> <p>          Some if not all of the above problems to some extent is caused by the lack of skill to negotiate safe sexual practices since the involvement of adolescents both boys and girls in sexual relationship is no longer new and this perhaps why Owie (2005) stated that the issue of boy and girl relationship such as dating, courting and choice of future partners should be critically addressed.</p> <p><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>          The purpose of this study is to ascertain the level of sex education knowledge of the in-school adolescents In Benin City with the following objectives:</p> <p>1.     To ascertain the level of sex education knowledge among in-school adolescents in Benin City.</p> <p>2.     To ascertain if gender have an influence in the level of sex education knowledge.</p> <p>3.     To ascertain if class-in-school have an influence in the level of sex education knowledge.</p> <p>4.     To ascertain in school-type whether single sex school or mixed sex school have an influence in the level of sex education knowledge.</p> <p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study will benefit the following</p> <p>1.     Health education intervention planners since the level of sex education knowledge when ascertained will serve as a starting point for a comprehensive sex education.</p> <p>2.     Curriculum planners in the inclusion of sex education in the curriculum and the level of embassy that will be given to it.</p> <p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In the bid to accomplish the stated objectives of the study, the following research questions is posed</p> <p>1.     What is the level of sex education knowledge among in-school adolescents in Benin City?</p> <p>2.     What is the influence of gender on the level of sex education knowledge among in-school adolescents in Benin City?</p> <p>3.     What is the influence of class-in-school on the level of sex education knowledge among in-school adolescents in Benin City?</p> <p>4.     What is the influence of school-type on the level of sex education knowledge among in-school adolescents in Benin City?</p> <p><strong>DELIMITATION</strong></p> <p>Due to the lack of time and resources, the study is delimited to selected secondary schools, located in Oredo local government area in Benin City, Edo state, Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>LIMITATION</strong></p> <p>Lack of time and finance is a major limitation as this prevents the researcher from reaching the defined population.

class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION:    </strong>Contraceptives are drugs or device used to prevent a woman from being pregnant and also used to protect men and women from sexually transmitted diseases.  How can this be driven home is truth to our adolescences, utilized to reduce our teaming population and to reduce the diseases that are sexually transmitted.  The project was done in March – July 2010.</p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong>  To assess the knowledge and improve the practice of this knowledge in our teaming adolescent population bearing in mind that a good beginning will eventually grow to a good end.</p> <p><strong>METHODOLOGY:</strong>  A descriptive cross-sectional study was done using quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection.  Though sample size was calculated for a finite population, the total population of student respondents was used for the study.  Data collection was by use of a seria structured questionnaire and an observational check list.</p> <p><strong>RESULTS:</strong>  The mean age of the student  respondents was 25 + 5 years.  All the respondents are male adolescent students.  The knowledge of contraception in this group was 86.1% as against those who had as knowledge of 13.9%; the practice of contraceptive use has 77% while abstinence ws 6.6% and withdrawal 5.5% respectively.  The subject of study of the students did not influence the knowledge and practice of contraception so also is their year of study.  The mass media and peer group were found to be their main sources of information that contraceptives and their parents’ being alive or dead did not also influence their practice.</p> <p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong>  the students who had good knowledge of contraception affirmed that they will continue to practice it.  The cultural values of students did not influence their practice of male contraception.  The mass media a veritable means of communication should be effectively used to cover both urban and rural areas in order to stimulate more adolescent to the use of male contraception.</p> <p>            Parents, teachers, health practitioners should do more to give adolescents such advice to help in their proactive ability and the need to adequate control of sexuality related activities.</p> <p><strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>            The Oxford Advanced Learners’ Dictionary of Current English defines “Contraceptives as a drug, device of practice used to prevent a woman becoming pregnant.”1 This definition though well embracing but does not include its utilization as a preventive measure against the spread of sexually transmitted diseases; such as AIDS/HIV.  The act of contraception has been an old practice even from our forefathers who designed the timing of mating with their wives or not depending on whether they want to make babies.  They have a mental picture of when the monthly menstrual flow of their wives takes place or how long their wives have to breast feed their babies to avoid unwanted pregnancies.  Some traditional women even go through the extra-mile of wearing contraceptive bands on their waist to prevent unwanted pregnancies.</p> <p>            Each year, women around the world experience 75 million unwanted pregnancies.  Unwanted pregnancy can occur for two main reasons; either the couple was not using contraceptives, or the method they were using failed.  There are many reasons why people do not use contraceptives to prevent unwanted pregnancy, including lack of access to family planning information and services; incest or rape; personal or religious beliefs; inadequate knowledge about the risks of pregnancy following unprotected sexual relations; and women’s limited decision-making ability with regard to sexual relations and contraceptive use.2 Many women are deprived of family planning services.</p> <p>            The use of contraceptives by both males and females has been accepted and widely practiced in the developed world.  This has not been the case in the developing world where the male chauvinistic cultural belief that women should protect themselves from unwanted pregnancies; instead of the men also making it possible to use contraceptives.  The act of child bearing is the combined effort of both males and females, but in the developing world; it is seen as a primary function of the female gender.  This is the reason why the usage of contraceptives among men in these areas has not been encouraged as the female contraceptives. The patriarchal nature of the African society does not seem to help or encourage male contraception rather it makes men to believe that they do not have any role to play in reproductive health.</p> <p>            In the developed world, the populace has overgrown the persistent myths and negative attitude of men towards contraception.  However, the fact that male contraception in the underdeveloped countries has not been encouraged has led to the paucity of information about it and also reduced the quest for knowledge in this area.  Studies show that men want access to better contraceptives.  In a recent study of British men, 80% placed a hypothetical male pill as one of their top three contraceptive choices (Brooks, 1988)3.  Another study found that over 60% of men in Germany, Spain, Brazil and Mexico were willing to use a new method of male contraception (Heinemaan, 2006).4  In another study on “why Nigeria adolescent seek abortion rather than contraception:  Evidence from focus group discussions” where youths were asked about contraceptive availability, perceived advantages of method used, side effects and young people’s reasons for using or not using contraceptives?  It was found that the fear of future infertility was an overriding factor in adolescent decisions to rely on induced abortion rather than contraception.5</p> <p><strong>Methods of Contraception</strong> -  are more in the female gender than the male.</p> <p>            Those of the female include:</p> <p><strong>The Combined Pill:</strong>  These are oral contraceptives which are eniphasic and biphasic pills, Everyday /Ed pills.  They are 99% effective when properly taken.  They contain two hormones – estrogen and progistogen, and acts by preventing ovulation when taken regularly.</p> <p><strong>Mini Pill:</strong>  Progestogen pill only.  Its 98% effective when taken properly and regularly any day at the same time.  It causes changes in the womb which makes it difficult for the sperm to enter the womb.</p> <p><strong>Injectable Contraceptives:</strong>  They include Depo-provera and Noristerat.  Its effective to 99% of cases.  It also stops ovulation by acting in a similar way to the mini pill.  It provides protection for up to 3 months longer.  It may cause irregularity in her periods and break through bleeding.</p> <p><strong>Intra Uterine Device:</strong>  Its 96 – 99% effective.  It’s a plastic device or with copper inserted into the womb by the doctor and it prevents the ovum or egg from settling in the womb.</p> <p><strong>Diaphragm or Cap:</strong>  Its 85-97% effective with careful use.  It is a soft rubber device put into the vagina before intercourse, to cover the cervix, and form a barrier which prevents sperm from meeting the egg.  It must be used with a spermicide and left in place for six hours after intercourse.</p> <p><strong>Sponge:</strong>  It is 75 – 91% effective, with careful use.  It’s a soft circular polyenthrane foam sponge, put into the vagina up to 24 hours before intercourse, to cover the cervix.  It already contains a spermicide.</p> <p><strong>Female Sterilization:</strong>  It’s a permanent method of birth control in which the fallopian tubes are closed so that the egg cannot travel down than to meet the sperm.  Its effective for life but has occasional failure rate of 1:300 where the tube rejion and fertility returns.</p> <p><strong>Natural Methods</strong> (‘Safe Period’ ‘Rhythm method’).  Its 85 – 95% effective.  It aims to predict ovulation when the woman is most fertile intercourse is avoided at this time.  This symptom-thermal method requires daily recording of body temperature, noting changes in vaginal nuclear and other signs of ovulation.</p> <p><strong>The male contraceptive measures include:</strong></p> <p>a.                   <strong>Condom:</strong>  It is effective in 85 – 98% of cases with careful use.  Its made up of a thin rubber and worn on an erect penis.  It prevents sperm from entering the woman.  It protects both partners against sexually transmitted diseases and also protects the woman against cancer of the cervix.</p> <p>b.                  <strong>Male Sterilization (Vasectomy):</strong>  It’s a permanent method which involves the cutting or blocking of the tubes that carry sperm from the testes (vas deferens) to the penis.  It is a permanent method of contraception like the tubal ligation in females.  Another method of contraception needs to be used for about 3 months after vasectomy so as to clear the whole sperm from the tube.  Occasional failure of this method occurs in 1:100 cases.</p> <p>c.                   <strong>Withdrawal Method: </strong> This method is usually not effective but its practiced by some own. They withdraw the penis before ejaculation takes place during orgasm.  Its not effective because it does not take care of sperm which are passed into the vagina before orgasm takes place.</p> <p><strong>Emergency Contraception:</strong>  This is method of preventing pregnancy after having unprotected sexual intercourse or if you had a contraceptive accident or misuse (such as condom breakage, failed coitus interruptus) and in case of rape.  There are two common methods which can be used in emergency contraception:</p> <p>a.                   Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs)</p> <p>b.                  Copper intra-uterine device (IUDs).</p> <p>These two methods must be used within few days of unprotected sexual intercourse.  They are safe for most women.  The ECPs contain the same hormones used in family planning pills but are used differently.  They either stop the release of the egg or prevent fertilization of an egg.  The IUDs immobilize sperms, slow down sperm movement, prevent fertilization of the egg and cause changes in the uterine lining which prevent pregnancy.</p> <p>1.2       <strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong></p> <p>            It is true that sexual education in most of our homes are poor, with the belief that being sexually educated will make the student to be promiscuous or to test what they have learnt.  But we all know that our society have overgrown such belief, and they will always have coitus, whether they are educated or not. They will always be influenced by their peer groups and those who are not yet exposed will learn the act in a negative way.  This being the case, the onus now rests on adults to educate the teenage or early adult group on what the reproductive organs stand for, the usage of contraceptives to reduce the incidence of unwanted pregnancies or even infections in the reproductive system.</p> <p>            The need for this study is to stimulate parents and school authorities to educate our younger generations to be well equipped with the knowledge of family planning.  Failure of this taking place will lead to an increase in the number of unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases and undue population rise in the society.</p> <p>1.3       <strong>JUSTIFICATION FOR THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>            Over the years, especially in Africa, the need for contraception and control of population using female methods of the pill, injectables etc have been adapted.  Before now only the condom and withdrawal method has been used by men.</p> <p>            The increasing need for male contraception cannot be over-emphasized as humans are more aware of the fact that, there need to be a greater co-operation between spouses for family and reproductive health to grow and blossom; with greater understanding that everyone involved will contribute their quota to the success of the family.</p> <p>            To this extent therefore, there is the dire need for the study of this nature to identify the contraceptive devices possibly of use now, the knowledge of their use, how well adolescent comply with their use, in order to educate them so that they could have a good beginning in their understanding of choosing when to have children and when not to.  This is done with the wisdom that a good beginning when well nurtured will bring about a good end.</p> <p>            This study will give us an overview of the perception or knowledge, the usage or practice of contraception among these adolescent which will again enable us to educate them on what good practice of family or reproductive health should be.  This will translate into a better moral upbringing of the society around us.</p> <p><strong>On-Going Research: </strong>            There are many ongoing research projects into different methods of male contraception.  Researchers are optimistic that a safe, effective method of male contraceptive will eventually become a reality, although this is still several years away.6</p> <p>            The two main areas of research into male contraception include:</p> <p>a.                   <strong>Hormonal Contraception</strong> – where synthetic hormones are used to temporarily stop the development of healthy sperm.</p> <p>b.                  <strong>Non</strong>-<strong>Hormonal Methods</strong> – where other techniques are used to stop healthy sperm from entering a women’s vagina.</p> <p>1.4       <strong>GENERAL OBJECTIVE</strong></p> <p>            The objective of this study was to determine the level of awareness of male on contraceptive measures with a view to improving this knowledge and increasing their compliance to the usage.  This will help us in educating them on how to prevent early pregnancies and its negative effects and or infections to their young reproductive organs which may lead to secondary infertility in later life.</p> <p>1.5       <strong>SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE</strong></p> <p>1.         To assess the knowledge of male students of Federal College of Education Technical Asaba on male contraception.</p> <p>2.         To determine the practice of male contraception among the students.</p> <p>3.         To assess the factors that influence the use of these contraceptives in this age group of students.</p>                                                           \n\nTHE KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE OF CONTRACEPTION AMONG MALE

Traditionally, the marital relationship includes economic independence, common residence, sexual fidelity and shared responsibility for children. Although, the institution of marriage remains popular, it sometimes seems to be under assault from shifting social trends. This assault has promoted some experts, for example, Chartin (1981) and Gleen and Wearer (1988) to ask whether the institution of marriage is in trouble.</p> <p>It in any case, appears that marriage will whither the storm. But it is worth looking at some of the social trends that are shaking one traditional and modern model of marriages.</p> <p>According to Jones (1994) a great variety of motivational factors propel people into marriage. The most among them is the desire to participate in a socially sanctioned, mutually rewarding, intimate relationship. Among the key factors is the social pressure exorted on people to marry and the socio-economic independence which make marriage to work well. Getting marriage is still the norm in our society. Our parents, relatives and friends expect their loved ones to marry eventually, and they often make this abundantly clear with their comments and inquires. (Anorne 1994).</p> <p>As Onyeji (1999) puts it, the popular view in the Nigerian culture is that people marry because they have fallen in love. Although, partially accurate, this view, is terribly oversimplified. A multitude of motivational factors are involved in the decision to marry and stay married. They key factors in marital stability are: increased acceptance of cohabitation, good family background, adequate communication, absence of inlaws’ interruption, having the same religion, maintaining the same account, fidelity or sincerity, integrity, lack of suspicion and above all, high socio-economic status.</p> <p>Neither financial stability nor wealth can ensure marital stability or satisfaction (Komarorsky 1997).</p> <p>Komarorsky went on to postulate that without money, families live in constant dread of financial drains such as illness layoffs, or broken appliances. Husbands tend to view themselves as poor providers, and their self-esteem may crumble as a result. This problem is sometimes aggravated by disappointed wives, who criticize their husbands for their inability to provide for the family.</p> <p>According to Amaonye (1998), spontaneity in communication may be impaired by an understandable reluctance to talk about financial concerns. Thus, it is clear that poverty produces significant stress for married couples. Given this reality, it is important that prospective partners be realistic about their ability to finance a viable future.</p> <p>Moreover, when financial resources are plentiful, money can be a source of marital strain (Adeleke, 1991).</p> <p>According to Adeleke (1991), quarrels about how to spend money are common and potentially damaging at all income levels. Pattman and Llyod (1998), for instance, found that perceived financial stress, regardless of a family’s actual income was associated with decreased marital satisfaction.</p> <p>Furthermore, another study carried out by Martins and Martins (1996), examined how happily couples handled their money in comparison to couples that eventually divorced. In comparison to the divorced couples, the happy couples engaged in more joint decision making on finances. Thus, the best way to avoid trouble and some battles over money is probably to engage in extensive planning of expenditure together (Buss, 1986).</p> <p>Again, Ochemba (1999) opines that money is very important for the stability of many families. According to him, without money, there may not be marital bliss and love which are the core ingredients couples need to stay together as one indivisible entity. In a research carried out by Ochefu (1992), it was found that in the high socio-economic status families, there tend to be happiness, love and affection than in the low or poor socio-economic homes. Eraser (1983) asserts that in the high socio-economic status homes, parents stay together in love, children are provided with their needs and there tend to be high level of mutual understanding. Whereas, in the poor homes, parents constantly fight each other because the husband could not provide for the family or the children’s school fee’s cannot be paid as at when due.</p> <p>Also, Anyanwu (1980) is of the opinion that in a family where there is poverty and lack, there tends to be unfaithfulness, disrespect, fighting, quarrelling and these can lead couples to break up their marriages or they may live like cat and mouse in the same house. The problem of socio-economic status of couples and its effects on their marital stability is what prompted this researcher to embark on this work.</p> <p>Issues of mutual concerns have to be talked about freely and without any inhibition. Efforts should be made to talk over difficulties and work out acceptable-solutions. Expressions of feelings and readiness to tell the marriage partner what you expect him or her to do are necessary before behaviours can be modified to suit a given situation (Ayodele, 1990).</p> <p>If the parent is emotionally involved in a matter to the extent of being furious or enraged! the other partner should watch the time when the situation is less tense before replying. For example! if the husband loses his temper (which he should try not to lose) and says that the wife was stupid the way she acted. Though the wife is hurt by her husband's utterance! she should not call her husband. She should wait till an appropriate time when the husband is sufficiently calm before she calls her husband's attention to his rude remarks about her action! and how she was really hurt by his utterance. She could even tell her husband that she should be treated with courtesy and respect because she holds the husband in high esteem. A reasonable husband is likely to apologise and beg his wife to forget and forgive. If the wife also loses her temper (which she should try not to lose) the husband can call her to order when the charged atmosphere is over.</p> <p>The attitudes of the husband and wife to sex may be influenced by their religious upbringing and early experiences. A partner may regard sex as something pleasurable to be enjoyed while the other sees it as being unpleasant and should not be indulged in except for procreation. The ability of the couple to establish adequate sexual relationship and satisfaction matters very much in marriage stability. Husband and wife need to adjust to sexual behaviour of each other. Normally! a man experiences sexual urges more than his wife. The man should be considerable enough regarding the frequency of the sexual intercourse he demands from his wife. His request for sex should not be detrimental to his wife’s comfort. The wife also should corporate with her husband about his need for sex. Sexual intercourse is best enjoyed enjoyed by a couple if both of them react positively and cooperatively. A frigid wife with her cold attitude to sex will deprive her husband of the full enjoyment of sexual interaction with her. To deprive a man of his right to have sexual intercourse with his wife without a legitimate reason is detrimental to marriage stability. All the mutual sexual satisfaction requires is adjustment to each other's demands.-­</p> <p>Biologically! a woman does not reach organism as quickly as her husband and the man may need to delay sexual intercourse until his wife is ready to enjoy it. The husband can wait form his wife by engaging her in pre-sex plays such as touching and kissing the erogenous zones to quicken her desire for sex. Understanding each other's level of sexual arousal! the sensitivity to gentle touches to genital organ and the length of orgasms are factors that lead up to and follow intercourse. Husband and wife need not regard sex as a dirty game or feel guilty after sexual intercourse. They should regard sex as something good in itself to further cement the love and affection between them (Durojaiye, 1996).</p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Socio-economic status of a family may determine the level of peace in a given home. For instance, when a family is in abject poverty, no money to send the children to school, no good nutrition for the children, the woman is not maintained and taken care of by the husband, there may be conflict in the home.</p> <p>In a poor home background, there are many untoward things that happen. For instance, there is likely to be infidelity, there is choas and there will be no love and affection in the home. And in any home where there is no love, no affection, no trust, no fidelity, the foundation of the marriage will collapse and crumble like a pack of cards.</p> <p>In many homes today, lack of money and other material things have caused couples to seek divorce in law courts. For example, a situation where a husband does not win bread any more, the family upkeep will be lacking. Situations where there is no money to maintain the wife, the children’s school fees are not paid as at when due; where house rents have piled up and the landlord has served a quit notice. In this particular case, there might not be money to pay up or seek for another cheaper accommodation somewhere else. There might even be cases of some creditors constantly visiting the home to seek for pay back. These stressful condition may cause loss of love and affection especially on the side of the woman. She may eventually resort to a divorce in a law court. This will definitely put the family and children in a bad condition.</p> <p>Furthermore, children from poor and low socio-economic homes tend to be malnurished and lack adequate health maintenance. A family that is poor, may not be happy due to the fact that it cannot meet up with certain obligation on the family. This may lead to separation, divorce or husband and wife living under a roof without mutual love and good relationship. Merely living a cat and mouse situation or kind of relationship will eventually jeopardize the marriage and children would eventually suffer for it. The above reasons gave rise to the examination of this study.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>Purpose of the study</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of the study is to find out the influence of socio-economic status on marital stability among selected couples in Mushin Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p>Specific objectives of the study include:</p> <p>1.            To ascertain whether socio-economic status of couples influence their marital stability.</p> <p>2.            To assess whether difference exists between the academic performance of students whose parents are living together and those whose parents are living separately.</p> <p>3.            To find out whether a significant difference exists between the attitudes of couples who live together and those who do not.</p> <p>4.            To observe whether significant relationship exists between stable homes and unstable homes.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>These research questions were be asked in this study:</p> <p>i.             Is there any significant influence of the socio-economic status on couples marital stability?</p> <p>ii.            Is there any significant difference between the academic performance of children whose parents are living together and those whose parents are separated?</p> <p>iii.           Will there be any significant differences between the attitude of couples who live together and those who live separately?</p> <p>iv.          Will there be any relationship between the attitude of children in stable and unstable homes?</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The following research hypotheses were formulated for testing in this study:</p> <p>1.            There will be no significant influence of the socio-economic status of couples on marital stability.</p> <p>2.            There will be no significant difference between the attitude of couples who come from high socio-economic homes and those who come from the low socio-economic homes.</p> <p>3.            There will be no significant difference between the attitude of children who come from high socio-economic homes and those who come from low socio-economic homes.</p> <p>4.            There will be no significant difference between the academic performance of children who come from poor socio-economic background and those from wealthy families.</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study will be beneficial in the following ways or areas:</p> <p>1.            <strong>Couples:</strong> The findings and recommendation of this study will be of great benefit for couples; both the already married ones and those intending to marry.

During the initial infection a person may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. This is typically followed by a prolonged period without symptoms. As the illness progresses, it interferes more and more with the immune system, making people much more likely to get infections, including opportunistic infections, andtumours that do not usually affect people with working immune systems.</p> <p>HIV is transmitted primarily through unprotected sexual intercourse, contaminated blood transfusions, infected syringe and instrument and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Prevention of HIV infection, primarily through safe sex and needle-exchange, is a key strategy to control the spread of the disease.</p> <p>There is no cure for HIV/AIDS; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. While antiretroviral treatment reduces the risk of death and complications from the disease, these medications are expensive and may be associated with side effects.</p> <p>HIV originated in west-central Africa during the early twentieth century. It was first recognized by the centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1981 and its cause HIV infection was identified in the early part of the decade. Since its discovery, AIDS has caused nearly 30 million deaths (2009). As of 2010; approximately 34 million people have contracted HIV globally. AIDS is considered a pandemic, a disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading.</p> <p>The high incidence of HIV/AIDS in sub-Sahara Africa has been widely documented (Taylor, 2003). There are more than 40 million people afflicted with HIV/AIDS worldwide, 30 million are estimated to live in this region of Africa (UNAIDS, 2003). This represents about 70 percent of the global disease burden even though this region of Africa only accounts for about 10 percent of the global population (Eaton et. al, 2002). The most afflicted sub-Saharan African nations include Botswana, Cote d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia (White, 2003).</p> <p>The unique challenges in combating the continuing spread of the disease in the region of Africa have been discussed by various groups and individuals (UNAIDS/UNICEF/WHO, 2002; Piot, 2000; Butler, 2000; Eaton, 2002).</p> <p>HIV/AIDS has had a great impact on society, both as an illness and as a source ofdiscrimination. The disease also has significant economic impacts. There are manymisconceptions about HIV/AIDS such as the belief that it can be transmitted by casual non-sexual contact. The disease has also become subject to many controversies involving religion.</p> <p>Nigeria has the third highest population of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Despite this, the knowledge of HIV/AIDS and uptake of voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) is still low, especially in the rural areas.</p> <p>It is also widely documented that half of all new infections with HIV/AIDS now occur in young people under the age of 25. While the spread of the virus may be slowing among other members of the global community, increases in incidence of the disease appear to be the norm among youth all over the world (Morris, 2003).</p> <p>There are more than six billion people in the world today; one billion are between the ages of 15-24. Half of the population of sub-Saharan Africa is under 18 years of age. One third of those living with HIV/AIDS in the region are between the ages of 15-24 (UNAIDS, 2002). Unless there is global commitment to decreasing the incidence of this contagion in this region of the world, Africa may remain the reservoir for HIV/AIDS transmission in the foreseeable future.</p> <p>A dearth of knowledge about HIV/AIDS etiology among young people globally, constitutes a major challenge to the control of this scourge. Most people become sexually active in adolescence. The need to admit that young people are having sex but lack the proper knowledge to protect them is particularly important in the war against HIV/AIDS. Young people are now the epicenter and bear a disproportionate burden of this pandemic (WHO/UNICEF/UNAIDS, 2002).</p> <p>Surveys continue to indicate that young people between 15 and 24 years harbor serious misconceptions about HIV and how it is transmitted (Cohall, et.al,2001).</p> <p>It is believed that the only way to stop the pandemic without vaccine is through public education on the prevention strategies against HIV/AIDS. Much of this responsibility is borne by the health professions (Mungherera et. al, 1997). The strategy involves dissemination of information to individuals and communities on disease and injury prevention (Caldron, 1997).</p> <p>Knowledge has been defined as the capacity to acquire, retain and use information (Bacdran,1995). Furthermore knowledge means facts, information, skills and understanding that have been gained especially through learning and experience.</p> <p>As the pandemic is now in the third decade since it was first identified and is showing no sign of relenting (Mbaya et. al, 2001), it is important for health care workers to be well equipped with current facts, information, treatment options and knowledge of resources available. With the fear of contracting HIV/AIDS in the work place, there could be a tendency among like other health care workers to be afraid of the infection and diseases associated with HIV/AIDS. It is therefore important to assess the knowledge, belief and attitude, in our locality towards HIV/AIDS.</p> <p>There have been previous studies which evaluated the knowledge and attitude of health care workers towards HIV/AIDS. Wu et.al, (1999) studied knowledge of HIV/AIDS in China while All and Fried (1997) evaluated the anxiety of health care rehabilitation workers in United States of America. Pilyugina et.al, (2000) in their study reported that 48% of health care workers rated their knowledge of HIV/AIDS moderate while 89% of the respondents requested for further training. Kit aura et.al, (1997) reported 80% average knowledge among dental care workers in Japan. A study in United States ofAmerica reported that radiographers support the disclosure of HIV/AIDS result to the patient and mandatory testing for certain group of patients considered to be at risk of infection by the virus. The result also showed that radiographers with more exposure to HIV/AIDS patients were more toleranttowards the issue (Adams, 1990).</p> <p>The attitude of the general public towards people living with HIV/AIDS is mostly negative (Williamsand Kennedy, (1989); Okoli and King, (1993). People are perceived to be reluctant in attend to HIV/AIDS patients who require their services for fear of being infected with the virus. The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge, belief and attitude HIV/AIDS among secondary school adolescent in Arigbajo community area.</p> <p><strong>1.2    Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of this work was to examine and seek knowlegde, belief, and attitude towards HIV/AIDS among secondary school adolescents in Arigbajo community to the understanding of HIV/AIDS.</p> <p><strong>1.3    Significant of the Study</strong></p> <p>§  The result of this study may contribute to the body of knowledge, belief, and attitude towards HIV/AIDS among secondary school adolescents.</p> <p>§  This study may be useful to parents, guidance, students, Government, Policy maker andNGO’S.</p> <p>§  It may also serve as a means of increasing their knowledge, belief and attitude towards HIV/AIDS.</p> <p>§  It may equally provide the readers with in-depth and current trend in the world of HIV/AIDS.</p> <p><strong>1.4    Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>It has been observed by the researcher over the years that HIV is transmitted primarily through unprotected sex, contaminated blood transfusions, infected syringe and instrument and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears do not transmit HIV, the year 2000 centennial report revealed that Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome HIV/AIDS infection is more susceptible among the adolescents and youths between the ages of 15 and 24 who are sexually active which is the normal age range for students, as a result of dearth of knowledge about HIV/AIDS etiology among young people globally, the problem under investigation by this study therefore is to determine the knowledge, belief and attitude towards HIV/AIDS among secondary school adolescents.</p> <p><strong>1.5    Research Question</strong></p> <p>1.     Does awareness of HIV/AIDS increase the knowledge, belief and attitude towards HIV/AIDS?</p> <p>2.     What are the impacts of parent in educating adolescents towards HIV/AIDS?</p> <p>3.     Does sex education make any significant difference in prevention of HIV/AIDS?</p> <p><strong>1.6    Research hypotheses</strong></p> <p>1.    Awareness of HIV/AIDS does not make significant difference in knowledge, belief, and attitude towards HIV/AIDS.</p> <p>2.     Parent does not make any impact in educating adolescents towards HIV/AIDS.</p> <p>3.     Sex education does not make any significant difference in prevention of HIV/AIDS?</p> <p><strong>1.7    Delimitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study is delimited to knowledge, belief and attitude towards HIV/AIDS among secondary school adolescents in Arigbajo community, Ifo local Government area of ogun state.</p> <p><strong>1.8    Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>This research work is limited to knowledge, belief and attitude towards HIV/AIDS among secondary school adolescents in Arigbajo community, Ifo Local Government Area of Ogun state.</p> <p><strong>1.9    Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p><strong>AIDS:</strong>         Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is an infectious disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

The child is conceived at home and born at home, so the home is its first port of call (Odunukwe, 2008). The child moves from the home to the community and then to the society at large. According to Ikulayo (2003) the home is the first social contact in any human groupings and it is seen by sociologists as the microcosm (or a replica) of a society.</p> <p>At home, the interaction among various variables goes a long way in determining the type of behavior children are likely to exhibit (Olayinka, 1995, Omoegun 1995 and Dowell, 1996). These various variables of the home as enumerated by Odunukwe (2008) are type of parents, home atmosphere, socio-economic status of the parents, family size, birth order, relationship with other sibling and social cultural setting in which a child is born. All these affect the child as he is growing and even up to his working life.</p> <p>Ikejiaku (2006) is of the opinion that the type of behaviour an indivdial develops is reflected in the kind of upbringing he receives Ijeoma in Odunukwe (2008) believes that sound personality development is achieved through healthy child rearing practices in the home. According to this author, a child inherits some behavioural traits from his parents and that good home gives the child a sense of security, love and mutual respect among others and allows the chil to think ahead for a fruitful future. A child who enjoys no love from the home is bound to develop several behavioural problems such as hatred for others in later life.</p> <p>Oladele (1989) in Ikejiaku 2006) summarizes the influence of various home variables on mal-adaptive behaviour of children as follows:</p> <p>1.   The rejecting home promotes submissiveness feelings of insecurity, nervousness and non- compliance.</p> <p>2.   The overprotecting home promotes infantile and with drawal reactions, submissiveness, feelings of insecurity, jealousy and nervousness.</p> <p>3.   Dominating parents have dependable, shy, submissive, polities, self-conscious children.</p> <p>4.   Submissive parents have aggressive, careless, disobedient, independent and self-confident children.</p> <p>5.   Disharmonious homes promotes aggressive, neurotic, jealous, delinquent, unco-operative children.</p> <p>6.   Harmonious homes promote co-operation, good adjustments, superior achievement and independence.</p> <p>7.   Defecting home promotes poorly adjusted, aggressive, jealous, diligent and neurotic children.</p> <p>Since the home is the first port of call, the child’s social world and relationship begin with the family and then widened as the child grows older. So, the type of behaviour and attitudes of parents and other home variables affect to a large extent the child’s behavioural development.</p> <p>Based on the picture presented above, the researcher therefore examined the various home variables such as socio-economic status of parents, birth-order, family size and child-rearing approach and how they influence maladjusted behaviour among adolescents in Isolo Local Government Area of Lagos. State.</p> <p><strong>1.2   THEORETICAL BACKGROUND</strong></p> <p>Seven models have been used to explain the cause of maladaptive, maladjusted behaviour. These models are:</p> <p>1.   Cognitive model</p> <p>2.   Medical model</p> <p>3.   Humanistic model</p> <p>4.   Behavioural model</p> <p>5.   Psycho-analytic model</p> <p>6.   Socio-cultural model</p> <p>7.   Eclectic model</p> <p><strong>1.2.1 COGNITIVE MODEL    </strong></p> <p>Cognitive perspective- “the school of psychology” that examines internal mental processes such as creativity, perception, thinking problem solving, memory and language; cognitive psychologists are interested in how a person understands, diagnosis and solves a problem, concerning themselves with the mental processes that mediate between stimulus and response. This view of maladaptive or maladjusted behaviour focuses on the mental process. The model postulates that thoughts and beliefs of the individual is central to the maladjusted behaviour he/she manifests. Among the leading scholars in this field is Gestalt.</p> <p><strong>1.2.2MEDICAL MODEL  </strong></p> <p>This model suggests that the root cause of maladjusted behaviour will be found in the physical examination of the individual, such as hormonal imbalance, chemical deficiency, brain injury, etc.</p> <p>According to this model, and individual is judged to be maladaptive if the person can be assigned to a psychiatric category of DSM-IV or ICD-IO. Because many types of maladaptive behaviour have been linked to biological causes, the medical model seems to be a reasonable approach, athough Brunner (1993) has however report that recent advances in our understanding of  the biological bases of behaviour have supported the importance of considering physiological causes in abnormal or maladjusted behaviour.</p> <p><strong>1.2.3 HUMANISTIC MODEL</strong></p> <p>The model of maladjusted behaviour focuses on the control and responsibility that people have for their own behaviour. It concentrates on what is uniquely human, viewing people as basically rational and motivated to get along with others. (Rogers, 1980). This model also views people as having an awareness of life and constantly searching for meaning and self-worth. It argues that, as long as people’s behaviours are not hurting to other and they do bot feel personal distress they should be free to choose the behaviours they engage in. however, the short fall of humanistic model lies in its reliance on unscientific, unverifiable information (Aldridge, 1989).</p> <p><strong>1.2.4 BEHAVIOURAL MODEL</strong></p> <p>This school believes that maladjustment behaviours are equally acquired just as we acquire normal behaviours. It also explains that when an individual has a maladjusted behaviour, it is the behaviour that is the problem not the person. They believe since such behaviour has been learned, they can also be unlearned.</p> <p>According to the school, the person exhibiting any maladjusted haviour is not sick. He can unlearn it through retraining or conditioning. Among the leading proponents of this view are B.F Skinner and J.B Watson.</p> <p><strong>1.2.5 PSYCHO-ANALYTIC MODEL</strong></p> <p>This perspective seems to strongly support this study. It explains that maladaptive behaviour is learned within a social context ranging from the family, to the community, to the culture. According to this model the individual’s behavoiur is said to be maladjusted if it does not conform to the established culture of a society. </p> <p><strong>1.2.7 ELECTIC MODEL</strong></p> <p>This model behaviour that maladaptive behaviour is not caused by a singular factor, rather than the interaction of various factors. Therefore, it proposes that maladjusted individuals can be helped combining at least two treatment models or techniques or even more.</p> <p><strong>1.3   STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS  </strong></p> <p>Adesua in Odunukwe (2008) lamented that the average Nigerian home is no more alive to its unique responsibilities. Many parents have ignorantly or unconsciously abandoned the training of their children in the pursuit of wealth (Olusakin and Ubungha, 1996).</p> <p>Apart from this, most home are the seat of violence, spousal abuse and problems. It is increasing becoming  difficult these days to come by home environment where all things work in good order for the child. In most cases, the reverse is the case.</p> <p>Coupled with these, is the ever increasing population of our society where the home is seen as the human manufacturing company. Thus, some homes are oversized, giving no adequate provision and security for her members.</p> <p>Closely related to that is the incidence of maladjusted adults the make up the home. For instance some of the parents are known for unhealthy behaviours such as smoking fighting, disruptive behvaiours, immorality, social deviance and disregard for law, to mention a few.</p> <p>Consequent upon these problem there is an alarming rate in the increase of maladjusted behaviour among our adolescents. Today, our school, churches/mosques, and society are dominated by maladjusted adolescents.</p> <p>Pringly in Ifeoma (1996) in the recent and related study discovered that prisons, mental homes, rehabilitation hospitals, remand homes constrain a high proportion of adolescents who from their homes lacked consistent continuous and concerned care. This according to Odunnukwe (2008) is disastrous to the individual and the society at large.</p> <p>Based on this, the study examined the influence of home variables on maladjusted behaviour among adolescences in Isolo Local Government Area of Lagos State.  </p> <p><strong>1.4 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY    </strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to ascertain the extent to which the have variables influence maladjusted behaviour of adolescents. The researcher limits this study to these variables: family or home type, child-reaining approach, family size, socio-economic status of parent and this study therefore examined the influence of:</p> <p>1.   Home type on maladjusted behaviour among adolescents in Isolo Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p>2.   Child-rearing approach on maladjusted behaviour among adolescents.</p> <p>3.   Family- size on maladjusted behaviour behaviour among adolescents.</p> <p>4.   Socio-economic status of parents on maladjusted behaviour among adolescents.</p> <p>5.   Family relationship  on maladjusted behaviour among adolescents in Isolo Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.5   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The questions guide the study</p> <p>1.   Is there any relationship between home type and maladjusted behaviour among adolescents in Isolo Local Government Area of Lagos State?</p> <p>2.   What will be the relationship between child-rearing approach and maladjusted behaviour among adolescents in Isolo Local Government Area of Lagos State?  </p> <p>3.   Does any relationship exist between family size and maladjusted behaviour?</p> <p>4.   Would there be a significant relationship between socio-economics status of parents and maladjusted behaviour among adolescent in Isolo Local Government Area of Lagos State?</p> <p>5.   Does family relationship coverlates with maladjusted behaviour among adolescent Local Area of Lagos State?.</p> <p><strong>1.6   RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>There hypotheses guided the study:</p> <p>1.   There will be no significant relationship between home type and maladjusted behaviour among adolescents in Isolo Lcoal government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p>2.   There will be no significant relationship between child-rearing approach and maladjusted behaviour among adolescents in Isolo Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p>3.   There will be no significant relationship between family size and maladjusted behaviour among adolescents from Isolo Local Government Aread of Lagos State.</p> <p>4.   Socio-economic status of parents will not be significantly correlated with maladjustment among adolescents in Isolo Local Government Area of Lagos State.    </p> <p>5.   Family relationship will not be significant correlated with maladjustment among adolescents in Isolo Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.7   SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The outcome fo this study will be of great benefit to the home, the school system, the teachers, the counselors and parents as well as the society at large.</p> <p>The study will highlight the role played by the home in the development of maladjusted behaviour among adolescents.

Research in this area has shown that this type of violence has touched the lives of many Nigerian couples. Although societal awareness and condemnation of the issue has increased in recent years. Domestic violence remain a hidden and persistent problem because of the power and control held by the abuser, the fear, intimidation and humiliation suffered by the victim of this crime.</p> <p>The oldest and most prevalent institution in the world today is the marriage institution. In all culture, there is a particular sanctity attached to this institution, so much that it is particularly considered to be a building block of any society.</p> <p>The pivotal position of marriage has made domestic violence a subject of interest to various disciplines, government, religious sects and professional associations.</p> <p>American Psychological Association (APA) (1996) defined domestic violence as a pattern of abusive behaviour including a wide range of physical, sexual, and psychological maltreatment used by a person in an intimate relationship against another to gain power unfairly or to maintain that person misuse of power, control and authority. If the abuse between intimate partners in which one person tries to control the other person through violence. Domestic violence is other wise called spousal abuse.</p> <p>The role of spouse in family relationship is significant, such that some people have acclaimed it to the power of surviving family adjustment. However, this role has its own problems. some spouses have been found to be abused in various forms, ranging from sexual to financial abuse and communicative abuse. All these have implication on family relationship.</p> <p>Domestic violence occurs in traditional heterosexual marriages, as well as in some sexual partnership. The abuse may occur during a relationship, while the couple is breakup, or after the relationship has ended. The key elements of domestic violence are: intimidation, humiliation and physical injury. Going by the definition of domestic violence couples engage in it to control the other partner and keep him/her from departing or quitting the relationship.</p> <p>A critical look at the definition of domestic violence will reveal that they assume the dimension of portraying women as the victims bearing the brunt, while men are seen perpetrators.</p> <p>This could be as a result of the widely held beliefs that women are the weaker sex while men are by right, the head of the family that must be obeyed.</p> <p>Nigeria as a country has her own fair share of domestic violence, which could be seen in the rate of divorce, separation and marital dishonesty in the country.</p> <p>According to Ajila (2000) in his study on wife beating in western Nigeria, it was found that 32% of women indicated that they have experienced abuse, 21% believe strongly that wives should be beaten while 72% believe that wives should be beaten once in a while.</p> <p>Bakare (1986) identified marital conflict to exist along a particular continuum which are:</p> <p>1.           Occasional verbal quarrels</p> <p>2.           Frequent verbal quarrels</p> <p>3.           Occasional physiological quarrel</p> <p>4.           Frequent physical quarrel</p> <p>5.           Psychological separation</p> <p>6.           Physical separation</p> <p>7.           Divorce</p> <p>A close look at this shows that a particular couple is expected to go through the whole stages, but it is not necessarily so in all situations. Some couples get to the divorce stage without going through physical quarrels and physical separation, while some resolve the conflict completely before it gets to divorce stage.</p> <p>Researchers indicated domestic violence, through prevalent in Nigeria is still largely under reported, if reported at all. The causes of domestic violence can be seen in two broad categories.</p> <p>The traditional causes are those factors that are commonly seen and discussed as leading to fighting among couples. They are immediate causes that can be pin pointed as leading to violence in the home. These include, among others, sex role, sexual dissatisfaction and infidelity, ego message, feeling of staying control, income petibility, religion conflict, alcohol consumption, money matters, childlessness, influence of inlaws etc.</p> <p>Secondly contemporary causes of domestic violence are those underlying remote factors that are not easily seen or implicated, yet they influence violence behaviour in marital relationship.</p> <p>Domestic violence has now become a common phenomenon. It should be noted here that as husbands abuse their wives so also wives abuse their husbands (Steinmetz, 1977). It is only the degree that varies.</p> <p>The question then is how well has domestic violence or abuse has been able to achieve its end going by the high rate of family discord, divorce, separation etc experienced today?</p> <p>Base on the above picture, the study is to determine the influence domestic violence on family relationship among couple in Oshodi Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>Theoretical Framework</strong></p> <p>Three theoretical models will be used to explain domestic violence and neglect in family relationships:</p> <p>1.           Resource Theory</p> <p>2.           The Patriarchy Theory</p> <p>3.           General System Theory</p> <p><strong>Resource Theory</strong></p> <p>The resource theory of family violence propounded by Goode (1971) assumes that all social systems (including the family) rest to some degree on force or the threat of force. The more resources – social, personal and economic a person can command, the more force that individual can muster. However, according to Goode (1971), the more resources a person actually has, the less that person will actually use force in an open manner. Thus, a husband who wants to be dominant person in the family, but has little education, has a job, low prestige and income, and lacks interpersonal skills may choose to use violence to maintain the dominant position.</p> <p>According to Nadin (1998) employed women are less depended on abusive partners and better able to extricate themselves from harmful relationships. Women are not absolved from this social vice of heart breaking. Some women (especially those of superior economic standings to their male counterparts) are tempted to play domineering role in the family such a way that their husbands have to play the second fiddle in a home, where they are supposed to be the head of the family.</p> <p>In the incidence of domestic violence on family relationship, the causal few in most cases include infidelity, sex role, sexual dissatisfaction, feeling of stay in control, influence of inlaws, economic handship, lack of education among others. For instance, women that are not allowed to work tend to stay in an abusive relationship because, their husbands sometimes gain economic and psychological control over them. According to Nadin (1998) employed women are less dependent on violent partners and better able to extricate themselves from violence relationships.</p> <p><strong>The Patriarchy Theory</strong></p> <p>The patriarchy theory according to Dobash and Dobash (1979) is that economic and social process operate directly and indirectly to support  patriarchal (male dominated) social order and family structure).</p> <p>The central theoretical argument is that patriarchy leads to subordination and oppression of women and causes the historical pattern of systematic violence directed against wives.</p> <p>The patriarchy theory finds the source of domestic violence in society at large and how it is organized as opposed to within individual families or communities.</p> <p>Globally, and in every culture, men have been seen and celebrated as superior to their female counterparts. Traditionally, the arrival of male child into a family is seen as a special blessing to such home. It is not uncommon, most especially among Africans to pry and earnestly expect a male child irrespective of the number of the female children in the families. The central belief is that male children are by all standard superior to their female counterparts and should be treated as such.</p> <p>This situation is buttressed also by the social order and family structure. Almost in every social strata, male men are mostly favoured for significant posts. The affair of family living is also conferred superiority on the men. This has helped shape the behaviour and perception of men as superior to the female counterparts and has largely contributed to their violent behaviour against wives in family relationships.</p> <p>In most cases, wives also tries to prove that they are never inferior, when this happen the consequence is domestic violence with its many evil effects on family relationship.</p> <p><strong>General System Theory</strong></p> <p>General System Theory, a social system approach was developed and applied by Straus (1973) and Jean (1983) to explain family violence. Here violence is viewed as a system product rather than the result of individual pathology. The family system operation can maintain, escalate or reduce levels of violence in families. The theory describes the processes that characterize the use of violence in family interaction and explains the way in which violence is managed and stabilized. Straus argues that a general system theory of family violence must include at least three basic elements:</p> <p>1.           Alternative causes of action or causal flow.</p> <p>2.           The feedback mechanism that enable the system to make adjustments and</p> <p>3.           System goals.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>It has been found that various forms of domestic violence exist in some family relationship and has degenerated into various marital problems among which are child negligence, communication gaps, destruction of property, divorce, separation and ultimately death.</p> <p>Base on the above picture, this study is therefore meant to determine the influence of domestic violence on family relationship among couples in Oshodi Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The primary purpose of this study are to:</p> <p>(1)     Determine the difference between domestic violence and family relationship among new and aged wedded couples in Oshodi Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p>(2)     Find out the difference between domestic violence and family relationship among Christian and Muslim couples in the area.</p> <p>(3)     Investigate the emotional stability of children of parents who engaged in domestic violence and those who do not.</p> <p>(4)     Examine the prevalent rate of domestic violence among male and female spouses in the area.</p> <p><strong>1.5   Research Questions</strong></p> <p>This study provides answer to the following questions:</p> <p>(1)         What is the difference between domestic violence and family relationship among new and aged wedded couples in Oshodi Local Government Area of Lagos State?</p> <p>(2)         What is the difference between domestic violence and family relationship among Christian and Muslim couples in the area?</p> <p>(3)         Is there any difference between the emotional stability of children of parent who engage in domestic violence and those who do not?</p> <p>(4)         What is the prevalent rate of violence among male and female spouses in the area?</p> <p><strong>1.6   Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The hypotheses that guide the study are as follows:</p> <p>(1)         There will be no significant difference between domestic violence and family relationship among new and aged wedded couples in Oshodi Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p>(2)         There will be no significant difference between domestic violence and family relationship among Christian and Muslim couples in Oshodi Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p>(3)         There will be no significant difference between the emotional stability of children of parents who engaged in domestic violence and those who do not.</p> <p>(4)         There will be no significant difference in the prevalent rate of domestic violence among male and female spouses in the area.</p> <p><strong>1.7</strong><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The outcome of this study will be of great benefit to the married couples, marriage counsellors, children of violent couples and the society at large.</p> <p>With reference to the married couples, the finding of this study will help them identify some of this evil effects of violence not only on them as perpetrators but also on everyone who maintains intimate relationship with them such as their children and extended family members or friends. Thus, be able to control their anger.</p> <p>Also, marriage counsellors will be able to identify the various forms of violence among couples and be able to provide adequate counselling assistance whenever the need arises.</p> <p>On the other way, children of violent couples will be exposed to the right attitude to violent behaviour of their parents so as not to grow up as perpetrators of domestic violence. These children will also be educated on the need to always develop healthy emotional life inspite of the violent circumstance prevailing among them.</p> <p>The society at large will be made to the damning effects of domestic violence on family relationship. It will also assist the society to see and accept marriage as a loving relationship that should be devoid of humiliation, intimidation, threat and physical injury.</p> <p><strong>1.8</strong><strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study basically covered married couples in Oshodi Local Government Area of Lagos. Oshodi Local Government Area of Lagos is predominantly the commercial nerve centre of the state with all its inhabitants from all social classes of the Nigerian economy.</p> <p><strong>1.9</strong><strong>Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>1.          <strong>Domestic Violence:</strong> Domestic violence which is otherwise refer to as spousal abuse is described as when adults in a relationship misuse power to control another whereas such establishment of control in the relationship is through violence and other form of abuse. It is also defined as a pattern of abusive behaviour including a wide range of physical sexual and psychological maltreatment used by one person in an intimate relationship against another to gain power unfairly or to maintain the person misuse of power, control and authority.</p> <p>2.          <strong>Family Relationship:</strong> This is defined as the relationship of trust, love and care existing between couples who have agreed to co-exist as husband and wife. It is the foundation or bedrock of all other societal relationship. Family relationship is expected to last till death do couples part.</p>                                                          \n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ON FAMILY RELATIONSHIP AMONG COUPLES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE INFLUENCE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ON FAMILY RELATIONSHIP AMONG COUPLES", "id": 130}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The study examined the influence of child abuse on the social adjustment of children in primary schools in Mainland Local Government Area of Lagos State. In this study, some relevant and extensive literatures were review under relevant sub-headings.

This is because all the key ingredients of emotional intelligence such as confidence, curiosity, intentionally, self control, relatedness, capacity to communicate and co-operateness   that determines how a child learns and relates in school and in life general are developed.</p> <p>Anderson (1999), stated that, childhood is the time we learn basic skills and establish the platform for our future. Therefore, the need for achievement  orientation among adolescent in our society is paramount  because it is what ever orientation he or she get that affect the feeling about himself and his relationship with others. People with a high need for achievement sick out situation in which they can compete against some standard be it grades, money, or winning at a game and prove themselves successful while people with low achievement orientation tend to be motivated primarily by a desire to avoid failure as a result, they seek out easy tasks, being sure to avoid failure or seek out very difficult tasks for which failure has no negative implications, since almost anyone would fail at them.</p> <p>However, the beginning of the adolescent perception of his environment is the accumulated experiences the adolescent  gathers from the infant stage to the adolescent period. This is a period the adolescent begins to see things as relative rather than absolute.</p> <p>Piaget (1966) as contained in Osarenren (2000), observed that it is a period known as formal operational stage (11-15 years) the key patterns of reasoning at this stages combinational, proportional, probabilistic and correlational during this period, the adolescent reason out everything key perceive in their own way.</p> <p>Bond (1989) asserted that adolescent with a background of family tension may approach schooling as unhappy and insecure, those from a culture different from that of the teacher and different from that portrayed  in  the learning materials may experience unusual difficulty in learning.</p> <p>Some adolescents come from a home environment which provides love, understanding, an opportunity to develop individuality and a feeling of security which others do not. Quarreling parents, broken homes, child neglect, child abuse, over protection, parental domination, anxiety, hostility and destructive rivalry among siblings are likely to produce nervous  tension and feelings of insecurity and consequently lead to low achievement orientation.</p> <p>When the behaviour of a low achiever is compared to that of an adolescent making normal progress, it becomes obvious  that there are differences in personal and social adjustment. Adolescent who are failing to achieve  well are more likely to show signs of emotional and social maladjustment than their successful peers. Most adolescent  with low achievement manifest some sort of maladjustment ranging in degree of mild to severe.</p> <p>In the classroom, adolescent with low achievement  manifest symptoms of stress in one way or the other. Often, they appear shy or restless, some seems unable to concentrate. They lack self-confidence, they become discouraged easily and tend to give up when work becomes difficult. The inability to achieve satisfactory usually means severe frustration for the adolescent when his unsuccessful attempts to achieve high make him conspicuous in a society unfavorable way, the adolescent  is hurt and ashamed. His continued lack of success with attendant frustration and feelings of insecurity bring on emotional maladjustment.</p> <p>Sornson (2002), stated that, some of these adolescent easily become convinced that  they are stupid. This feeling of inadequacy is enhanced by the attitude of their classmates, their parents and their teachers. Sometimes, failure leads adolescent  to become timid, withdrawn and they frequently  day dream. Others may compensate for their feelings of inferiority by developing various forms of anti social behaivour which leads to negative self talk.</p> <p>Negative statements about self originated from poor conceptualization of idea and thoughts. An individual  first think of something within him before he acts. This is because a thought of an idea is first generated or conceptualized before one verbalizes or acts it. This thought might be rational or irrational, positive or negative.</p> <p>The achievement  orientation of an adolescent plays back at his thought process which consequently makes that adolescent make either rational or irrational  statement  about self which are capable of influencing his behaviour.</p> <p>Hensen (1997)  observed that because man has been endowed with the ability to verbalize, thinking and emotion as presented by Elis takes the forms of self talk, and this self talk directs the individuals behaviour in either rational or irrational direction</p> <p>It is imperative however, that the handicapped who has been tagged with various adjectives like unproductive, totally dependant, second class citizen, by the society tends to direct his behaviour towards irrational direction and hence negative self concept, wrong perception of self, poor actualization, poor judgmental value of the ideal self. He makes distorted statements about self and about others. He is biased about other people’s opinion about him. On the whole, he is socially maladjusted in the society.</p> <p>Nelson (1997), asserts that teachers can become more effective classroom managers by increasing their rate of contingent positive statement for appropriate  students behaviour and decreasing the rate of negative statements for in appropriate students behaviour.</p> <p>The praise and ignore techniques has been repeatedly  demonstrated to be an effective classroom  management procedure by some behaviourist (Becker, Madsen abd Thomas, 1987, Madson and Thomas 1988 )</p> <p>Nelson  (1997), carried out two experiments with classroom teachers, using self-monitoring to alter negative classroom verbalization. In experiment 1, two teachers self-recorded positive and negative classroom verbalization during different phase of the study. In experiment 11, four teachers self-recorded positive or negative classroom verbalizations and received experimental instructions to increase  positive statements or to decrease negative statement the result of their study showed that self-recording tend to increase positive statements but was less effective in decreasing negative statements.</p> <p>Merchenbaum (1995), noted that negative  self talks contribute  to maladaptive behaviour in many situations. He went further to say that adolescents thinking style or what he says to himself has an important role in the definition of the present problem.</p> <p>According to Meichanban, investigations who had treated phobias with different treatment procedures have all suggested that a common mediating mechanism underlying the therapy process is a change in the client’s self statements. Those who have attempted to reduce phobia behaviour by means of desensitization, modeling, flooding and altering cognitions about internal reaction have all commented on the change process, even when no direct effort is made to change these talks.</p> <p>As Herter (1994), noted  the therapy technique which is used to modify the internal dialogue and maladaptive behaviour in large part depends upon how one views the thinking  style. Different conceptualizations leads to different therapeutic interventions.</p> <p>Mecichenbaum (1995)    also observed that some semantic or  cognitive therapists view the negative self. Talks and poor achievement orientation of the faulty belief system and faulty thinking patterns. It was however concluded that modeling, behavioural and imagery rehearsal, operant and aversive  conditioning  and others could be used to modify the adolescent’s self talk and belief systems for positive achievement orientation</p> <p><strong>1.2    Theoretical Background</strong></p> <p>As we go about our daily lives, we are constantly thinking about and interpreting the situations we find ourselves in. It is as though we have an internal voice on our head that determines how we perceive every situation. We call this inner voice our self- talk and it includes our conscious thoughts as well as our unconscious assumptions or beliefs. This study is basically anchored on four major theories. These are Rational Emotive  therapy (RET), Eilis (1967), achievement orientation theory by Michem (1973), the A-B-C- of self talk by (Edelmen’s abd Remond, L 2005) and attribution theory</p> <p>1.       <strong>Rational Emotive Theory:</strong> The central point of RET is that psychologist can help their clients to live the most  self fulfilling, creative and emotionally satisfying lives by teaching them now to organize their thinking.</p> <p>Rational  psychotherapy is based on the assumption that thought and emotion are not too entirely different processes but that they significantly overlap  in many respects and that therefore, disordered emotions can often (though not always) he modified by changing one’s thinking. According to Elis (1967) thinking  is a more harmful, less accurate directed mode of discrimation  than emotional thinking and emotion tend to take the form of self-talk or internalized sentences</p> <p>Nevertheless, the psychologists main goals should be those of demonstrating to client that their self- talk have been  and still are the prime  source of their emotional  disturbance.</p> <p>Specifically Sokan  (1996), states that effective therapist should continually help in unmasking his clients past and especially his present illogical thinking of self defeating talks by</p> <p>(a)         Bringing them to his attention  or consciousness</p> <p>(b)         Showing the client how they are causing and maintaining their disturbance and unhappiness</p> <p>(c)         Demonstrating exactly  what that  illogical links in his internalized  sentence are</p> <p>(d)         Teaching  him how to rethink and re verbalize these sentence  in a more logical self helping way</p> <p>In changing  the clients illogical thought, he/she should be exposed to main irrational thought, that human beings are prone,  to so that at the expiration of the therapy he does not fall a victim to another set.</p> <p>Consequently, unequivocal attack on the client’s general and specific irrational idea and to try induce him to adopt more rational ones in their place.</p> <p>Sokan (1996) lists two main ways by which rational therapist  attack the irrational ideas:</p> <p>(i)          He serves as a frank counter –propagandist who directly contradicts and derives the self defeating propaganda of the client</p> <p>(2)    The therapist  encourages, persuades and sometimes  commends the client to partake  in some activity which itself will act as a forceful center propagandist against the client irrational thoughts.</p> <p>(ii)         Achievement orientation: The level of aspiration in all human  endeavour is a factor of the individuals internalized  construct known as achievement  orientation or need for achievement. Achievement  orientation as a personality trait or construct encompasses learned predisposition to achieve or attain success in completion with an internalized standard of excellence. Achievement orientation makes an individual to man and execute tasks and actions leading to the achievement  of a goal.</p> <p>Anameze (1992), beliefs that achievement orientation enables an individuals to plan a task, feel connected  with the plan and select appropriate steps and carry them out to achieve a goal. Many students who fail examination are likely to have negative achievement orientation. This can be inferred from their negative attitude towards planning academic tasks and selecting appropriate strategies to tackle them, besides, they hardly feel connected with work and this denies them success. To escape the problem many of them indulge in examination mal-practice.</p> <p>According to Mauku (1996), achievement orientation or motivation is a psychological motive to accomplish, excel or attain  higher goals similarly, Igwebuke (1997), defined it as the degree of completion for excellence it equally means that the internal drive that makes an individual to put in all efforts in any work in order to achieve the purpose or goal of such work or it is the internal urge that makes an individuals to set up a task of moderate difficulty , fashion out strategies of performing the task and persist in doing it in order to achieve standing excellence. All said and done, it can be seen that individuals having positive achievement orientation engage in challenging or competitive  tasks, make use of their creative abilities and take responsibility for their success and failure. They equally try to perform to  standard  of excellence in relation to others competing  with them.</p> <p>Achievement  orientation has three component (Cognitive ego, enhancing and effiliature) Bakare (1976). The degree or level of these components in an individuals determines the individual’s striving to succeed in academic task or any other task.</p> <p>It should be noted that the way an adolescent sees himself in relation to his goals and to others, the kind of person he believe himself to be and the kind of fear and aspirations he has are major factors in delineating the things for which he strives.</p> <p>Studies  of levels of achievement orientation have shown that one of the important variable in determing the levels of achievement  a child proposes for himself is his previous experiences  in like situations and self-talk (Sears, 1996).</p> <p>A-B-C of self-talk</p> <p>(A)     Is of Activating situation the Activating situation refers to the situation  itself, or the things that happened when an adolescent begins  to feel bad such as being overloaded with essays  and assignments or making a silly comment which he later regretted. It is important to stick to the facts when activating situation has been identified.</p> <p>(B)   Is for beliefs. Belief comprise self-talk (thoughts) and assumptions, that an adolescent makes about a situation. Identifying self-talk, can sometimes be tricky this is because it is so automatic  that often adolescent  is not even aware of what is going on his mind, when something happens and he suddenly feel upset, he assumes that it is the situation  itself that has made him feel that way. However it is not the situation (activating situation)  but the way he perceive  it (Beliefs) that makes him feel the way he does.</p> <p>(C)     Is for consequence: The  consequences of beliefs include feelings and behavious feelings are emotions such as sadness, anxiety, guilt, anger, embarrassment, joy, excitement or stress. Behaviours are the things adolescents do, such as communication, withdrawal, ask for help etc thinking negatively about situations makes the adolescents feel bad and it can cause them to behave in an unhelpful way.</p> <p>(iii)    Attribution theory: This theory helps us to understand human motivation, reminds us that people who experience frequent achievement often attribute their success to their own effort or ability and their failure to their own lack of effort or ability people who experience repeated failure, however, often attribute their failure to bad luck or to task difficulty and their success to good luck or the case of the task (Weiner 2000), for adolescents with a history of failure  teaching learning strategies alone may not be sufficient to consist entry increase effort and persistence because the attribution state often determines whether and to what extent a learning strategy will be used.</p> <p>(Borkowst; Weyling, and Turner 1996) The research of attribution thoughts has spined investigations into expectancy theory (Betancert and Weriner 2002; Dweak, 1996; Licht, 2003), which states that when a person feels success is possible he or she is likely to exert greater effort, persist for a longer period of time, and attribute a greater proportion of success to the effort execrated than in someone who does not expect success (Carr, Boikowski, and Maxwell, 2001, Deshler, Shumaker and Lenz, 2004; Garner, 2000; Xasutake, Bryen and Dohin, 1996) to determine “where” and “how” self talk fits into the scheme of achievement  orientation must be derived. The reality of emotional choice that people have definite control over their emotional state is known in various circle as self-talk, interpersonal communication (IAPC), imaging and visualization (Weaver 1997 )  self-talk is part of 1 APC, but the part can not be equal to the whole.</p> <p>Self-talk and 1APC are separated  but related model of communication, but all elements of ‘sender, receiver’, receiver,” and transmitter, are carried out within individual  people.</p> <p>Pearson and Nelson (1995) expanded the definition as not restricted to talking to ourselves. It also includes such activities as internal conflict planning for the future emotional evaluation of ourselves and others.</p> <p>Self-talk has potentially far reaching effects and will likely be used by those who have a high internal locus of control  and place a high value on achievement  self-talk is categorized as being positive or negative. Positive  self-talk has good implication  for achievement  and people’s mental and physical well-being. However, the negative is not all bad. The key to using self talk is to strive for an appropriate balance between the two.</p> <p><strong>1.3    Statement of the Problem  </strong></p> <p>It is quite unfortunate that achievement orientation is seriously jeopardizing the self-talk of the adolescents in secondary schools. The adolescent self-talk could either be positive or negative, when the self talk is negative, it is because self-defeating for instance, ‘I’m going to fail for sure’.</p> <p>Negative self-talk often causes adolescents to feel bad, and to experience upsetting emotions or anxiety which influences their academic work. It should be noted that what people say to themselves does affects their ability to combat and ward off achievement. To this end, an adolescent can tap into the power of his  own self-talk by recognizing it for what it is, reducing harmful negativity  and increasing the number of positive internal messages and it can be achieved when the right thought process is encouraged (Positive self statement), the self-talk of the adolescents will continue to  be poor  and invariably a succession of failure may discourage student  to a point where frustration may block further efforts. This trend if unchecked, may increase drop out rate in the secondary school level. Mass failure is equally frustrating to parent  and the trend may hinder Nigeria’s scientific and technological advancement and general progress.</p>                                                          \n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF CHILD ABUSE ON THE SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT OF PUPILS IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE INFLUENCE OF CHILD ABUSE ON THE SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT OF PUPILS IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS", "id": 131}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The study examined the effect of working mothers’ career on the social adjustment of students in selected secondary schools in Ikeja Local Government Area of Lagos State. In this study, some relevant and related literature reviews were carried out under sub-headings. The descriptive research survey design was applied in the assessment of the respondents’ opinions using the questionnaire and the sampling technique. The sample of this study consisted of 120 (one hundred and twenty) respondents, which represented the entire population of the study. A total of five null hypotheses were generated and tested using the independent t-test for hypotheses one, three and four and five respectively, while the Pearson product moment correlational coefficient statistical tool was used in testing hypothesis two at 0.05 level of significance. At the end of the testing exercise, the results that were obtained indicated that:</p> <p>(1)         there is a significant effect of mothers’ careers on children’s social adjustment in school,</p> <p>(2)         there is a significant relationship between mothers’ careers and the moral development of children in the community,</p> <p>(3)         social adjustment of children brought up by working mothers differs significantly from those brought up by non-working mothers in the community,</p> <p>(4)         there is a significant difference between the academic performance of children who are brought up by working mothers and those brought up by non-working mothers in the community, and</p> <p>(5)         there is no significant gender difference in the social adjustment of students due to the careers of their mothers.</p> <p>It is also recommended that mothers, who are actively engaged in their work or careers, ought to ensure that, while they carry out their various duties in order to earn money, they should ensure that they take appropriate care of their children’s welfare in terms of their effective education so that these children would not be left out uneducated. </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0   INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Home is the point of support around which the early years of a child revolve.  The central figures in the home are the parents, especially, the mother (Adeleke, 1990). Child-bearing and child-rearing are inseperable. The type of child-rearing practice has tremendous impact on the entire life of the child including his/her academic, social and psychological, even moral life on his/her entire life or career.</p> <p>As Adiele (1994) puts it, the social climate or environment in which an indjvidual finds his/her self, to a large extent, determines his/her behavior or personality development, parental guidance and discipline he added, usually influence the behavior of the child. At the apex of this parental influence is the mother.</p> <p>Mothers’ love for their children is undeniable. Their feminine nature makes them wholesome, soft, passionate and sensitive to the plight of their children and a condusive atmosphere for problem-solving involved (Odomene, 1995).</p> <p>Chukwuka (1999) opined that in this period of economic hardship, more women (wives or mothers) take up paid employment due to the fact that more women are exposed to the western education and there jobs or careers take them away from their matrimonial home and duties of taking care of their children and wards and the proper upbringing of these children.</p> <p>In effect, children are often left in the hands and care of the hired care-giver(s) and maids who do not possess the requisite experience to train the child and inculcate maternal-morality and good behavior in the child. In support of this statement, Uzor (2000), points out that children of these days lack adjustment, because, they are mostly brought up by others instead of their mothers. He went ahead to claim that even when these children know the right thing to do, they fail to do them because, their learning to do good from the family (especially from their mothers) is faulty due to mothers’ absence to direct and inculcate the right attitude of children from cradle.</p> <p>Nkemdirim (2001) states that, for the fact that mothers are absent from their natural duties of upbringing of the child in the right way, the resultant effect is the moral decadence that is prevalent in the society today. A situation where children no longer respect and observe the norms and values expected of them. Elders are no longer cherished and respected by the youths. The youth due to lack of proper and adequate home upbringing by their mothers, are maladjusted to the extent of upholding negative ideas and values such as fighting, drug abuse, examination malpractices, fraud, stealing, lying, promiscuity, disobedience to laid down rules and regulations and indiscriminate sexual relationships both at home, at school and general indisciplinary behaviours perpetuated by youths and the young ones in the society who lack mothers’ care and instructions.</p> <p>Ayodele (2005), opines that, women in the contemporary society especially mothers, miss out in their daily routine and obligations to their families including the societal adjustment of their children, due to gainful employment either to augument the family’s income or to empower themselves economically in the society in order to be independent of their husbands. Anyanwu (2002) opines that most women who work usually leave very early in the morning and come back late at night, thereby leaving the upbringing of the child in the hands of the immature and inexperienced househelps in the home and in the day care centres. According to Ayo (2003, children left in the cares and upbringing of the inexperienced househelps tend to grow up misbehaviouring and upholding the wrong tenets or values of the society due to non-incuclation of the basic motherly care, directions and role-modelling.</p> <p>Ikeofuonye (2000) is of the opinion that the mother-child relationship has been weakened by the prolonged absence of the mother from the home due to routine-employment or career opportunity. He opined that mothers who are career women or who engage in employment spend more time at workplaces than in the homes and the effect is lack of motherly guidance and moral counseling. Furthermore, children grow up to become wayward, mal-adjusted and delinquent in the society.  </p> <p>Amaonye (2004 examined the effect of full time employment of wife, mother on husband and children in the home. He found that mothers who are career women/wives, do not rear, in most cases, good or well-behaved children in the community, and that their husbands are not well taken care of due to intervention of employment or career. Awowinfa (2005) carried out a study on the influence of working mothers on children’s social adjustment. His finding showed that mothers’ career interferes with their home chores and children’s upbringing. Awowinfa, therefore concluded that full-time house wives make better homes than the working mothers. According to him working mothers have more unstable homes, more maladjusted children and more poor school achievement of idea than non-working or career mothers.</p> <p>Most adolescents who are brought up by care-givers due to the absence of mothers who are in search of golden fleece in terms of gainful employment or business, grow up to lack etiquette and positive social adjustment (Uzodinma, 2006). No wonder, many children these days, lack good morals and positive values that are upheld in any given society. Most children these days have turned out to be disrespectful to parents and elders in their communities; some of them do not even know the cultures of their communities, not to talk of how to keep and respect them. And the society is at the brink of collapse, because the norms and values that make the society thick have been in constant disregard and violated due to lack of motherly upbringing of children.</p> <p>As Amakor (2005) put it parents especially, mothers these days, do have the knowledge of child upbringing, but lack the time and opportunities in bringing these children up in proper ways. A situation where a mother wakes up early in the morning and leaves for work while the child is fast asleep and returns very late at night when the child has gone to bed, will cause most children not to even know their mothers, not to talk of having the mother-child bonds or relationships that transpires naturally between mother and child. Parents need to bring up their children and wards in a proper way, teaching them to observe the laid down cultures and traditions of the communities; instructing them to respect and value the societal norms and values, ethics and good moral behaviours that a child needs to imbibe in order to grow into acceptable adolescence and adulthood in the scoiety. (Mumonye, 2003).</p> <p><strong>1.2   Statement of the Problem:</strong></p> <p>The issue of working mothers and its effects on the social adjustment and academic achievement of the child has been a heated up debate among Nigerians, most especially, among the man folks. Due to the economic down-turn in the country and the world in general, which has caused high inflationary trends and problems, the men have failed in their bid to win bread for the family. This is as a result of general unemployment and harsh business environment in the country today. This in turn has caused the women to go out in search of gainful employment in order to support the dwindling financial up-keep of the family.</p> <p>According to Alfred (2003), most mothers work these days and these has made them to leave their children at home at the mercy of care-givers and house-helps, who often maltreat the children and bring them up in the way devoid of society’s moral values and positive adjustment and norms. This is the reason why few children in Nigeria today turn out to be area boys and wayward girls simply because they lack home training as a result of the absence of mother-care and guidance.</p> <p>For these reasons, prostitution, disrespect to the rules and regulations governing the society and disobedient to parents, significant others and school authorities are the order of the day. The fact that most children have lost the opportunity of being reared by their mothers, has lead to moral decadence and adolescents’ delinquency. This study therefore, sets out to examine the effects of mother’s career on the children’s social adjustment.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The specific objectives of this study among others are to:</p> <p>1.      Examine the effect of a working mother towards the social adjustment of the child.</p> <p>2.      Assess whether mother’s career affects the moral development of the child.</p> <p>3.      Find out whether non-working mothers rear up their children better than the working mothers.</p> <p>4.      Examine whether there is a difference between the academic performance of children brought up by non-working mothers and working mothers.</p> <p>5.      Compare the social adjustment of children brought up by working mothers and non-working mothers.</p> <p>6.      Find out whether there is difference between the moral development of children brought up by working mothers and those brought up by non-working mothers.</p> <p>7.      Profer solution to the problem of working mothers on the social adjustment of their children.</p> <p><strong>1.4   Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions were raised for the conduct of this study:</p> <p>1.      Will mother’s career affect the social adjustment of their children?</p> <p>2.      To what extent will the career of mothers affect the moral development of their children?</p> <p>3.      Do non-working mothers rear better children than the working mothers?</p> <p>4.      To what extent will there be any differences between the academic performance of children brought up by non-working mothers and those of the working mothers?</p> <p>5.      Is there any comparison between the social adjustment of children brought up by working mothers and those brought up by non-working mothers?</p> <p>6.      Is there any difference between the moral development of children who are brought up by working mothers and those by the non-working mothers?</p> <p>7.      To what extent will there be any solution to the problems of working mothers on children’s social adjustment?</p> <p><strong>1.5   Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The following research hypotheses were tested in this study:</p> <p>(1)     There will be no significant effect of mother’s career on children’s social adjustment in school.</p> <p>(2)     There will be no significant relationship between mother’s career and children’s moral development.</p> <p>(3)     There will be no significant difference between the social adjustment of children who are brought up by working mothers and those brought up by non-working mothers.</p> <p>4.      There will be no significant difference between the academic performance of children brought up by working mothers and those brought up by non-working mothers.</p> <p>5.      There will be no significant gender difference in the social adjustment of students due to the careers of their mothers</p> <p><strong>1.6   Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>It is hoped that this study will create an awareness of the difficulties that career mothers encounter while combining the care of their family with their career or work.</p> <p>It will also determine the degree of relationship between career mothers and the influence they have on their children’s moral development, social adjustment and academic achievement in school.</p> <p>The study when finally completed, will determine to a great extent, the effects of career mothers on their children’s well-being, especially, their moral development and social adjustment in the society.</p> <p>This study will highlight the importance of the responsibilities of the mother which include: care, love, affection and good upbringing of the child in a family setting.</p> <p>The awareness the findings and recommendations of this study will create, will therefore enable parents, especially, mothers to know the right direction in which to follow for proper upbringing of their children and ward in the society.</p> <p>Apart from the above benefits, this study will be a reference material to the general members of the society, students and researchers, especially those who wish to carry out research in related topics.</p> <p><strong>1.7   Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study covered the effect of working mothers on the social adjustment of children in Ikeja Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.8   Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p>The operational terms were defined in this study thus:</p> <p>1.      <strong>Working mother:-</strong> This means a mother who is gainfully employed or who goes out routinely in order to engage in one business or employed work or the other.</p> <p>2.      <strong>Non-working mother:-</strong> This connotes the mother who is not engaged in paid jobs or businesses.

The descriptive research design was used in order to assess the opinions of the respondents using the questionnaire and the sampling technique. A total of 300 (Three Hundred) respondents (made up of 150 males and 150 females) were selected and used in this study as the sample of the study which represented the entire population of the study. Five research questions were raised in the study and were analyzed together with the bio-data of the respondents using the simple percentage frequency counts, while two null hypotheses were formulated and tested using both the Pearson's Product Moment Correlation Coefficient and the independent t-test statistical tools at 0.05 level of significance. At the end of the data analyses, the following results emerged: There will be no significant relationship between child’s rights act and girl-child education in Lagos State, Nigeria and that there will be no significant gender difference in the education of the Girl-Child due to the Child’s Rights Act in Lagos State, Nigeria. With the above results, it is summarized that there is a positive relationship between Child’s Rights Act and Girl-Child Education in Lagos State, Nigeria. Based on the above results, it became imperative to recommend that: Nigerian girl-child should be sensitized about their rights. Many of them do not know their Fundamental Human Right such as rights to education, right that could allow them to challenge and reject all conditions that seek to make them inferior, subjugate them, oppress and deny them equal access to policy and decision-making positions.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Primary education started in Nigeria in the 1840s with the advent of the missionaries and the traditional system of governance. The traditional rulers and chiefs who had the direct contact with the colonialists were very reluctant to send their children and wards to the early schools established because they were not sure of the motive of the British. Instead, the traditional rulers and chiefs sent children of slaves and others who were' serving them as house-helps to these schools. It was after these; slaves became literate and were employed by the missionaries as clerks and interpreters that it dawned on the traditional rulers that it could after all be beneficial to send their children to school (Adeleke, 1997).</p> <p>According to Ayodele (2000), the traditional education in Nigeria is such that the girl-child is made to understudy her mother while the boys are made to also understudy their fathers in their chosen professions. The expectation therefore, was that the culture of the people never encouraged the girl-child to do more than help out in cooking food and doing other domestic chores. Over time therefore, everybody imbibed the culture and the girl-child education suffered tremendously. Informal education was what the culture requires to train and prepare both men and women for survival. What is known as formal education was introduced to Nigeria with the advent of British rule and the coming of Christian Missionaries to Nigeria.</p> <p>According to Awolowo (1981), education is that process of physical and mental culture whereby a man's personality is developed to the fullest. To him, an educated man is one whose personality is fully developed, he never feels inferior to anyone, no matter the colour, stature or strength of such a person or individual, he or she is self-reliant, and will resist any form of embarrassment until the last breath in him is exhausted. Fafunwa (1979: 26), defines education as 'the aggregate of all the processes by which a child or adult develops the abilities, attitudes and other forms of behaviour which are of positive value to the society in which he or she lives, that is to say, it is a process of disseminating knowledge either to ensure social control or to guarantee rational direction of the society or both.</p> <p>Over the years, the girl-child has been grossly neglected (Oleribe 2002). Girl-child are left out in decision-making, utilized at homes without due remunerations, kept as home keeper and never allowed to earn a living for herself used by men as wife, by children as mother, by other women as house-girl and by men as bed-mate (Fishel, 1998; Oleribe, 2002; Sarwar and Sheikh, 1995). She has never ever been given a chance to make her own choices.</p> <p>According to Ebigbo and Abaga (1990), in Nigeria, the rate of child abuse and child hawking has assumed a worrisome and alarming proportion. He further noted that in Ibadan, Ondo and Ogun metropolis, it is a daily occurrence to see children, especially the girl-children below 14 years, hawking wares and other products along the roadsides thereby depriving them going to school.</p> <p>Christian Missionary Society (CMS) started both primary and secondary education in Nigeria. With this, even the girls that were opportuned to go to school got pregnant because of lack of self-discipline. They were forced to get married and this led them to bid good-bye to their educational careers. But the ugly trend and reluctance to send the girl-child to school because of cultural factors, which hither-to affected the growth of the girl-child education was checked as the Roman Catholic Mission (RCM) activities started in Nigeria in 1948. According to Oyedeji (2001), \"The RCM opened girl's convent school in Abeokuta in 1886, St Agnes College Yaba Lagos for the training of women teachers in 1933. Soon, there were schools for girls, both primary and secondary in some other parts of southern Nigeria\".</p> <p>The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) is no doubt the most widely accepted framework for action with respect to children. It is the most widely ratified human rights instrument. The CRC guides international efforts to identify the continual life conditions that put very young children at risk and pre-empt their healthy and optimum growth and development/education. The Convention can be used to actively promote the quality of care through policies and practices that young children need and are entitled to as part of their basic human rights (Angeles-Bautista, 2001). But twelve years after the ratification of the Convention and eleven years after the World Summit for Children, the Childhood Care Development and Education first presented at the OMEP Nigeria, 2001 National Conference, held at the University of Ibadan. The programme continues to face challenges. It is the duty of all those responsible for the care, development and education of young children to continue to remind governments and state parties of their obligations towards them (Bellamy, 2001).</p> <p>Nigeria has ratified several human rights instruments including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and its Optional Protocol on individual communications, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and its Optional Protocol, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). Nigerian child protection policy is rooted in the Child Rights Act, which President Olusegun Obasanjo signed into law in 2003 (UNICEF Nigeria, 2007). This defines all persons under the age of 18 years as children, outlining specific protections and prohibitions necessary to meet the mandate of providing all care necessary for child survival, well-being, education and development. The Act has been passed on a state level by 24 out of 36 Nigerian states (Defence for Children International, 2010). It covered child trafficking, child labour and child abuse, at the highest levels. A plethora of other policies and programmes, at national and international levels supplement this framework and provide tools for implementation.</p> <p>Education is one of the fundamental rights of individuals. Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in December, 1949 stipulated that:</p> <p>•    Everyone has the right to education. This shall be free at least in the elementary and primary stages.</p> <p>•  Elementary education shall be compulsory while technical and professional education shall be made generally available.</p> <p>•    Higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit.</p> <p>•    Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children (Nwangwu, 1976).</p> <p>Since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations has adopted numerous treaties, declarations and conventions concentrated on human rights including the right to education. The General Assembly refers most items relating to human rights to its Third Committee, which deals with social, humanitarian and cultural matters (Anynwu, 1990). The human rights of children are fully articulated in one treaty: the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) offering the highest standard of protection and assistance for children under any international instrument. The approach of the Convention is holistic, which means that the rights are indivisible and interrelated, and that all articles are equally important. The CRC defines a \"child\" as everyone less than 18 years of age \"unless under the law-applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.\"</p> <p>The World Summit for Children also held in 1990 re-emphasized that all children should have access to basic education by the year 2000 as well as increasing female literacy. Following the World Convention on Education for the Female Child (WCEFC), the Dakar World Education Forum (WEF) was held where new sets of education goals were stipulated to be attained by the year 2015. The goals include, amongst others, ensuring that all children, especially girls, in difficult circumstances and from ethnic minorities have access and complete free and compulsory primary education of good quality; eliminating gender disparities in pre-tertiary education by 2005, and migrating to gender parity in education by 2015, with a focus on ensuring girls full and equal access to basic education of good quality. Similarly, the Millennium Development Goals 2 and 3 reiterated the achievement of universal primary education and the promotion of gender parity and women empowerment respectively. Based on the developments, the Universal Basic Education Act (2004) and the Childs Rights Act (2003) documented that Nigeria government shall provide free, compulsory and universal basic education for every child of primary and junior secondary school age.</p> <p>Access to education for girls is also affirmed in the <em>Millennium Development Goals </em>(MDGs), agreed in 2000 following the Millennium Summit and intended to be achieved by 2015. MDG2 is to \"Achieve universal primary education\" and MDG3 is to \"Promote gender equality and empower women\". The girl-child education has been a burning and continuous issue in the developing countries of which Nigeria is one.</p> <p>In spite of the fact that improvement and ordering of access to education has been a major goal ofAfricanGovernment since in the 1960s, the history of educational provision to date is a catalogue of enduring inequality between boys and girls and men and women. Again, though educational opportunities have indeed greatly expanded for all children in Nigeria, there is still an under-representation of females in schools, showing a disparity in educational access and achievement widened to the growing disadvantages of females (Gender Training Manual, 1999).</p> <p>Nigeria is a signatory to many international conventions aimed at bringing the gender imbalance in education, yet the girl-child lags conspicuously behind. The 1984 Universal Development of Human rights states that \"every person has a right to education\". Article seven (7) of (UNICEF, 1995) and the right of the child also states \"every child (male or female) is entitled to receive free and compulsory basic education and equal opportunity for higher education based on individual ability.\"( Ayande, 1990).</p> <p>In 1990, the world Conferences on Education for All (EFA) held in Jomtien, Thailand, declared among others, that every person shall be able to benefit from educational opportunities designed to meet their basic learning. Despite the concerted efforts at national and international levels to bring about gender equality between boys and girls in many areas and particularly in education, in equality still persist worldwide. (Mamma in Eze, 2011), captures the fate of the girl child, \"it is a well known fact that many parents in Africa give preferential treatment to boys especially in matters concerning education. It is really sad that up till now in some societies, girls are still made to live in their shadows, denied education and other rights, and socially exploited. What is more disturbing, is that even the passage of the child rights act into law in 2003 by Law makers in Nigeria on the issue of the girl-child education has not been fully addressed (Ayodele, 2000).</p> <p>The child rights law seeks to facilitate the realization and protection of the rights of all children in the country regardless of their tribe, gender, and parents' status. There is continuing national gender disparity in basic education enrollment, retention and completion against the girl child. -Available statistics revealed that we have about 10 million children in Nigeria, and 60 percent are girls who are presently not in school (Jackson and Walwana, 2009). The girl-child education has been a burning and continues issue in the developing countries of which Nigeria is one. The girl-child education can be compared to a coin which has two sides. This is because in the northern part of Nigeria, the girl-child is not encouraged to go to school, whereas in the Southern part of the country, reverse is the case. But culturally women are confined to their traditional roles with lots of sanctions imposed on them either by custom, norms or religion (Onyeaku, 2001).</p> <p>It has been revealed that the girl-child education has suffered a lot in the society as cited by Mohammed (2008). This has been the case since independence in 1960. In the sixties, the situation was really break because out of 10 school children that went to school beyond primary 4, only one was a girl. Missionary activities started in certain parts of northern Nigeria before the turn of the century. In 1860s, Baikie of Christian Missionary Society founded a settlement at Lokoja. A school was opened the same year and instruction was given in Hausa and Nupe languages right from the beginning. The girl-child education in Northern states has been lagging behind all this while in terms of education one can wonder why the situation should persist like this in respects of the light of the clear provisions in National Policy on Education that education is a right for every Nigerian Child, The National Policy on Education (2004) also has as its 5th objective, the building of a \"bright land full of opportunities for all individual\". Northern states in Nigeria as a whole, there is the presence of discrimination against girl-child in the access to basic education. The Northern region which is so much dominated by the Hausas who have no interest in girl-child education as it was viewed exclusively for the male child. The girl-child was not only denied formal education, but also the Qur'anic education. The few girls that attempted school during western education after the amalgamation in 1914 did that under duress.</p> <p>The problems of the lack of girl-child education emanates from the root of:</p> <p>•    The culture of the northerners</p> <p>•    Religion</p> <p>•    Poverty</p> <p>•    Weak father figures and ignorant mothers who knew no better</p> <p>•    Early marriage and</p> <p>Placement of priority on the Boy-Child etc. </p> <p>Therecent report to the African Union on the rights and welfare of the Nigerian child showed that about 6,000 children are in prison and detention centres across the country. Girls make up less than 10 per cent and they mainly come into contact with the law as a result of criminal acts committed against them such as rape, sexual exploitation and trafficking.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The panacea of poverty, family disorganization and. societal true development has suffered several sets backs over the years due to socio-cultural and economic factors. Till date, girls constitute the largest population of illiterate children worldwide. Extreme poverty, mass illiteracy, large scale ignorance, high maternal mortality and fertility rates, child wastages and lack of access to health, education and social services may sound far and fictional to many indigenes and visitors.</p> <p>The problems of girl-child education have been in existence since the introduction of British rule in Nigeria. Parents were very reluctant to send their female children to school. This was partly because the traditional system of education often dictates that the place of the girl or woman in the society is in the home. Many children, who should be in school, particularly girls, were involved in unpleasant acts such as child labour, child abuse, child trafficking, prostitution and were all deprived from Child’s Rights Act decree law enforcement. More often than not, these children were subjected to inhuman treatment as some suffer physical abuse, economic exploitation and denial of opportunity to education. Most of them were under-fed and if they are fortunate enough to be in school, they are hardly given any time to play and rest properly.</p> <p>Mohammed (2008) opined that most girl-children are engaged in either  hawking goods on the street for their parents, and at some other times, the girl-children were engaged in early marriages as a result of parental poverty and financial problems where some parents cannot afford to pay school fees for their many children. In some families, parents who have many children select the boys and educate them, thus leaving the girl-children untrained and uneducated. Not only that, the girl-child has suffered enough discrimination among siblings and parents, and even the society and this has affected her education negatively. For instance, in many African traditions and customs, the girl-child is regarded as inferior to the boy-child, and this has made many African parents to devote more attention in training the boy-child than the girl-child.</p> <p>The above identified problems, gave rise to the examination of the impact of child’s Rights Act on the education of the girl-child among students in Missionary Senior Secondary Schools in Mainland Local Government Area of Lagos State, Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions were raised in this study:</p> <p>(1) What are the cultural-factors affecting the girl-child education in Lagos State, Nigeria?</p> <p>(2) What are the most perceived effects of lack of girl-child education by the students in Lagos State, Nigeria? </p> <p>(3) How do students perceive the influence of child Rights Act on girl-child education in Lagos State, Nigeria?</p> <p>(4) What are the solutions for implementing the Girl-Child’s Rights Act in Lagos State, Nigeria?</p> <p><strong>Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>(1) There will be no significant relationship between child’s rights act and girl-child education in Lagos State, Nigeria.</p> <p>(2) There will be no significant gender difference in the education of the Girl-Child Due to Child’s Rights Act in Lagos State, Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>Students would be able to find the results of this study very important for them to use as a guide towards their works on the issues concerning child’s Rights Act and Girl-Child education in Nigeria in general and Lagos State in particular, especially students in the missionary secondary schools in the state. This is because the issues of the education of the girl-child are very vital issues that need to be paid attention to, due to the importance of the education of the girl-child in any Nigerian family.</p> <p>The teachers in our secondary schools, especially in Lagos State, would be able to see the outcomes of this study as very important because they would have correct insights about the importance of training the girl-child in the Nigerian families.</p> <p>This study will be beneficial to the government, especially the Ministry of Education, because it will assist them to be in the-know concerning the important role the education of the girl-child play in any nation of the world, particularly in Nigeria and Lagos State.</p> <p>This study will be also be very beneficial to the society who will be in good position to have fair knowledge of the training of the girl-child in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study examined the relationship between Child’s Rights Act and Girl-child Education in Lagos State, Nigeria. The study covered all the teachers and students in the Missionary Secondary Schools in the Mainland Local Government Area of Lagos State, Nigeria. This study was limited to access for the panacea of the Girl Child Education, Missionary Schools in LagosState; it did not take into consideration the other crucial issues in girl-child education like retention and equity, enrollment, quality and achievement in school subjects. It's also restricted to missionary schools in Lagos state only. The major reason to conduct this research in only Lagos state was due to time and financial constraints.</p>                                                            \n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHILD’S RIGHTS ACT AND GIRL CHILD EDUCATION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHILD’S RIGHTS ACT AND GIRL CHILD EDUCATION", "id": 133}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study analysed the parental Socio-Economic background and students’ academic performance in Public Senior Secondary Schools in Ojo Local Government Area of Lagos State, using the descriptive research design and the population of all the teachers and students in the Public Senior Secondary Schools a sample of 40 students and 10 teachers were randomly selected from all the four Public Senior Secondary Schools out of the 13 in Ojo Local Government Area through stratified random sampling.

Findings reveal significant difference in the academic performance of students from high socio-economic background and those from low Socio-Economic Background; significant relationship between parental moral, financial and material support, parental occupation and students’ academic performance. Sequel to the findings of the study, increased parental and governmental support to enhance students’ academic performance was recommended amongst others.       </p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>A person’s education is closely linked to their life chances, income, and wellbeing (Battle and Lewis 2002), therefore it is important to have a clear understanding of what benefits or hinders one is educational attainment. Several topical areas are mostly commonly linked to academic performance of student, such as school factors, family factors and peers factors. Generally, academic performance is how well a student an individual achieves a set objectives.</p> <p>School environment factors such as school size, neighborhood and relationship between teacher and student also influence test score (Crosnoe, Johnson and Elder 2004). Also, family background has been found to influence student’s academic performance and socio-economic statues, parental involvement, and family size are particularly important factors (Majoribanks, 2006). Peer influence can also affects student’s performance in that peer pressure and peer conformity can lead to an individual participating in risk taking behavior which has negative effect on academic performance.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>Hunt, 2005 and Miller et al, 2005 define social class as literacy of social order or group more or less hereditary but with provision for movement up and down the ladder, all the class are endowed in unequal degree with right and privilege, obligation degree duties in accordance with their position in the social scales. In the Nigerian society, the social class one belongs depends on the educational level, occupation and environmental factors such as circumstance of birth, thus the home becomes and important socializing agent especially in the important socializing agent especially in the early development of the person’s education (Aguokogbuo 2005). At birth an individuals is totally dependent on his/her parent and others grown-up individual in his/her immediate family for guidance. Man is an embodiment of nature and nurture, nature here means biological inheritance from biological parent while nurture is environmental influences. At birth an individual is firmly rooted in or dependent on the parent for socialization process and such a way, social attitude, value norms etc are captured by the individual. According to Locke as cited in Augokogbuo (2005) a man at birth has no innate ideas but rather his mind is tabula rasa (clean slate) thus the original nature of man is neither good or bad but neutrally. A child becomes whatever the society makes of him.</p> <p>Education is regarded as an important tool for achieving national objective, it is a venture that every society and individual needs. In line with the April 2000 education for all commitment, the Nigerian government in the National Policy for Education (2004) section I, sub-section c posited that every Nigerian child shall have a right o equal educational opportunities irrespective of any real or imagined disabilities each according to his ability.</p> <p><strong>1.10</strong><strong>Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>Low socio-economic status or poverty, which forms a specific culture and way of life, is a growing issue in Nigeria, the number of Nigerians living in poverty is continually increasing, poverty indicates the extent to which an individual does without resources. Resources can include financial, emotional, mental, spiritual, and physical resources as well as support systems, relationship, role model and knowledge of hidden rules. Poverty or low socio-economic directly affects academic achievement due to the lack of resources available for student success.</p> <p>Low achievement is closely correlated with lack of resources, and numerous studies have documented the correlation between low socio-economic status and low achievement. Even in the United States of America (USA) the gaps in achievement among poor and advantage students are substantial (Rowan 2004).</p> <p>Through multiple studies, the U.S department of education (2001:8) has indicated result that clearly demonstrated that student and school poverty adversely affected student achievement the US department of education (2001) found the following key findings regarding the effect of poverty on student achievement in a study conducted on third through fifth grade student from 71 high poverty schools. The student scored below norms in all years and grades tested, student who lived in poverty scored significantly worse than other students. Schools with the highest percentage of poor student scored significantly worse initially, but close the gap slightly as time progressed. Similar individual studies have found similar results. In his fiscal 2010 budget proposal; President Obama called for neighborhood modeled after the Harlem children’s zone to improve the lives of their children living poverty (Aaron 2009).</p> <p>The difference in performance has also been found in the United State of America among students whose parent receives welfare or cash income through the aid of families with independent or private source of income. Also in Nigeria, the performance of secondary student in internal and external examination such as West Africa Examination Council (WAEC), NECO etc in the past five to six years have been abysmal and nothing to write home about, this poor performance has been attributed to poor school facilities, lack of school needed material, poor standard of living and poverty. These are the problems that has warrant this research work, in other to know how this challenges can be tackled and lasting solution to be proffered the roles of the family in promoting the academic performance of their children good standard of living for the people, as well as the provision of adequate learning facilities for our schools.  </p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>1.11</strong><strong>Purpose of Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of the study is to:</p> <p>1.   Find out the difference in academic performance between students from poor socio-economic background and those from high socio-economic background.</p> <p>2.   Find out the extent to which parental moral, financial and material support affects student academic performance.</p> <p><strong>1.12</strong><strong>Research Question</strong></p> <p>1.   Is there any significance difference between the performance of student from higher socio-economic background and those from lower socio-economic background?</p> <p>2.   To what extent does parental moral financial and material support affect the academic performance of students?</p> <p><strong>1.13</strong><strong>Research Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>H1: There is no significant difference between the academic performance of student from poor socio-economic background and those from high socio-economic background.</p> <p>H2: There is no significant relationship between parental moral, financial and material support and student academic performance.</p> <p>H3: There is no significant difference in parental occupation and student academic performance.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>1.14</strong><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The significance of this study lies in the fact that it will help to look into the effect of the socio-economic status of parent on the academic performance of the secondary school students.

An approach drawing from both quantitative and qualitative methodologies was adopted. A cross-sectional survey and in-depth interview of prisoners enabled the exploration of specific objectives formulated around the purpose of the study, which included the need to know how ‘needs assessment and classification of offenders correlated with their progress in the rehabilitation process’, and ‘the effect of improved prison industry on the creation of jobs opportunities for the interned offenders’. A probability sampling technique was adopted for the study. Thus, simple random sampling method was used to select a sample size of 183 inmate-respondents from a total of 1,835 inmate population in Ikoyi prison. Also, non-probability sampling technique was adopted in the study to select ten (10) prison personnel, and ten (10) inmates, using quota sampling method. In total, 20 respondents were selected for the in-depth interview. Quantitative and qualitative data generated during the study were analysed using frequency distribution tables and simple percentage, andcontent analysis.The study found no positive correlation between needs assessment and classification of offenders and their progress in rehabilitation process, inmates who participated in vocational education and training were less likely to reoffend, inmates tortured by prison officers were more likely to be driven toward collective behaviour, improved prison industry would create job opportunities for inmates.The study concluded that there was a constant increase in the prevalence of recidivism; especially among male inmates and that most crimes¸ patterns of relationships and behavioural predispositions were offender specific. Recommendations were made.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong><strong>INTRODUCTION   </strong></p> <p>Since the inception of the modern criminal justice system, a persistent response to the question of what to do with offenders has been to rehabilitate them in the mainstream of social life (Paranjape, 2011: 463). Prisons are usually structured to identify the peculiar problems of each inmate and device means of guiding him or her out of the problem. Although prisons are considered as the most widely used institutions of correctional administration but their role has been a subject of severe criticism and scrutiny from the point of view of rehabilitation of prisoners (or offenders) (Ugwuoke, 2010 and Paranjape, 2011). An observation of the population that goes in and out of the prisons shows that there are some problems in the system; hence, the prison system has not been able to achieve the ultimate goal of rehabilitation.</p> <p>More than half of a century ago, Gresham Sykes wrote that “life in the maximum security prison is depriving or frustrating in the extreme” (Sykes, 1958:63), and little has changed to alter that view. Indeed, sykes’s observation is perhaps more meaningful now than he first made it, because prison facilities in many parts of the world are in poor condition (Cavadini and Dignan 2002; 2006; 2007/13). The disrepair is such that even in European countries, where prisons are generally considered good, prisoners are ‘simmering on the point of riot or rebellion’ (Cavadino and Dignan 2006: 43). The discontent is not only with their fellow inmates, but also with prison staff, who are often demoralized, disaffected and restless (Cavadino and Dignan 2006). A prison is not expected to be exactly a bed of roses (as the inmates are there for penal purposes), neither is it supposed to be a bed of thorns and thistles meant to snuff life out of the occupants.Edwin James wrote that “prison experience for the inmates in the main consists of enforced idleness and an obligation to conform to behaviour which primarily is aimed at maintaining the smooth operation of the institution and less about assisting offenders with their problems, or helping them to desist from crime (James, 2006: 19-27). This may have prompted scholars such as Edgar et al. (2011: 3) to argue that “prisons conspire to create model inmates rather than model citizens”.</p> <p>Whilst Prison facilities in Africa are moving toward behaviour change approaches for inmate rehabilitation in the same way as their European counterpart, the degree of success in their implementation is however inadequate (Tenibiaje, 2010 and Ijaiya, 2009). Although prisons are supposed to be places for transformation and rehabilitation, scholars have adjudged Nigerian prisons a school of crime (Obioha, 1995; Adetula et al., 2010; Tanimu, 2010; Tenibiaje, 2010). Dambazau (2007: 210) has proposed that inmates left unoccupied with positive and constructive activities are likely to engage in vices, such as sale and use of drugs. Despite the fact that approximately half of inmates go on to re-offend when released from prison (Prison Reform Trust, 2011: 26) as a growing body of evidence has suggested (Soyombo, 2009; Wilson, 2009; Ministry of Justice, 2010; National Bureau of Statistics, 2010 and Abrifor et al. 2010), much of what is done within prisons is not based on sound evidence but, rather, on custom, bureaucratic convenience, and political ideology (James 2006; Lipsey and Cullen, 2007: 3).</p> <p>The recurring relationship between imprisonment, release and recidivism has ensured that policy makers have given this subject considerable attention over the past two decades in particular. “[N]early three in five prisoners are re-convicted within two years of leaving prison” (Rt. Hon. Tony Blair MP, ‘foreword’ to McEvoy, 2008: 4). Of the offenders released in 2004 in Britain, 58% were convicted of another crime within two years (Home Office 2007: 1). In 2009, 90% of the adults receiving a custodial sentence in the United Kingdom had previously been convicted on at least one prior occasion. According to the Ministry of Justice’s November 2010 Compendium of Reoffending Statistics, 20% of the offenders who were discharged from custody between January and March 2000 had been reconvicted within three months (Ministry of Justice, 2010). This figure rose to 43% after a year, 55% after 2 years and 68% after 5 years. By 2009, 74% of the initial cohort had been reconvicted (Ministry of Justice, 2010).</p> <p>An assessment carried out in 2010 by the Director of National Intelligence on former Guantanamo Bay detainees indicated that an estimated 20% of them had re-engaged in criminal activities (Director of National Intelligence, 2010).</p> <p>Soyombo (2009) reported that the rate of occurrence of criminal recidivism in Nigeria in 2005 was 37.3%. Also, Abrifor et al. (2010) estimated the prevalence of recidivism in Nigerian prisons at 52.4% in 2010. Since then, there has not been any indication that the trend has declined. A report on trend and pattern of recidivism shows that 81% of male criminal inmate offenders and 45% of female criminal inmate offenders were re-arrested within 36 months of discharge/release from the prison custody (Wilson, 2009 and Abrifor et al., 2010).</p> <p>The figures are even more startling when one considers that young male offender within the age groups of 18 to 20 years in England and Wales were reconvicted at a rate of 64% over the same period (Home Office, 2007: 6). While the reconviction rates in Northern Ireland are only slightly lower for adults (46% within two years), the figure for young offenders (74% within two years) underlines the deeply rooted nature of the problem of recidivism (NIPS/NIPB Resettlement Strategy, 2003: 5, cited in McEvoy, 2008: 4).</p> <p>A study on the offender’ educational experience and learning needs showed that in the prison population, a lack of basic skills is common: 48% of prisoners have a reading age at or below the level of an 11 year old (this increases to 65% for numeracy and 82% for writing skills), half of all prisoners do not have the skills required by 96% of jobs and only 1 in 5 can complete an application form (Prison Reform Trust, 2009). In 2005, the Department for Education and Skills reported that 52% of male prisoners and 71% of female prisoners had no qualifications at all (Department for Education and Skills, 2005). The lack of qualifications and difficulties with communication are parts of the explanation of high levels of offender unemployment – 13 times higher for offenders than in the general population. Furthermore, studies have reiterated that the majority of prisoners worldwide come from economically and socially disadvantaged backgrounds. Poverty, unemployment, lack of housing, broken families, histories of psychological problems and mental illness, drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence are realities that are likely to be found in most offenders’ lives (Belenko, 2002; James and Kenneth, 2004; Zhang, 2004; United Nations, 2006; Przybylski, 2008; Reichert, 2010; Chaturvedi, 2006, cited in Paranjape, 2011, and Pettit, 2012). According to Hawley et al. (2013: 5), among the 640,000 prison population in the E.U., there are a significant proportion of low-skilled Europeans. “Even though there are no exact data on the qualification levels of prisoners, it has been estimated that only three to five per cent (3 to 5%) of them would be qualified to undertake higher education, and in many countries there is a high instance of early school leaving among prisoners” (Hawley et al., 2013).</p> <p>Tanimu (2010) has found that a typical convict in Nigerian Prison is a semi-literate male in the prime of his youth (18-29 years). He is most likely convicted for committing property-related crime. Occupationally, he is either unemployed or self-employed in the lowest occupational ladder.</p> <p>The reasons given for re-offending are many, but as suggested in the following quote, vocational education, training and employment are internationally identified as pathways out of the recidivistic life of crime: “While many factors contribute to re-offending, offenders and ex-offenders tend to have skills levels well below those of the general population, and are much more likely to be unemployed” (Department for Education and Skills, 2005: 6), yet sustained employment is a key to leading a crime-free life. Low levels of qualifications have important negative effects on prisoners' employment prospects upon release, which has been found to be one of the key factors influencing whether or not ex-convicts re-offend. Thus, the provision of basic skills education, and particularly, vocational training, in prisons has an important role to play in the reintegration process of prisoners. However, as noted by the European prison rules, it is important to provide educational opportunities, which meet the needs of individual prisoners. This includes providing education and training also for those who have higher prior educational attainment (Hawley et al., 2013).</p> <p>Maxfield and Babbie (2008: 122) define recidivism as the re-occurrence of criminal behaviour. According to Scott and Marshall (2005: 552), recidivism is the conviction of crime on more than one occasion; thus, a recidivist is a person who re-offends (Scott and Marshall, 2005: 552). According to Maxfield and Babbie (2008), the rate of recidivism should be calculated by counting the number of prison release or by counting the numbers of offenders placed under community supervision who are re-incarcerated for technical violation or new offence within a uniform period of at-risk street time. According to Scott and Marshall (2005: 552), recidivism is measured in relation to the type of last sentence or last offence, as percentages re-offending, or re-convicted.</p> <p><strong>THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF PRISON</strong></p> <p>Historians have documented the existence of prisons in ancient Greece and Rome. For example, the Mamertine Prison, constructed in Rome in the 7th century B.C., consisted of a vast network of dungeons under the city’s main sewer (Champion, 2009). These subterranean cells held political dissidents and criminals for short periods of time in cramped, miserable conditions. However, the practice of confining wrongdoers for long periods as a form of punishment was not widespread until after the 15th century (Champion, 2009).</p> <p>With the march of time and advancement of knowledge and civilization, the conditions of prisons also improved considerably. Since the present day penology centres round imprisonment as a measure of rehabilitation of offenders, the prisons are no longer mere detention houses for the offenders but they seek to reform inmates for their future life. The modern techniques of punishment lay greater emphasis on reformation, correction and rehabilitation of offenders (paranjape, 2011: 418). The modern prison system in Nigeria is essentially based on the British prison model which in itself is an outcome of prison development in America during the late eighteenth century.</p> <p><strong>THE ORIGIN OF PRISONS IN NIGERIA</strong></p> <p>The origin of modern prisons service in Nigeria is traceable to 1861 (Nigerian Prisons Service, 2013). The progressive incursion of the British into the hinterland and the establishment of British protectorate toward the end of the nineteenth century necessitated the establishment of the prisons as the last link in the Criminal Justice System (Elias, 1967). Prisons modelled on the one first established in Lagos in 1872 spread across the country in line with the gradual expansion of the colonial jurisdiction and in 1876, the prison ordinances came into force (PTS Kaduna, 1991). Thus, in 1910, there already were prisons in Degema, Calabar, Onitsha, Benin, Ibadan, Sapele, Jebba and Lokoja (Orakwe, 2014). In 1920, a Commission was set up to report on prison conditions and in 1932; a borstal was established in Enugu (Egu, 1990; PTS Kaduna, 1991: 14). The prisoners were in the main used for public works and other jobs for the colonial administration (Arthur, 1991). According to Orakwe (2014), it was not until 1934 that any meaningful attempt was made to introduce relative modernization into prison service. It was at this time that Colonel V. L. Mabb was appointed Director of Prisons by the then Governor, Sir Donald Cameron (Orakwe, 2014).</p> <p><strong>NIGERIAN PRISONS TODAY</strong></p> <p>The abolition of Native Authority Prisons on the 1st of April, 1968 and the subsequent unification of the Prisons Service in Nigeria therefore marked the beginning of the Nigerian Prisons Service. In 1971, the government white paper on the reorganization of the prison was released. The establishment and growth of the prison is backed by various statutes, amongst which was the Prison Act No. 9 of 1972 (Nigerian Prisons Service, 1979; Orakwe, 2014), which was reviewed in 1990 and is currently under review. The Act, which is known as CAP 366, Laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1990, defines itself as ‘an act to make comprehensive provisions for the administration of prisons in Nigeria and other matters ancillary thereto’ (Nigerian Prisons Service, 1990: 1). The prison is charged, inter alia, with the responsibility of taking custody of those legally detained, identifying causes of their behaviour and retraining them to become useful citizens in the society (Federal Government of Nigeria, 1990: 3-5; Orakwe, 2014). From the foregoing, it seems clear that though the Decree makes secure custody the first role of the prisons, it also makes it explicit that reform and rehabilitation are the ultimate aims of the Prison Service.</p> <p>Today, there are 235 prisons across the 36 states and Federal Capital Territory (FCT) with a total capacity of 47,284. The inmate population has gradually grown from 43,312 to about 54,144 (male 53,069, female 1,075), with approximately 25,000 personnel (http://www.prisons.gov.ng/about/history.php). The Prisons Service now has a command structure that boasts of 8 zonal commands, 36 states commands, 1 FCT command, 144 prisons including farm centres and 83 satellite prisons. It also has four training schools, one Staff College and 2 Borstal Institutions (Orakwe, 2014).</p> <p>The above history, though clearly partial, is important to consider as: “[T]he correspondence between the ideal models of state institutions and their actual operation is complicated by the very process through which they come into being” (Aguirre, 2005: 11). We should not forget however that state institutions do not come into being once and for all; they are always in a process of coming into being. It is this fact that makes it imperative to focus analysis on ‘their actual operation’, their practices as well as their purported values or penal philosophies.</p> <p>Whilst educational provision for offenders usually has the primary aim of reducing reoffending, the association between a lack of basic skills and offending is, as we have seen, not readily demonstrated (Harper and Chitty, 2005). Education does however have much further reaching benefits that may have more indirect, but no less significant impacts. Oreh (2006) rightly observed that education in prison is necessary because its provision will make the prisons become places of continuous and informal learning rather than ‘schools of crime’. Although there is very little research in Nigeria on prisons education (for example, Yakubu, 2002; Mango, 2006; Oreh, 2006; Evawoma-Enuku, 2006), inter-state research and international meta-analyses demonstrate the significant contribution that education and employment make to the reduction in reoffending rates. According to the Nigerian Prison Service Manual (2011), the realization of the object of rehabilitation of convicted offenders is to be done through a complicated set of mechanisms consisting among others: conscientiousness, group work, case work session, recreational activities, religious services and adult and remedial education programmes, educational development project, skills acquisition programme, mid-range industrial production, agricultural service and after-care service programme. The prison’s services providers should not only identify the causes of the prisons’ inmates anti-social behaviour but also endeavours to set them on the road to reform through induced self-rediscovery and eventual change for the better.</p> <p>According to Federal Government of Nigeria (1989), some of the specific objectives of rehabilitative services in Nigerian prisons are to: ensure effective management of crisis situation of the prison inmates; an appropriate training for the prison inmates in order to reduce dependency; and promote the provision of adequate and accessible recreational and sporting facilities for the prison inmates. Rehabilitation services in Nigerian prisons therefore, should be aimed at increasing the educational and vocational skills of inmates, and their chances of success upon release. In order to accomplish these goals, prison inmates are encouraged to participate in rehabilitative programmes made available to them while in prison. This is crucial for prison inmates especially because many of them entered the prisons more socially, economically and educationally disadvantaged (Chaturvedi, 2006; Paranjape 2011; Pettit, 2012). The key to success in a free society for many of these socially, economically and educationally disadvantaged prison inmates is rehabilitation. There is no better way to help prison inmates re-enter the larger society successfully and break the in-and-out of jail cycle than to provide them with skills that they need to succeed on the outside world. Schuller (2009) describes how offenders often lack human, social and identity capital, and that engaging them in education can help on all three of these levels beyond increasing their ability to acquire qualifications (human capital). Clark and Dugdale (2008) assert that learning and skills might contribute something even more fundamental than reducing re-offending. Improving literacy skills might have the “potential for restoring to society those people who are excluded from full citizenship because they have yet to attain functional literacy. In short, reading interventions for offenders are justified not by reference to human wrongs but by reference to human rights” (Rice and Brooks, 2004: 2). Brooks similarly writes “Western governments … place less emphasis, but should place more, on the need for good basic skills as a human right so that everyone can fulfil their potential and therefore take a full role as private individuals, citizens, family members and employees – and probably earn more” (Brooks, 2010: 191). Enhanced personal development should be the central goal of learning (Schuller, 2009); and being individually empowering (Reuss, 1999); learning can have very positive effects on mental health (Field, 2009). Furthermore, offenders could benefit from acquiring the ability to better manage their own health needs (substance abuse, mental health) including learning to use health services to good effect (Schuller 2009). Research on offender perceptions, although limited, has highlighted some of the potential wider positive impacts of basic skills learning programmes, such as gains in self-esteem, self-confidence and motivation; having access to computers; and receiving encouragement for their progress (Adult Learning Inspectorate, 2004). Educational achievement, then, can have more than just direct, instrumental benefits. Arts based courses may have a distinct and important contribution to make, not least through links made with charities and voluntary organisations. Research into the impact of music based programmes for offenders in prisons found clear benefits and improvements in engagement with education more widely, interpersonal skills, improvements in social skills and relationships with prison staff and a decrease in aggressive behaviours. Some of the important features identified by offenders and staff which were seen to contribute to these benefits were participation in shaping the learning experiences, negotiating with others and sharing achievement through performance (Wilson et al., 2009).</p> <p>With this in mind the researcher has sought to understand, through this inquiry, how the known risks of re-offending could be reduced and re-integration improved. An important contextual factor in the current delivery of rehabilitative programmes and services is that of inadequate rehabilitative facilities. This factor has resulted in a significant increase in the prisoner re-offending in recent years. Individual offenders who serve their whole time – some people do not even get a parole term – are simply released from prison without any assistance whatsoever (Narelle, 2010). A major consequence of inadequate rehabilitative facilities is diminished accessibility to prison programmes and services.</p> <p>Despite calls for more comparative studies on penal institutions and inmates, the dominant axis of comparison remains the Anglo-American. Developing countries are arguably systematically excluded from comparative studies (King and Maguire, 1994; Weiss and South, 1998). While criminologists and practitioners have been active in the field of penal reform in developing countries, their reports remain limited to description and criticism with little by way of explanation or analysis. The tone of voice emanating from prisons in Africa notes that prisons are overcrowded, conditions are appalling, health is threatened, justice is slow, two-thirds of prisoners are waiting trial/not convicted, violence is the norm, and human rights are routinely violated (Aiyedogbo, 1988;Omorotionwman, 2005; Wines, 2005; Agomoh and Ogbozor, 2006; Sarkin, 2008; Amnesty International, 2008; Tenibiaje, 2010; Davidson and Chiemele, 2012). These voices, however, fail, of course, to tell us much about causes, dynamics or processes. Thus, this study takes as its starting point the need to account for prisons as institutions established to help inmates to get over their social handicaps and to remove the stigma that darkens their present and future life through rehabilitation. It is now widely acknowledged that rehabilitation schemes in prisons have been neglected by researchers seeking to study prisons despite repeated statements of their importance (Hawkins, 1976: 85; Thomas, 1978: 58–62; Liebling and Price, 2001: 4). Most studies of the prisons have been concerned with the sociological analysis of the prison as a social system and have examined the social structure, role and normative system, and value orientation of inmates (Goffman, 1961; McCorkle and Korn, 1954; Clemmer, 1958; Schraq, 1954; Civil Liberty Organization, 1995). These studies have developed propositions concerning the effect of prisons on both the institutional and post institutional behaviours of inmates. A number of studies (for example, Obioha, 1995; Adetula et al., 2010; Tenibiaje, 2010; Tanimu, 2010) have, hitherto, shown that contact with the prison institution in Nigeria makes the less hardened individuals to be more hardened in criminal activities upon release, with more tendencies than not, to relapse to criminal activities, which generates high frequency of recidivism.</p> <p>This study is justified because prison inmates are members of the larger society whose movement are restricted. The prison aside serving as custody for convicted people doubles as a rehabilitative centre. Functional prison facilities, no doubt play a vital role in the rehabilitation process. This study, therefore, becomes imperative, in that its findings will reflect the kind of attention the prison system in Nigeria receives from the public and policy makers. It is assumed the findings will either leave the policy makers fulfilled or further challenged; and bring about a general awareness for rehabilitative needs of the interned offenders. Omorotionwman (2005) has reported that the Nigerian prisons are in sordid state and that the conditions under which prisoners live are pathetic, and do not meet modern and international standards for prisons inmates all over the world. Although rehabilitative policies are necessarily influenced by value, resource, organizational, and political factors (Rezmovic, 1979), it is suggested that programmes that seek to reduce criminal involvement should be informed by the scientific data on what works. The goal should be to develop a clearer understanding of what should be done to successfully rehabilitate offenders (Rhine, 1998). Therefore, the question is “To what extent can the prison rehabilitate inmates?” The answer to this question will hopefully be achieved by empirically examining the experiences of the inmates.</p> <p>In the light of the above, the study seeks to explore what facilities are available in prison and why, how they are accessed or used, how staff respond to and facilitate rehabilitation of offenders (or inmates), and how inmates conduct their work within the facilities. This will involve a critique of inmates’ assessment of facilities in the prison, followed by an assessment of the inmates’ view of the prison social setting and general practices. The inmates’ view of the prison’s official attitude towards them and its implications for the rehabilitation ideals will be examined.</p> <p>An approach drawing from both quantitative and qualitative methodologies is adopted. The quantitative component – a survey of prisoners – will enables an exploration of prisoners’ use (and non-use) of rehabilitative facilities in prison. The qualitative component – both inmates and prison guards will be interviewed to generate data on how rehabilitation scheme is perceived, experiences of inmates, and how the scheme operates in prisons. Ikoyi prison has a population of 1,835 inmates and it is believed that recidivists will constitute a substantial portion. Data will be obtained from the interned offenders in Ikoyi prison, Lagos State, South West of Nigeria.    </p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The Nigerian prison facilities are undeniably in a deplorable condition. The Prison Act may have been unable to define the purposes of imprisonment, silent on the crucial service of rehabilitation, and archaic in its concept of revenue generation. The resultant structure is inadequate.</p> <p>The prisons in Nigeria are currently operating freely, and individual prison facilities lack a management information system that monitors cost effectiveness in prison industries (Omoni and Ijeh, 2009). There is no activity based cost accounting system for prison industries in Nigeria. This has resulted in a lack of financial transparency and precludes any possibility of a cost benefit or a cost effectiveness analysis of any given performance by the industry. Although most of the prisons have facilities that enable inmates engage in vocational training, the working tools are lacking and where there are existing trade and skills acquisition centres within the prison yards, they are either not functioning or unsuitable for some of the inmates who may prefer other trades and educational learning processes that are not existing in the prisons rehabilitation curriculum. In some prisons where they train the detainees on tailoring, there is only one sewing machine to a population of about 300 detainees. Besides not having tools, there are no instructors and workshops for training of the detainees (PrisonWatch, 2000). For example, there are no rehabilitative facilities in existence in Ijebu-Ode prison, except a cane-making workshop and the equipment in the workshop was provided by the Catholic Church through its Justice and Peace Department. The tailoring and wood-carving shops available are not functional (Aminu, 1997: 11). The same thing applies to facilities such as carpentry, knitting, welding and a host of others. Lack of adequate funding appears to be the main reason constraining the Nigeria prison from delivering on its mandate. Consequently, inmates are economically unproductive, physically idle and emotional disturbed (Dambazua, 2007 and Oshodi, 2010).</p> <p>Accessibility to education and training is becoming increasingly constrained because education centres have a limited capacity, and the massive build-up of prison population has further reduced the availability of education in prisons (Omoni and Ijeh, 2009). As a result, inmates make use of tree shades outside their cells and cellblocks as makeshift classrooms. In prisons such as Shendam, Wase, Lakushi, Agaie, Dekina, Lamingo, MSP Nassarawa, MSP Omu Aran, Kabba, Ankpa, and Idah in the North Central, there are no educational facilities (The National Human Rights Commission, 2012).</p> <p>Needs assessment and classification of offenders, which are done to ensure offenders experience progress in specific programmes, are rarely carried out by the prison administration at induction due to lack of meaningful programmes. Canton et al., (2011) assert that evaluation of risks (and needs) of offenders should be a component assessed prior to a programme being implemented. The absence of classification of inmates has made it possible for low risk offenders to be influenced into reoffending by the potent anti-social norms of their higher risk peers. This has encouraged inmates to get on one another’s nerves and friction between staff and inmates is quick to develop (Omorotionwman, 2005). Linked to this is the deteriorating ratio of staff to prisoners. This further precludes access to some programmes as a custodial officer needs to be present for the delivery of initiatives such as Vocational Education and Training (VET). In their absence these cannot be provided.</p> <p>The lack of harmony between prison staff and inmates is a major factor that comes in the way of prison administration in performing their rehabilitative function. This accounts for the culture of fragility and explosive social violence (in the manner of riot) that is re-current and descriptive of Nigerian prison community over the years. In Kuje Prison, for example, a riot which occurred on the 28 March, 2007, resulted in the death of two inmates and left many others injured. Similar circumstances led to at least two other riots in 2007, one in Kano Central Prison on 31 August, 2007 and the other in Ibadan’s Agodi Federal Prison on 11 September 2007, resulting in the death of almost 20 inmates (Davidson and Chiemele, 2012: 1).</p> <p>The availability of rehabilitative facilities, meaningful programmes and services may not have formed the priority consideration for the board that is responsible for the review of prisoners in Nigeria, but they remain a consideration. As noted by Przybylski (2008), a state of affairs whereby inmates are not provided an opportunity for self-improvement constantly warns of danger to social order, because almost every one of them will eventually return to the community. The result of all this is that inmates come out of prisons harder and more determined to deal a blow at the society that continues to punish them so cruelly. The three problems yearly exacerbate one another: little funds, little reformation, and self-reinforcing spiral of criminality. The result is a vicious cycle: little rehabilitation of prisoners, recycle of criminals, increased prison population, higher cost to tax payers, higher budgetary demands, lesser rehabilitation and higher rate of recidivism (PrisonWatch, 2000: 4). A continuous cycle of crime and punishment, otherwise referred to as recidivism, is thus instituted. Increased level of insecurity frightens away foreign investors, and tourists; and by implication, foreign capital greatly needed for national development is denied the nation. Recidivism contributes to high crime rates which have resulted in loss of lives and property, thereby threatening public peace, safety of lives and national cohesion. Also, criminal activities by such recidivists have made the country unsafe for economic and commercial activities for both local and foreign investors, sometimes, forcing them to relocate to safer climes. With such development, the country had lost billions of Naira which would have been invested in developmental projects that could benefit the Nigerian citizenry. In recent times, imprisonment is anchored on the ‘3Rs’ – “principle of Reformation, Rehabilitation and Re-integration”. However, the increase in the rate of recidivism among prisoners in Nigeria, which has been documented by studies (for example, Wilson, 2009; Soyombo, 2009; Agali, 2004 and Chenube, 2009; Abrifor et al. 2010; National Bureau of Statistics, 2010: 167) calls to question the effectiveness of the Nigerian Prisons Service in its reformatory, rehabilitation and re-integrating function. This was reiterate by the then Controller-General of Prisons that “if the Nigerian Prisons Service does not process these prison inmates and return them unreformed to the society, the society will be in for problems” (Ogundipe, 2006), and this is actually the case in contemporary Nigerian society. As a result, crime by former inmates alone accounts for a substantial share of current and perhaps, future crimes in Nigeria.</p> <p>Data from the Annual Abstract of the Statistics on inmates in Nigerian prisons indicate that in 2009 alone, a total of 156,351 prisoners were held as repeat offenders (recidivist) (National Bureau of Statistics, 2010: 167). Of the 156,351 prisoners held as repeat offenders, 149,187 were male, while 7,164 were female. A breakdown of the figure shows that 1,159 prisoners were convicted for six times (male 1,121 and female 38), 6,457 prisoners were convicted for five times (males 6,340, and female 117), 15764 prisoners were convicted for four times (male 15,366, and female 398), 20,022 prisoners were convicted three times (male 18,797, and female 1225), 25,582 prisoners were convicted twice (male 23,870, and female 1712), and 30,386 prisoners were convicted once (male 29240, and female 1146); with only 56,981 prisoners as first offenders  (male 544,53, and female 2,528) (National Bureau of Statistics, 2010: 167).</p> <p>From this background, peace, safety of lives and property are threatened thereby affecting the rate of investment in social and economic growth and developmental processes. Nigeria, as nation-state, deserves a criminal justice system it can be proud of. Thus, it becomes imperative to examine the declining facilities in Ikoyi prison, South West of Nigerian and accompanying challenges on rehabilitation of offenders.</p> <p><strong>1.3       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is aimed at investigating how declining prison facilities impede the rehabilitation of offenders, using Ikoyi prison, in Lagos State, South West of Nigeria, as the study location. It is believed that the outcome of this inquiry will invoke a programme of action, which will be adopted to improve funding of prisons and services, so as to facilitate offender rehabilitation, and catalyze re-integration when discharged. These will serve additive values to national security and development. In view of this, the research will be guided by the following objectives:</p> <p>1.         To find out if there is a correlation between needs assessment and classification of offenders and their progress in rehabilitation process.</p> <p>2.         To find out if there is a correlation between participation of inmates in vocational education and training and reoffending.</p> <p>3.         To find out if inmates tortured by prison officers are more likely to be driven toward collective action.</p> <p>4.         To find out if there is a relationship between improved prison industry and creation of jobs opportunities for inmates.</p> <p><strong>1.4       RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>To achieve the above-stated objectives, the study will provide answer to the following research questions:</p> <p>1.      Is there a correlation between needs assessment and classification of offenders and their progress in the rehabilitation process?</p> <p>2.      Are offenders, who participated in vocational education and training programmes while in prison, more likely to reoffend, either in prison or after their release?</p>                                                          \n\nDECLINING PRISON FACILITIES AS IMPEDIMENT TO THE REHABILITATION OF OFFENDERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DECLINING PRISON FACILITIES AS IMPEDIMENT TO THE REHABILITATION OF OFFENDERS", "id": 135}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This study was carried out to examine the effect of nutritional knowledge on nutritional practice and belief among pregnant women in Oshodi/Isolo Local Government Area of Lagos State. The study focused on women attending the ante-natal clinic at five Health Centres in Lagos State. The subjects were made of women of various ages with different socio-cultural and economic levels. The descriptive research survey design was used to assess the opinions of selected respondents from five health centres in the Local Government under review. A total of 200 (two hundred) pregnant women were selected as sample size of this study, which represented the entire population of the study. Three research questions were raised in the study, while three hypotheses were formulated and tested. The research questions were analysed using the simple percentage frequency counts, while the hypotheses were tested with the application of the independent t-test and Pearson Product Moment Correlational Coefficient at 0.05 level of significance. At the end of the exercise, the results that emerged showed that: there is a significant effect of nutritional-knowledge on nutritional practice among pregnant women in Lagos State, there is a significant relationship between nutritional-knowledge and health vitality of the new born child in Lagos State, and there is a significant relationship between nutritional-knowledge and belief system among pregnant women in Lagos State. Based on the data analyses carried out and the conclusions thereafter, the following recommendations among others were made: every pregnant woman, should be aware of the importance of intake of good foods and drugs that are helpful to the unborn child and the mother and it is recommended that women who are pregnant should be exposed to the values inherent in good foods and effective drugs.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       Introduction</strong></p> <p>Nutrition is a process of getting the right food for good health, growth and development. It is also the kind of food you eat and the way it affects your health. Good nutrition is vital for good health and it is one of the requirements to meet physiological changes and activity needs of different ages. Nutrition is the process of supplying and receiving nourishment; it is the science of food values (Advance Learners’ Dictionary, 1980).</p> <p>Nutrition as the process of giving or getting the right kind of food for good health and growth (Krause, 2004).</p> <p>The knowledge of nutrition by pregnant women is very important, as this will enable them to know the kind of food or drugs to take at any given time. The knowledge of nutrition enables pregnant women to be aware of the type of nutrition to be taken, helps pregnant women to identity and eat those foods that assist their unborn babies to be healthy (Uzor, 2006).</p> <p>Believing in an intake of particular foods by pregnant women is very essential, because pregnant women who believe in taking certain foods and drugs not only remain healthy, but assist their unborn babies to be healthy. Pregnant women who believe in taking certain diets, deliver their babies strong and healthy (Siimon, 2000).</p> <p>The practice of nutrition among pregnant women is equally important. This is because, it is one thing to have the knowledge of nutrition and or believe in intake of particular foods, it is very crucial and recommendable for pregnant mothers to form the regular habits of practicing eating good and healthy diets or foods as the benefits therefrom are great (Barnes, 1990).</p> <p>The knowledge, believe and practices of food nutrition differ in different places. For instance, in India and any other developed countries of the world, pregnant women compulsorily develop the habit of practicing nutrition due to the kind of environment they are in. For instance, pregnant mothers in the developed world, are more exposed to better nutrition than those in the developing world (Lewis, 2001). They have the wherewithal to purchase and eat whatever diet they want.</p> <p>In Nigeria, many women who are pregnant are not exposed to knowledge, belief and practice of nutrition. This is due to the level of education among Nigerian women. Most pregnant women in Nigeria are illiterate and dwell in the rural areas where information dissemination is difficult and therefore, most pregnant women in Nigeria do not practice nutrition (Onuoha, 2002). Not only being illiterates, they lack the wherewithal to purchase and at whatever diet they need due to poverty.</p> <p>The practice and belief in nutrition among women who are pregnant in Lagos State, cannot be different from what is obtainable in Nigeria. Except that most pregnant women who dwell in the city of Lagos are aware of nutrition and its effect on health vitality of both mothers and their unborn babies. Most women who live in cities of Lagos State, have much information on nutrition and do develop positive belief and exhibits good practices of the intake of certain foods and drugs during their pregnancies (Nkemdirim, 2007). </p> <p>Good food is a basic necessity for normal organ development and function, reproduction, growth and maintenance of optimum resistance to infection and ability to repair body damages (Banks, 1993).</p> <p>Good nutrition is a fundamental part of a healthy life-style. It is very essential if you are planning to become pregnant. Both mother and father to be need to be healthy to provide strong genetic material for the child to be and a healthy womb to grow into it (Almond, 2000).</p> <p>Nutritional beliefs of pregnant women mean traditional beliefs regarding harmful and beneficial foods for women during pregnancy. There are also beliefs regarding the optimal amount of food to be taken during pregnancy for a successful reproductive out come. These beliefs may or may not conform to the modern biomedical notions about the proper type and amount of food needed by pregnant women to safeguard maternal nutrition, adequate growth of foetus and safe delivery (Allport, 1999). For instance, “An economy and political weekly published, September 10 2004”, revealed that in India, the food taken  by a large section of pregnant women is deficient in caloric content, protein, and other nutrients(a leading cause of maternal and child mortality) (Monde, 2001).</p> <p>Three well known reasons for low nutritional status of pregnant women in India are wide spread poverty; discrimination against women and female children in household food distribution and health care; and lack or poor quality of antenatal care (Alpha, 1998).</p> <p>Whether or not the beliefs and practice regarding food during pregnancy are significant additional reasons for the low nutritional status of pregnant and undesirable reproductive outcome in India is an important question which has been hardly addressed by scholars (Bruce, 1999).</p> <p>The practices about food during pregnancy by women are generally by choice (Bruke, 1991). For instance, the concept of hot and cold food are quite wide spread in India and many other countries, but the underlining criteria for classifying food as “hot” or “cold” are often not clear.</p> <p>A balance of hot and cold is necessary for body wellbeing and since pregnancy generates a state of hotness, it is desirable to bring a balance by cold foods (Mathew and Benjamin 1999; Nichter and Nichter 1989).</p> <p>Generally, adequate nutrition in pregnant women is one of the most crucial components of healthy society. Many of the chronic, on going problems that women experience in health, employment and productivity can be alleviated if they receive adequate nutrition through out their life cycle (Edward, 1996).</p> <p>Poor nutrition in pregnant women creates a self-perpetuating cycle. Infants born with low birth weight or presenting with retarded growth are at risk for higher-than-average rate of morbidity and mortality during infancy and childhood (Betty, 1999). The need for balance diet during pregnancy to meet the nutritional needs foetus and mother (Betty, 1999).</p> <p>On the other hand reported that various types of nutrients needed during pregnancy for physical and mental wellbeing of pregnant women, the developing foetus and the placenta includes protein, carbohydrate, fats vitamins, minerals, roughages or fibers and water(Zinger 1999). Krause laid an emphasis on the body condition resulting from the utilization of essential nutrients available to the body as body nutritional status (Krause, 2001).</p> <p>The pregnant woman during the last trimester needs small but frequent needs rather than several large ones at a time, she needs high energy diet for labour and lactation, the requirements for food differs from those of non-pregnant women (Krause, 2001).</p> <p>During this period also, all dietary essentials must be increased proportionally in order to supply the additional demands of the mother and the developing foetus. When there is nutritional inadequacy, the mother immune system reduces, thereby exposing her to various illnesses, intrauterine death may occur, pregnancy may be threatened and the woman may loose her life. Poor nutrition during this period may result in foetal abnormalities plus brain damages and low birth weight (Osareren, 1996).</p> <p>Nutritional status of the pregnant woman must be maintained prior to conception, especially the adolescent girl. Health education of the mother at antenatal, postnatal and child welfare clinic should be emphasized according to (Nzeribe, 2003). Demonstration with local food should be used by midwives to highlight on the preparation, quantity and combinations required to get a balance diet. This will help prevent and reduce complications due to malnutrition.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study was carried out on the assessment of nutritional knowledge beliefs and practices of pregnant women and their effect on their nutritional status. The study focused on pregnant women. The subjects were made up of women of various ages with different social- culture and economic levels. Energy given food items (starches) were considered good most often, while easily available protective (vegetable and fruits) and body building food items (proteins) were infrequently mentioned or avoided for cultural, religious and health reasons. Nearly three quarter of the women did not gain enough to meet the commended weekly weight gain 24.6% lost weight (Nwosu, 1990).</p> <p>Traditional beliefs rather than the more frequently cited reasons of poverty and non-availability of foods are seen as major factors limiting the quality of diet among respondents (Osondu, 1994).   </p> <p>The importance of nutrition, its knowledge and practices by a pregnant mothers cannot be overemphasized. This is because, the awareness of diet, the belief in it and the practices of eating well during pregnancy help a pregnant woman not only to deliver a healthy baby, but to be healthy herself (Uzor, 2000).</p> <p>A woman eats during pregnancy greatly affects both herself and her growing child. According to them, the fetus depends on the mother for an adequate prenatal diet, since so much demands are made on the woman’s system, there is the need for her to be well nourished (Bhatia, Katiya and Agarwaal, 1990). Researchers have carried out a study on the effect of knowledge of nutrition and its practices on health vitality of the unborn child (Mundi, Allport and Allport, 1991). Their finding showed that good diet is helpful for the formation, growth and development of the fetus. Not only that, the knowledge and practices of nutrition, the belief in eating the correct diet by pregnant mothers to delivery of babies who are not only healthy, but weigh normally.</p> <p>Having the knowledge of nutrition or diet and believing in the same are one thing, but practicalizing what one knows and believes is another and most important for the pregnant woman (Uzomah, 2007).Knowledge of certain foods and drugs and belief in them, will cause pregnant women to practice their intakes (Amaonye, 2000). For instance, for pregnant women to take foods rich in vitamin and protein such as: meat, milk, fish, eggs, liver, kidney, beans, vegetables, fruits, bread, and should take folic acid and fergon tablets for healthy babies to be formed and delivered without problems (Barnes, 2001).</p> <p>Globally speaking, women who are pregnant should be aware of the intake of foods and drugs that promote health vitality in both the unborn child and the mother (World Health Organisation (WHO), 1979). In Nigeria, awareness has been created on the kind of foods pregnant mothers should take for them to be healthy and maintain balance. Also, in Lagos State, a sensitization mechanism has been put in place for the promotion of nutritional knowledge, beliefs and practices among pregnant women. This has helped most pregnant women to be aware of certain food-intakes and drugs that give them the necessary health vitality in pregnancy (Nkwor, 2001).</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>Statement of Problem</strong></p> <p>In our society, there is strong attachment to beliefs and cultural norms even among the educated ones. While we agree that some of these beliefs and the practices are good, the others may not be so good. Recorded advances in medicine and medical services not withstanding, majority of the pregnant women seem to prefer taking instruction on nutrition and antenatal healthcare from traditional birth attendants. This diverse information have effect on the health of pregnant women thus the need to carry out this study on effect of nutritional knowledge, beliefs and practices among pregnant women.</p> <p>Understanding what they eat and what they forbid or abhor will enable the health worker structure a balance diet for them in line with available local food stuffs. Also, finding a means of spreading health talk on nutrition during pregnancy.</p> <p><strong>1.4       Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions were raised in this study:</p> <p>(1)        Is there any nutritional knowledge among pregnant women in Lagos State?</p> <p>(2)        Is there any nutritional belief system among pregnant women in Lagos State?</p> <p>(3)        Do women practice nutrition during their pregnancy?</p> <p>(4)        Is there any relationship between the knowledge of nutrition and health vitality of the newborn child?</p> <p>(5)        Is there any relationship between the nutritional-knowledge of pregnant women and their practice of it?</p> <p><strong>1.5       Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main purpose of this study is to examine assessment of nutritional0knowledge, beliefs and practices of pregnant women and their effect of their nutritional status in Lagos State.</p> <p>The following are the specific objectives of the study:</p> <p>(1)        To find out whether pregnant women have knowledge of nutrition.</p> <p>(2)        To examine whether pregnant women have nutritional belief system.</p> <p>(3)        To investigate whether pregnant women practice the intake of good food/drugs.</p> <p>(4)        To find out whether there is relationship between the knowledge of nutrition and health vitality of the new born child.</p> <p>(5)        To examine whether there is relationship between nutritional knowledge of pregnant women and their practice of it.</p> <p><strong>1.6       Research Hypotheses</strong></p> <p>These null hypotheses were formulated and tested in this study:</p> <p>(1)               H0: There will be no significant effect of nutritional-knowledge on practice of it among pregnant women.</p> <p>H1: There will be significant effect of nutritional-knowledge on practice of it among pregnant women.</p> <p>(2)               H0: There will be no significant relationship between the knowledge of nutrition and health vitality of the new born child.</p> <p>H1: There will be significant relationship between the knowledge of nutrition and health vitality of the new born child.</p> <p>(3)               H0: There will be no significant relationship between nutritional knowledge and practice of it among pregnant women in Lagos State.</p> <p>H1: There will be significant relationship between nutritional knowledge and practice of it among pregnant women in Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.8</strong><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The significant of this study to the pregnant women is for them to be more informed and enlightened on the importance of balanced diet during pregnancy, which will result in a healthy mother and child, as well as dispelling some rumors, superstition and old wives tale about nutrition in pregnancy.</p> <p>Findings from this study will help health workers to identify the areas of concentration during antenatal health education/ health talk.</p> <p>The findings will also contribute toward the improvement of the nutritional knowledge and practices of pregnant women, promote their well-being and prevent complications which may endanger their lives during delivery as a result of poor nutrition.

At some point in live, the older persons are disengage from their long life activities and thus, they are deprived of some basic things. The society had been structured that the older persons cannot hold some particular posts or performs some particular activities. The last ASUU-LASU strike has some of the elements of retirement as its core problem with the Government. The older persons are still generally stigmatized, living below expectation and still relegated in the Sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this study, therefore, is to examine the means of livelihood, living conditions and coping strategies of older persons. Disengagement theory and conflict theory were used to explain the phenomenon. The study made use of quantitative research method for data collection. The quantitative method involved the distribution of 150 questionnaires but which 149 questionnaires were returned. This implied that there were about 99.3% questionnaires returned. The quantitative method of data collection was done through questionnaire distribution and analyzed via the software called Software Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The data collected were analyzed using simple percentage and frequency distribution. Three (3) hypotheses were tested and all were significant. The findings of the study were that the older persons were not been cared for adequately by their family members. The society disengages the older people from its economic mainstream without a replacement for their livelihood. It was also observed that the living condition of the older persons in Ojo Local Government correlates with their livelihood. Their statuses are relative low and thus their living conditions are relatively poor. They are making efforts to improve their livelihood by engaging in various economic activities. The study recommends that every family having older persons should not abandon them but try everything possible to help their living conditions. Furthermore, Government too should put the older people’s livelihood at heart and make it visible in their policies. Furthermore, Non-Governmental Organizations should also look into the plights of the older persons in Ojo Local Government.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Sociologists do not question the idea that age and ageing are linked to biological and psychological development, but they cannot be fully understood without reference to their social context. Just as race and sex were once seen in purely biological and psychological terms but now viewed sociologically through concepts such as ethnicity and gender, age can also be seen in sociological terms. From this perspective, age can be seen as, in part, a social construction. The meaning of old age varies from society to society. In the traditional societies, the elderly are revered for their wisdom and have high social status and considerable power (Haralambos et al, 2008). The social status of the elderly have, however, crashed in the contemporary society. At this particular stage, most of the older persons might have been disengaged from their long-life activities. Poverty, emotional and material neglect are the major challenges faced by the aged especially when their family members are nowhere to be found in terms of support.</p> <p>Most developed countries of the world have accepted the chronological age of 65 years as a definition of ‘elderly’ or older person, but like many westernized concepts, this does not adapt well to the situation in Africa (World Health Organization, 2014). Age classification varied between differences or functional ability related to the workforce, but more often than not was a reflection of the political and economic situation of countries, which could also include the life expectancy of the people of the country. Many a time, the definition is linked to the retirement age, which in some instances, was lower for women than men. This transition in livelihood became the basis for the definition of old age which occurred between ages of 45 and 55 for women and between the ages of 55 and 75 years for men (Thane, 1978).</p> <p>When attention was drawn to older populations in many developing countries, the definition of old age many times followed the same path as that in more developed countries, that is, the government sets the definition by stating a retirement age. Considering that a majority of old persons in sub-Saharan Africa live in rural areas and work outside the formal sector, and thus expect no formal retirement or retirement benefits, this imported logic seems quite illogical. This is one of the flaws of the definition of older persons from the western world because most of the dwellers in the rural areas of the developing countries work in the informal sector and the application of retirement to old age would not be substantive to work for them. Further, when this definition is applied to regions where relative life expectancy is much lower and size of older population is much smaller, the utility of this definition becomes even more limited. Thus, the definition of older persons shouldn’t be given from a myopic point of view but should consider the fact that the human variation is not an abstract concept but a global phenomenon and the all encompassing concept of age should be put into consideration. </p> <p>A single definition, such as chronological age or social, cultural, functional markers e.t.c, is commonly used by, amongst others, demographers, sociologists, anthropologists, economists and researchers, it seems more appropriate in Africa to use a combination of chronological, functional and social definitions. Despite Nigeria is considered and classified among the developing countries, it still maintain the definition of 65 years (retirement age) for an old person.</p> <p>The population of older people is on the increase worldwide. Despite the fact that the life expectancy of humans in developing countries like Nigeria is lower than that of the developed countries. Advances in medicine had contributed to this phenomenon which had seen the population of the Western world to age gracefully and constitute a old population while the developing countries is having a young population due to high fertility rate and lower life expectancy..</p> <p>Demographically, in most nations of the world, persons below 15 years and 65 and above are regarded as the dependent population which is in contrast to those who are between the ages of 15 and 64 years of age, who are seen as the independent population. The individuals who are 65 and above must have gone through the first stage of dependency (0 – 14 years), second stage of being dependent (15–64 years) and back being dependent again due to old age which must have disengaged then from the active activities in the society.</p> <p>Livelihood means the way one earns money in order to survive. It also connotes the current condition of individual and households and the ways or means via which they reproduce themselves. Some of the socio-economic factors that may impact on the livelihood of the older persons include relative wealth, poverty, access to resources and ownership of property/assets (Amaike, 2005).</p> <p>Coping strategy could be referred to the specific efforts, both behavioral and psychological, that people employ to master, tolerate, reduce, or minimize stressful events. There are two general coping strategies: problem-solving strategies are efforts to do something active to alleviate stressful circumstances, whereas emotion-focused coping strategies involve efforts to regulate the emotional consequences of stressful or potentially stressful events. Research indicates that people use both types of strategies to combat most stressful events (Folkman &amp; Lazarus, 1980). The older persons engage in different coping strategies to keep body, soul and spirit together. For some of them who retired in the formal sectors, the set up small or medium scale businesses like rental services, renting out of building material among others to get their feet grounded after they must have been disengaged from the activities they have done for almost half of the life. Some other people, who had no opportunity of such, go into alms begging and some others depend largely on family members and relatives.</p> <p>Being old does not necessarily make people poor, it is just that the risk of being poor increases. Those people who are poor in old age are most likely to be those who have earned least in their working days or worked outside the formal sector where pensions and other benefits would be given to them (Moore et al, 2001).</p> <p><strong>1.2      STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>In many societies of the world, older persons must continue to earn their living so long as possible they want to survive. However, the exclusion of older persons from income-generating activities is common and livelihood recovery activities are often planned without considering the capacities of older persons; For example, government’s intervention programme like buying of tractors for the older farmers may not be what the farmers need. Older persons may be more affected during conflict because they are often custodians of the land that is ravaged or occupied. Older women’s position in the informal economic sector can leave them with few marketable skills and no retirement compensation. Older widows, in particular, are often among the most marginalized in cultures where the inheritance codes dispossess them on their husband’s death.</p> <p>The discrimination and stigmatization attached to the term ‘old age’ or ‘older persons’ is not only a national issue but a global phenomenon as well.</p> <p>In the recent years, most developing countries of the world are adopting the system practiced by the developed countries in which they help provide livelihoods in terms of pensions on retirement in old age which may be sponsored by the state or employer. We must, however, consider those that were never opportune to work in any government parastatal or with a private employer as well as those that were retrenched before attaining the retirement age.</p> <p>In Nigeria, what is visible to everyone is that supports given to older persons are chiefly the work of their respective families, which means that any old person who didn’t plan well for his/her old age and still lack a family to care and cater for his/her needs is doomed. These old people engage in different activities such as fishing, carpentry, butchery, site-labouring, farming and others go into alms begging to keep body, spirit and soul together as coping strategies. Most of these activities are aimed at strengthening their survival instinct and for few others, to stay fit.</p> <p>The cost on health care is relatively high for the aged as they frequently have one health issue or the other based on biological factors attributed to old age. The little gotten to stay alive will be snuffed out on health care and for those that cannot afford this or gave families to support them may either take to aims begging or live with the health challenges till death take their lives away.</p> <p>They standard of living is another issue faced by the aged. There is no market anywhere that sells same item at different prices using the working class and the non-working class as criteria as regards to the standard of living. The problems faced by the elderly are so numerous and the quality of life for the aged is pathetically degrading in all ramifications.</p> <p><strong>1.3      RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1.     What are the means of livelihood available to older persons in Ojo Local Government?</p> <p>2.     What is the current socio-economic status of older persons in Ojo Local Government?</p> <p>3.     Have the livelihood of the older persons affected their living conditions?</p> <p>4.     What are the various formal and informal coping strategies available to older persons in Ojo Local Government?</p> <p>5.     Are the older persons still largely stigmatized or discriminated by others?</p> <p><strong>1.4      OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>1.     To examine the means of livelihood available to older persons in Ojo Local Government.</p> <p>2.     To discover the current socio-economic status of older persons in Ojo Local Government</p> <p>3.     To examine if the livelihood of the older persons affects their living conditions</p> <p>4.     To investigate the various formal and informal coping strategies available to older persons in Ojo Local Government</p> <p>5.     To investigate the extent to which older persons are stigmatized in the area.</p> <p><strong>1.5      SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The findings of this study will be of immense benefit to the Government and bodies like non-governmental organizations (NGO’s), Human Rights Activists etc. Specifically it will help the government of Nigeria to plan, given that; the problems faced by old people are exposed and adequately addressed.

Social construction, sales and usage of secondhand clothing. Certain conditions compel individual into taking decisions and actions. Sales and usage of secondhand clothing is a major occupation, for which, Igbo people are famous. With the economic downturn, more Igbo people have taken to the sales of secondhand clothing. Today, sales of secondhand clothing are no longer exclusive Igbo affairs. Government policy has caused inflation, which has in turn, deprived people employment and even choices in terms of wears. As a result, patronage of used clothes that was a character of the low income earner, and people with no or low education, has become an attraction to educated folks as well as medium income earners. The rising population of the patrons of used clothing has in effect, significantly led to a rise in importation of used items especially through illegal perceptions. This study is carried out with duly valued questionnaires and indepth interview were used as instrument to collect primary data from 150 respondents from various market in Alimosho which are Kantagua. Igando, Ikotun and Egbeda market for statistical analysis. The results of data collected were analyzed and transcribed with Pearson’s Product moment correlations statistical tool to test the three (3) hypotheses formulated. The result of the three hypotheses tested indicated that: there is a significant relationship between social construction of sales and usage of secondhand clothing in Alimosho Local Government, consumer do attached meaning to the usage of second-hand clothing in Alimosho Local Government and problems associated with the sales and usage of second-hand clothing in Alimosho local Government area of Lagos metropolis. The findings of this research revealed that the sales and usage of secondhand clothing have adverse effect on the nation economy which ranges from diseases, loss of cultural values and unemployment. The study reveals that people also benefits from the sales and usage of secondhand clothing as a result of factors which are durability, quality and cost. From this study, it was also realized that there are various places where people get secondhand clothing from and people attached meanings to it. It recommended that consumers should appreciate and patronize local products, if such products meet their needs and expectations in the face of competing brands from oversea. No nation became advanced suddenly; some of them sacrificed and had an inward orientation that favoured their economies. It is better to encourage domestic producers of this product to put in their best to make the product viable and saleable. That local fabric/garment producers need to address themselves to the socio-economic factors influencing secondhand clothes traders to prefer these imported items.  Attention should be given to the implications on local production and marketing if the local industry is to meet consumer needs satisfactorily, the industry should strive to make high domestic sales so that exportation makes a small contribution to business performance.  Domestic sales will make local industries almost self-reliant. The Nigerian government through the standards organization of Nigeria (SONs) need to monitor quality of locally produced clothing so that consumers within and without Nigeria are not disappointed. Finally, enlightenment campaigns and workshops must be conducted to train and reorientate both producers and consumers. Also research and development institute that will take care of this sector should be put in place or become more functional if it is already in existence.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0</strong><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>The social construction of sales and usage of second hand clothing has been a contemporary issues in Nigeria which cannot be overemphasized. Secondhand clothing (SHC) traces their origin from wealthy westerners who contribute their obsolete clothing as donations to charity organizations (Dougherty, 2004; Slotterback, 2007). Larger charities first sort through the donations to add to their stock stores and then sell the surplus to secondhand clothing dealers to help generate funds towards assistance programs. Slotterback (2007) reported that about 80% of the donated clothing is usually sold to secondhand clothing merchants. The merchants sort the secondhand clothing by condition and then categorize in groups which they bundle in bales whose prices vary according to quality of the contents. Clothing merchants from the importing countries visit the offices of exporters to ascertain the quality, negotiate the price, pay for the bales and then ship the clothing to the country of origin (Olumide, 2011).  It has been observed presently that Nigeria and Kenya is one of the largest importers of secondhand clothing (locally referred to as ‘Okirika, Benddown boutique and Tokunbo while Kenya called it “Mitumba’ meaning ‘onslaught’) in Sub Sahara Africa respectively.</p> <p>Buying behaviour according to Dawson et al (2006), are set of attitudes that characterize the patterns of consumers' choices. Apart from the essential internal factors, which are recognized as influential to buying behaviour, there are a number of external situational contexts that affect consumer choices. Consumer behaviour is a combination of customers' buying consciousness and external incentives which are likely to result in behaviour remodeling. The society’s culture such as norms, philosophies, settlement, customs religion, festivity, class, lifestyle and other subculture influence how individual consumers buy and use secondhand products, and help explain how groups of consumers behave.  There has been a current need for individuals and families to develop sustainable ways of living. One of the important areas of sustainable living is through maintainable clothing and textile consumption. Maintainable consumption is using resources in a way that minimizes harm to the environment, while supporting the well-being of people (OECD, 2008). Maintainable clothing or fashion consumption is the use of clothing for purposes beyond utilitarian needs which is achieved while enabling the</p> <p>future generations to meet their needs (Nordic Initiatives, Clean and Ethical (NICE, 2012).  Secondhand Clothing trade (SHCT) represents an insignificant proportion of the total global trade in clothing (0.5%), more than 30% of the imports goes to the Sub Sahara African (SSA) countries (Baden &amp; Barber, 2005). Despite being overtaken by imports from Asia to Africa, the use of Secondhand Clothing still significant.</p> <p>According to Mangieri (2006) and Slotterback (2007) opined that having increased drastically since 1990 the global Secondhand Clothing trade (SHCT) is worth more than USD 200 billion each year with almost all countries in the world becoming involved in it either as exporters, processors, re exporters or importers. Used clothing markets exist in over 100 countries globally (Slotterback, 2007). The United States, the Netherlands and Japan participate in SCHT as major exporters while the developing countries like Nigeria are the major importers and consumers of Secondhand clothing (Baden and Barber, 2005). </p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>STATEMENT OF  PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The economic downturn of the past has affected nearly every segment of the Nigeria economy of the past has affected nearly every segment of the Nigeria economy .The sales and usage of secondhand clothing is one of the business, people are engaging themselves with and its increasingly gaining ground in Nigeria. The rapid increase of population unemployment is one of the major factors pushing many individuals to sell and buy secondhand clothing, all over the world.</p> <p>Nigeria as a country is posed with a lot of problems, which includes poverty ,unemployment, lack of resources, and low wage income are making individuals sell and use secondhand clothing.</p> <p>Typically, the importation of used clothes would result in a downward shift of the demand curve in the new apparel industry. According to studies (Slotterback 2007) many reasons accounts for the sales and usage of secondhand clothing.</p> <p>1 .Unemployment among individuals.</p> <p>2..Poverty, both relative and absolute poverty.</p> <p>3. Low wage income and lack of better job opportunities.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong><strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In this study, an attempt was made to provide answers to the following questions.</p> <p><strong>i.</strong>What are the meanings attached to the sales and usage of secondhand clothing by people?</p> <p><strong>ii.</strong>What are the reasons why people use and sale secondhand clothing?</p> <p><strong>iii.</strong>What categories of people use secondhand clothing?</p> <p><strong>iv.</strong>What are the business strategies involved in the sales of secondhand clothing?</p> <p><strong>v.</strong>What are the problems associated with the sales and usage of secondhand clothing?</p> <p><strong>1.3      OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is to investigate social construction of sales and usage of second-hand clothing in Alimosho local government area of Lagos metropolis. This is however divided into the following sub objectives;</p> <p>i.        To know whether there is any meaning attached to the sales and usage of second-hand clothing by people of Alimosho local government area of Lagos metropolis.</p> <p>ii.      To ascertain the reasons why people use and sell secondhand clothing</p> <p>iii.    To identify the categories of people that use secondhand clothing Alimosho local government area of Lagos metropolis</p> <p>iv.   To identify the business strategies involved in the sales of secondhand clothing.</p> <p>v.     To examine the problems associated with the sales and usage of secondhand clothing.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong><strong>            SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will be of great importance to policymakers in the sense that it will be an assistance to make rightful and necessary policy that will encourage and favorable to Nigerian textile industry, individual have found that thrift stores often reflect the community in which they reside and quality clothing with the tags still in some wealthier neighborhoods. Also, Goodwill found to be expensive, as far as thrift store goods or cloth cheaper than new one. Their prices are definitely higher, but it does seem that they do a better job of filtering out junk, spouses often believe that the level of income determines the purchasing power, researchers and general public in the sense that it will assists them to know the adverse effect of social construction of sales of usage secondhand clothing, causes and solution to the consumption.</p> <p>The Nigeria Demographic Health Survey(NDHS) significantly emphases that an ideal vehicle for studying not only the linkages between secondhand clothing usage and health and demographic outcomes. This study will help to solve current or existing problem as it affect Textile Company in Nigeria. It will also help the government in terms of planning and budget revenue in the appropriate ways putting all things into consideration such as what the people so desire. This study would raise various suggestions and recommendations that will go a long way to minimize these problems and their attendance effects. Student writing their research project on similar topic will be guided as the finding and recommendations will be serve as a map, pointing them to the path to treat. Undertaken a study of this nature will expose the researcher to rigorous and challenging exercise of writing a project, which need a lot of concentration handwork and patience. </p> <p><strong>1.5      SCOPE AND DELIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is designed to investigate the social construction of sales and usage of second-hand clothing in Alimosho local government area, Lagos metropolis. Specifically, the scope covers social construction of sales and usage of second-hand clothing in Iyana-Ipaja, Egbeda and Ikotun area of Lagos State. This covers:</p> <p>a. Iyana Ipaja (Kantagwa Market)</p> <p>b. Ikotun ( Ikotun Market)</p> <p>c. Egbeda (Egbeda Market)</p> <p>This study is utmost important simply because the researcher discovered that most of the people living in the aforementioned area prefers secondhand clothing to new one due to the presence of large markets in that area such as Ikotun BRT Terminal and Kontogora market. This research study, like any other research is bound to have limitations, through these limitations does not have significant effect on the validity of the study. This include:</p> <p>Insufficient fund to carry out the study. It should be noted that money will be needed for transportation to the field, typing and printing etc. and shortage of it (money), may affect the proper scrutiny of this study. Also inadequate information from the respondents serves as another major factor that may affect this research exercise. More so, shortage or inadequate time to carry out the research work cannot also but mentioned among those other factors that serves as a constraints to this study.</p> <p><strong>1.6      DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>For better understanding of the various terms related to and in this research project, it is necessary to briefly define these term m their general meaning and specific contextual application to the topic under discourse:</p> <p><strong>SALES: </strong>In general, a transaction between two parties where the buyer receives goods (tangible or intangible), services and/or assets in exchange for money.</p> <p><strong>SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION: </strong>This is perception of consumer towards any social phenomenon and the meaning attached to it. Social construction is something you might not be aware of. You are somewhat living in segregation depending on what gender, race and class you are. Race, class and gender don’t really mean anything. They only have a meaning because society <em>gives</em> them a meaning. Social construction is how society groups people and how it privileges certain groups over others.</p> <p><strong>SECONDHAND CLOTHING: </strong>Items of clothing that have been previously owned by someone else. Besides, second-hand or used good is one that is being purchased by or otherwise transferred to a second or later end user. A <em>used</em> good can also simply mean it is no longer in the same condition as it was when transferred to the current owner. When \"used\" means an item has expended its purpose (such as a useddiaper), it is typically called garbage, instead. Used goods may be transferred informally between friends and family for free as \"hand-me-downs\" or they may be sold for a fraction of their original price at garage sales or in church bazaarfundraisers.</p> <p><strong>USAGE: </strong>Usage is defined as the way that something is being used, or to the proper way to make use of something such as a word or phrase or tool.</p>\n\nTHE SALES AND USAGE OF SECONDHAND CLOTHING AMONG NIGERIANS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE SALES AND USAGE OF SECONDHAND CLOTHING AMONG NIGERIANS", "id": 138}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The problems of unemployment of youth in Nigeria are increasing in an unprecedented rate. Unemployment is a situation whereby able bodied men who are willing to work could not get suitable job to do.</p> <p>The problems of unemployment have been found to be affecting both the skilled and unskilled persons in Nigeria. More especially, as it affect the youths being the core in the nation economic development. However, some school of thought opined that naturally some people are not ready to accept any kind of job offer to them while some held the view that naturally some youths are just being lazy and prefer enjoyment to hard work.</p> <p>In other words, it was up held that 75% of the youths are just been selective in choosing the type of job they want to engage in.</p> <p>The nature of the problem of unemployment has brought about this study as it affects the youths in Ajeromi Ifelodun Local Government Area of Lagos state.</p> <p>In the course of this research, the researcher administered questionnaire which received various responses from the respondents. In their submission as it was analyzed, evidences showed that unemployment arose in Nigeria as a result of poor management of the nation resources. 85% of the respondents agreed that economic policy of the government in Nigeria should be re­structured whereby the system of education in Nigeria shall focus on technological training to enable.</p> <p>To combat unemployment problems, social amenities should be provided in the rural areas so as to reduce rural-urban migration to the barest minimum or optimal level. However, eradication of unemployment problems of youth in Nigeria is seen as the only panacea to solving problems of moral laxity among Nigerian youths that roam about the cities in the country. Political logjerm is also seen as the impediment to unemployment; therefore good governance based on principle of democracy, justice, equality, would further assist in solving unemployment problems of youths in Nigerian with the view to promoting and building up an egalitarian society.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>According to Begg (1987:570), unemployment rate is the percentages of labor forces that is without a job but are registered as being willing and available for work.</p> <p>In the same manner, unemployment is also a state whereby a person wants to work but could not get anyone.</p> <p>However, unemployment can be seen as a structural problem where the production capacity of the economy is far below the level of absorbing the available manpower. The term unemployment is multi- versatile in interpretation, hence it can also be viewed to mean those categories of people who are able bodied and often eager to work but to whom no suitable jobs are available. The issue of unemployment is perennial problem and can be seen all over the nation, states and cities. Different people are held up in this hook of unemployment problem, it isa common problem among graduates of tertiary institution and secondary school leavers. It also embraces skilled and unskilled personnel ranging from science, engineering, medical graduates and others.</p> <p>The peculiarity of  the high rate of unemployment in our society has brought about the need to study how the problems of unemployment affect the youths in Agbado Oke Odo local government area of Lagos state and strive to find out possible solution to this enormous and lingering problems that threatens the core of out life stream. This is because unemployment affects economics growth, social and political stability of a Nation.</p> <p>Besides, unemployment is viewed by some school of thought as a stepping stones to a better job.</p> <p>From the foregoing, it has therefore becomes imperative to embark on this research hence it has been noticed that without checking the problems of unemployment, you would loitering about in Nigeria society thereby engaging themselves in numerous evil activities or constituting social menace in the society. Economists have addressed the issue of unemployment, types and effects and profer solution with the view to improving on the level of development of nations in the world.</p> <p>In Nigeria today, problems of unemployment of youths is paramount due to a lot of economic measure or policy being put in the federal Government of Nigeria. Such policies are embargo on employment, devaluation of currency, establishment of foreign exchange market which is seen not to be implemented appropriately by the relevant agencies. The problem of unemployment of youths is at alarming rate due to social and political instability in Nigeria. It has been noted that youths are the future leaders of the nation and they constitute the major key factors of production in the country.</p> <p>Consequently, for any production process to be ascertained and actualized, labor must be fully utilized. The absence of labor automatically renders land and capital our life stream.</p> <p>1.2     <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The problem of unemployment of youths has consequently led to the followings within the Nigeria society.</p> <p>1.       Youths are seen parading the streets as a result of being unemployed which is detrimental to the economy of Nigeria.</p> <p>2.       The high rate of unemployed youths constitute into wastage of human resources and man - power which in turn lead to lower productivity of the economy.</p> <p>3.       As a result of high rate of youths, it has consequently led to high degree of moral laxity and social evil acts associated with Unemployment and this misbehavior has lead to the discouragement of the investors to boost the economy positively.</p> <p>4.       The high rate of unemployment in then country has let to many of our potential labors to run away to other countries in search for a job hence, contributing to the foreign land income at the detriment of ours.</p> <p>5.       Many of our youths have turned to be hoodlums and constituting nuisance to the society by collecting money from the commercial vehicle drivers as a result of unemployment in the country.</p> <p>1.3    <strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>1.       This research to identify the problems of unemployment youths and proffer necessary solution to conquer it.</p> <p>2.       It will also focus on the economic effects of unemployment of youths in Agbado Oke-Odo local government area of Lagos state.</p> <p>3.       The study will provide relevant information, data and materials for policy formulation and for policy makers.</p> <p>4.       In addition, the study also aimed at making the youths realize the fact that they have to be resourceful. i.e. To think about what they can do for themselves and not what the nation can always do for them.</p> <p>5.       The study is hope to encourage the youths to strive to be self employed so as to improve the nation's economy.</p> <p>6.       It will also examine the various government policies in reducing the rate of unemployment especially for the youths.</p> <p><strong>1.4     RESEARCH QUESTION AND HYPOTHESIS.</strong></p> <p>·        Could the recent problems of unemployment of youths in Nigeria be attributed to problems of political instability?</p> <p>·        Is the problem of unemployment of youths in Nigeria common among the universities and the unskilled youths in Nigeria?</p> <p>·        Does the problem of unemployment of youths affect both the skilled and unskilled youths in Nigeria?</p> <p>·        Can we attribute the problem of the youth's unemployment to the inefficiency utilization of our scarce resources in Nigeria?</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS:</strong></p> <p>·        <strong>Ho: </strong>The problem of unemployment can be attributed to political instability.</p> <p>·        <strong>Ha: </strong>The problem can not be attributed to the political instability.</p> <p>·        <strong>Ho: </strong>The problem is not common among the university graduates in Nigeria.</p> <p>·        <strong>Ha: </strong>The problem is common among the university graduates in Nigeria.</p> <p>·        <strong>Ho: </strong>The problem does not affect both the skilled and unskilled youths.</p> <p>·        <strong>Ha: </strong>The problem affect both the skilled and unskilled youths.</p> <p>·        <strong>Ho: </strong>The problem of unemployment can not be attributed to the inefficient utilization of the limited resources,</p> <p>·        <strong>Ha: </strong>The problems can be attributed to! the inefficient utilization of the limited resources.</p> <p>1.5     <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The findings recommendation of this study is hoped to be of tremendous to both the government, the policy maker, industrialist as well as youth.

Alcohol as it were has always come with more of negative outcomes. And in considering the correlation between alcohol and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) one would be able to know that it is the outcome effect of it, which one of it is sexual arouse that results into sexually transmitted infections (STIs) which when not immediately managed could results into sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). And in recent time it was observed that most uniform men consume more of alcohol to make them to be pro-active at work and because of the power they have on the general populace, by virtue of their work and the authority conferred on them, they tend to take advantage of others, mostly when under the influence of alcohol, precisely ladies. And because of the alcohol influence they tend to involve themselves in risky behaviour which later results into sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). For this reason, this study wants to investigate the effects of alcohol and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among uniform men. For this study 150 questionnaires were used of which 120 questionnaires were retrieved. The result of the study shows that </em>72.<em>5% of the respondents take alcohol and </em>51<em>.</em>7% <em>get aroused sexually after the intake of alcohol and as a result of this, they involve themselves in risky behaviour. </em>61.7% <em>of the entire respondents said they have contracted an STI before. So for all these effects the study has been able to come up with some recommendations so as to manage the resultant effect of risky behaviour that is sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and to also have consistent orientation programmes on how they can be health conscious at every point in time.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><br/><br/></p> <p><strong>1.0      BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Available statistics suggest that the global burden of disease with regard to both alcohol and unsafe sex is considerable. For example, in 1990 alcohol accounted for 3.5 percent of the total Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost globally, and for 2.1 percent of the total years of life lost; unsafe sex accounted for 3.0 percent of the total years of life lost globally (Room et al., 2002: Murray &amp; Lopez, 1996). The respective contributions of alcohol and unsafe sex to the global burden of disease are, furthermore, amplified through the linkages that have been shown to exist between alcohol, risky sexual behaviour (unintended or unprotected sexual contact) and the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV infection.</p> <p>Sexual risk behaviour accounts for a large number of opportunities for acquiring HIV infection, and alcohol use has been shown to increase high-risk sexual behaviour. Moreover, the social dynamics that surround alcohol use, sexual risk behaviour and HIV infection and interactions between these issues warrant a search for alternative ways of dealing with the problem in diverse socio-cultural settings, if intervention is to be effective. Only by unraveling the social dynamics of alcohol use-related sexual risk behaviour within particular cultural settings can this be achieved. It can be anticipated that the body of knowledge acquired through proven scientifically sound instruments will not only highlight the relevant preventive measures to be adopted but will bring out relevant clinical and experimental research questions to be considered by all disciplines interested in curbing the problem of alcohol use-related sexual risk behaviour with regard to HIV infection.</p> <p>People with alcohol use disorders are more likely than the general population to contract HIV. Similarly, people with HIV are more likely to abuse alcohol at some time during their lives. (Petry, 1999) Krupitsky et al. Found a rate of 9 percent for alcohol abuse/dependence in hospitalized patients with HIV/AIDS (Krupitsky et al, 2005). Alcohol use is associated with high-risk sexual behaviors and IV drug use which are two major modes of HIV transmission. Alcohol-related problems are a major public health issue. A submission of the studies on alcohol use in Nigeria shows that there has been a rapid increase in alcohol availability and consumption in recent times with young adults in universities and colleges being those mainly concerned. (Abiodun, 1991) Most alcohol-related problems appear in non-alcoholic dependent individuals who fall into the categories of hazardous or harmful drinkers according to the WHO (2000) terminology.</p> <p>In Nigeria studies have focused on lifetime and current prevalence rates of alcohol use without exploring alcohol-related problems. (Odejide et al, 1997; Adelekan et al, 1999) Adewuya in a sample of University young people found Alcohol related problems in 13.2 percent of subjects of which 9.4 percent had Hazardous drinking, 3.1 percent had Alcohol abuse and 0.74 percent had Alcohol dependence (Adewuya, 2005). There is an urgent need to encourage extensive epidemiological and longitudinal studies of alcohol-related problems in Nigeria in order to accurately determine the populations at risk. Early detection of people with hazardous alcohol intake and time bound interventions aimed at decreasing alcohol consumption and thus the likelihood of harm and dependence is warranted. People who abuse alcohol are more likely to engage in behaviors that place them at risk for contracting or transmitting HIV. A history of heavy alcohol use has been correlated with a lifetime tendency toward high-risk sexual behaviors, including multiple sex partners, unprotected intercourse, sex with high-risk partners (e.g., injection drug users, prostitutes), and the exchange of sex for money or drugs. (Windle, 1999; Avins et al, 1999; Boscarino et ai, 2000; Malow et al, 2001) There may be many reasons for this association. For example, alcohol can act directly on the brain to reduce inhibitions and diminish risk perception. (MacDonald et al, 2000; Fromme et al, 2000; Cooper, 2002) Decreasing alcohol uses among HIV patients not only reduces the medical and psychiatric consequences associated with alcohol consumption but also decreases other drug use and risky sexual behavior and hence reduce HIV transmission (Lucas et al, 2002). Thus, alcohol and other drug abuse treatment can be considered primary HIV prevention as well (Metzger et ai, 1999).</p> <p><strong>1.1       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The issue of alcohol and sexually transmitted diseases among uniform men is not just happening. This is because in Nigeria a lot of values and ethics in the various institutions as well as in the organs of government and sectors of the society has been polluted. It is a general or global thing the many of the uniform men in the countries of the world are law enforcers who are of various types or kinds across the country. These uniform men are supposed to lead by examples while the generality of the public take after them. But then the reverse is the case that is they are still the ones that are found taking alcohol which invariably arouse their sexual urge and what happen after that is the urge for sex. And when this happens they tend to satisfy the urge any how without being conscious of the fact that they are meant to protect themselves.</p> <p>In fact, during course of discharging their duties mostly when the military are on rescue mission and they feel the urge of sexual arouse they sometime go into sex with those ladies or women in the place where they have gone for mission without being conscious of protecting themselves. And as a result of this some of them have contracted sexually transmitted infections which had made some of them dead in the place and some have even transfer it to others when they are back home. However, this study is interested in investigating the effect of alcohol consumption and sexually transmitted diseases among these uniform men. Statistics have revealed that all or majority of them take alcohol and as a matter of fact this as it were arouse their sexual urge which sometimes make them get any mean of satisfying the urge or sexual gratification.</p> <p><strong>1.2       RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>However, the interest in the study has raised the following questions:</p> <p>1.        What are the consequences of the use of alcohol on the officers?</p> <p>2.        What are the various infections that can be contracted by virtue of involving in an unprotected sexual intercourse?</p> <p>3.        What are the attendant effects of unexpected sexual urge on officers?</p> <p>4.        Is there any relationship in the use of alcohol and sexual intercourse?</p> <p>5.        Is there any relationship between the use of alcohol and sexually transmitted infections?</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>1.          To investigate the consequences of the use of alcohol on the officers</p> <p><br/></p> <p>2.         To know the various infections that can be contracted by virtue of involving in an unprotected sexual intercourse</p> <p>3.         To inquire the attendant effects of unexpected sexual urge on the officers</p> <p>4.         To know if there is a relationship in the use of alcohol and sexual intercourse</p> <p>5.         To know if there is a relationship between the use of alcohol and sexually transmitted infections</p> <p><strong>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is relevant based on the area it intends to cover which is concerned about the use of alcohol and sexually transmitted diseases. This study will investigate the effect that the use of alcohol has caused on uniform men most especially when they are on uniform. The public believe is that they are very powerful and this sometimes give them the power to exercise authority on people even when they are not supposed to obey them but for the fact that they are law enforcement officers they will. This as it were go a long way in influencing ladies and girls to obeying them even when the ladies are not wrong in their actions and this sometimes makes them take advantage of the situation.</p> <p>Most times when they are under the influence of alcohol they act like irrational being that is forcing ladies into sexual intercourse of commercial sex worker without being conscious of protecting themselves. For this reason this study will educate the uniform men on how they can they can abstain from taking alcohol that can arouse their sexual urge as well as how they can protected themselves from contracting the sexually transmitted infections that later degenerate into sexually transmitted diseases. This study will also educate government, non-government organizations, public and private organization as well as families on the effects of alcohol taking and how it can lure one into unprotected sexual intercourse.</p> <p><strong>1.5       SCOPE AND DELIMITATIONS OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research endeavour will cover areas concerning the effects of alcohol and sexually transmitted diseases on uniform men. However, the study will unravel the attendant effects of alcohol taking as well as however it can make one contract sexually transmitted diseases which most times may be as a result of the intoxication from alcohol taking which make them get aroused and sometimes triggers them from being involved in unprotected sexual intercourse which its consequences are sexually transmitted infections and later if not well taken care of, may degenerate into sexually transmitted diseases.</p> <p>However, this study also has some delimitation which makes the research work to be strenuous and requires being careful and objective because of the object of study which is central to human behaviour.

Also, three hypotheses were tested in the course of the study. The finding reveals that Western culture fuels the pressure of unintended teenage pregnancy, Breakdown of family and approved societal values leads to teenage pregnancy in the society; and that there is a significant relationship between a teenager's social and economic background and her debut into sexual relationships. The study recommended that the family, mosques/churches, and schools as the first agents of socialization should provide opportunities for moral, mental, religious, and educational dissipation of energies by the youths. Their curriculum should be able to provide an avenue for over all development of the youths.

It occurs in both developed and developing nations but with variations in degree and its consequences on the social actor's involved. Although widely recognized as a social problem, unintended pregnancy stigma has not been extensively studied by social and behavioral scientists. Because labeling stigmatization and alienation is by definition a relational construct, adequately understanding it requires analysis at both cultural and individual levels.</p> <p>Teenagers all over the world attract attention. Unmarried teenage parenthood is by no means a new phenomenon. In the developing world, unmarried teenage pregnancies are very common especially in the urban areas due to differences in culture.</p> <p>In Agege Local Government of Lagos State, pre-marital sex is not encouraged culturally. The culture is in support of sanctity of sex but with the waves of civilization, that aspect of culture is gradually forgotten. Out-of-wedlock teenage pregnancy has major physical, social, and psychological consequences. In addition to the need to cope with motherhood, many unmarried teenage mothers face stigma, lack of schooling, and livelihood insecurity.</p> <p>The labeling and stigmatization of unmarried teenage mothers have not been without its consequences as it have caused many unmarried teenage mothers series of personal and collective problems especially in the area of sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy (Abdulraheem, &amp; Fawole, 2009; Atuyambe, Mirembe, Johansson, Kirumira &amp; Faxelid, 2005). Though unmarried teenage mother's pregnancy prevention efforts are varied nationwide, many deal in shame and stigma.</p> <p>Unmarried teenage mothers compared to their male partners have been reported as the most affected with the stigma and shame associated with unwanted pregnancy in many developing nations especially in cultures where fertility within the marriage institution is highly valued; while the male gets away with the act, the females are biologically meant to carry the physical evidence of their act. (Ilika &amp; Anthony, 2004}.</p> <p>A research carried out by World health Organization (WHO, 2009) indicates that 16 million girls aged between 15 and 19 give birth every year. Within this figure, 95 per cent of them occur in developing countries. Across cultures, just seven countries namely: Bangladesh, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and the United States of America are responsible for half of all adolescent births (WHO. 2009).</p> <p>The normative picture of unmarried teenage mothers in the sub-Saharan Africa is that of an unhealthy looking girl with an unhealthy child, poorly educated, suffering from poverty, unemployed, shattered future, lacks access to reproductive health services and stigmatized for having unintended pregnancy (WHO,2007). Although significant drop have occurred in some countries within the past 20 to 30 years, emerging findings still shows that unmarried teenage</p> <p>mother's account for 15 per cent of the global burden of disability for maternal conditions, and 13 per cent of all, maternal deaths (WHO, 2006:). Earlier studies have shown that unmarried teenage mothers are at disadvantage especially in terms of qualitative reproductive health services available to them when compared to adult mothers (Creatsas, 1991; Galal, 1999; Atuyambe, Mirembe. Tumwesigye, et al. 2008).</p> <p>Unintended pregnancy among unmarried adolescents and its stigmatization are not peculiar to sub-Saharan region (Warenius, Faxelid, Chishimba, et al, 2006; Cuffee, Hallfors, &amp; Waller, 2007). Largely, unintended pregnancies, safe delivery and care of their babies have not received the needed attention (WHO, 2007). However, how unmarried teenage mothers cope with the challenges of unintended pregnancy have not received research attention in the sub-Saharan Africa, Nigeria inclusive (Atuyambe, et al, 2005). In reality, there are those whose health and well-being and those of their children has grown worse due to unintended pregnancy. Similarly, there would be some, though they might be few in number but who have survived the phenomenon of unintended pregnancy.</p> <p>What are their experiences like during pregnancy and how did they resolve the challenges that emanated from their unintended pregnancies? What socio-cultural factors are responsible for their enablement to live out of the stigma?</p> <p>An exploration of the phenomenon of unintended pregnancy and their survival strategies will not only improve our understanding of `their world', but will also be relevant in policy formulation and working out effective programmes that may better improve the socio-economic status of unmarried teenage mothers in Agege area of Nigeria.</p> <p>These are some of the issues addressed in this study. Hence, this study explores the experiences of unmarried teenage mothers with unintended pregnancies and how they addressed their psychological and social consequences of their pregnancy and motherhood, strategies adopted in resolving the stigma in Agege Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p><strong>1.2      STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The social stigma associated with being an unmarried teenage mother is so much that it may lead some women to attempt or commit suicide. In our social setup, pregnancy outside marriage is considered a humiliation that will affect not only the mother but also her family. It is no longer news in our society that young girls are being given out in marriage at early ages by their parents or family members due to pregnancy, financial difficulties or other reasons like cultural inclinations.</p> <p>Onigu (1978) pointed out that this causes decline in the childhood as these girls become pregnant mothers in their teens. Unintended teenage pregnancy threatens the objectives of the millennium development goals (MDGs) as posited by Mathur (2003) which include; eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal basic education, promotion of gender equality and empowering the women, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, and combating HIV/AIDS, malaria other disease; United Nations (2007).</p> <p>Bayinsenge (2010), is of the view that early marriage occasioned by unintended pregnancy cut-­off educational and employment opportunities and chances of personal growth. A large proportion of unmarried teenage mothers face emotional, physical, psychological, and social problems after pregnancy and childbirth, such as obstetric complications, lack of education, and stigmatization by parents, brother and sisters, relatives, etc. in their communities. Another critical issue is that the responsibility of a child born outside marriage rests solely on the mother. The lack of support from family, relatives, society, etc. makes her living quite hard and sometimes unbearable. Today we are faced with the erroneous notion that unmarried single mothers are considered as `available' or `someone easy to gain access to'. In this study the problems of stigmatization of unmarried teenage mothers in Agege Local Government Area will be looked into.</p> <p><strong>1.3      RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The following research questions would be answered in the course of this study.</p> <p>1.        What are the influence of the unfavourable reactions faced by unmarried teenage mothers and their integration back into the larger society?</p> <p>2.        Is there any significant relationship between teenage sexual behaviour and teenage pregnancy?</p> <p>3.        Should teenage girls be allowed better access to contraceptives and option for an abortion in cases of unplanned pregnancy? </p> <p><strong>1.4      OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In a bid to ensure that this study is relevant in the field of academic profession certain aims have been designed for this research work. The aims that this research was carried out have the following objectives in mind;</p> <p>1.        To examine and determine the extent of problems facing unmarried teenage mothers in Agege in Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p>2.        To examine the impact of stigmatization faced by unmarried teenage mothers in Agege Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p>3.        To determine the cultural barriers that influence access to birth, control drugs and programmes.</p> <p>4.        To study how media awareness, family, religious institutions, etc. has created the needed information that will help unmarried teenage mothers plan their future.</p> <p><strong>1.5      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The outcome of this study will be of immense importance to those who are directly involved in managing unplanned teenage pregnancy issues, especially those who handle training and development functions of NGO organizations. It would give insight into the coping strategy methods and how best to overcome stigmatization and alienation in the society.</p> <p>Not only this the study will look into the benefits which accrue from giving the girl child help and access to duality information and care when needed, it will also lead, to a better understanding of those factors such as family planning, use of contraceptives, abortion, sexual transmitted diseases, communication and safe sexual relationships.</p> <p>More importantly, the study will help us to know if developing good framework that can transform the quality of life of the girl child and enhanced her overall performance.</p> <p><strong>1.6      SCOPE AND DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study focuses on the causes and challenges of stigmatization and alienation faced by unmarried teenage mothers who were actually involved in the area of study. It will be open to female victims of teenage motherhood for a comparative analysis. The location under study will be restricted to some selected villages under Agege Local Government of Lagos State. In all, the study will be useful to health planners to fashion out better ways to project quality of safe life and living for the women and children population in setting achievable standards concerning issues of stigmatization and alienation of unmarried teenage mothers in the society.</p> <p><strong>1.7      DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>·        <strong>ALIENATION:</strong> The condition of being estranged or disassociated from the surrounding society.</p> <p>·        <strong>DISCRIMINATION:</strong> Discrimination is an action, a process in which members of one or more groups is a form of racism which those discriminated is a minority.

Therefore, parents and students themselves should be motivated to perform better in their duties and academics. The relationship between the members of the family should be a positive one in order to allow students to perform well in their academic pursuits.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong> INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>A number of factors determine how far a child can go in life. In most cases his association with friends and family may not necessarily be in the majority but may be needed factors of enhancing his academic performance. This study is to find out the cause of conflicts in the home and some basic socio-­psychological effects of conflicts in the home on a child's academic performance.</p> <p>Conflict is a militating factor on a child's academic performance. It affects the child both socially and psychologically. It is a deterrent to the child in his social environment and intellectual progress. According to Staple R. (1999), a disharmonious home promotes aggressive, neurotic, jealous, delinquent unco-operative children, while harmonious home promotes co-operative, good adjustments, superior academic performance and independent children.</p> <p>The home is an institution where people needing care live in. It is a dwelling place of a family which originated from marriage. Marriage is a union between a man and a woman such that the children born are recognized as the offsprings of both parents. Demo D. H. (1998) defines marriage as an established practice in all human societies in one form or another, that is the reason why marriage is called an institution.</p> <p>The home is a reflection of the society and so, if the home is defective, the child being the product of the home will be affected. Most of the social­ problems we encounter in Nigeria today, is traced or connected with the social errors that evolved in the conflicts in the homes. It is very important to note that the stages of marriage, if not well met, can establish conflicts in the home. The conflicts in the home leads to development of lack of conscience and excessive prohibition which produces unrealistic, severe moral constraints and above all these lead to uncompromising social behaviours that cause poor performance.</p> <p>Factors that influence academic performance of the child are numerous. They could be negative or positive factors. For example, bad habits like sleeping always, laziness, non challant attitude of the child towards his studies, can affect the child's academically. It is the duty of the parents from the onset to help the child by teaching him the right thing to do and encourage him through reinforcement. Arditte J. A. (1999), stated that \"The ideal family life when created will motivate the child and help  in his  academic  performance\". The  child needs  care, socially, emotionally, physically, mentally and psychologically. Couples often disagree when  it  comes to  roles  and  responsibilities, due  to  the  fact  that  both   parties want to win the argument. Constant disagreement in the home leads to marital conflict which affects the child's academic performance.</p> <p>As opined by Olayinka (2005) \"a peaceful home tends to be a pleasant environment for raising healthy children who will become good citizens in future\". But a conflicting home is a fertile ground for breeding delinquent children. The socio-psychological effects of conflicts such as denial or indifference hostility fear and confusion affects the child's academic performance.</p> <p>Research reports suggest that a child from conflict home experience more problems in adjustment than children who grow up in intact families. Most of the research effort suggests that children from conflict homes are more likely to have difficulties in school and to be more aggressive, less pro-social, more depressed, and more likely to abuse substances and participate in delinquent acts than their peers from intact families.</p> <p><strong>1.2      STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Students do not perform alike; this can be attributed to many factors. The major one is individual differences among them. Many psychologists, educators and sociologist have been trying to unravel the reason for these differences amongst students. Through researches and studies, it was found out that factor such as family background with characteristics like parental education, socio economic status, parental attitude, family size etc. affect children negatively. Family tone, that is how stable or unstable a family is (conflict, divorce, broken home, separation etc), also contribute to individual differences. Other factors include peer group influences, school related factors such as teacher-student relationship, class-size, curriculum, teaching method, the students' personality etc.</p> <p>But for the purpose of this research, the study will focus on only one of the factors, that is, the conflict in the home.</p> <p>Studies have shown that when there is a conflict in the home between parents, it has not only negative but powerful effect on the children. Sometimes, this effect can be social, psychological, emotional etc. This will in turn affect their personality development and academic performance etc.</p> <p>Market (1984) stated it is unfortunate if a child comes from a disorganized home or full of conflicts. When such a thing happens it may lead to one of the parents separating from the spouse, as a result the child will not have appropriate role models. Conflict, disagreement or family separation is not healthy for any child especially those in school. This study will therefore examine the effect of socio-psychological factor  of home conflict as predictor of academic performance of students.</p> <p><strong>1.3      PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is mainly to identify some socio-psychological effects of conflicts in the home on the students’ academic performance. Also, it is to find out the extent to which the socio-psychological effect of conflict in the home has effectively contributed to the academic performance of the child.</p> <p>The study also analyzes the relationship between the student, his peers and family. The study addresses how the family stands to influence the positive or negative academic performance of the child and make some recommendations on how to manage conflict in the home.</p> <p><strong>1.4      SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study will have the following implications:</p> <p>·        It will be of benefit to parents and guardians, as it will make them realize the effect of conflict in the home on the academic and psychological development of their child.</p> <p>·        It will give an insight to the teachers.   It will enable them understand that there is individual differences among students and tailor their instruction in such a way as to cater for each individual child.</p> <p>·        The study will have implication for policy makers, educators and other stakeholders as it will reveal some of the reasons for poor academic performances among students.</p> <p>·        Finally, the study will be a springboard for other researchers in the field.</p> <p><strong>1.5      RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The following research questions were formulated to guide the study:</p> <p>·        Is there any significant relationship between family influence and academic performance?</p> <p>·        Is there significant relationship between academic performance of a student and socio-psychological effects of conflicts in the home?</p> <p>·        Is there significant relationship between a child's academic performance and family background?</p> <p>·        Is there is no significant difference in the academic performance of students from home with conflict and those without conflict.</p> <p><strong>1.6      RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>1.        There is no significant relationship between academic performance and family/conflict homes.</p> <p>2.        There is significant relationship between academic performance and socio-psychological effect of conflict in homes.</p> <p>3.        There is no significant relationship between student academic performance and family background.</p> <p>4.        There is no significant relationship between students academic performance and the home environment.</p> <p><strong>1.7      SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In view of the diverse spread of socio-psychological welfare in the country, this study will be restricted to Secondary Schools in Alimosho Local Government Area of Lagos. In other words, data and facts will be restricted to what have been collected from five schools in Alimosho Local Government Area of Lagos.</p> <p><strong>1.8      LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is faced with certain constraints such as inadequacy of finance, the time available was too short and as a result of information needed to expand the scope of this work is limited.</p> <p>Inaccessibility of some vital information necessary for the study, the school library does not contain adequate textbooks, which would have helped in making the research work extensive.</p> <p><strong>1.9      DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>ACADEMIC:</strong> This is connected with education, especially studying in schools and universities.            This involves a lot of reading and studying rather than practical or technical skills.</p> <p><strong>PERFORMANCE: </strong>This is how well or bad something is been done.

The people of Agege local government constitute the study population. The main objectives of this study were to examine how domestic violence influences the people living in this area. The data used for the study was collected through her interview schedule in which 200 respondent were selected through systematic random sampling.</p> <p>From the study, it was observed that the majority respondent agreed that woman need to engage in labour to support their family financially. This finding showed that working mothers are conscious of their supportive role to their families but engaged actively in paid employment. Interestingly the study reported that the women receive encouragement, support and respect from their spouse which prevent occurrence of violence act from the husband. These findings corroborating, Oguwole (2005) findings that the women are respected at home for their contribution and participation actively in family decision making. Also, UN (2002) reports concur that working mothers participate more in family decision making are .less likely to witness domestic violence.</p> <p>Furthermore, the study found that the working women not only receive their spouse attention and support, they also enjoy organization support, for instance 81 % of the respondent acknowledge that tree months maternity leave are always being granted to and observed by nursing mothers. They also identify it her nursing such as closing on time counseling of safe motherhood and access to organization clinic for medical attention, all this improve the relationship within the family. \"On a daily basis, Nigerian women are beaten, raped and even murdered by members of their family for supposed transgressions, which can range from not having meals ready on time to visiting family members without their husband's permission,\" adding that \"husbands, partners and fathers are responsible for most of the violence’s.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTROUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Domestic violence is a patter of behavior which involve the abuse of one partner against another, this can occur in intimate relationship, marriage friendship and family affairs, it can take forms of effect on one another, physical violence involves physical afflicting pains and actions. e.g. hitting, slapping, beating, sexual harassment while psychological can be in form of denial of right, abusing, frustration (Journal of the American Medical Association, 1995).</p> <p>Domestic violence\" varies, depending on the context in which it is used. It ma} be defined differently in medical, legal, political or social contexts. The definitions have varied over time, and vary in different parts of the world. Traditionally, domestic violence was mostly associated with physical violence. For instance, according to the (Merriam-Webster dictionary definition, 2005) domestic violence is \"the inflicting of physical injury by one family or household member on another; also: a repeated habitual pattern 'of such behavior.</p> <p>However, domestic violence today as defined by international conventions arid by governments, has a much broader definition, including economic' abuse. Domestic violence\" means any' act of violence, even if upon another household member and includes harm to the other. (Journal of the American Medical Association, 1992).</p> <p>It is also a pattern of behavior characterized by the misuse of power and control by one person over another who are or have been in an intimate relationship. It can occur in mixed gender relationships and same gender relationships and has profound consequences for the lives of children, individuals, families and communities. It may be physical sexual, emotional and/or psychological. The latter may include intimidation, harassment, and damage to property, threats and financial abuse. (The Act XX on Domestic Violence 2006, in Malta)</p> <p>Furthermore is also a pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship that is used by one partner to gain or maintain power and control over another intimate partner\". The definition adds that domestic violence \"can happen to anyone regardless of race, age, sexual orientation, religion, or gender\", and can take many 'forms, including physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional, economic, and psychological abuse. (The US Office on Violence against Women)</p> <p>Domestic violence can be trance back to 1800s, at this period most legal systems accepted wife beating as a valid exercise of a husband's authority over his wife. One exception, however, was the 1641 Body of Liberties of the Massachusetts Bay colonists, which declared that a married woman should be \"free from correction or stripes by her husband.</p> <p>Political agitation during the nineteenth century led to changes in both popular opinion and legislation regarding domestic violence within the United Kingdom and the United States. In 1850, Tennessee became the first state in the United States to explicitly outlaw wife beating. Other states soon followed suit. In 1878, the Matrimonial Causes Act made it possible for women in the UK to seek separations from abusive husbands. By the end of the 1870s, most courts in the United States were uniformly opposed to the right of husbands to physically discipline their wives. By the early twentieth century, it was common for police to intervene in cases of domestic violence in the United States, but arrests remained rare.</p> <p>The interest of this study is to examine the consequence of domestic violence is Lagos and using Agege local government as a case study, domestic violence as occurred mostly in areas of gender inequality and child abuse in this area of the state, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Aminu Tambuwal, has promised that the house will toughen the law against domestic violence and gender discrimination in Nigeria. The Speaker believes that the law would help bridge all gender gaps encouraging discrimination and promote gender equality as recognized by the Constitution. He announced this move at the third national women in parliament summit in Abuja. Female lawmakers at the summit frowned at the low representation of women in the National Assembly which placed Nigeria at the 117th position among democratic nations with less than 6.8percent of women in the nation's Parliament. (Channels Television July 01, 2013).</p> <p><strong>1.2      STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>It is obvious that large family size is no more desirable of the increasing rate of poverty, illiteracy and poor heath due to the effect of domestic violence in gender inequality and socio cultural belief system is one of the major consequences ,which implies that social cultural belief are the major constraints for. Domestic violence among gender in Nigeria.</p> <p>In addition to this between half and two thirds of Nigerian women are subject to domestic violence in their homes. Domestic violence affects all social groups and can consist of physical, sexual and psychological abuse. Although men can also be affected by domestic violence, women suffer disproportionately (Leonie Taylor Article 14 March 2012 - 11:4Sam)</p> <p>This trend occurs across much of the world, but Nigeria's discriminatory laws and dismissive police compound its particularly high rate of domestic ·violence. Most potently, its prevalent culture of silence and stigma for the victims of domestic violence hinders' public acknowledgement of the problem. There is an urgent need to challenge the social prejudices and institutional structures in order to protect it women, not just from danger, but also from ridicule fear and isolation.</p> <p>\"On a daily basis, Nigerian women are beaten, raped and even murdered by members of their family for supposed transgressions, which I Call range from not having meals ready on time to visiting family members without their husband's permission,\" adding that \"husbands, partners I and fathers are responsible for most of the violence\".

It is the building block of human society, and when the foundation of society is weakened, considerable damage results. Therefore, the growth of any society depends largely on the ability of the family institution to perform its role effectively.</p> <p>Ayodele (2001) defines marriage as the union of a man and his wife in body and soul. It is the institution in society in which a man and woman are joined in a special kind of social and legal dependence to found and maintain a family. Notwithstanding, the purpose for marriage is far more important than the mere legalized sexual relationship among spouses (Agbutuin, 1990). To this end, Yahaya (1998) opined that in marriage, there are lots of stresses, bitterness, failures and successes. Other factors that threaten marital stability include age of marriage, educational level of spouse, religion, income, type of marriage, fertility status, kind of family background of spouses, communication, culture, etc. From the foregoing, a lot of researches on marital instability show that many factors are responsible for the misnomer in marital union.</p> <p>The term marital instability is used to refer to the process whereby marriages break down through separation, desertion or divorce and where relevant to the subsequent re-partnering of the individual are concerned. Separation and legal divorce are socialphenomenon which is caused by the couples involved, and which could either resultfrom social, economic, psychological or cultural phenomenon. Many marriages remain shaky for a very long time; some of them recover equilibrium and become cohesive again, this shaky period may lead to separation.</p> <p>Nearly everyone begins their marriage with a high level of satisfaction with their relationship and a high level of optimism for the future. Yet, marriages end in a divorce for many couples, while marital satisfaction declines over time for even more couples. People tend to fall prey to the confirmation bias, they tend to be more optimistic about themselves than for other, and they tend to interpret facts in a way that supports their desired view of the world.</p> <p>There are hundreds of factors which are responsible for marital instability in the world today. They range from several factors; social issues, psychological issues, economical issues, cultural issue, biological issues, emotional issues, spiritual issues, amongst others. Even some are as a result of the combination of two factors. The term ‘marital instability’ is a very vast and broad topic. Therefore focusing on a key factor responsible for marital instability can give us a good guide on what the term \"marital instability\" is all about.</p> <p>Women's relationship with their partners is grounded on several factors best known to them (Psychological expectations some of which includes; regular income, sexual satisfaction, paternal responsibility and equity). These factors are what they take to their relationship which serves as homeostasis. It is the things they hold on to, which guide and sustains them throughout their stay in marriage. Women are usually satisfied in marriage when their needs are being met by their husband, and when their expectations and desires are being met and satisfied. Now, when there's a conflict between the expectations of a woman in marriage and the present outcome, this would definitely lead to a breakdown in their social interaction with their spouse. At this stage, women tend to be so stubborn, inconsiderate, less communicative and unresponsive to their partner. Indirectly, this is to say that their psychosocial system now shapes their behaviour. Research has shown that a regular occurrence of this would eventually lead to a break down in marriage.</p> <p>Psychosocial factors as a phenomenon are behavioural issues which arise from problems or social problems in a society which shapes or affects the social functioning of an individual in society. Psychosocial factors deals majorly with the study of how and why people think, feel and do the things they do depending upon the situation they are in. It involves studying the impact that the social environment and group interactions have on people's attitudes and behaviours towards others. Having said all that, psychosocial factors are those factors that are responsible for the behavioural change of an individual toward a person or groups of persons. Therefore, the word “psychosocial” in this context can best be explained as; how a woman's personal behaviour about situations in marriage affects her external behaviour towards her husband.</p> <p>This study will therefore be aimed at looking at the some of the psychosocial factors that influences marital instability. It aims to breakdown these factors and explain how and why women act the way they do before marital dissolutions. Also, to look deeply into the consequences an implications of these and how they affect the development of any society. The psychosocial factors that will be examined therefore are; level of spousal communication, type of attachment patterns between spouses, parental marital background of the wife, and lastly, rate of in-law's involvement.</p> <p>Spousal Communication as a social factor involves the communication pattern that goes between a woman and her husband. Communication therefore can be seen as \"the imparting or interchange of thoughts, opinions, or information by speech, writing, or signs\". It can also be referred to as the process used by people to create and manage relationships. A marriage without effective communication is likely to crumble. Communication is a life wire of marriage relationship or any other meaningful relationship (Esere, 2002, 2006). Spousal communication is a critical element in marriage as it is an inevitable requirement before the commencement of the relationship and also necessary for the sustenance of the union. Communication is the heart of intimate human relationship and the foundation on which all other relationships are built; they also assert that it is the key to a successful couple relationship. In fact, the ability and the willingness to communicate have been found to be among the most important factors in maintaining a satisfying relationship.</p> <p>Attachment pattern as a psychosocial factor is very important in any marriage. A growing number of studies suggest that, among individuals in relationships, attachment style/pattern is a significant predictor of relationship satisfaction. In Bowlby's work on attachment pattern, there are two major categories of attachment pattern between two individuals in a relationship, and he also laid emphasis on the categories of attachment pattern that could either sustain or destroy a particular relationship. These patterns are secure attachment pattern and insecure attachment pattern. The secure attachment simply explains that, apartner with this type of attachment pattern are open to people, extroverts in nature, share feelings with their partners; securely attached adults would be more tolerant, less reactive, and prefer smaller interpersonal distances. Insecure attachment pattern on the other hand is categorized into two; the avoidant attachment pattern and the ambivalent attachment pattern. An avoidant and ambivalent attached individuals seek emotional distance and extreme closeness, respectively. When a woman is loosely attached to her husband, such woman tend to share secrets, find difficulty in sharing marital problems, such individual can hardly cope or bear unplanned circumstances.</p> <p>Parental marital background of a particular partner is a psychosocial factor that shapes and develops one's personality as one grows. As certain behaviours, characteristics and traits are said to be emulated from either the father or the mother. It is also of importance to know that the parental marital background of an individual greatly shapes a couples perceptionabout life, perception of other people and how to cope and deal with situations that arisesfrom one's social environment. The effect of parental marital background on individuals is quite worrisome these days, as some researchers have tried drawing a link between a partner's parental marital background and their stability in marriage. The word `family background' would have been more preferable but the context is very broad as it entails issues like, single parent, family structure (polygamous e.t.c), educational background, literacy level, parental marital background, family's social and economic status. Therefore, the area of interest to me is parental marital background. Some researchers have gone to the point of showing a clear relationship between a partner whose parent has either separated, divorced or being single and their stability in marriage with their future partners. Women whose parents have separated or divorced tend to have- higher level of marital instability than their male counterpart, and the reason why this is so cannot still be fully explained, as there are result which also shows that men are as well influenced by their parental marital background which affects their marital stability.</p> <p>In-Law's Involvement in marriages, is a psychological trend that runs through so many families all over the world today, leading to serious damages in any dyadic relationship. Marriages are meant for two and not three; decisions in marriages are meant for two and not three, because most times, the presence or interference of a third person in marriage isoften powerful than even the two partners involve, as a partner might be influenced by the third party. According to Bowen (1978) and Friedman (1985), the involvement of a third party in a relationship is as a way of diffusing some of the pressure and tension between the couple and can have a negative effect on the couple's relationship. One major problem most women find hard to cope with in marriage is, when the husband is not strong enough to confront her, scold her, and talk to her but rather reporting to his in-law without her consent. This problem affects most women psychologically, and therefore shapes their interaction to their husband and their marriage socially. At this point, most marriages are usually irredeemable.</p> <p><strong>1.2      STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Overtime in the history of marriage, women have been known to be the major problems of marital instability in every home, because society sees them as solely responsible for every marital instability in society. In some relationships, some women often claim they feel cheated, neglected, uncared for, maltreated or abused by their husbands, therefore they prefer being independent or getting a new life with a man who would show them affection, love, care, support; a man who would understand the way they think, show empathy, a man who can communicate effectively with them, a man who can meet their emotional and sexual needs and also, a man who can take good care of them and more importantly, they would love to create a life of their own without any interference from anyone. All these factors, put together affects women's decision and attitude in marriage, and also shapes their thoughts which and makes them either submissive or responsive in marriage or vice-versa.</p> <p>In essence, psychosocial factors influencing marital instability arises from the way women observe situations in marriages in respect to their feelings, thoughts, belief, culture and personality. Now, when there's a conflict or misunderstanding between a woman's feelings, thoughts, belief, culture, personality and her spouse, she tend to create behaviours, attitudes and certain responses which then shapes her social behaviour towards her spouse, and as a result of this, terms like marital disengagement, marital dissolution, marital instability, divorce come to being.</p> <p>Communication in every relationship is very essential to the partners involved, as a breakdown in the communication processor pattern between two spouses could result to deep crises between both partners. Studies have revealed that one of the top five issues generating conflict in marriage is communication (Ekot and Usoro, 2006; Anyakoha and James, 2004). The level of spousal communication between couple often determine the success and failure of that marriage. Tanner (1990) in Santrock (2002) observed that lack of communication was high on women's reasons for divorce whereas for men it was insignificant. This is to say that certain life situations between a woman and her husband influences the rate of spousal communication between them. This 'situations could either be positive or negative, but whichever way it is, a woman's communication with her spouse could either be psychological or social.</p> <p>Due to economic hardship from complex economies/societies, spousal's attachment seems to be declining on a daily basis. Most women complain of their spouse being unresponsive to some of their basic needs, not given them equal right to decision making and other important areas that has to do with both partners. Some of the presumed causes of these factors include; stress, giving more time to work over relationship, sexual dysfunction amongst others, and the effects of these on women includes; change in attitude and behaviour, engaging in more social activities and finally holding onto certain marital issues which could further lead to the disintegration of the marriage. It is of great importance to first of all understand that the attachment pattern of any individual originates from the type of attachment pattern that has been adopted in the early stages of childhood, that is, between a child and a primary care giver (parents). These early parental care experiences then gives rise to an internal working model of oneself and others, which form a basis for generating expectations about future relationships and provide a context for interpreting what happens in those relationships (Bowlby, 1973). Having discussed the types of attachment pattern in the introduction, the two sub categories of attachment pattern in women that can give rise to marital instability, are the avoidant attachment pattern and the ambivalent attachment pattern. Women within these attachment pattern often possess ‘I don't care’ attitudes; feelings of what other people are of emotionally concerned about, is usually of no importance to women under these categories. Thus, this is to say that early attachment have a profound effect on people's relationships throughout their entire lives.</p> <p>One major problem women often battle in marriage is their parental marital background. The background of several women in marriage contributes immensely to the success and failure of many marriages in Nigeria today as a person's parental marital background is where the moral lesson and social behaviours of life are being learnt and emulated. Most behaviours and attitudes of women in marriages today are as a result of how their mother or father behaved or how either of them solved certain life situations in the past and also; the way of life of this parents. Some research has also shown that most women whose parent had experienced divorce or marital instability also have the probability of going through the same. Though individuals have a choice of which lifestyle they would love to emulate and which not to.</p> <p>Parental marital instability as part of a person's family background, is something that affects most women without them being aware of its prevalence and how it shapes their interaction with spouse. Most women whose parents had problems with their marriages are most times trying to be careful not to experience the same. Now, in the cause of avoiding marital breakup, they either become tolerant, intolerant, too reactive or slow to react to certain behaviours from their husband, as life as placed a stigma of fear of the unknown in their psyche. It is from a person's family background, cultures and tradition are passed from parents to offspring; fear and confidence are instilled into the way we relate with people; lifestyles and personalities of a parent one has more affection for is being inculcated into our day to day way of life. Problems therefore arise when a spouse is in conflict with the other's belief system of their parental marital background, which affects their psyche and influences their interaction with their spouse and could therefore result to marital instability.</p> <p>Diversity in culture and tradition is more of the reason why most women prefer their husband’s in-laws, parents and so on to stay away from their marriage. But this is not tosay this is exactly why some women discourage in-law or parental involvement in their marriages, as there are some other reasons responsible for this. Women often feel there is the tendency of their husband's in-laws making certain decisions or enforcing laws on their husbands most especially</p> <p>when they are seen as one big family. Some in-law's even go to the extent of coming over to the husband's house every weekends to see if the husband is being treated well, fed well and respected by the wife; some even go to the point of organizing family meetings all in the name of ensuring a peaceful home. Couple's often place a higher priority on their relationship with their marital partners and individuate/differentiate with some of the close attachments that they may have formed with parents, children, siblings and relatives(Bowen, 1978; Bray 1995; Mace 1989).</p> <p><strong>1.3      RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1)          Does the level of spousal communication influences marital instability?</p> <p>2)          Is parental marital instability a predominant factor that influences marital instability?</p> <p>3)          Which spousal's attachment pattern is more liable to influence marital instability?</p> <p>4)          Does the rate of in-law's involvement in marriage behavioural change in women?</p> <p><strong>1.4      OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study will be carried out to determine the psychosocial factors that influence maritalinstability with the specific objectives stated below;</p> <p>1.     To examine whether the level of spousal's communication would influence marital instability.</p> <p>2.     To know whether parental marital instability of women contributes to their decision making which may result to marital instability.</p> <p>3.     To know what kind of spousal attachment patterns in marriage influences marital instability.</p> <p>4.     To examine if the rate of in-law's involvement in marriage influences women's behaviour which may result to marital instability.</p> <p><strong>1.5      SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is focusing mainly on four psychosocial factors influencing married women before the occurrence of marital instability.

Therefore, this study seeks to help an individual in understanding the various psychosocial factors affecting marital instability, which could eventually lead to dissolution or disintegration among couples. This project therefore aims at unveiling the psychosocial factors which poses a threat to marital instability and the society at large. This study will therefore be of great importance to different social welfare institutions, families, women, because conclusion gotten from this research, could serve as a road map to whatever goals that are been developed by these organization. Another great importance is that, social workers can be of great help in marital counseling agencies or institutions by counseling and cautioning women or both parties on the signs and symbols that are likely to cause marital instability.</p> <p><strong>1.7      CONCEPTUAL CLARIFICATIONS</strong></p> <p><strong>Marriage</strong>: A socially and religious approved union between a male and a female by which they are legally and morally entitled to sexual relationship, bear and rear children thereby, establishing a family of their own; It is the union of a man and a woman who makes a permanent and exclusive commitment to each other of the type that is naturally fulfilled by bearing and rearing children together, and renewed by acts that constitute the behavioural path process of production.</p> <p><strong>Instability</strong>: The quality or condition of being unstable.

The goals of occupational safety and health programs include to foster a safe and healthy work environment. (Oak Ridge National lab safety Documents) OSH may also protect co-workers, family members, employers, customers, and many others who might be affected by the workplace environment.</p> <p>Occupational safety and health can be important for moral, legal, and financial reasons. All organizations have a duty of care to ensure that employees and any other person who may be affected by the companies undertaking remain safe at all times. 'Employers safe work practices, Health and safety policy, 2013. Moral obligations would involve the protection of employee's lives and health.</p> <p>The concept of working culture is intended in this context to mean a reflection of the essential value systems adopted by the undertaking concerned. Such a culture is reflected in practice in the managerial systems, personnel policy, principles for participation, training policies and quality management of the undertaking. Joint ILO/WHO Committee on Occupational Health Occupational Health service and practical ilo.org 2013.</p> <p>Although work provides many economic and other benefits, a wide array ofworkplace hazards also present risks to the health and safety of people at work. These include but are not limited to, chemicals, biological agents, physical factors, adverse genomic conditions, allergens, a complex network of safety risks, and a broad range of psychosocial risk factors. Lopez. A.Rogers and C J C Murray (ends) Comparative Quantification of health Risk (WHO).</p> <p>Physical hazards are a common source of injuries in many industries. They are perhaps unavoidable in many industries such as construction and mining, but over time people have developed safety methods and procedures to manage the risks of physical danger in the workplace. Employment of children may pose special problems.</p> <p>Falls are a common cause of occupational injuries and fatalities, especially in (instruction, extraction, transportation, healthcare, and building cleaning and maintenance (jail injuries prevention in the work place\" NIOSH. Work and Health institute of occupational safety and health. July, 2012.)</p> <p>Bazroy et al. (2003) reported that traumatic occupational injuries lead to 10,000 deaths globally. Occupational injuries have been identified as one of the leading causes of adult mortality and a major contributor to permanent disability among low income countries such as those of South Asia and Africa; and an estimated 50 million work related injuries occur every year or 160,000 every day. Gardner et al. (1999) and Druchi et al. (W04<em>) </em>stated that the manufacturing industry has a high incidence of workplace injuries in comparison to other industries. Fadier and De la Garza (2006) reported the occurrence of 62,500 occupational accidents on France in the year 2000 alone, while Mattila et al. <em>cW06) </em>also stated that Finland recorded 20,016 hospitalizations for injuries between 1990, I and 1999. According to the Nigerian Institute of Safety Professionals (2000) overall, 11,000 people were injured due to on-the-job accidents each year in chemical industry alone in Nigeria. Also, Adebiyi et al. (2005) estimated the cost of accidents agro-allied industries in south-western Nigeria at 87.89 million dollar annually. </p> <p><br/></p> <p>Occupational hazards are dangers to human health and well-being which are alone in Nigeria. Also, Adebiyi et al. (2005) estimated the cost of accidents in agro-allied industries in south-western Nigeria at 87.89 million dollars annually associated with specific occupations. While efforts are made to reduce hazards, these hazards remain present in the workplace by nature of the profession. Recognizing occupational hazards is the first step in working on risk reduction programs for the</p> <p>Workplace to keep work as safe and healthy as possible. Some jobs are, by their very nature, extremely hazardous. Jobs with numerous occupational hazards often provide better pay for their employees, in recognition of the danger, and they are also usually charged higher races for insurance, because underwriters recognize that the chance of paying out on that insurance is much higher. Occupational hazards may lead to illness, injury, or death. They can include physical risks like falls and exposures to heavy machinery, sharp or glass object cut, along with psychological ones such as stress. Occupational hazards like exposure to chemical, biological, as well as radiological agents are also a concern. In people who work jobs with at recognized occupational safety hazard, special training is often provided so the It people are made aware of the hazard.</p> <p><strong>1.1   STATEMENT</strong> <strong>OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>In our country employers have a very negative approach towards the employees as they are often seen labourers in Nigeria whom they should treat like slaves. Their job is such that they face plenty of health problems. The main health problems faced by the manufacturing workers or employees are all sorts of physical problems like Cardiac diseases, High blood pressure, Hypertension, Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis, Fatigue, Obesity, Varicose veins, Dehydration, Sunstrokes, Aging as they work all day. They also face sunstrokes, joint pains, scull skeletal disorders (MSD) as well as emission of waste chemicals or gases due to prolonged hours of work and less physical activity and many other problems. Looking at such a huge list of health problems some strict measures should be taken to avoid such problems. Possible remedies like sitting in a correct posture, medication for high resistance power, etc. so that they too can have healthy work conditions at ida healthy and happy life after all they sacrifice their family life and health for our nation.</p> <p><strong>1.2   RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>1.  What are the occupational hazards affecting factory workers?</p> <p>2.   What are the impacts of occupational hazards on the psychological well-being of factory workers?</p> <p>3.   How efficient and effective are factory workers in the factory with some hazard they encountered in the work place?</p> <p>4.

This study is necessary in order to unravel the hazards associated with are manufacturing as well as factory job that is based on glass production, and also highlight the satisfaction associated with the job as well. This study is imperative in view of the present hazardous situation where factory workers wrists, legs, hands cut through the heavy powered engine that is used in the production of the glass or when an heavy load falls on a worker at the point of discharging his duties. I have heard of such situation where an incident of such occurred. The fact remains that the worker was not really taken care of. And that some that have been permanently incapacitated are even neglected such that some of their family will sometimes have to sue the company to court before necessary actions are then taken towards remedying the situation of the victim.</p> <p>A country with strict law and good health working condition policy should enforcethe provision of standardized health and safety policy that will guarantee the safety of lives of workers in various organizations.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>1.5   SCOPE AND DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of this study is to find out the occupational hazards and job satisfaction olfactory workers.

The study will highlight the various types of occupational health and hazard as well as its effects on the life of workers as well a!: how it can be managed such that it will enhance better job efficiency and effectiveness that  is guaranteed through job satisfaction. However, the limitations of this study are population, time and financial constraint.</p> <p><strong>1.6   DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>The various terms in the study have been operationalized systematically:</p> <p><strong>1.6.1 Occupational Hazard:</strong> Danger or hazard to workers that is inherent in a particular</p> <p>Occupation. A danger or risk inherent in certain employments or workplaces or any condition of a job that can result in illness or injury</p> <p><strong>1.6.2 Occupational Safety:</strong> To foster a safe and healthy work environment that also protects co-workers, family members, employers, customers and many others who might be: affected by the workplace environment. To make progress in occupational safety and health within the enterprise, workers and their representatives have to cooperate with employers e.g., by participating in elaborating and implementing preventive programmes.</p> <p><strong>1.6.3 Factory Workers:</strong> these are people that are employed for labour services to industries that guarantees meeting the need or objective of the organization.</p> <p><br/></p> <p><strong>1.6.4 Efficiency: </strong>state or quality of being competent in performance or ability to do a job with a minimum expenditure of time and effort. Describes the extent to which time, effort or cost is well used for the intended task or purpose. It is often used with the specific purpose of relaying the capability of a specific application of effort to produce a specific effort. The term \"efficient\" is very much confused and misused with the term \"effective\".</p> <p>In general, efficiency is a measurable concept, quantitatively determined by the ratio of output to input. Efficiency can be expressed as a result as percentage of what ideally could be expected, hence with 100% as ideal case.</p> <p><strong>1.6.5 Commitment: </strong>Act of pledging or promising or the state of being so committed. Commitment is to be obligated or under the pledge to a particular cause. In a relationship, this shows the pledge to the other partner to have an exclusive companionship which binds the people together.</p> <p><br/></p>                                                            \n\nOCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH HAZARDS AMONG EMPLOYEES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH HAZARDS AMONG EMPLOYEES", "id": 145}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>This research project tends to examine Occupational Hazards among Hawkers in Pen Cinema Area of Agege, Lagos State.</p> <p>Survey design was employed with the use of a well structured questionnaire.

In most African cites the problem is especially acute, and Lagos, the Nigerian commercial capital is no exception. Street hawking arises primarily because of rural-urban migration, unemployment, and the increasing number of school dropouts; It serves as a source of livelihood and in addition, an avenue also, to supplement family income. Rural poor youth moving into the city in search of non-existent jobs fail to find employment because of lack of education and employable skills.</p> <p>They end up as street hawkers selling wares on major city streets (Asiedu, et al 2008).</p> <p>Deaths, accidents and infections from the workplace have been contributing immensely to the global mortality rate. Annual death toll from unsafe occupation reported for 2006 was 1.1 million people. The recorded cases of fatalities in the workplace that led to complete disability was about 300,000 out of 250 million while over 160 million people were victims of work-related diseases (Ilo, 2006; WHO, 2006; llo, 2008; WHO, 2010)</p> <p>Generally, both women and men are found concentrated in certain occupation, face similar conditions at work and experience the same workplace hazards.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>In Sub-Saharan Africa region, working women are also traditionally responsible for the household chores. However, both sexes are physically different and women are more sensitive considering their reproductive roles. Gender variations are difficult to specify especially for a low-income economy. The global figures for 2008 show that out of 337 million occupational accidents, 358,000 were confined as fatal, while deaths from occupational related illness were 651,000 (WHO, 2010; ILO, 2006; ILO, 2008; Lu, 2(11). Observation from these data show that there is almost 77 percent increase in death toll from unsafe workplace between 2006 and 2008, 35 percent increase between the same period while the number of fatal accident increased by 19 percent.</p> <p>Women make up 45% of the employed population in the EU (European Union for Safety and Health at Work, 2012), they constitute about 31.2 percent of Nigeria labour force (Eweama, 2009; National Bureau of Statistics (NBS1 2010). Across the Eastern, Middle, Western and Southern Africa regions, about 37, 25, 22 and 2 percent of girls respectively in age between 10 and 14 were economically active in the year 1990 (ILO, 1990; Bledsoe &amp;Cohen 1993). The proportion in the next older age (15-19 years) was 62, 39, 45 and 29 percent respectively in the same year (ILO, 1990; Bledsoe &amp; Cohen, 1993).</p> <p>In Nigeria, the proportion of women in labour force is unfavorably compared to the men. A change in this paradigm as currently been driven by gender equality agenda (including equal employment opportunities and support for women enterprises that were enshrined in MDG 3 (UN, 2003; NPC &amp; USAID, 2004; Oyekanmi, 2008; Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor, 2008) can only be successfully achieved with the provision of safe working environment for women.</p> <p>The concentration of women in micro-enterprises with diverse methods of operations makes it more important to address the gender dimension in health and safety at workplace. Healthy and safe work environments can enhance, and are synonymous with quality jobs and output (Muir, 1974; Alli, 2001). It is envisaged that quality outputs would impact on women's earnings and might keep them in employment. Thus, attention must be paid to the health and safety of the jobs that women do.</p> <p>However, men and women are not the same neither is their jobs and the working conditions they are exposed to the same. Likewise, the ways they are treated in the society also differ. These factors can affect the hazards they face at work and the approach that needs to be taken to assess and control them. Women are always at the receiving end of most social and economic hazards (National Population Commission and USAID, 2004) and street trading is not an exception.</p> <p>\"A hawker can be defined as a person who offers goods for sale to the public without having a permanent built-up structure from which to sell\" (Asiedu, Ag yei-Mensah, 2008 Pg1). Street hawking exposes the individual to the risk of potential accidents, loss of lives, abuse, reproductive health problems, easy prey to crime and prostitution as well as a number of other social problems. In addition, street hawkers retard national growth because they cannot be taxed to provide revenue for the government, impede traffic, increase travel time and fuel costs thus increasing transportation costs and the average costs of dory business (Davis, <em>2008). </em>In addition, hawkers operate in unsafe public spaces where they have to man oeuvre between cars and motors to make their living at the risk of losing their lives and at the mercy of the weather, crime amongst other factors.</p> <p>Street hawking is therefore, a negation of the international convention on the rights of the child. It is indeed inhuman for anyone to engage a child in money­ making venture. Such a child is denied basic education which is another reign of every child. Hence, child labour refers to the ill-treatment of a child by his parents or any other adult. Edu and Edu (2009) describe child abuse as a willful maltreatment of a child. Such maltreatment according to them (In include acts of commission (abuse) and omission (neglect).</p> <p>A narrow definition of child abuse is limited to life-threatening physical violence, including severe beatings, bums and strangulation which are inflicted on children by the adult members of the community. A broader definition however, lays emphasis on any treatment other than the most favourable care, and includes neglect, sexual or emotional abuse and exploitation. Whichever way, child abuse is the flagrant abuse of children's God-given and constitution-guaranteed freedom, comfort and peace, by adults in the society.</p> <p>Therefore, this study examines occupational hazards affecting hawkers along Lagos-Badagry Expressway.</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF</strong> <strong>PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Over the past few decades, employment in the informal sector has risenrapidly in most regions of the developing countries including Nigeria. The reason for this has been the failure of the formal sector, which has traditionally been m important source of employment generation to absorb the multitudes of semi-­skilled and unskilled persons to the city of Lagos State and due to tile weakness of the government and modern private sector to generate adequate employment in recent years.</p> <p>Street traders face more routine occupational hazards as well. Many must 1ft heavy loads of goods to and from their point of sale each day. The physical environments in which they work typically lack proper infrastructure, such clean running water, toilets, and solid waste removal. Street vendors' are exposed to physical harm from the improper provision of fire safety equipment and the improper regulation of traffic in commercial areas. They are also exposed to a high concentration of air pollutants and to inclement weather. These physical risks take a particular toll on young children who must accompany their mothers to vend in the streets.</p> <p>According to Palmer (2007) support for skills development in the informal economy, which is by far the largest destination for school leavers, is virtually non-existent, hence, the most important issue being highlighted in relation to the phenomenon of street hawking is the issue of skills training and development to improve the status of these hawkers and to remove them from the situations they find themselves in being on the street. Despite the benefits of easier access to retail goods that the hawkers provide to drivers, motorists and pedestrians, there are high costs to their presence on the street.</p> <p><strong>1.3   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In this study, attempt will be made to provide answers to the following questions</p> <p>·        What are the factors responsible for increase in hawking in pen cinema area, Agege?</p> <p>·        Is there any law that safeguard or prevent hawkers from commercial drivers in the traffic in Lagos state?</p> <p>·        What are the health challenges or risks hawkers are exposed to?</p> <p><strong>1.4   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is primarily aimed at examining occupational hazards among hawkers in pen cinema, Agege.

In any consideration of the problem of malnutrition,' these segments require special consideration, as this unfortunate nutritional situation is prevalent in many under-developed countries today. Pregnancy constitutes states of considerable physiological stress which impose increase nutritional demands (Gopalan, 2000).</p> <p>Pregnancy deserves planning because many practices or conditions of the mother that harm the developing fetus are modifiable, such as the following: Alcohol consumption, Use of certain medications, such as heavy use of aspirin, Use of illegal drugs, such as cocaine or marijuana, Job-related hazards and stresses, Smoking, Inadequate diet, such as too little iron, zinc, and synthetic folic acid, Excess vitamin A intake and mega dose use of other nutrient supplements, Heavy caffeine use, Lack of medical treatment with HIV -positive status or AIDS, Poor control of ongoing diabetes or hypertension (ADA Reports, 2000).</p> <p>Women need to pay attention to these risks in the months before conception. This precaution is necessary because women often do not suspect they are pregnant during the first few weeks after conception and may not seek medical attention until after the first 2 to 3 months.</p> <p>Still, even without fanfare, the child-to-be grows and develops daily. For that reason, the health and nutrition habits of a woman who is trying to become pregnant - or has the potential to become, pregnant - are particularly important. Although some aspects of fetal and newborn health are beyond control, a woman's conscious decisions about Social, health, and nutritional factors affect her infant's health and future. Much research suggests that an adequate vitamin and mineral intake at least 8 weeks before conception and during pregnancy can help prevent birth defects such as neural lube defects. This problem has been Iinked-in part to a foliate deficiency.</p> <p>In addition, about 50% of pregnancies are unplanned. For these reasons, parents should be aware of the role nutrition plays in the development of a healthy infant both before and during pregnancy. According to Scholl &amp;Johnson, 2000), the stages of pregnancy include: Prenatal Growth, Development and the Early Growth. For <em>B </em>weeks after conception, a human embryo develops from an ovum into a fit for about another 32 weeks, the fetus continues to develop. When its body finally matures, the infant is born. Until birth, the mother nourishes it via a placenta, an organ that forms in her uterus. The placenta separates the blood supply of the mother from the blood supply of the fetus. Nutrients pass from the mother's blood through the placenta to accommodate the growth and development of the fetus.</p> <p>In the formation of the human organism, egg and sperm first unite, producing the Zygote. From this point, the reproductive process occurs very rapidly: Within 30 hours-zygote divides in, half to form 2 cells, Within 4 days cell number climbs from 64 to128 cells. At 14 days-the group of cells is called an embryo, Within 35 days-heart is beating, embryo is / of an inch (8 millimeters) long eyes and limb buds are clearly visible, At 8 weeks-the embryo is known as a fetus, At 13 weeks (end of first trimester-most organs are formed, and the fetus can move.</p> <p>For purposes of discussion, the duration of pregnancy-normally, 37 to 41 we from the mother's last menstrual period-is commonly divided into three periods called trimesters. Growth begins in the first trimester with a rapid increase in cell number.</p> <p>The most serious damage to the fetus from exposure to toxins is likely to occur during the first 8 weeks after conception, two­ thirds of the way through the first trimester. However, damage to vital parts of the body - including the eyes, brain, and genitals ­can also occur during the last months of pregnancy.</p> <p>This type of growth dominates embryonic and later fetal development. The newly formed cells then begin to grow larger. Further growth and development then involve mostly an increase in cell number with some increase in cell size. By the end of 13 weeks-the first trimester-most organs are formed and the fetus can move.</p> <p>Nutritional deficiencies and other insults transmitted through the mother to the embryo or fetus-for example, injuries caused by medications and other drugs, high intakes of preformed vitamin A\" radiation, or trauma-can alter or arrest the current phase of development. . The effects may last a lifetime. The most critical time for these problems to happen is during the first trimester. Most miscarriages (more correctly termed spontaneous abortions) occur at this time. Currently, about one-half or more of all pregnancies either fail to attach to the uterine wall or undergo spontaneous abortions, often so early that a woman does not even realize she was pregnant. The early spontaneous abortions usually result from a genetic defect or fetal error in fetal development. Stuart, et al., (2003).</p> <p>A woman should avoid substances that may harm the developing fetus, especially during the first trimester. This holds true for the time when a woman is trying to become pregnant. As previously mentioned, she is unlikely to be aware of her pregnancy for at least a few weeks. In addition, the fetus develops so rapidly during the first trimester that if an essential nutrient is not available, the fetus may be affected even before evidence of the deficiency appears in the mother.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>For this reason, the quality of one's nutritional intake is more important than quantity during the first trimester. In other words, women should consume the same amount of food, but the foods should be more nutrient dense. Although some women lose their appetite and feel nauseated during the first trimester, they should be careful to meet nutrient needs.</p> <p>By the beginning of the second trimester, a fetus weighs about Arms, hands, fingers, legs, feet, and toes are fully formed.</p> <p>The fetus has ears and begins to form tooth sockets in its jawbone. Organs continue to grow and mature, and, with a stetho­scope, physicians can detect the fetus's heartbeat. Most bones are distinctly evident through the body. Eventually, the fetus begins to look more like an infant. It may suck its thumb and kick strongly enough to be felt by the mother.</p> <p>The fetus can still be affected by exposure to toxins, but not to the degree seen in the first trimester. During the second trimester, the mother's breast weight increases by approximately 300/0 due to the deposition of 2 to 4 pounds of fat for lactation. Consequently, under nutrition in the second trimester has a greater effect on the mother than on the fetus. For example, if the mother does not meet the nutritional requirements during this time, her ability to successfully breastfeed her infant may be affected, as fat stored during pregnancy helps serve as an energy reserve for lactation (Robert and Kail, 2006).</p> <p><br/></p> <p>Also by the beginning of the third trimester, a fetus weighs about 2 to 3 pounds. The third trimester is a crucial time for fetal growth. The fetus will double in length and will multiply its weight, by five times. Art infant that isborn after about 26 weeks of gestation has a good chance of survival if it is cared for in a nursery for high-risk newborns However, the infant will not contain the vitamin (mainly vitamin E), mineral (mainly iron and calcium), and fat stores normally accumulated during the last month of gestation. This and other medical problems, such as a poor ability to suck and swallow complicate nutritional care for preterm infants. Note also that infants will use the stores of the mother to obtain needed iron. If the mother is not meeting her iron needs, she can be severely depleted after delivery (Gordon, 2002).</p> <p>At 9 months, the fetus weighs about 7 to 9 pounds (3 to 4 kilograms) and is about 20 inches (50 centimeters) long. A soft spot in the forehead indicates where the skull bones (fontanels) are growing together. The bones finally close by the time the baby is about 12 to 18 months of age (Scholl and Johnson, 2000).</p> <p><strong>1.1 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The events of pregnancy with birth provide the foundation on which all child development is built, this events of prenatal development that transform sperm and e.g. into a living, breathing human being which is a biological and social reality in the existent of man. The effect of maternal malnutrition on the course of pregnancy, the condition of the infant at birth, and state of lactation of the mother, the food a pregnant woman eat are the main source of the nutrition's for the baby because a lot of pregnant woman don't know what to eat?

The ability of a leader to coordinate member’s behaviour in the pursuit of goals is referred to as leadership. George and et al (1990) defined leadership as a relationship in which one person accepts the responsibility for the fate of self and others in relation to achieving a task. The problem of our country is that of leadership. Successive government have already missed and lost, considering the unrelenting progression of corruption, bad governance and bad economic management. The consequence of bad governance and frustration impeded on the youth is observable in the increase proportion of Nigerian youths who try to see of salvation of foreign shoes.</p> <p>The problem of unemployment has been considered as an underdevelopment problem. Youth unemployment is caused by the ruling elite who mismanaged the economy mostly through corrupt practices. Youth who constitutes a potent and latent human resourced of any country are not truly engaged in labour thereby causing insecurity to the nation. The aftermath of bad governance, frustration led the youth to seek greener pasture elsewhere. The research work exposed the leadership problem in the country, it exposes the internal dynamic of a corrupt leadership in the political economy. The main objectives of the study are to find out the problem of leadership that resulted in mass movement of youths to Europe due to corruption, bad governance, seek recommendation and solutions.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In Nigeria, the quest for national development is always at the heart of the leaders and the led. Leadership is the process of influencing group activities towards attainment of goals. The quality of leadership in any given country has a direct influence on the development of that nation in terms of the standard of living, available infrastructures, and poverty, level on unemployment among others. According to World Bank Report (2006) a nation’s wealth is measured in terms of balance sheet which consists of three categories of capital. Natural assets, produced assets and intangible assets, which consists of human and institutional capabilities that measures society’s quality index.</p> <p>Nigeria is ranked as the world’s largest producers of oil, but the leaders have not been able to manage the oil wealth for the benefit of average Nigerian. This is due to unrelenting progression of corruption, inefficient, bad government policies and incompetent decision making. Mass unemployment among the able bodied Nigerian youths to their influx to developed countries of the world in search of greener pasture. Lack of basic social amenities is also major cause for the influx, deficient infrastructure, inadequate health and educational system among others. Although the problems of unemployment is a general phenomenon depending however on the nature of the skill produced by the economy for its own use. The features of underdevelopment in the third world economies is lack of developed manpower required for the development of the industrial, technological and service sector. Where the high level manpower is available, they remain unemployed. A country with abundant natural resources and in dare need of high level human capital could allow massive exodus of her able bodied men and women to European countries in search of greener pasture.</p> <p>Mass exodus of youth from Nigeria also be traced to the activities of the criminal agencies and cartels whose main business is to recruit young people to serve as either drug carries or in case of young females, to recruit them as prostitute. Thousands of female Nigerian teenager and youth found their ways to overseas through these channels, and their work has led to the tragic deaths of many promising Nigerian youths. Nigerian youth became even more desperate to take even more during chances to emigrate, the crossing to the notorious Sahara Desert on foot as well as the tragic risk of hiding oneself in a wheel of an aircraft just to get to Europe. The problem of national development had remain a hydra-headed monster looking for a messiah for help. Good governance is all that would be required to extract the best of this unique opportunity of abundant human and natural resources to establish sustained durable and diversified, economy for national development.</p> <p><strong>1.2      STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Rich countries are largely rich because they are well governed, while poor countries are largely poor because of bad governance. Good governance translates to progressive national development, and good infrastucr=tural facilities. Good governance implies that intangible assets of the nation are fully exploited to manage tangible assets. Since inefficiency, incompetence, corruption, bad management are rules of the day. It means that it will be difficult for Nigerian leaders proved incapable of turning the advantages of oil wealth.</p> <p>The influxes of Nigerian youth to Europe and America in search of greener pastures are due to unemployment, insecurity, lack of economic opportunities, corruption and nepotism, which could betraced to bad leadership. The extent which bad leadership contribute to the influx of Nigerian youths to Europe and America is what this project intends to unravel.</p> <p><strong>1.3      OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main objective of the study is to assess the problems of bad leadership on the influx of Nigerian youths to Europe and America and the extent which it has affected socio-economic development of the nation. The consequences of unemployment as a result of bad leadership. Specific objectives were follows:</p> <p>1.     To identify major reasons for mass movement of youth to Europe</p> <p>2.     To find out the influence of unemployment on the influx of Nigerian youths.</p> <p>3.     To critically examine the relationship between the problems of leadership and unemployment problem in Nigeria.</p> <p>4.     To provide plausible solutions that could minimize the influx of Nigeria youths to Europe and America in search of greener pasture.</p> <p>5.     To ascertain the effects of leadership on national development in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.4      HYPOTHESES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS I</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho:     </strong>There is no significant relationship between unemployment and mass movement of the youth to European countries in search of greener pastures.</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>:      </strong>There is significant relationship between unemployment and mass movement of the youth to European countries in search of greener pastures.</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS II</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho:     </strong>There is no significant relationship between leadership problem and unemployment of the youth in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>:      </strong>There is no significant relationship between leadership problem and unemployment of the youth in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS III</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho:     </strong>There is no significant relationship between quality of leaders and emigration of youths to European countries</p> <p><strong>H</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>:      </strong>There is significant relationship between quality of leaders and emigration of youths to European countries</p> <p><strong>1.5      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study is significant in many ways. It tries to determine the cause, effect and consequences of unemployment, shed light on some of the problems of leadership and expose the leaders inability to tackle unemployment and find solutions. It tries to determine the structure and consequence of unemployment and mass movement of youth to Europe. Nigerian leaders have the problem of effectively transforming natural capital aimed at developing the economy, provide adequate infrastructures, empowering the society through the provision of good employment opportunities and other national development indices. Oil which is a natural capital has increased greed and corruption to the point of strongly eroding personal. Ethical and social values, if effective transformation had taken place oil would have been playing a smaller role in the economy and a number of economy sectors would have emerged and Nigeria would have been able to diversify the economy.</p> <p>The study of this nature becomes imperative in that it will serve as an eye opener to the leaders who would be able to ascertain the significance of good and quality leadership, and the study will also have the potential of serving as a guide to researchers in working on the areas of deficiencies of leaders in Nigeria in order to improve on leadership with a view to having a sustainable national development.</p> <p>It will also be useful to policy makers in the areas of improving the political, socio-economic status of Nigerian society and bring under control youth movement from Nigeria. Young women stand the chance of befitting a great deal since they constitute the bulk of victims of human trafficking. The leadership will know which part of the population is highly affected, youth, which is not acceptable to national growth.</p> <p><strong>1.6      SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Movement of Nigerian youths to develop countries of the world. The bulk of the affected areas are Edo and Delta States, to some extent East and Western States. 70% are from Edo State, but the study concentrate on Lagos. The North has insignificant number. The movement cut across religion, tribe, sex and different educational background, mostly undergraduates, dropped outs and sometimes graduates. Basically, the study is limited to youth seeking greener pasture in European countries, Spain, Italy, France to mentioned a few.</p> <p><strong>1.7      DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>Various terms will be defined and explained to enable us understand the phenomenon under investigation.</p> <p><strong>LEADERSHIP – </strong>The closet to a census in the definition of the concept is that, it is a social influence process. It is defined as the process of influencing group activities towards the accomplishment of goals in a given situation. (Harsey and Blanchard 1977) while (Griffin 1984) defined leadership as the ability to influence others.</p> <p><strong>EMPLOYMENT – </strong>A concept of which labour is engaged in production i.e. a situation where all eligible citizens are working either for themselves or for an organisation on full or part time to earn a living or wages and salary.</p> <p><strong>UNEMPLOYMENT – </strong>Some authorities have stressed not working and seeking to work and others like Sen (1988) recognized aspect of underutilization of labour. It is a situation where some human factor of production is idle, i.e. where all those eligible to work are not able to find job. There are different types of unemployment, structural, seasonal, voluntary, fictional, casual, disguised and cyclical unemployment. Cyclical unemployment is the one that is most concern for the purpose of this study. That is unemployment due to depression or recession in the economy due to bad leadership.</p> <p><strong>ECONOMIC GROWTH – </strong>refers to the entire productive and distribute system of the state. In an economy, you are either on production or distributive or both. The unemployed is not contributing to the production or distribution of goods and services. He is dependent consumer.</p> <p><strong>DEPORTEE – </strong>A person who is sent back to his country of origin from another country for some reason.</p> <p><strong>MOVEMENT – </strong>For the purpose of this study, means traveling or migration from Nigeria to Europe.</p> <p><strong>YOUTH – </strong>Able bodied (male &amp; female) traveling to abroad for greener pasture</p> <p><strong>1.8      METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>Refers to the process and approach in data gathering and analysis. The use of questionnaires in gathering data will be used. In formation from journal, survey research and relevant literature review will be used. Gathering data from the field which is a form of descriptive research.</p> <p><strong>1.9      LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Problem may be encountered in answers by the respondents. Problem of getting unemployed who are willing and also those that were sent back. Data on theses are not available among those who are traveling out of the country from January to June, 2008</p>                                                            \n\nLEADERSHIP AND PROBLEMS OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT: AN ASSESSMENT OF UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM AND MOVEMENT OF NIGERIAN YOUTHS TO DEVELOPED COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " LEADERSHIP AND PROBLEMS OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT: AN ASSESSMENT OF UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM AND MOVEMENT OF NIGERIAN YOUTHS TO DEVELOPED COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD", "id": 148}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The study cantered on Labour Welfare and Industrial Relations in a Depressed Economy; a case study of Grief Nigeria Pic which intends to show the importance of labour welfare and industrial relations in a workplace and the environment at large. The study revealed that interaction in workplace boost performance. The organisation's welfare system should be highly improved. Workers appreciate the welfare package they get from their employers. Management should pay attention to the basic needs of their employees.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Labour in general, could be defined as the human efforts of any kind, manual or mental, skilled or unskilled, scientific or artistic. It is the human knowledge transformed into activity that gives utilities or values to all commodities.</p> <p>It is a man who cultivates land whether he uses hoe or tractor. It is the same man who sows, weed, harvest, process, stores and sell. Every single endeavour here on earth has man's finger print. All these human efforts which are vital to production are called LABOUR. The productivity of a worker would be a function of the amount of effort a man can put forward in a given period of time and skill. When we talk of productivity, we mean the increased efficiency and the rate of which goods are produced, while labour is the bodily and mental work.</p> <p>Welfare services are so enormous and numerous. This can be defined as the added advantage or support given to the workers by the employer or the company at large. This can be described as the Canteen Services, Financial Support, Educational Financial Support, Transport Facilities, Medical Facilities, Maternity Benefits, Gratuity Scheme, Employment Provident Fund, Compensation Scheme, Recreational Benefits, etc.</p> <p>The Coinage of the term Industrial Relation is originally traceable to the historical circumstances of British industrial revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe. It should be remembered that the industrial revolution was accompanied by a breakdown of the manorial system and serfdom, i.e. person client relationship that was tied to the tradition land ownership in the form of the employment contract between the workers and the employer. Workers exploitation through a regime of oppressive or horrifying wages: poor organization climate, poor quality of working life. The inherent profit motivation of capitalist, employers of their surrogates (e.g. manager) on the other hand and primary reward and job satisfaction interest if ranks and file employees.</p> <p>Industrial relation is the study of employment relationship that is between workers and management or employer. Here are some of their definitions by different authors:-</p> <p><strong>Beatrice Webb (1890): </strong>defines industrial relation as whole web of human interaction at work which is predicated upon and arise out of employment contact.</p> <p><strong>UBEKU (1982): </strong>defines industrial relation as a resolution of industrial conflicts.</p> <p><strong>HYMAN (1975): </strong>opines that industrial relation as a process of control over work relation and among their process, those involving works organization and of a particular concern.</p> <p>When we talk of economic depression, it means a situation whereby the employment phase falls, economic meltdown, but the rate of fall gradually decreases until the circle through is reached. Economic depression of a country is the devaluation of currency. High level of unemployment rate in any economy is a state or period of economic depression.</p> <p>The value of labour to an employer varies with the marginal productivity of the worker. This is the additional contribution which the last worker makes to the employer's output. Marginal productivity of labour must be equal to the wages rate if the product rises, all other things being equal and employer of labour will be able to employ more labour. The marginal productivity of labour will be affected by the following factors:-</p> <p>a)                 The natural ability of labourer's efficiency and training.</p> <p>b)                The equipment with which the worker works will also be determined by the marginal productivity of labour, where modern and suitable equipment are used, labour is likely to have a high marginal productivity</p> <p>c)               The conditions of demand for the product which labour produces will also affect marginal productivity of labour. If the demand for the product increases, the employer will employ more labour force adding more to earnings and loss of production. This will affect the overall demand for labour and its marginal productivity.</p> <p>When we talk of economic depression, it means a situation whereby the employment phase fall, but the rates of fall gradually decrease until the circle through is reached. Unemployment in a country is a situation whereby the mentally and physically fit men and women can't get a job to do. Any responsible government must combat the problem seriously. Another main cause of economic depression of a country is the devaluation of the currency. By this we mean exchange value of the country currency is reduced to a lower rate.</p> <p>By Yesufu (1984); who view industrial relation (R) as the total sum of labour relation (LR) and personnel relations (PR), illustrating with arithmetic model of IR = LR + PR developed by Seward authors. In more details, labour relation (LR) defines the relationship between labour (trade union organisation) and management and individual employees. Also, Yesufu located the various concepts of \"employee relations, labour relation and industrial relation\". Even when used interchangeably within the central theme of employment.</p> <p>J.T DUNLOP (1958) defines industrial relations as \"web rules\" that actors in the sphere of employment working together Industrial relations as an academic in Nigeria is relatively young and developing. This has been reflected in the status of organized literature on the subjects' matter, which has been expanding but relatively scarce in respect of the key area including the labour economics aspect.</p> <p>The whole idea of this research bothers on the concept of \"Welfare Scheme of the Industrial Labour Force\" which is conceptualized as the right of every workforce for freedom to some rights of social amenities, health and safety outfits and other facilities in an industrial sociological factory or company.</p> <p>The system concept of industrial relations is credited to john Dunlop who explains that a system of industrial relations is comprised of four main attributes. These are: major actors, web of rules, contexts and ideology. The Major actors in a typical system of industrial relations are recognized as: workers and their organizations. (E.g. trade unions), managers or employers and their association, government and their agencies. The \"web of rules\" is essentially referenced to the semblance of work rules that are formulated and applied for the moderation of inter­actor behaviour in line with the demands of conformity and harmony in the workplace. The \"context\" refers to the various situation and environments of employment that may often produce different patterns of systems that influence the mode of operation of a specific work organisation and bind together a system of industrial relations</p> <p>The welfare services includes: canteen services, housing facilities ,educational financial support, death benefits, recreational benefits, transport facilities, provision of creches, bonus benefits, medical facilities, gratuity scheme, maternity benefit, employee provident fund and compensation scheme.</p> <p>I am introducing GREIF NIGERIA PLC.

This is due to the fact that social interaction and better labour welfare increases productivity and high level of performance at work. This continuity on the long run brings better result to the organization and this boosts the economy. Absence of the labour welfare and industrial relations would reduce performance of the worker and its effect is widely felt in the economy.

This has prompted the federal government to subtly suggest birth control for its citizen with serious backlash and dichotomy between proponents and opponents. In the quest to stem the tide of unbridled population growth, the government of the federal republic of Nigeria in 2002 came out with a population policy paper on family planning and fertility regulation.</p> <p>According to the policy paper, the value of family planning and the child spacing on the stability and wellbeing of family shall be promoted and family service shall be incorporated in maternal and child health care. This is to help reduce maternal and infant morbidity and mortality as well as reduce rapid population growth in the shortest possible time in order to ensure sustainable development which can be achieved only by reducing population growth to bring it to per with the available national resources.</p> <p>This will invariably lead to the attainment of good quality life and high standard of living in the country. It is perhaps because of the foregoing world leader in 1974 accepted family planning as a human right of individuals and couples. Article 14(F) of the World Population Plan of Action states that: “all couples and individuals have the basic right to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education and means to do so; the responsibility of couples and individuals in the exercise of the right takes into account the needs of their living and future children, and their responsibility towards the community”.</p> <p>Though there is a growing interest with the intense efforts of the government to popularize the use of modern family planning methods by integrating it unto maternal and child health in Nigeria, it seems many people still do not apply planning methods.</p> <p>Is population Nigeria’s biggest problem? Whatever answer that is likely to come out; fears are being expressed concerning Nigeria’s rising population. From a little number of 55 million people in the 1950s, before independence, Nigeria’s population grew astronomically to about 80 million in the 1990s. Today, that figure is pecked around 167 million people.</p> <p>If the nation’s population is left to grow uncontrolled, the national resources will sooner or later be outstripped by increasing demand of the growing population. Aside the political undertone of population, a high population carries with it many burdens that may even over power the state in handling. An increased population for Nigeria will also over stretch services and infrastructure.</p> <p>In all the challenges that come with high population density, poor healthcare remains the biggest headache. In the long run, it may lead to total collapsed of the social system. These are the fears being expressed by the government, prompting government officials to conceive the idea of family planning.  Observers believed that high population will ever remain an impediment to her development until something is done about it. In the 1990s, the Ibrahim Babangida military government even attempted compulsory family planning for Nigerians. A policy that was greeted by strong opposition and critisms.</p> <p>Though there is a growing interest with the intense efforts of the government to popularize the use of modern family planning method by integrating it into maternal and child health in Nigeria, it seems many people still do not apply family planning methods. This is essence brings to mind the role mass media will play to make effective the issue of family planning in a country like Nigeria that the literacy level is not at optimal.</p> <p>The influence and pervasiveness of the mass media can be found everywhere around us today, and they are everywhere respected. We must search long and hard to find a Nigerian who will say that information provided by the media is not generally good for him or her in one way or another. We can say with large measure of certainty that one of the primary assumptions held by most Nigerians is that the media and the information derived from them have influenced our thought, attitudes and behaviors.  </p> <p>Thus, the mass media touch nearly every one of us every day, socially and culturally. The mass media can affect the way we think about issues around us and they can influence what we think about and the way we eat, talk, work, study and relax. This is the impact of mass media on the society.</p> <p>Lindroos and Lukkainen (2004) contend that Nigeria is a country where modern family planning usage is one of the lowest in the world. This may be due to lack of useful information to those who really need the information as a majority of the Nigerian populace live in the rural areas where there is poor access to modern means of communication including the mass media.</p> <p>Odaman (2005) family planning provides the society with some socio-economic and health benefits. Awareness of such benefits can significantly enhance the use of contraceptives, which in turn, will reduce population growth and overtime have positive effects on national development.</p> <p>In this connection, Ugoji (2008) observes that family planning programs strive to prevent unwanted pregnancies, help achieve birth spacing and help couples limit family size so as to reduce maternal/infant mortality. Further, Odaman (2005) enumerates some of the family planning methods to include the use of safe period, calendar or rhythm, oral pills, condoms, injectables, intrauterine devices (IUDs), Norplant and sterilization.</p> <p>As regards the foregoing modern methods, Oladeji (2008) contends that communication and decision making play a vital role in ensuring informed        choice of family planning and reproductive health behavior. Effective communication/decision making allows people to seek what is best for their own health and to exercise their right to good quality health care (Rimal et al.2002). In the same vein, it has been argued that mass media, especially radio and television have been quite effective in creating family planning awareness in urban Nigeria. Perhaps, this is because the urban dwellers have greater access to the mass media.</p> <p>Raising a child requires significant amounts or resources: time, social, financial and environmental planning can help assure that resources are available. The purpose of family planning is to make sure that any couple, man, woman who has the desire to have a child has the resources that are needed in order to complete this goal. With these resources a couple, man, or women can explore the options of natural birth, surrogacy, artificial insemination, or adoption. In the other case, if the person does not wish to have a child at a specific time, they can investigate the resources that are needed to prevent pregnancy, such as birth control, contraceptives, or physical protection and predominantly urban areas, about 90% of all urban house-holds have radios and about 60% own televisions in Nigeria (information, education and communication, IEC, July 1996) and the likelihood that people living in urban areas would readily have access to family planning information as purveyed through radio and television media is high. But to make this level of family planning awareness effective among the generality of Nigerians, the mass media should have a hold in the rural areas where a larger number of people live.</p> <p>The spread of television and radio, the rise of an independent press, and increasing literacy rates in many countries offer new opportunities for family planners and other health care organizations to inform the public and reach opinion leaders (piotrow et al 1994). Making the most of these opportunities requires skill in helping the news media cover family planning. Since 1972, the average family size in developing countries has dropped from six or seven children per woman to about three children.</p> <p>This trend has saved millions of lives and provided additional benefits to women and children who when healthy can achieve greater levels of education and empowerment (International Planned Parenthood Federation, PPF 1992).</p> <p>Despite the gain, contraceptive use is still low and needs high usage in some of the world’s poorest and most populous places, including Nigeria.  At least, three in 10 pregnancies are unintended in some regions, and millions of couples are still unable to effectively choose the number and timing of their children.</p> <p>The use of safe, voluntary contraception is also accepted worldwide.  In 1994, representatives from 179 nations met in Cairo, Egypt at the international conference on population and development and agreed to provide reproductive health care to all people by the year 2015 – a goal that called for countries to ‘meet the family planning needs to their population’ and provide ‘universal access to a full range of safe and reliable family planning methods’ (Population Reference Bureau, PRB 2004).</p> <p>Waiting until the mother is at least 18 years old before trying to have children improves maternal and child health. Also, if additional children are desired after a child is born; it is healthier for the mother and the child to wait at least -1 years after the previous birth before attempting to conceive (but not more than 5 years). After a miscarriage or abortion, it is healthier to wait at least 6 months.</p> <p>When planning a family, women who are over at least 30 years of age should be aware of the risks of having a child at that age. Like older men, older women are at higher risk of having a child with autism and Down syndrome, the chances of having multiple births increases, which cause further late-pregnancy risks, they have an increased chance of developing gestational diabetes, the need for aCaesarian section is greater, older women's bodies are not as well-suited for delivering a baby.</p> <p>Family planning benefits the health and well-being of women and families throughout the world. Using contraception can help to avoid unwanted pregnancies and space births; protect against STDs, including HIV/AIDS; and provide other health benefits</p> <p>Raising a child requires significant amounts of resources: time, social, financial, and environmental. Planning can help assure that resources are available. The purpose of family planning is to make sure that any couple, man, or woman who has the desire to have a child has the resources that are needed in order to complete this goal.</p> <p>With these resources a couple, man or women can explore the options of natural birth, surrogacy, artificial insemination, or adoption. In the other case, if the person does not wish to have a child at the specific time, they can investigate the resources that are needed to prevent pregnancy, such as birth control, contraceptives, or physical protection and prevention.</p> <p>There is understandably a strong interest within population policy and family planning program circles in the potential impact that try to inform and motivate on the methods and advantages of regulating family planning.</p> <p>These messages can take many forms, ranging from soap operas on radio and television designed to persuade women of the personal and social advantages of smaller families to spot advertisements about methods and clinics. However, what is media evidence that such efforts actually influence individual’s reproductive attitudes and behavior?</p> <p>The application of mass communication to influence family planning is a natural extension to the basic idea that the media can inform and motivate people. Communication efforts have become increasingly widespread in developing worldas part of international technical assistance and government program designed to reduce fertility. l clay, many more citizens listen to the radio than read newspapers or watch television.</p> <p>The focus of this work is to illustrate the analysis of the efforts and impact of mass media on family planning.</p> <p><strong>1.2      STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The application of mass media to influence fertility is a natural extension of the basic idea that the media can both inform and motivate people, even about such complex subjects as their reproductive means and goals. There is understandably a strong interest within population policy and family planning and the roles mass media plays to get the message across to the population.</p> <p>What is the evidence that such efforts actually influence reproductive attitudes and behavior? What are women's exposures to family planning messages in the media as measured by their recall of those messages? Is there any positive effect to contraceptive use especially by women who stand the risk of repeated pregnancy through unprotected sex? How does the spouse respond to issues of contraceptive use by their wives viz-a-­viz truth and fidelity?</p> <p>Does these of contraceptive encourage promiscuity° among married women?</p> <p>In the course of knowing the problems and effects the effects that are being created by family punning and the role of mass media in creating the needed awareness, the following critical questions are examined.</p> <p>·                 How has media awareness created the needed information that will help couples plan their family?</p> <p>·                 What are the cultural barriers that will militate against access to birth control drugs and programmes?</p> <p><strong>1.3      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>·                    This research is significant because it provides the basis for further research into this topic by providin6 related data. The importance is underscored in the strategic position mass media play -s in every facet of human life and development.</p> <p>·                    Again, the issue of quality of life for mother and child and high infant and maternal death adds more credence to the significance of this study.</p> <p>·                    Again, the issue of duality of life for mother and child and high infant and maternal death adds more credence to the significance of this study.</p> <p>·                    In all, that study will be useful to health planners to fashion out better ways toproject quality of safe life and living for the women and children population in setting achievable standards concerning media influence on family planning in the society.</p> <p><strong>1.4      OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In a bid to ensure that this study is relevant in the field of academic profession certain aims have been designed for this research work. The aims that this research was carried out have the following objectives in mind;</p> <p>·                    To examine and determine the knowledge and perception of the people of Agege community towards family planning.</p> <p>·                    To examine the impact of mass media on family planning in the community.</p> <p>·                    To suggest methods to bring about improvement to the health of both the mother and child.</p> <p>·                    Assessment of government attitude towards family planning and quality of health of mothers.</p> <p>·                    To advance solutions to the problems of media influence on family planning.</p> <p>·                    To recommend positive ways towards family planning.</p> <p><strong>1.5      RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In the course of knowing the problems that couples face when selecting methods of family planning and the role of mass media in creating the needed awareness, the study intends to provide answers to these questions;</p> <p>·                    Do people in the rural areas have access to mass communication methods like the urban dwellers?</p> <p>·                    What is the cognitive level of family planning and family planning devices available to them'?</p> <p>·                    What influences the attitude and decision of per rejection of family planning methods available to them''</p> <p>·                    How has media awareness created the needed information that will help couples plan their family?</p> <p>·                    What are the cultural barriers that will militate against access to birth control drugs and programmes?</p> <p><strong>1.6      SCOPE AND DELIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of this research project is centered on the influence of mass media on family planning in Agege Local Government area of Lagos State. The study tried to capture the effect of mass media in dissemination of family planning information as it has a wider reach and immediacy effect. It also looked at health issues surrounding child and maternal and mortality.</p> <p>Time and financial constraints are two limitations to this study. Subsequent difficulty was encountered in obtaining data from the general public, nursing mother, hospitals etc. Shortage of literature review was another inhibiting factor. It was also difficult in getting young mothers and pregnant mothers to divulge information.</p> <p>This research is significant because it provides the basis for further research into this topic by providing related data. The importance is underscored in the strategic position mass media plays in every facet of human life and development.</p> <p>Again, the issue will be useful to health planners to fashion out better ways to project quality of safe life and living for the women and children population in setting achievable standards concerning media influence on family planning in the society.</p> <p><strong>1.8</strong><strong>DEFINATION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><em>MASS MEDIA:</em> this includes all means of effective communication with the larger society like radio, television, internet, billboards, fliers, magazine and journals, periodical, etc.</p> <p><em>MEDIA:</em> This includes all means and equipments used in the effective’s dissemination of information.</p> <p><em>FAMILY PLANNING:</em> Modern method of spacing children for effective planning of the family and care of both the mother’s health and the child</p>                                                            \n\nINFLUENCE OF MASS MEDIA AWARENESS TO PROMOTION OF FAMILY PLANNING PRACTICES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " INFLUENCE OF MASS MEDIA AWARENESS TO PROMOTION OF FAMILY PLANNING PRACTICES", "id": 150}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The study concerns how the KEKE NAPEP programme of Federal Government Poverty Eradication Programmes has fared in alleviating poverty among youths in Ojokoro Local Government Area of Lagos State.</p> <p>Poverty rate occasioned by unemployment has consumed a frighten dimension in Nigeria.

Such idea informs the stand of those economists who believe that poverty cannot be measured.  Okoh, (1998).</p> <p>However, different researchers have tried to define poverty. For instance, Ravallion andBidani (1994) refer to poverty as a lack of command over basic consumption needs that are a situation of inadequate level of command over basic rise to insufficient food, clothing and shelter.

(1987) defined poverty as a lack of certain capabilities such as being able to participate with dignity in societal endeavors.</p> <p>Poverty has also been defined as the inability to attain a minimum standard of living.  World Development Report,( 1990).</p> <p>Definition a poor person A poor person is considered as one without job, who canno help himself or cater for his family, who has no money, farm or business. Adolescent males and females are poor if they have no parent, no education, no good food, clothes and health. A poor person is described as one who is undernourished and aging fast, one without self confidence, looks dirty and lives in filthy environment, one who cannot cater for his family, train his children in the school and unable to pay medical bill (The World Bank, 1992)</p> <p>The major category of people vulnerable to poverty are women and children, majority of whom live in the rural areas, or migrate from rural areas with cannot fit into many of theurban jobs. Aina and Odebiyi (1997) attributed urban poverty to high rate of urbanization, accompanied with high rate of migration, population density, high rate of population growth, the unemployment, inflation and bad governance (such that urban centres in Nigeria generally lack basic social infrastructures to meet the needs of the teaming population.</p> <p>Poverty becomes widespread in Nigeria after the implementation of Structural AdjustmentProgramme (SAP) in Nigeria. When Babangida seized the government from Buhari, the former agreed to implement the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditionality becausepoverty had become glaring in Nigeria most especially among the rural dwellers leading torural-urban migration. It is in record that Babangida wasted more than 100 billion Naira on phantom projects, D.O. Elumilade, (2006). These projects included the one initiated by his wife, Better Life progammes for the poor, DEFRI, People's Bank of Nigeria, two democratic transition experiments and other big time corruption in Babangida regime enrichedthemselves D.O. Elumilade, (2006).</p> <p>Poverty in Nigeria cuts across different strata of the society in all the thirty six states and Abuja the FCT of the country. However, the position of Lagos state as the former capital of Nigeria as well as the commercial nerve centre of the country made the problem to be morepronounced. Lagos poses as an attraction various rural settlements in Nigeria; particularly the youths who see Lagos as a place full of economical opportunities.</p> <p>However, the excessive influx of people from all parts of the country into Lagos over the lasty affected the economy distribution of wealth, resources and infrastructures.  This has created a form of economic imbalance whereby the available wealth, resources and infrastructures appear to be distributed among the influential and the elites in the society.</p> <p>A major manifestation of poverty in the state is seen in crime rate, malnutrition, large numberof street urchins (Area boys) and the establishment of many slums in and around the Lagos metropolis by people who cannot afford to get good shelter for themselves. Some of these slums include: the Maroko, Ajegunle and Mushin to mention but a few. Condition of living in these settlements are so bad that those people cannot afford the basic need such as good food, good shelter, good clothing etc. People in these settlements also lack access to basic infrastructures  such as road, good education, good medical facilities among other things. Another manifestation of poverty is seen in the over stretched usage of the available resources like roads, health care facilities, power (electrical installations), water, transport system etc. A very important resultant effect of poverty or economy imbalance in Lagos is seen in the breeding of touts and miscreants popularly known as ‘Agbero' or \"Omoota\" i.e. Motor Park touts. These people are so ruthless in their conducts that they constitute major threat to the peace and safety as well as the security of lives and property in the state.</p> <p>Poverty has many root causes, while it is primarily related to very low income earners; is in many dimensions especially in malnutrition, ill health and illiteracy.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The persistence of massive poverty in Nigeria has created myriads of social maladies and security challenges.  There is no doubt that there are some factors within the poor that are responsible for this morally unconscionable plague. Hitherto obvious lack of concerted institutional and policy framework in Nigeria to tackle the scourge of poverty constituted a major challenge. It is on the bases of these facts this research is designed to provide solution to the following questions:</p> <p>1.       What are the effects of poverty on the urban dwellers?</p> <p>2.       What is the relationship between keke NAPEP initiative and poverty reduction among operators?</p> <p>3.       Are there any factors militating against the success of keke NAPEP in poverty alleviation?</p> <p>4.       What are the durability and efficiency as well as overall maintenance implication         of keke NAPEP?</p> <p>5.       What are the contributory effects of road network, traffic and transport officials of keke NAPEP?</p> <p><strong>1.3     STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>The following hypothesis will be tested at 0.5 significance:</p> <p>1.                 Keke NAPEP has significantly reduced poverty among its operators.</p> <p>2.                 Keke NAPEP is not expensive to maintain and operate.</p> <p>3.                 Road network has no significant influence on keke NAPEP operation.</p> <p>4.                 There is no significant relationship between traffic and profitability.</p> <p><strong>1.4     JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The issue of poverty among the Nigeria population is a very important one.  It significant reduction is a task that the past and present government have continue to address by coming up with different programmes and strategies.  One of such programmes is KEKE NAPEP which was introduced more than 10 years.  This study is necessary in order to know the programme has performed in term of poverty alleviation.</p> <p>The findings of this study are expected to determine the achievement or problem(s) being encountered by the programme in the study area in order to come up with appropriate solution.</p> <p><strong>1.5     OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The broad objective of the study is to examine the impact of KEKE NAPEP as poverty alleviation strategy in Ojokoro Local Government Area of Lagos State.  The specific objectives are:</p> <p>(i)       To determine if there is improvement in the economic well-being of the operators in the study area or not.</p> <p>(ii)      To determine the suitability of working environment for KEKE NAPEP in the study area.</p> <p>(iii)     To determine whether the average revenue of operators is influenced by the period of operation or not.</p> <p>(iv)     To identify the various costs incurred by the operators in the study area.</p>                                                            \n\nIMPACT OF KEKE NAPEP AS POVERTY ALLEVIATION STRATEGY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF KEKE NAPEP AS POVERTY ALLEVIATION STRATEGY", "id": 151}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>This project is an analysis of Drug and Alcoholic abuse among the youths in Agege Local Government Area of Lagos State. The nature of continuous exposure to the street and its associated lifestyles makes most youths vulnerable to the use of psychoactive substances. At present, there is insufficient information regarding the pattern of psychoactive substance use among this group of children in Nigeria. The most commonly used psychoactive substances were alcohol, kola nut, tobacco and cannabis. None of the respondents reported the use of cocaine, opiates or hallucinogens. Length of stay on the street was found to be significantly predictive of current psychoactive substance use. The readily available and relatively cheap substances were in common use among street children with the length of stay on the street being a significant predictive factor. The affected community and the government should design methods of curtailing the problem of drug use and helping the children off the street.</em></p> <p><strong><br/> CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Alcohol use and abuse is a serious problem among young people. There are a number of unhealthy risks associated with it, including alcohol dependence, and alcohol related accidents and violence.</p> <p>There are many factors that contribute to the influence of drug abuse or drug addiction among the Nigerian youths, namely peer groups, parental background (broken home), and emotional stress among others.</p> <p>Today, majority of people m the country believe that drug abuse is a cankerworm and a disturbing problem in the lives of our youths.</p> <p>It has already been established that drug abuse is a factor to be reckoned with. While some people see it from the psychological point of view as part of Erikson's Psycho-social Development and Maslow's Need Gratification Theory (1954), others perceive drug abuse as a societal malaise.</p> <p>That it is socially unacceptable in Nigeria is manifested in some recent anti-drug agencies formed in different parts of the country. For instance, apart from institutional and state anti-drug agencies, the Federal Government created the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA). This shows the extent to which drug abuse has assumed national importance.</p> <p>It is therefore an evil to be properly watched, monitored and discouraged. Like \"little drops of water that forms oceans\", it probably started at home, school, or societal levels only to become a phenomenon of uncontrollable magnitude. The research work reported in this paper arose because this phenomenon from all Indications is worth probing into especially from the view point of controlling this menace in our society.</p> <p>Young people who persistently abuse substances often experience an array of problem, including, academic difficulties, health-related problems (including mental health), poor peer relationships and involvement with the juvenile justice system. Additionally, there are consequences for family members, the community, and the entire society. In fact, the most likely cause of death for a 16 year old is alcohol related. For that reason, it is important to clearly understand the extent of youth involvement in underage drinking.</p> <p>The impact of drug and alcohol abuse among Nigerian youth has been a stigma of a morally bankrupt, decadent and wasted generation that must be revitalized and collectively salvaged together in order to prevent the total degeneration and loss of our societal values and ideals. What is the brain behind our rotten society via the Nigerian youth? The answer is not fetched; it's simply drug and substance abuse.</p> <p>We cannot all sit on the fence and criminally pretend on the menace of drug abuse that has eaten very deep into the fabrics of our society. The idea of smoking cigarette in the past is something very rare, unlike today that hard drugs and marijuana is openly smoked and distributed freely in the open with the very law enforcement agents keeping a blank eye. What do we mean by the term \"drug abuse\"? Drug abuse may be defined as the \"arbitrary\" overdependence or abuse of one particular drug with or without a prior medical diagnosis from qualified health practitioners. Majority of the Nigerian youths ignorantly depend on one form of drug or the other for their various daily activities - social, educational, political, moral, etc.</p> <p>Dangerous drugs like cocaine, Indian hemp (marijuana), morphine, heroine, tobacco, ephedrine etc. Some of these dangerous drugs are both represents and stimulants, making the users either to feel high (on top of the world!) or low (below the sea level!) since there is a common adage which says \"Show me your friend and I will tell you who you are”.</p> <p>The sociological implications of drug abuse among the Nigerian youth have been a major threat to the peaceful co-existence of all and sundry in our contemporary society, thereby destroying the socio-political dignity, personality and integrity of dependence on life. The various consequences of the drug abuse or drug addiction are so devastating and very shameful to the extent that both the national and international organizations all over the world are also worried about the spread of this scourge among the Nigerian youths.</p> <p>They are as follows: social violence among youths, armed robbery, mental disorders, 419 syndrome, social miscreants (Area boys and girls), lawlessness among youth, lack of respect for elders, rape, and many more of the social evils. Who is to hold to ransom and blame seriously for the menace of drug abuse among the Nigerian youth? The family through non-internalization of social norms, the society or peer groups of our youths. Many narcotics have been banned among our youths for their indiscriminate use by the international organizations like FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization), WHO (World Health Organization) and our various local organizations. There is a proverb in Latin which says \"mens sana in corpore sano\" - meaning – “a sound mind in a sound body.\" Hence, the ever usage of drugs and alcohol will never let one be in this state of sound mind in a sound body.</p> <p>The various consequences of the drug abuse or drug addiction are so devastating and very shameful to the extent that both the national and international organizations all over the world are also worried about the spread of this scourge among the Nigerian youths. This deviant behavior happen the breeding ground for other social vices as follows: social violence among youths, armed robbery, mental disorders, 419 syndrome, social miscreants (Area boys and girls), lawlessness among youth, lack of respect for elders, rape, and many more of the social evils. Who is to hold to ransom and blame seriously for the menace of drug abuse among the Nigerian youth? Parental background via the society or peer groups of our youths?</p> <p>In the higher institutions of learning, binge drinking has become another social norm. Binge drinking is the habit of having five or more drinks in a row, which could have serious health risks. Although, binge drinking levels are lower than they were in the 1980s, there is still a significant minority of youth who are engaging in this risky behavior. Binge drinking levels increase throughout adolescence and peak at ages 18-22.</p> <p>More than three-fourths of youth age 12-17 are not regular drinkers. It is very encouraging that despite some sensational headlines d tragic incidents related to alcohol use and abuse, data from the past two decades show a continuing trend of decreasing youth alcohol use. One major area of concern remains; however, the increasing percentage of teens who binge drink.</p> <p><strong>1.2      STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>It is no longer new in our society that young people has taken after deviant behaviors to express themselves in our society. Deviance is not a property inherent in certain forms of behavior (Erikson, 1962; Becker, 963; Lemert, 1972); it is a property conferred upon particular behaviors by social definitions.</p> <p>In the course of our daily lives, people use normative schemes available to them and make judgments regarding the desirability or undesirability of this or that behavior. They then translate their judgments into favourable or unfavourable consequences of those who engage in the behavior. In this sense, deviance is what people say it is.</p> <p>From the foregoing, it is evident that the larger society frowns at alcohol and drug abuse by the youths.</p> <p>In this research, attention will be focused on some important problems relating to the causes and challenges as it affects the youths who abuse the usage of drugs and alcohol in Agege Local Government Area.</p> <p>The problems among others include:</p> <p>·        The cultural and religious dimension of drugs and alcohol abuse by youths in Agege Local Government in Lagos State.</p> <p>·        The socio-economic constraints.</p> <p>·        Efforts towards the rehabilitation of drug addicts and their eventual reintegration into the society.</p> <p><strong>1.3      RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>In the course of knowing the problems that youths face when dealing with the problem of alcoholic and drug abuse, the study intends to provide answers to these questions;</p> <p>·        Does media awareness enhance the need for proper control of drugs in our society?</p> <p>·        In what ways has both cultural and religious barriers inhibited access to media awareness in controlling youth's behavior, promotion of responsive drinking?</p> <p>·        Has parental background had a major role to play in correcting the \"plague\" of drug abuse among the Nigerian youths?</p> <p>·        To know the extent of implementation of health policy, the problems and argument in favor of media awareness to the people living in Agege Local Government Area.</p> <p><strong>1.4      OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of the study is to access the socio-economic causes and challenges of drug and alcoholic abuse among the youths in Agege Local Government area of Lagos State. The general purpose is to examine the socio-economic causes and challenges of this phenomenon.</p> <p>The specific objectives are:</p> <p>·           To determine the causes of deviant behavior as exhibited by the youths.</p> <p>·           To investigate the causes of cultural and religious barriers to youths deviant behavior in the society.</p> <p>·           Assessment of government attitude towards availability, distribution and access of controlled drugs by the youths.</p> <p>·           To advance solutions to the problems of drugs and alcoholic abuse among the youths.</p> <p>·           To contribute new facts and knowledge to academic field.</p> <p>·           The consequences of the activities to the general public.</p> <p>·           Intervention methods to eradicate and clean up the problem of drug abuse and youth drinking.</p> <p><strong>1.5      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Numerous studies have been carried out on the abuse of drugs and youth drinking, binge drinking, substance abuse like marijuana, cigarettes smoking, etc. but few took the issue of drugs and alcoholic abuse by the youths into consideration as a major social problem directly involving and affecting the lives and development of the youths in general, with visible negative effects on the society as well.</p> <p>The few that dwelled on this topic could be found wanting in some aspects especially as it affects youth development.</p> <p>Hence, the significance of the research is first to understand the reasons for the persistence use of drugs and alcoholic abuse among the youths, their motivations, and to formulate better ways to deal with this social problem and re-integrate them back into civil society. Thus, the study will he of theoretical relevance to the res archers, scholars, and academics that would want to carry out research or further research on this topic or similar topics in future.</p> <p>This study will be available for criticisms and analysis and may also serve as a platform for further postulations or as a source of reference materials.</p> <p>Practically, this study will serve as a tooI to assist both Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO), Policy makers etc, in effecting positive changes in issues concerning the youths.</p> <p>Being a topical issue, Agege in Lagos State will be examined closely for the purpose of this study and references will also be made to certain peculiar situations in some other cities in Nigeria.

The study employed both primary and secondary sources of data collection such: as survey design, interviews and journal reviews. This research recommends that youth should engage in profitable activities such acquiring soft skills and expertise while still searching for jobs rather than sitting idle home.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Unemployment among graduates in Nigeria is one of the most critical problems the country is facing. Nigeria is a country passing through multiple transitions, form the period of colonialism to independence, from illiteracy to literacy, subsistence agriculture to monetary economy, rural life to urban cosmopolitan life, form the day of employment to the days of mass unemployment. Year after year in Nigeria, the increasing number of graduates joining the labour market keeps rising geometrically and any hope for them to secure jobs looks pessimistic. The tempo of economic development does not keep pace with the rate of educational advancement. That a developing country should suffer from surplus labour is hardly surprising, but generally, unemployment is one thing and graduate unemployment is another. Unemployment has in all their ramifications come to stay with us since the era of oil boom.</p> <p>According to Daily Star, June 30 1986, unemployment is described as a situation where there are few jobs to go round the great number of people willing to work\". Here, it could be both educated and uneducated people in the country. Graduates unemployment has become some of the basic economic social and political problems facing so many states in Nigeria recently. The graduates in this context are' generally the school leavers from our post primary and higher schools of learning. This pitiable \"labour forces\" that are left redundant are ever ready to put in their best services in any kind of jobs, but would not be called upon to do so because of the situation in the country.</p> <p>In Lagos metropolis, there has been a persistent increase in the number of unemployed graduates of institutions of higher learning. It is a problem that has consistently forced itself on the minds of different people in different ages. It is time we redressed our mind sincerely to the issue of graduate unemployment. The past government officials in the state had failed to give an accurate employment figure of the labour force available. and this has perpetuated to pose some dangerous threats to the socio­economic stability of the state than usual.</p> <p>On this note, therefore, it becomes imperative to give a brief definition of unemployment. According to Wikipedia, Unemployment (or joblessness) occurs when people are without work and actively seeking work. The unemployment rate is a measure of the prevalence of unemployment and it is calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all individuals currently in the labor force(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment). Also, according to Nigeria Statesman May 28, 1986, \"Unemployment connotes the scarcity of job both in public and private sectors. This may be traceable to mismanagement of productive resources, immobility of labour between jobs, economic crisis like oil doom etc. especially in our predominately capitalist economy.</p> <p>Unlike in the past, graduates of schools of higher learning now roam the streets and motor parks in search of non-existing job opportunities and this has created immeasurable number of social and economic problems in the status quo of the society. This problem therefore, is of staggering magnitude because idleness influences all our actions and designs. It corrupts the graduates and is the bane of the middle ages. This research is also intended to find out the root causes of the increasing number of unemployed graduates and the strategies designed by graduates to cope with it.</p> <p>It is of paramount importance to stress that no other economic problem needed more immediate attention than finding job for the growing number of unemployed graduates. In the light of these problems, the former Head of State and Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces General Sani Abacha in his 1st October, 1995 broadcast lifted the ban on employment. There is no doubt that the country has witnessed an upsurge in crime such as drug addiction and sophisticated armed robberies while broken homes, malnutrition and many other social vices are on the increase too.</p> <p>Other factors that contributed to this situation also remain an integral part of this research. Such factors include the expansion of the existing schools and establishment of new schools without a collateral increase in industries to absorb produced graduates, the behaviour of graduate 'themselves towards jobs like farming construction of roads, bridges, school taxi cars and also the over-dependence of a mono-export-oriented economy etc. the efforts of the previous government in areas of infusion of skill­ orientation in educational scheme will be scrutinized in order to have a balanced an analysis. Did the government evolves stringent measures aimed at eradicating problem of unemployment in the state or did they apply the myopic machineries which appealed to policy makers because of case or execution?</p> <p>The answer to this question with relevance to the historical background of Akala area of Mushin, Lagos requires meticulous evaluation in order to find a lasting solution. The researcher will therefore, use questionnaire and review of past work in the same direction. Most regrettably, however, there is scarcity of domestic data relating to the number of unemployed graduate of school of higher learning.</p> <p><strong>1.2      STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The unabated increase in the rate of unemployment among the youth and how they cope with it, with particular emphasis on higher institution graduate has been a source of concern to the entire nation. More so, being aware of the social vices that this situation could result in makes it more disabusing. This situation is a dilemma when we consider many policies, and legislation so far put in place by the government to cub this mince and how ineffective they have been as an instrument to reduce unemployment. The researcher, having considered the above and decided to study the under listed problems with the view to pinpoint the cause, coping strategies and possibly proffering lasting solutions to them.</p> <p>1.     The increase in the rate of unemployment amongst higher institution graduate and how they are coping with it.</p> <p>2.     Understanding the capacity of the university graduate we have today including those who have studied in very essential field which before now was not so. Nevertheless they suffer unemployment.</p> <p>3.     The increase in the scope of private sector participation which should result in the increase in employment of university graduate has not been true in our situation.</p> <p>4.     The federal government recently increased the capital base of the bank of industry so as to allow more graduate to participate in the federal government graduate loan scheme, with the aim of being self-employed, but this has not yielded any meaningful result or reduced the unemployment toll.</p> <p><strong>1.3      OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The general objectives of this study is to determine the coping strategies among unemployed youths in Akala, Mushin Local government area.</p> <p>The specific objectives include;</p> <p>1.        Understanding the socio-economic implications of unemployment.</p> <p>2.        Identifying the coping mechanisms among unemployed graduate.</p> <p>3.        To recommend and suggest measures at reducing unemployment in Lagos State in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.4      RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1.        How does it feel to be an unemployed graduate?</p> <p>2.        Are there unemployed graduates?</p> <p>3.        Are there enough jobs to absorb graduates or there are graduates that are lazy in getting available jobs?</p> <p>4.        What kind of skills makes a graduate employable?</p> <p><strong>1.5      HYPOTHESES</strong></p> <p>This study would be geared towards testing the following null hypotheses.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis One</strong></p> <p>Ho:     There is no significant difference between the available jobs and unemployed graduate rate</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis Two</strong></p> <p>Ho:     There is no significant difference between the structure of the society and graduate unemployment rate</p> <p><strong>1.5      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Owing to the down turn in the economic fortunes of this country over the years, the Nigerian graduates have lost their pride of place. Their status in the society has continued to dwindle. Today, it is sheer mirage for fresh graduates to dream of the good things of life. They are made to understand and accept that to graduates, unemployment should be seen as a passing phase in the history of the nation. It is very doubtful if the much desired change in the near future will bring us anything.</p> <p>Therefore, this study is aimed at showing the coping strategies among unemployed graduates. It is desirable to create a new forum in which the government plays a dominant role and actively promotes private enterprises, establishes new enterprises with a centrally directed mobilization of resources towards the definite objectives of solving the graduate problem. The solution to this national malaise lies in turnaround or direction on the economy.</p> <p><strong>1.6      SCOPE AND DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study on the problem of graduate unemployment and the coping strategies among graduates is such that would have taken me to different parts of the country. However, as a result of financial problems and more importantly the time factor i will be limiting this study to Akala community area of Mushin local government, area of Lagos state.</p> <p>Due to the nature of topic, the researcher limits the respondents to unemployed graduates in the selected area.</p> <p>It is not uncommon that during the process of this research work, some difficulties were overcome. These difficulties are:</p> <p>1)        The time given for this research was not enough. The study is supposed to last for at least six months to enable a thorough study on the topic.</p> <p>2)        Scarcity of materials also posed a constraint to the researcher since no text has been written purely on the topic. Most libraries where such helping materials were found refused to allow the researcher make use of them.</p> <p>3)        Financial constraint contributes in no small measure in impending the length and width of research. Cost of materials, transport fare and scarcity of fuel were among the limitations of the study.</p> <p><strong>1.7      DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>UNEMPLOYMENT:</strong> This means involuntary idleness.

The fish farming option can be seen as an option to checkmate unemployment. So, this project focuses on exploring the fish farming business as the way youth can be self-employed. This project is divided into five chapters with chapter one starting with the background of the study, objective of the study limitation of the study statement of research problem, scope of the study and justification of the study. Several literature are review to see what other authority says about the topic. So, several books, journals and other sources of information were used to assess the level and nature of unemployment situation globally and also in Nigeria. The option fish farming was expressively discussed for easy understanding of those who intend to go for the business. The research methodology aspect is the focuses of chapter three while the four deals with data analysis and interpretation. The questionnaires were design and distributed to the respondent, personal interview and observation were also used to get the information. The data was interpreted using simple percentage, regression analysis and spearman rank order correlation method were used to test the two hypothesis of the fish farming reduce youth unemployment and fish farming is a lucrative business. Finally, the whole finding were summarize, recommendations were made and the chapter was concluded on the note that fish farming could be a better option to checkmate youth unemployment in Nigeria and also lucrative.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1      BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Unemployment is defined according to Oxford Advance Dictionary as the fact of number of people without a job. Harold Goldstein (2008) defined unemployment as enforced idleness of wage earners who are able and willing to work but cannot find jobs. In societies in which most people can earn a living only by working for others, being unable to find a job is a serious problem. Because of its human costs in deprivation and a feeling of rejection and personal failure, the extent of unemployment is widely used as a measure of workers' welfare. The proportion of workers unemployed also shows how well a nation's human resources are used and serves as an index of economic activity.</p> <p>Unemployment is a global phenomenon in this 21st century. For example the rate of unemployment in Belgium stood at 8.7% (statistics institute of Belgium, 2010).United Arab Emirate rise to 12.7% (Emirate business April, 2008). United State of America is 9.8% (office of national statistic US November, 2010).</p> <p>The rates of unemployment in Africa are listed below: -</p> <p>Ø    South Africa 25.3% (statistic South Africa, 2010)</p> <p>Ø    Nigeria 19.7% (National Bureau for statistic federal Republic of Nigeria 2009, September).</p> <p>Economists have described the causes of unemployment as frictional, seasonal, structural, and cyclical.</p> <p>Frictional unemployment arises because workers seeking jobs do not find them immediately; while looking for work they are counted as unemployed. <em>Friction</em> in this case refers to the incongruity between the demand for and supply of labor.</p> <p>Seasonal unemployment occurs when industries have a slow season, such as construction and other outdoor work in winter. It also occurs at the end of the school year in June, when large numbers of students and graduates look for work. At its seasonal high point (January and February), Structural unemployment arises from an imbalance between the kinds of workers wanted by employers and the kinds of workers looking for jobs. The imbalances may be caused by inadequacy in skills, location, or personal characteristics. Technological developments, for example, necessitate new skills in many industries, leaving those workers who have outdated skills without a job.</p> <p>Cyclical unemployment results from a general lack of demand for labor. When the business cycle turns downward, demand for goods and services drops; consequently, workers are laid off. In the 19th century, the U.S. experienced depressions roughly every 20 years.</p> <p>However, several effort have been made to tackle unemployment globally through fund from international economic organization (like World Bank, International monetary fund, European Economic Community), Government, corporate organization, non Governmental parastatal and individual. Attentions are driven toward creating job rather than seeking for job.</p> <p>Ogunleye G.A. (2004) says in the face of severe unemployment experienced by a country as Nigeria, small and medium scale is usually the way out. The experience of some developed countries like United States of America and China that SME has contributed to the growth and development of these economies, especially in terms of employment, contribution to GDP, export, etc. it is as a result of these that U.S.A currently has a small business sector that has about 22 million small sector generating more than a half of the country’s GDP, employing about 53% of the total private workforce, and is responsible for creation of all new jobs. Also in china, the number of township enterprises (as SME are called ) increase from 1.52 million in 1978 to 19 million in 1991. During this period, their employees increased from 28 million to 96 million. The same is true of rural Middle East and Asian.</p> <p>In a developing country like Nigeria, SMEs have been recognized as the foundation for achieving rapid economic growth and development by way of their output as well as employment potentials. However, despite the numerous advantages of SMEs, the contribution of this sector to the overall economic development of the nation has over the years remained low. Because of this problems and in recognition of SMEs advantage federal government of Nigeria has over the years continued to play pioneering and active roles since the 1970s in stimulating SMEs. Notable among the past present and measures for combating unemployment include:</p> <p>1.     provision of strong institutional support which can be seen in the following:</p> <p>·              The establishment of the small scale industries credit schemes (SSIC) in 1971.the scheme was operated as a matching grant between state and federal government to make credit available for small and medium enterprise.</p> <p>·              The establishment of industrial development centers (IDC) 1970-1975.under the plan, #800,000 was allocated for setting up IDCs in various parts of the country. The aim of government was to provide extension services to the SME as they relate to product development, entrepreneurial training, and technical appraisal of loan application as well as managerial assistance.</p> <p>·              Establishment of National Directorate of Employment (NDE) 1986. Through the Directorate, a number of programmes such as small scale industries, youth Employment and vocational skills Development, etc, were embarked upon to boost employment.</p> <p>·              Working for Yourself Programme (WFYP) with the assistance of British council and the international labour organization (ILO), the federal ministry of industries established this programme to provide technical skills to business entrepreneurs.</p> <p>2.                 Establishment of industrial banks and ensuring easy access to credit facilities at reasonable rates. Government realize fund to the established bank through central bank of Nigeria. The established banks are:</p> <p>o    The Nigerian industrial development bank (1964).the bank can grant loan from # 50000- #15 million but not more than the 75% of the fixed asset of the business being finance.</p> <p>o    The Nigeria bank for commerce and industry (1973) to furtherance of its objective to ensure availability of finance to indigenous entrepreneurs.</p> <p>o    National economic reconstruction fund (NERFUND) Set up in 1989 to provide medium to long term loan for SME.</p> <p>The government, Non-Governmental organization and individual citizen of Nigeria effort have gone a long way in generating employment across the sectors of the economy.</p> <p>Despite the effort made so far to combat unemployment, 29,550,000 youth are still unemployment (national bureau for statistics federal republic of Nigeria 2009) which means by implication the number will increase by some Nigeria Youth Corp who will step into the labour market this year. To remedy this government can work on the sector that has the potential of generating employment i.e. agricultural sector particularly fish farming.</p> <p>In 2004 the total world production of fish farming was 140,500,000 tones and the growth rate has been sustained and rapid, in 2007, its market reached $ 86 billion (Source: World Fisheries and Aquaculture) which tells us that fish farming has the potentiality of creating employment globally.</p> <p>Fish farming is an important economic activity in China. Between 1980 and 1997, the Chinese harvests grew at annual rate of 16.7 percent, jumping from 1,900,000 tones to 23,000,000 tones (Source: Chinese Bureau of fisheries report, 2005) which account for 70% of world production of fish.</p> <p>Nigeria as a nation has a population of 150 million people (Source: population Census 2006) with the unending demand for fish by her populate can adopt the measure that China used in combating unemployment. Therefore, fish farming is one of lucrative business one can learn and earn a very good profit.</p> <p><strong>WHAT THEN IS FISH FARMING?</strong></p> <p>According to Grace .O. Evbuomwan (2004) defined fish farming as the art of growing and breeding fish in enclosures such  as ponds, multipurpose water reservoirs, irrigation and drainage channels, fish pens constructed at the edges of rivers or lakes, water filled burrow pits as well as fish cages floated on rivers or lakes.</p> <p>            Fish farming has the following braches which one can specialize and expand as time goes by: -</p> <p>1.                 Construction of fish ponds</p> <p>2.                 Production and selling of fingerlings </p> <p>3.                 Buying and Nurturing of fingerlings to juveniles and post juveniles       stage   then crop.</p> <p>4.                 Buying and selling of feeds</p> <p>5.                 Fish farming consultant.</p> <p>Fish farming Nigeria contribute to the Nigeria GDP of #216.417 billion (source Chairman Fishery society of Nigeria) and small and medium scale fish farming contribute #14 billion to the economy. This is indeed an eye opener to a lucrative business one can start and make cool money.</p> <p><strong>1.2.     STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Unemployment is a social evil that must be kept at an acceptable level because it bring about increase in crime rate and other social vices among the youth, ranging from prostitution , political violent, internet scam, kidnapping, militancy in Niger delta, drug trafficking  armed robbery and girl trafficking to Italy. It also brings about loss of dignity, human suffering, poverty, family disintegration etc.</p> <p>The need to create employment has made government to be taking several measures to tackle the problem through conversing for entrepreneurial behaviour among the youth accompany with initiating of several developmental and empowerment programs through national directorate for employment, releasing of fund from centre bank of Nigeria through bank of industry to micro finance bank.</p> <p>The fish farming can be considered as an option in the face of unemployment as Nigeria is yet to meet the increase in demand for fish as an alternative source of protein that is not carcinogenic. Fish farming is an economic activity that could lead to improved income and quality of life and it have a high rating because the net return on investment is relatively higher than that of other animal species and its contributory role to national economy cannot be over emphasized.</p> <p><strong>1.3.     RESEARCH QUESTION</strong></p> <p>For the effective research study, researcher shall find answer to the following question:</p> <p>1.                 How lucrative is fish farming?</p> <p>2.                 What is the minimum capital requirement to set up the business?</p> <p>3.                 What are the danger and risk to watch out for?</p> <p>4.                 What is the technical knowledge one must possess before venture       into the business?</p> <p>5.                 What is the anticipated pay back period of investment?</p> <p>6.                 How can one source for fund to finance the business?</p> <p>7.                 What are the branches and method of fish farming?</p> <p>8.                 What is the marketing potential of fish farming business?</p> <p>            The study will help to critically appraise fish farming as an option to reduce unemployment among Nigeria youth.</p> <p><strong>1.4.     OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The search light of this research is primarily focus on fish farming as a tool to combat unemployment. This study will be an eye opener for youth to look inward and see many lucrative business opportunity he/she can embark upon. In the light of this, the following objectives world be addressed and these include: -</p> <p>a.        Revealing ways of gaining financial support for business.</p> <p>b.        Offer possible solution to the danger and risk involve in fish farming.</p> <p>c.         Comparing other businesses with fish farming business so as to ascertain the better option of your choice.</p> <p>d.        Exploring marketing potential of fish farming.</p> <p>e.        Awareness of Ethics, Government rule and Regulation girding the business.</p> <p>f.          Extensive study on, “how can I get the business started”.</p> <p>g.        Step by step’s approach of becoming a large scale fish farmer and earn maximum profit.</p> <p><strong>1.5.     JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study will be of great importance to: -</p> <p>i.            Individual who is at the valley of decision concerning what kind of business to start and how lucrative can it’s be.</p> <p>ii.            The corporate organization seeking to diversity its business can as well discover through this research the potentiality of fish farming business in the market and its profit maximization.</p> <p>iii.            The Government, after been aware of the research by the World Bank that majority of Nigerians falls below the poverty line of $1 per day (World Bank 2002). In looking for how to create employment, fish farming should be consider with the potentiality of creating 23,000 jobs (source chairman fishery society of Nigeria i.e. FISON).</p> <p>iv.            The insecurity in the country which is militant in Niger delta, kidnapping, robbery and prostitution is as a result of poverty and unemployment so this study will go a long way to appeal to the hungry man who is angry and at the same time bring morality to the country.</p> <p>v.            Several undergraduates are yet to know that labour market is oversaturated and seeking white collar job can be a mirage. Therefore, the study is just establishing to undergraduate to look beyond getting certificate.</p> <p>vi.            One of the richest man in the whole world (Bill Gate) is not a civil servant but an entrepreneur therefore the topic is justify the fact that one can only serve purpose of God and of man having a personal businesses.</p> <p><strong>1.6.     SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The scope of the</p>                                                         \n\nCHECKMATING YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IN NIGERIA: FISH FARMING OPTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CHECKMATING YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IN NIGERIA: FISH FARMING OPTION", "id": 154}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>This study is uniformed and designed to unveil and reveal Family Planning Methods in Rural Communities of Enugu State with particular References to Aji In Igbo Eze North L.G.A. the researcher assessed the acceptance of the different methods of family planning in Aji.

The study also examined the relationship between family planning and the well-being of the family. Data for the study was sourced from two main sources which include Primary and Secondary sources of data Collection. Primary data: questionnaires and oral interviews were used to collect information from the respondents. Secondary data: journals, and other relevant materials relating to the area of my investigation will be review. Extensive literature review was carried out on the direct literature and indirect literature on books, journals and past works. The research instrument used in this study includes oral interview and questionnaire. The questionnaire is structural as to contain both close and open ended question. Simple tables and percentages were used in treatment of data analysis. At the end of the analysis the researcher observed that the method of family planning used by the people of Aji community are Traditional Methods, Contraceptive Measures, Conventional Methods and Withdrawal Methods. It was also observed that the people of Aji community are aware of the existing family planning methods. The study shows that family planning has positive impact on the well-being of the people of Aji community. It was also discovered that there is significant relationship between family planning and the well-being of the families in Aji community. Based on the findings the research her recommends that couples should plan their families by adhering to the practice prescribed by the planned parenthood federation and whose services are also given free in family planning clinics all over the country. Sex education should be encouraged in our community in particular and in our societies in general so as to minimize the rate of teenage pregnancies and child dumping.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>Background to the study</strong></p> <p>The term family planning has been on the lips of many in this nation for some time now but not much is known about it. The family is a social institution that unites individual into cooperative groups that over see bearing and raising of new children conventionally, the main aim of involving oneself into family life is for procreation, to bear and raise or socialize children into the society.</p> <p>It is regarded that family exist in every society but in different forms. Family as a smallest may start in the form of courtship leading to the marriage life.</p> <p>Family is a social institution that is responsible for procreation and raising of new brand of human being in the society.</p> <p>According to Pope John Paul II (1981) the family is a common unity of person and the smallest unit. “As such it is an institution fundamental to life of every society” thus the family consist of a husband, wife and their children, the family live together, pools its resources and work together and produce offspring. The structure of the family varies from society to society. The stability of any nation is very much dependant on its families, it is therefore believed that future and progress of any society bear on the live and development of the young one’s in the family. It is generally felt that family planning is in the interest of development of the countries expiring high rate in order to avoid population explosion in the future.</p> <p>In Nigeria, the treat is one of population growth being excessively higher than the rate which the country can provide the required service. If the quality of life is to be raised, population growth needs to be consider in planning socio economic development. Amenties have to be constant increased to make them available to large number of people looking at it in individuals prospect. The problem is even more critical, the ultimate objective is to bring about sustained improvement in the well being of the individual and express in all aspects of human right which include the right enough good food of the right kind of nutrition, good health education and shelter.</p> <p>¨     The right to employment, whether self, family wage employment.</p> <p>¨     The right to regulate family size and space children so that each child born is a wanted child who can be given a good start in life.</p> <p>With the prevailing level of socio-economic development many of these right are not at reach of the country especially those in rural area like Aji. Family planning is considered necessary because it affords couples and individual the opportunity to realize their potentials and make significant contribution to the socio-economic development process of the country.</p> <p>Family planning was introduced as a result of one growth in population of people, the rate of which people procreate has continuously increased as a result of not prepared for birth due to unplanned pregnancy.</p> <p>This will help various married couple girls under age of 18yrs and women over 35yrs. Men who wish to space or limit their pregnancies etc to realize their potentials and to make significant contribution of the entire nation. The advocate of both population control and abortion tells us that the world is becoming over crowded that in another few hundred years. There won’t be standing space on the earth.</p> <p>However, since the introduction of family planning came into existence in Nigeria, the government and some non-government agencies has made a lot of effort to see to it that the establishment and setting up of birth control clinics until several brunches around the country like here in Nigeria the planned parenthood federation of Nigeria (PPFN) unaffiliated of international planned parenthood federation.</p>                                                          \n\nFAMILY PLANNING METHODS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FAMILY PLANNING METHODS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES", "id": 155}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>This research work titled ethic affiliation and resource challenges in Nigeria with particular reference to Igbo Etiti Local Government Area of Enugu State. The researcher examined the effect of ethnic affiliation on the development of Nigerian economy. Four research questions and hypotheses were formulated in this project work. The research instrument used in this study includes oral interview and questionnaire. The population of the study was 209,248 while the samples size of 399 was determined by the use of Taro Yamanis formular. The sampling technique used in this study is simple random sampling. The questionnaire is structured as to contain both close and open ended question. Simple tables and percentages were used in treatment of data. Chi-square was used in testing the hypotheses.  At the end the researcher found out that Ethnic affiliation has significant effect on the development of Nigerian economy. It was also observed that the resource challenges of ethnic affiliation in Nigeria are Poor Revenue Allocation, Mismanagement of allocated funds and so on. The researcher equally discovered that the various ethnic affiliations in Igbo Etiti Local Government Area of Enugu State affects the area to a large extent. The study recommends that To build a virile state the ruling elites should encourage national discourse to enable the various groups’ air their grievances and fears.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1</strong><strong>Background of the study</strong></p> <p>It is a commonplace fact that Nigeria is a multi-ethnic nation state with socio-cultural differences between its component ethnic groups all of which have resulted into cultural dissimilarity (Okafor, 2007). This cultural dissimilarity has been manifested by, for instance, the differences in language, diet, dress and types of social system. Shrewd observers have noticed that the recent event such as globalization have not significantly diminished these differences. This static situation has been due to a number of reasons.</p> <p>The indigenous languages, which help to identify the various ethnic groups, are still spoken by almost the entire population of Nigeria.</p> <p>The style of life has not, for the majority people, changed to such a degree as to produce appreciably greater uniformity. Against this diverse background, many ethnic problems abound in Nigeria, which arise principally from the hostility that derives from competition between ethnically different peoples for wealth and power (Okafor, 2007).</p> <p>The establishment of ethno-regionalism had a significant impact in Nigerian political arena. Theoretically, Edlyne (2002) contented that, even the formations of political parties, their manifestos, system of leadership and campaign strategies were originated from ethnic and geographical dimensions. An ethnic nationality refers to people who agree to share a common language, their cultural ideology and self identity.</p> <p>While Okafor (2007) observed that since the beginning of democratic system of government during the first republic Nigerian political parties were forms into regional position supporting the three major ethnic groups the Hausa/Fulani, Igbo and Yoruba. In similar vein, the third republic of Nigerian democracy follows the same train. Furthermore, the model indicates clearly that Nigerians are more loyal to their ethnic background than their state.</p> <p>The phenomenon of ethnicity becomes the most essential aspect of national identity in Nigerian politics, because people are more prone to their identity than being a Nigerian (Ogundiya, (2010). Gilley (2009) observed that, majority of Nigerians in their survey prepare to be label by their ethnic background. However, Nigerians tend to cluster more readily around the cultural solidarities of kinship, traditional entity than the class solidarities of the workplace. They also opined that what is more, “religious and ethnic identities are more fully formed, more holistic and more strongly felt than class identities” as evidenced in the fact that “whereas those who identify with religious and ethnic communities are almost universally proud of their group identities…those who see themselves as members of a social class are somewhat more equivocal about their pride”. Edlyne (2002) concludes that looking at the historical antecedent of Nigeria and the effect of colonialism the challenges is not a point of surprise but to adhere into unity in diversity.</p> <p>According to Ogundiya, (2010) Nigeria has witnessed the transition from the military regime for a quite long time to a democratic system of government since the year 1999, Nigeria failed to resolve its ethno-religious and political violence which contributed to the weakening of democratic governance and national integration. As a multi-ethnic nation, with diverse religious and cultural background the political system is expected to cope with and control both human and natural resources effectively, but in contrast this diversity becomes the source of ethno-religious and political violence.  About five decades after Nigeria gained independence, the Nigerian diverse social structure in terms of her heterogeneity has not changed significantly.</p> <p>Gilley B (2009) opined that the diversity nature of the society has made identification with the ‘nation’ a difficult task. Today, identification is easier at both family and ethnic levels. A consequence of this is that many of the citizens may never develop a proper concept of nation. This kind of ethnic group relations signifies a negative dimension and which may mean much for the Nigerian political system. Therefore, a discussion of the effects of ethnic politics on the survival of democracy is or seems to be highly desirable. It even becomes necessary given the cry of political marginalisation coming from various ethnic groups in the new democracy. In all political activities in Nigeria, the factor of ethnicity is reflected. It is particularly obvious in areas like voting, distribution of political offices, employment and government general patronage of the citizens. It is against this background that this research work discusses ethic affiliation and resource challenges in Nigeria with particular reference to Igbo Etiti Local Government Area of Enugu State (Gilley, 2009).</p> <p>According to Levitsky, (2010) in a federal system of government, revenue allocation involves two schemes. The first is the vertical sharing between the federal or inclusive government and the other tiers of governments. The subject of these sharing schemes is the federally collected revenues. This is because the revenues generated within the jurisdictional areas of the units – states and local governments are not subject to the national sharing formula. </p> <p>Omitola, (2005) is of the view that in the annals of federal countries’ revenue sharing arrangements, the sources of the federally collected revenue that form the subject of the sharing formula have remained largely unchanged. These sources which are not amenable to other units include import duties, mining rents, excise units, export duties and royalties (Ovwasa, 1995:102-117). The implication of this is that, since these sources of revenue are not amenable to the jurisdiction of the other units of government, the problem of revenue allocation has focused on not who should raise the taxes, but on how to share the proceeds that is, the actual revenue collected by the federal government. The imbalance between functions and resources base, calls for higher level government to transfer revenue to the lower level. Graham in a perceptive work, described such transfer as “deficiency transfer or balancing” (Graham, 1964). It is so described because the transfer seeks to make up for the differences in the levels of functions devolved to the lower government and the resources available to it. Another principle of revenue transfer which is horizontal revenue sharing arises out of the variations in revenue generation capacities of the component units. Where the revenue raising capacities are low, heavier tax burden is imposed relative to higher revenue raising capacities area. This transfer is called “equalization transfer”. This transfer is necessary because higher taxation will scare away businesses and the economy of the unit will become more depressed. To avoid this, the higher the federal level of government has to transfer to the lower unit, the better, to enable it make up for the differences between its internally generated revenue and those required for maintaining the minimum standard of services.</p> <p>According to Ovwasa, (1995) The two types of resource transfer discussed above are known as intergovernmental grantsin-aid. The third principle has been given different names by different scholars. Beak (cited in Graham 1964) called it “simulation”, “incentive” or “conditional” grants. This grant is also known as categorical grants because such grants are designed basically to undertake certain projects. This is also known as categorical grants because they are desired for particular purposes. Nevertheless, in view of the fact that no federation has all its component parts equally developed, the transfer of funds within a federation is a potent weapon in the hands of managers of the state more so in a plural society with diverse cleavages to satisfy hegemonic interests. On the other hand it can help in ensuring that all parts of the federation have resources to carry out their functions. The government can thus ensure that the revenue from resources located in a part of the country is used for the benefit of all parts (Nyemutu-Roberts 2005:328). To this extent, revenue allocations can foster national integration. However, when misused, it engenders political altercations and contestations which destabilise the political economy and tend to undermine the efficacy of federalism in fostering political accommodation and economic development. This is why the most common source of friction in a federation is the distribution of fiscal resources (Aluko 1976:1). It is important to add that fiscal relationship in a gamut of intergovernmental relations is no longer only federal-state but also state-federal, federal-local and state-local. This is one of the most significant recent trends in inter-governmental fiscal relationships in federal systems across all regions and climes of the world (Aluko 1976). In developing countries like Nigeria, studies have shown that the state and local governments rely mainly on allocations from the federal government (Ekpo, 1994; Olowononi 1998). The allocation from the federal government usually constitutes about 70 to 90 percent of the state or local government revenues. Some major implications of this dependence are that the situation of the local governments would be worse; the agitation for constant review of revenue allocations in favour of the States and local governments will persist and continue to be a major friction in the political equation of the country. Moreover, the States will remain inefficient in tax collection and consequently remain underdeveloped in tax and general revenue administration. All these will continue to generate unnecessary tension (Tella, 1999) as the case with Nigeria. According to Dunmoye (2002), four interrelated factors can initiate or ruin a viable federation. These are:- </p> <p>•      the issue of political power sharing or representativeness especially at the centre; </p> <p>•      the problem of equitable employment to members of all sectors or all constituent units in the federation;</p> <p>•      location of industries or infrastructures and projects especially those funded by the federal government and </p> <p>•      The sharing of resources or what is known in Nigeria as revenue allocation. </p> <p>Each of these four is related to the whole gamut of the political economy of federalism. Any lapse in one or more of these factors can mar any federal system especially a fragile federation with a dependent capitalist polity like Nigeria. </p> <p>The debate on Nigeria’s fiscal federalism and relations hinges on the fundamental question of who gets what of the national cake, when and how. This is fundamental given that Nigeria as a monolithic economy gets over 80% of its revenue from crude oil, by virtue of the constitutional provision, this revenue must be disbursed to the three tiers of government. It also explains why the formula for revenue allocation has continued to be at the heart of public debate and why public office holders are hardly held accountable for the misuse of revenues derived from the national oil wealth. It is obvious that the nature and conditions of the financial relations in any federal system of government is crucial to the survival of such a system. A major source of inter-governmental disputes under a federal system centres on the problems of securing adequate financial resources on the part of the lower levels of government to discharge essential political and constitutional responsibilities (Olaloku, 1979:109). In all federations, there are always constitutional wrangling or how resources should be shared among the constituent units since there are always poor and relatively rich units for instance, in Nigeria, the poor units/regions/states often prefer a re-distributive system of federal resource while the richer or more endowed States are in favour of more financial autonomy and revenue allocation based on the relative contribution of each constituent units to the federal purse. In Nigeria revenue allocation largely implies the allocation of oil revenue, therefore, oil is central to the politics of inter-governmental fiscal relations thus, the contending forces over power and access to oil, extraction and accumulation of resources constitute the major conceptual issues that must be objectively confronted in seeking to understand the political economy of federalism in Nigeria and revenue allocation.</p> <p>One striking feature of the recommendations of various Revenue Allocation Commissions with respect to the revenue allocation formula adopted from the 1970s is a phenomenon tagged the “concentration process” in Nigeria’s fiscal federalism (Mbanefoh and Egwakihide 1998:22). This refers to situation whereby there is a gradual reduction of State Government Accounts and this is further exacerbated with the establishment of Special Account by the Federal Government (Mbanefoh, Egwakihide 1998). This is because it was used to favour a few selected states/Local Councils more often than not, it provoked inter-state hostility and rivalry, thereby undermining the stability and corporate existence of the country. Suberu (1995:4), observed that the subsequent periodic modifications of the various allocative criteria have achieved three things. First, they have effectively legitimized the criteria of demography and equality as the prominent principles of horizontal revenue sharing in Nigeria. Second, the periodic changes in the horizontal revenue sharing system have largely compounded the schemes intensely political and divisive nature. For instance, in 1990, the Babangida Administration re-introduced, and then assigned a weight of ten percent to the discredited principles of land mass. Ethno-regional opposition to this apparent bias to the North (which with only about half of the nation’s population), encompasses some three quarters of the national territory led some southern members of the National Constitutional Conference to propose the inclusion of the countervailing ‘political’ principle of ‘population density’ in the horizontal revenue sharing scheme. The primary effect of such regional political manoeuvres is to deprive the nation of the development of a coherent revenue sharing scheme that balances ‘efficiency’ and ‘equity’ principles of allocation in a politically healthy and economically productive manner. Third, and finally, Nigeria’s horizontal revenue sharing policies and reforms give insufficient recognition to such largely non-political principles of allocation as the social development factor and internal revenue generation.</p>                                                          \n\nETHNIC AFFILIATION AND RESOURCE CHALLENGES IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ETHNIC AFFILIATION AND RESOURCE CHALLENGES IN NIGERIA", "id": 156}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT<br/>This project analysed the contributions of women organisations in the community development in mbaise Local Government Area in imo state. semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 120 randomly selected women from the chosen communities. Data analysis were achieved using simple descriptive statistics as percentages, frequency tables and ranking. Result of the study shows that women organisations for the purpose of community development in the study area are formed at different levels (community and village) and along different ties (religious,family and social). There was a remarkable high involvement rate of women organisations in the provision of infrastructural amenities as renovation/furnishing of town halls/equipment of village schools and churches, and provision of communal environmental sanitation services. other development programmes include those aimed at economic and educational empowerment of women and community youths such as;provision of grants/loans for enterprise development of women award of scholarships to children of the community,awarness creation on HIV/AIDS, family health and child care programmes,and other general health matters. It was recommended among others that existing women organisations in the community development should be encouraged by way of adequate recognition,training and funding by the local government authorities.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 Background to the study<br/>It is a truism the adage that says; behind every successful man is a woman. Women have been regarded as fragile and should be subordinate to the man but they can play very important role for the betterment of the society. This fragile nature has proved her taking domineering influence on many occasions in the history of mankind. Across the country, women have created innovative, comprehensive programs to meet the needs of their communities. Women have established themselves as leaders in the community development process and acquire the skills that have brought positive changes to their communities. As effective builders of social capital, Christian women leaders play key roles in establishing and maintaining important relationships and networks in their communities.<br/>They are facing the challenges of racial, culture, economic and political barriers that exist in the community development process and in many cases overcoming those barriers become their motivation. While their comprehensive approach has influenced the evolution of the community development field, Christian women’s contributions have been neither widely acknowledged nor explicitly credited. The result of the Christian women groups in community development study provide deeper insights into women’s thinking about<br/>10<br/>community development, the barriers they perceive to women’s leadership and the kind of efforts that should be made to facilitate and promote their status and roles in the field. Christian women groups demonstrate variety of effective ways women create social capital that is central to the existence of healthy communities. In fact, the contributions of Christian women groups in community development projects can bring about significant positive changes. Thus, Christian’s women groups have been proved to be one of the effective entry point for initiating activities or development projects in the community that are beneficiary to all the members of the community (Chiwendu, 1980). Therefore, for effective development to occur, their contributions need not be disputed.<br/>1.2 Statement to the Problem<br/>The cultural beliefs that the education of a woman ends in the kitchen, makes it almost impossible for males to see the immense contributions of women groups to the community development. For example, through picture books, girls are taught to have low aspirations because there are so few opportunities portrayed as available to them. It is believed that men’s work is outside the home and women’s work is inside the home. For example we see women at home washing dishes, cooking, cleaning, yell at the children, takes care of babies, and does the shopping, while men are store keepers, house builders, storytellers, monks, preachers, fishermen, policemen, fighters,<br/>11<br/>soldiers, adventurers, judges, farmers and pilots. They were also the king and the gods.<br/>Within the traditional African society, women from almost all the ethnic group were excluded from performing certain activities, especially those that concern leadership and other hand and significant activities like construction works and clergy roles, these were considered as men’s domain. The exclusion of women from some of these activities are due to the socio-cultural factors constraining them from participating in activities that were considered to be exclusively for men (William, 1973).<br/>Furthermore gender inequality contributes to the low contribution of women to community development. Many a times, we hear the men ask, “Don’t you know you are a woman? This question is due to the systematic<br/>gender bias in customs, beliefs and attitudes that confine women mostly to the domestic sphere and not in certain matters expected to be in the men’s domain. Also, the economic and domestic workloads deprived women of time to contribute to community development.<br/>Finally laws and customs also impede women’s access to credit, productive inputs, employment, education, information and politics. These factors affect women’s ability and incentives to contribute in economic and social development activities in the community. The purpose of this research is<br/>12<br/>to find out the contributions of Christian women’s groups to community development, since it is believed that “what a man can do, a woman can do better”. The challenges facing them in their bid to contribute will also be reviewed.<br/>1.3 Research questions<br/>1. What are the challenges facing the Christian women Groups in their contributions to community developments?<br/>2. How do Christian Women Groups contribute to community development?<br/>3. What are the ways in which Christian Women Groups could be encouraged to contribute to community development?<br/>4. How do Christian Women Group generate their income for community development projects?<br/>5. What are the objectives of Christian Women Groups?<br/>1.4 Objectives of the study<br/>This research work was an intensive field-based examination of the contributions of Christian Women Groups in community development activities. All its objectives include:<br/>1. To find out the challenges facing the Christian Women Groups in their bid to contribute to community development.<br/>13<br/>2. To find out how Christian Women Groups contribute to community development.<br/>3. To identify strategies for meaningful contribution of Christian Women Groups to community development.<br/>4. To find out the extent Christian Women Groups generate their income for community development projects.<br/>5. To find out the objectives of the Christian Women Groups.<br/>1.5 Significance of the study<br/>This study will be of help to future researchers in the area study. It will also add to the already existing knowledge on the contributions of Christian Women Groups to community development. The feminist will benefit from the study will help them advocate well on women rights and sexual equality.To politicians, it will help them to provide for their citizens the fact needs they have long waited for.<br/>To policy that matches the rapid changes which exist in the community.Finally, to teachers, it will help them lay their hands on more materials to teach in respect of the topic in focus.<br/>1.6 Definition of concepts<br/>The basic concepts that will be defined in this research work includes: Christian, Community, Community development, Contribution, Development, and Group Women.<br/>14<br/>Christian: According to the Good News Bible, the word Christian was first used at Antioch to refer to those who believe in our Lord Jesus Christ (Acts chapter 11:26(). Also, the Oxford Dictionary of Current English defined Christian as one following Christ teaching, believing in or following the religion of Christ, showing the associates qualities. It refers to the adherent of Christianity.<br/>Community: Ezeh (1999), defined community as a place in which people live (village, cities, etc) or reflecting a population group bearing similar characteristics (rural dwellers, urban residents, order people; children and young adults, etc). Bensman (1994) defined community as a relatively small isolated center with a stable population, in which all economic and social services necessary to life can be maintained. Also Igbo and Anugwom (2001:20) defined community as a population which occupies a given area and shares similar system of rules and regulations to a group of people, residing in a given geographical location, who share the same culture, identity and ideology, who are interacting with each other.<br/>Community development: according to the United Nation Organization (Ux10), community development is defined as the process by which the efforts of the people themselves are united with those of the governmental authorities to improve the economic, social and cultural life of the people to integrate the community into the life of the nation and to enable them to contribute fully in<br/>15<br/>National progress. Ezeh (1999) defined it as the various strategies and inter-positions through co-ordinate actions of the communities’ members in order to usher in for the people Social and Economic development. It is an effort geared towards achieving the solution of community problem.<br/>Contribution: According to the Oxford Dictionary of current English, contribution is the act of contributing. Contribution is derived from the word contribute, which means to give (time money, etc) towards a common purpose. In this context, contribution is referred to as the time money, support, material etc directed towards community development projects by the Christian Women Groups in mbaise.<br/>Development: Ezeh (1999) sees development as when there is an upward movement from one position to another overtime especially where the movement is a positive one. It consists of the process of bringing out the capabilities of possibilities of a phenomenon to a more advanced or effective state.<br/>According to Della (2000:370) development is the gradual growth of something so that it becomes advanced or bigger. In this research work, development would refer to the gradual increase in infrastructural foundations of a community for the wellbeing of the community members.<br/>16<br/>Groups: The word groups are used to refer to number of persons or things located close together. It refers to number of people working together. In this research work, groups will refer to the number of Christian Women, working together, to contribute meaningfully to the community development projects in their communities.<br/>Women:The word “Women” is a plural word, meaning more than one woman. It refers to two adult t females, group of adult females and women groups’ organization. According to Hornby (2000:1372), a Woman is referred to as adult female human beings. Also, the Oxford Dictionary of current English sees Woman as an adult human female, the female sex, wife or girl friend. But in this context, Women would refer to all the adult females in the Christian Churches under-study. It is usually used to refer to married Christian mothers.</p>                                                          \n\nTHE  CONTRIBUTION  OF  WOMEN  ORGANISATIONS IN  COMMUNITY  DEVELOPMENT  IN  NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE  CONTRIBUTION  OF  WOMEN  ORGANISATIONS IN  COMMUNITY  DEVELOPMENT  IN  NIGERIA", "id": 157}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <ul><li>INTRODUCTION</li> </ul> <p>Human trafficking as a new trend meriminelity is often referred to as “modern day slavery”.

A sample of 1425 respondents drawn through stratified random sampling technique from six (6) purposively selected public establishments with chequered history of conflict in work-relations in the federal capital city, Abuja, participated in the study. Data were obtained through the use of questionnaire which has a modified 5-point rating scale with a reliability coefficient of 0.796. Descriptive statistics of percentage count, mean and standard deviation were used for the analysis of data collected. The two hypotheses which guided the study were tested using t-test statistical method and Spearman correlation analysis at 0.05 level of significance. The result established a significant difference in the perception of labour and management on collective bargaining as an accommodative device for conflict management in public sector establishments. The study also found a non-significant statistical determinate effect between collective bargaining and conflict management. Specifically, the finding prefigured collective bargaining to be ineffective, indicating the creeping web of governments’ intrigues as one of the main constraints inhibiting the effectiveness of the mechanism. The manifest outcome has been the incessant intense cycle of industrial actions in the Nigerian public sector organizations. The study concluded that collective bargaining is an institutional invention for reconciling conflicting goals of labour and management, but the machinery has not played any central and effectual role in the industrial relations practice of the public sector establishment in Nigeria.</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>Contemporary work organizations, whether in the public or private sector of any nation’s economy are predominantly made up of plurality of interest groups with diverse goals and aspirations. These different goals and interests are in perpetual conflict with each other (Ekwoba, Ideh and Ojikutu, 2015). As such, the possibility of elimination of conflict in work – relations seems remote but the spectre can be recognized and managed for the overriding benefits of all stakeholders in organizations. For this reason, collective bargaining has emerged overtime as an accommodative device for regulating and dealing with relational problems between labour and management in the work – situation. The mechanism has served as an effective conflict deterrent, resulting in avoidance of bitter industrial actions and ensuring the promotion of lasting industrial peace and harmony in work-establishments.</p> <p>According to Bendix (2011), collective bargaining is a rational process in which appeals to fact and logic reconcile conflicting interests in the light of common interest of both parties. Within this context, the approach is seen as an essential tool of institutionalizing and containing</p> <p>conflicts in the workplace. In dynamic establishments, where collective bargaining is done effectively and in good faith, the outcome is often an amicable resolution of joint problems resulting into collective agreement by labour and management. This implies that effective collective bargaining establishes the set rules between parties during the life – time of a collective agreement and also gives the method of settling grievances that will occur from to time to time (Appah and Emeh, 2012).</p> <p>Within the employment relationship, conflict of interest is an inherent element of labour</p> <p>– management relations. From this perspective, Obi (2013) defined workplace conflict as an act of discontentment and contention which either the workers or employers of labour utilizes to put excessive pressure against each other so as to get their demands. This view is consistent with Muhammad (2014) and Kazimoto (2013) description of workplace conflict as existence of clash of interests or objectives in worker – management relations. On this premise, most industrial conflicts have economic and goal incompatibility in the absence of common values in work establishments. However, through the use of the machinery of collective bargaining, it is possible for labour and management with conflicting goals to relate harmoniously, handle their grievances or disputes by working towards consensus and diminishing the odds of non – productive escalation of conflicts. Ironically, despite the acclaimed purpose of collective bargaining as a veritable tool of industrial peace, no day passes in Nigeria, particularly in public sector organizations without any form or threat of industrial actions. Thus, the most frequent problem in Nigeria in recent times is the incessant industrial action (Uma, Obidike, Eboh and Ogbona, (2013) and Okuwa and Campbell, 2011). According to them, if it is not the National Union of Teachers (NUT), Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), it will be Health workers or other important public sector union. Consequently, the public sector employees’ faith in the use of collective bargaining is fast ebbing away. This is because, the only justification of industrial action in this sector is the dent on the collective bargaining approach.</p> <p>Thus, by today’s standard, collective bargaining practice seems to be in a deplorable and piteous situation in the Nigerian public sector establishment. Ibietan (2013) opined that the machinery and process of collective bargaining are not given firm footing particularly in the Nigerian public sector organizations. He added that perfidy or deliberate refusal to honour collective agreements arrived at through the consensual process of collective bargaining are rife among employers or management representatives of some public organizations. Similarly, Fajana and Shadare (2012) asserted that generally, collective bargaining has experienced considerable elevating policy pronouncements, but less in terms of seriousness and effectiveness in various industrial sectors in Nigeria. In contrast however, Ekwuoba, Ideh and Ojikutu (2015), Owoseni (2014) and Bello and Kinge (2014) argued that collective bargaining is a veritable instrument of management of conflict and has played an effective role in conflict resolution in Nigeria public sector organizations. Hence, a wide divergence of opinions exists on the effectiveness of collective bargaining as a tool of conflict management in the public sector organizations in the country.</p>                                                           \n\nASSESSMENT OF THE EFFICACY OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AS A PATHWAY TO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN NIGERIA’S PUBLIC SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFICACY OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AS A PATHWAY TO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN NIGERIA’S PUBLIC SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS", "id": 159}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>This study investigates the role of social studies in correcting societal vices and improving social values among the youth. A case study of Abeokuta South Local Government Area. The population for the study involved some selected secondary schools and five school were randomly selected in the area, one hundred (100) questionnaires were developed to collect information on the role of social studies in correcting social vices and social values among the youth in Abeokuta South. The result of the analysis revealed that social studies as a subject is capable of correcting the societal vices because it is a social science subject. More so, the result show that social vices are delinquency, drug addiction and prostitution in our societies which can be curbed by morals while social values are ideals of pattern and standard of behaviour accepted by a group of people. Some recommendations were made for the further study on the topic.  </p> <p>CHAPTER ONE<br/> 1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>According to an ancient Greek philosopher Socrates an unexamined life is not with living. This assertion was made following the level of moral decadence in Greek period when Socrates flourished. In an attempt to inculcate a good moral principle on the youths. He advocate for self examination and the impact of one’s action and reasons behind it. This morality of an act is central in philosophical ethics. It deals with what bought not to be done.</p> <p>Nigeria society is heavily charged with various social vices in our various institution such as secondary schools, the student hardly take time to reflect on the consequence of their action it is against this back ground that philosophical ethics tries to examine this is because it has the basic principle needed to include to inculcate in the minds of the youth. The moral qualities that are needed by every meaningful society. It is the only discipline that can help the student reflect on the consequences and implication of their action. It can eradicate kidnapping, armed robbery, prostitution to mention but a few, if philosophic would be embarrassed by all and sundry.</p> <p>A personal or cultural value is an absolute or relative ethical value. A value system is a set of consistent values and measures. A principle value is a foundation upon which other values and measures of integrity are based. Those values which are not physiologically determined and normally considered objectives such as a desired to avoid physical pan, seek pleasure, etc are considered subjective and vary across individuals and cultures and in many ways coupled with the belief system. Values can be defined as broad preferences concerning appropriate courses of action or outcomes, as such values reflect a person’s sense of right and wrong or what” ought” to be” equal right for all” excellence deserves admiration and dignity. Values tend to influence attitudes and behaviour.</p> <p>Therefore, the role of social studies in correcting societal vices and improving social values among the youth is over emphasis by scholars who have written on what is meant by social studies for instance (Mansard 1996) observed that social studies is concerned with more than just cognitive development, it is also concerned with shaping behaviour in the direction of what society considers as desirable for its sustenance and progress. Social studies is the study of man in his environment. It is designed to find out how man influences his environment and how the environments influence him through social studies. The learner is made to identify the realities of his being the problem emanating from his interaction/contact with physical and social environment and funding intelligent ways of solving them from the series of philosophies aims and objective of the nations of education and of the subjects the following objectives of social studies at the primary school in Nigeria as stated in the 1984 national curriculum for primary social studies are to help the Nigeria child:</p> <p>a          develop the ability to adapt to the changing environment</p> <p>b          inculcate national consciousness and unity</p> <p>c          because a good citizen who is capable of and willing to contribute</p> <p>            To national development</p> <p>d          Include the right attitudes, values and skills with the above information on aims and objective a primary school social studies it is already equipped in his effort what takes to be a loyal and patriotic citizen.</p> <p>More so, these problems can run adolescent lives by leading them to be put in jail, by limiting their education and vocational training opportunities by have unwanted pregnancies and by putting their future at risk. In addition, these problems are costly to a society in economic terms. Many studies from various countries indicate that delinquency, such as smoking drug and alcohol use and sexual behaviours that can cause disease are strongly correlated with each other. All of these problems are also associated with academic failure and school dropout. Adolescents with more than one of these problems are particularly likely to experience many of the serious and costly consequences of vices, violence, drug and alcohol abuse and risky sexual behaviours.</p> <p>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</p> <p>The problem of social vices nowadays constitutes a source of worry to people in the society both in villages, towns and cities. Youth restiveness is a despicable act being perpetrates by a significant proportion of our youths in our various communities that can no longer be ignored as it implies, it is a combination of action conduct or act that constitutes unwholesome socially unacceptable and unworthy whole activities engaged in by the youth in any community. It is a phenomenon which in practice has led to a near breakdown of law and order, low productivity due to disruption of production activities apparent increasing crime rate intra- ethnic hostilities harassment of prospective developers and other sundry criminal tendencies.</p> <p>Therefore the aim of this project is to appears the roles of social studies in correcting and improving social values among the youths.</p> <p>1.3     PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of social studies in correcting societal vices and improving social values among secondary school youths. Also the investigation will examine the roles of home training or cultural training in bringing up children who cherish social values in life.</p> <p>1.4     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</p> <p>This study is significant because societal vices have become a menace in Nigerian society in which the consequence is poor up bringing or poor child training among others. Also this research enables us to realize the importance of learning social studies as an avenue to reduce the rate of social vices within our community.</p> <p>1.5     RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p> <p>This study will be carried out to provide answers to the following research question.</p> <p>1.                  What is social studies?</p> <p>2.                  What are social vices?</p> <p>3.                  What is social values</p> <p>4.                  What are relationship between social vice and social values</p> <p>5.                  How capable is social studies in correcting societal vices in our society.</p> <p>1.6     SCOPE OF STUDY</p> <p>This research is limited to select secondary schools in Abeokuta South Local Government Area of Ogun State.

The possible problems involved in running separately homes by married couples. The effects of running homes separate by married couples. The sample for the study were randomly selected to cover the fifteen (15) towns in Pankshing Local government area, plateaus state. The data collected was through questionnaire. Frequency and mean were used to analyze the data. The finding revealed that some causes of running separate homes by married couples are: the nature of job/occupation, socio-economic reasons and some couples are more inclined to their jobs than living together. While problems associated with running separate homes by married couples are financial problems, communication gap and suspicion unfaithfulness. It was observed that inability to achieve cardinal objectives of marriage. Unnecessary expenses and emotional intemperate are effects of running separate homes by married couples while woman especially are less busy, determination of married love strengthened and children reared under family that is run separately are hardworking and competent enough as its prospects. The following recommendation was drawn, couples should endeavor to keep family intact for judiciously use of money for development. Couple should bridge the gag of extra–marital relationship by avoiding extended assistance. Conclusively, running separate homes by married couples constitutes a lot of problems to married couples and thus, is not advisable or encouraging to couples.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0     INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Family is the oldest human institution in many ways, it is the most basic unit. It is society’s most basic unit. The entire civilization have survived or disappeared depending on whether family life was strong or weak. Before the institution is established, there must be a union of a man and woman, this union is call marriage.</p> <p>          Mba (1980) stated that marriage is the state in which man and woman give themselves to each other in their life together and in procreation and training of offspring’s. The clear and certain knowledge of this institution is obtained only from the ideal of creation as revealed to the people of God in the Old Testament.</p> <p>          Thus, most of us grew up in a firm belief that marriage would it did for our parents, friends and parent tomorrow. Certainly, the moves on the television programmes, the books and magazines we read all had a way of convincing us that marriage would not only solve our problems but would last a life time. Thus, in our society, adult is counted as an active member of the society if he/she is married. In view of this, it is a drama in that everyone becomes an actor or actress and not just a spectator.</p> <p>          This day, things are changing because of rising tide of the powerful new interest in human, generated by the liberation movement, the life of woman alone, wisdom, divorce and separated are beginning to come in for a lot more attention and recognition today. Today, there are lots of books, articles, drama on the legal and emotional aspect of separation, on the changing status of the working couples, on the financial complexities of widowhood on the challenge of single parenthood and of the single woman’ s level of life. The basic separation of homes is like being faced with the pieces of a complicated jig saw puzzle, and asked to fit then together in a meaningful and satisfying way.</p> <p>          Before now, marriage in African context was being dominated by men folk. The duty of the woman was to cook, keep home and farm, movement for her was restricted. Men who travel to pass does that in groups or in company of leaders. While the man is away, another elder is in the family takes care and control of all the members of the family till the man returns from the journey. That is to say that woman then lives under the care, control and protection of men hence they live behind their husband’s huts.</p> <p>The emergence of the civilization, education and modern life have lifted the status of the woman in the society, some are stronger than men in the family and in the all capacities expect the naturally endowed powers. Women today take to any job, more about to all part of the world jus as men do. They are neither being controlled nor fear that anything will hinder them. Some women today live better than the men. For many of us, the world outside marriage like looks blank and bewildering. How does families who had been living together feel when they are separated? How does woman cope with the kids? This research is not for the men who wonder how he will leave his family for sometimes to a distance place. This research work will also provide an encouragement and sound advice on attendant problems that emanate from living separately such as emotional and practical issues that faces a couple living apart, love and friendship work and money, daycare and decision making while a husband is away from home.</p> <p>Arastrong (1974) observed that family man be separated if one is doing a stint in the armed services for example, he many have the kind of job that requires long absence. About of the illness makes it necessary for one to spend sometime in the reasons for a husband absence from home, a gap is created in the life of the family.</p> <p><strong>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Married couples are said to be people strongly united to live together with a cardinal objectives of security, feeding, companionship, education and procreation. These couples according to culture are meant to live together.

Millions of young people suffer its negative consequence around the world as it diverts them from opportunities of personal growth and development thus it is a developmental challenge and a barrier to young girls as they drop-out from schools when they get married, this phenomena is very common in rural areas and poor house hold families in Africa, it impacts negatively not only on young girls but society as a whole and wellbeing of future generation Bayisenge (2012).</p> <p>Pathfinder international report (2006) indicates that early marriage continue to exist in Asia, Africa, Latin America and middle east, parents as head of families continue to make choices for girls and boys with little or no involvement and consultation with them because of economic, cultural and attitudinal related factors. Parents in most cases consider marriage of their young children as family building strategy and protection from hurtful practices outside of marriage but few numbers of them give consideration the importance of educational attainment so as young generation get skills required for them to secure and sustain wellbeing and quality of life.</p> <p>Early marriage refers to any marriage of a child younger than 18 years old. This robs the girls of their youth as they are required to take up roles for which they are not psychologically and physically prepared. Many have no choice about timing of marriage with their partner. Some are coerced into marriage, while others are too young to make an informed decision. Premature marriage deprives them of the opportunity for personal development as well as their rights to full reproductive health (RH), and well-being, education and participation in civic life (Saxena, 1999:7). Despite its disadvantages, however, early marriage is common occurrence in many parts of the world. Overall, 20-50 per cent of women in developing countries are married by age 18, with the highest percentages in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia (Singh and Samara, 1996:8). Virtually everywhere, poor women in rural areas tend to marry younger than those in urban areas, and educational levels also play a critical role (UN, 2010:5). However, in the United States of America, 2.1 per cent of all girls in the 15-17 age group were in early marriage, while, 7.6 per cent of all girls aged 15-19 were in an informal union (UN, 2010:9). Early marriage exists in some parts of Europe, for example, in the United Kingdom where 4.1 per cent of all girls in the 15-19 age group were cohabiting (living in an informal union), while 8.9 per cent of all girls in that age group admitted to have been in a cohabitation relation before the age of 18. Over 4 per cent of all underage girls in the UK were teenage mothers (Sharon and Lewis, 2005:3).</p> <p>In rural areas and northern Nigeria, early marriage is high among girls compared to males. Forty-three per cent of girls are married before they they are 18 years compared to boys at 11.6 per cent. This proportion is higher than the national prevalence rate which stands at 34 per cent for females and 1.4 per cent for males (Plan International, 2011:1). Different reasons have been given for going into early marriage. Poor families may regard a young girl as an economic burden and her marriage as a necessary survival strategy for her family. Her marriage relieves the family financially and socially (ICRW, 2007:98). In some cases, parents willingly marry off their young girls to receive payment of bride wealth in order to increase the family income. Bride wealth is a cultural phenomenon practiced in Africa and other parts of the world and it encourages parents to marry their daughters early (UNICEF, 2001: 97). Culturally, the boy child’s education is more valued and usually more preference is accorded the boy-child than the girl-child. Educating the girl child is seen as a wasted investment since she will be married elsewhere.</p> <p><strong>1.2     Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>The practice of early marriage mainly arises due to poverty, civil strife and low level of development. Some families believe that it limits and discourages promiscuity. Early marriage discriminates against the girl child’s right, limits her freedom to make decisions, isolates her from her peers, increases her risk of intimate sexual violence and sexually transmitted infections including HIV infection, predisposes her to complications of child birth such as obstructed labor and obstetric fistulae. Maternal mortality in pregnancy is four times higher among girls below the age of 16 years and their new born death rate is 50% higher compared to women who become pregnant after the age of 20 years. Early marriage also causes the girl child to discontinue or interrupt her education. Her children are also less likely to grow up healthy and go to school, thus continuing and worsening the cycle of poverty for generations to come.</p> <p><strong>1.3     Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is to find out the implication of early marriage on sustainable future of teenage girls in Nigeria. Specifically the study intends to:</p> <p>1.     Find out the causes of early marriage in Nigeria</p> <p>2.     Analyze the implication of early marriage on sustainable future of teenage girls in Nigeria</p> <p>3.      Proffer solution to the problem of early marriage among teenage girls in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>1.4     Research Question</strong></p> <p>1.     What is the causes of early marriage in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.     Is there any implication of early marriage on sustainable future of teenage girls in Nigeria?</p> <p>3.     What is the solution to the problem of early marriage among teenage girls in Nigeria?</p> <p><strong>1.5     Research Hypothesis</strong></p> <p><strong>Ho:</strong> there is no implication of early marriage on sustainable future of teenage girls in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>Hi:</strong> there is implication of early marriage on sustainable future of teenage girls in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>1.6     Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>Early marriage of the girl-child has been shown to be common in some Nigerian communities. It is associated with school dropout and poor quality of life for these young mothers and their families. There is limited information on early marriage and its effect on the girl-child most especially in northern Nigeria. This study will therefore expose the public to the burden of early marriage and its effects on the girl-child in Nigeria. This information should allow for intervention measures to be formulated and also formulation of a policy to address the problem. The study will also expose other gaps that exist within the field and prompt more investigations by other scholars. Finally, the study contributes to the literature on early marriage in Nigeria</p> <p><strong>1.7     Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>This research on early marriage among teenagers, implication for sustainable future will be carried out in Otta, Ogun state i.e. Ado-Odo LGA in Ogun State, Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.8     Delimitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>Finance for the general research work will be a challenge during the course of study. Correspondents also might not be able to complete or willing to submit the questionnaires given to them.</p> <p>However, it is believed that these constraints will be worked on by making the best use of the available materials and spending more than the necessary time in the research work. Therefore, it is strongly believed that despite these constraint, its effect on this research report will be minimal, thus, making the objective and significance of the study achievable.</p> <p><strong>1.9     Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Early Marriage: </strong>Child marriage is a formal marriage or informal union entered into by an individual before reaching a certain age, specified by several global organizations such as UNICEF as minors under the age of 18.</p> <p><strong>Teenagers: </strong>A <em><strong>teenager</strong></em>, or teen, is a person who falls within the ages of thirteen-nineteen years old</p> <p><strong>Sustainable: </strong>Sustainability is the process of maintaining change in a balanced fashion, in which the exploitation of resources, the direction of investments, the orientation of technological development </p> <p><strong>Future: </strong>a prospect of success or happiness.</p>                                                         \n\nEARLY MARRIAGE AMONG TEENAGERS; IMPLICATION FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EARLY MARRIAGE AMONG TEENAGERS; IMPLICATION FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE", "id": 162}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>The purpose of this project work was to identify how family planning is an agent of population reduction of the increasing population of Nigeria in Ovia North East Local Government Area using some selected community as a case study.

In the traditional era, alcohol played complex roles in the socio-cultural relationships of different communities. It was used for rituals, marriage ceremonies, chieftaincy enthronements, etc. It was mainly consumed by male adults for pleasure while females and youths were culturally restrained from drinking. Excess consumption was not a norm and intoxication attracted negative sanctions. In the contemporary Nigerian society, patterns of consumption are changing rapidly following the socio-political and economic development of Nigeria, giving rise to new norms of alcohol use. This review examines the impact of alcohol consumption on health behavior of youths and the changing patterns of alcohol consumption. It concludes by exploring the consequences of these effects of alcohol consumption on the health behavior of youths and suggests some remedies for contemporary Nigerian society. </p>\n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL ABUSE ON HEALTH BEHAVIOR OF YOUTH AND OLDER ADULT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL ABUSE ON HEALTH BEHAVIOR OF YOUTH AND OLDER ADULT", "id": 164}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA TRENDS ON THE BEHAVIORAL PATTERN OF YOUTHS</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Social media is the integration of digital media, which includes combinations of electronic text, graphics, moving pictures and sounds in a structured computerized environment that allows users to interact with the data for appropriate purposes. The digital environment can include the Internet, telecommunications and interactive digital television. The Web is now part of the overall business of communication, sales and services. It changes business practices. Its technical limitations affect the amount of material and the speed of access to the material. The network depends mainly on the connections of the telephone line, so that the more they are good on a territory, the more the service will be reliable. The limitations inherent in transferring large amounts of digital information over telephone lines have affected the type and quality of media that can be used effectively, as well as the nature of the interaction enabled by the Web. There are ways to increase performance by improving technical limitations that depend on an available infrastructure that can provide more data faster and more reliably, called broadband.</p> <p>It is clear that there is a link between social networks and their impact on behavioral change among young people. As a result, messages can reach audiences and target groups in real time and can generate changes and trends. Nowadays, younger generations grow up having good contact with different types of social networks. easily acquire digital culture and live in a digital world where only adults are naturalized citizens. \"</p> <p>Tapscott (1998) talks about growing up in a digital environment by calling young people \"network generation\". Children meet in a hybrid virtual space, learn in an innovative way, create new language and apply multicultural values ​​(Tappscott, 1998). The main characteristics of the N-Gen culture are: independence, emotional and intellectual openness, inclusion, freedom of expression and strong points of view, innovation, maturity, pleasure of research, immediacy and sensitivity to the interests of the people. companies, authentication. and trust.

Psychological social adolescence. to build, experiment and present a project of self-reflection in a social context, as well as, for some, to circumvent the norms of communication and other risky behaviors. 4 Social networks generated by technology are a valuable tool, but today's young people are misusing them. The two main forms used by young people to access social networks are the cell phone and the Internet, which have significantly changed their way of life. Given the current visibility and ease of access that young people can get from these media, this study will determine the impact it has had on young people. Some of the issues that should result from this research include exposure to problematic materials, online victimization of youth, exposure to unnecessary marketing and online advertising, exposure to unsafe online behavior, identity theft problems, the emergence of the digital divide and the generation gap between parents. and young people. According to Ritchel, Matt wrote in the New York Times an article entitled \"Wire more and more digital, distracting cabling.\" On November 21, 2010, wasting time, building superficial and damaging relationships and possibly the cause, instead of alleviating, depression, loneliness, social isolation and withdrawal of users, among others. .</p> <p><strong>1.3 Purpose of the study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of social media trends on the behavioral pattern of youths, using the Lagos State as a case study.

Knowing fully that Repository is an essential tool for facilitating academic activities in tertiary institutions in Nigeria, for a number of years now, the managers of these tertiary institutions of learning have invested heavily in establishing Repository services in their schools. The services provided by Repository have had a major impact in the university context, in organisation and in teaching and learning methods. The Repository has made computers across the globe interconnected.</p> <p>According to Emeka and Nyeche (2016) the Repository today is a worldwide entity whose nature cannot be easily or simply defined. To many, the Repository is a large academic resources data base linking together millions of smaller users at numerous sites in various countries belonging to thousands of business, government, research, educational and other organizations. To the Repository users, the Repository is a global community-one with a very active life. In today world, the Repository plays a vital role in the teaching, research and learning process in academic institutions. Thus, the advent of the Repository has heralded the emergence of a new form of knowledge production and distribution – the soft form.</p> <p>This new form of information resources have as their greatest advantage, a virtually unlimited wealth of information resources which is widely readily available and accessible to hundreds of millions of people simultaneously in many parts of the world (Kumar &amp; Kaur 2006). In addition, Amaoge and Igwebuike (2016) believe that the Repository has increasingly become an invariable asset in education in terms of learning, teaching and research. The use of Repository in the tertiary institutions is an exciting prospect especially when the rugged terrain is the significant impediment to obtain information for the vast majority of people.</p> <p>Fasae and Aladeniyi (2012) pinpoint that for the developing countries like Nigeria to grow and attain its economic and social status; such country must be fully ready in strengthening and empowering its academic institutions, both in science and technological capacity. Hence, the students in their respective fields will need an array of reliable and interactive means of accessing and retrieving information without wasting much time. Similarly, the use of this Repository is greatly dependent on some associated factors such as purposes, students experience, locations, Repository facilities and services available, among others on academic pursue of the students in their institutions.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Students of tertiary institutions in Nigeria employ the Repository in educational matters such as writing papers, searches for answers to questions and communicating with classmates on homework. However, time spent in activities where “surfing the net” occurs could substitute away from time allocated to reading, studying and completing homework. This may hurt academic performance in the short term. So, the study assessed the effectiveness of the use of Repository services and its effects on students’ academic performances.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Objective of the Study</strong></p> <p>The main objective of this study is to find out the use of Repository and its effects on student’s performances.</p> <p>Specifically, the aims of the study are to:</p> <ol><li> <p>Examine the effect of Repository use on the academic performance of the students.</p> </li> <li> <p>Investigate the problems that militate against the student’s access to the Repository.</p> </li> </ol> <p>iii. Investigate the frequency of Repository use among students.</p> <p><strong>1.4 Research Questions</strong></p> <p>The following research questions were formulated to guide this study:</p> <p>i. What is the frequency of Repository use among the students?</p> <p>ii. How useful is the Repository to students in their daily academic activities?</p> <ol><li> <p>Which is the most used Repository service?</p> </li> </ol> <p>iv. Do the Repository services influence students’ academic performance?</p> <ol><li> <p>What are the problems faced by students in using Repository services?</p> </li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5 Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The study could be beneficial for students as well as for the institution. The valuable feedback gotten from respondents should help students to realize the benefits of repository in their education. Institutes can invest more in building repository to enhance the academic performance of their student and produce better results. Note that the relevance of internet facilities is measured by how effective, sufficient and accessible it is to students and users. The research will also provide in-depth insight into the various repository facilities and how students can be able to use them to improve academic performance.</p> <p><strong>1.6 Scope/Limitation of the study</strong></p> <p>The self-report criterion is a limitation. Future research should employ more objective measures of repository. This study covers all regular undergraduate students in University of Abuja, Nigeria. These are 100 - 400 levels student including 500 levels law. The study therefore excludes centre for distance learning and continuing education (CDL and CE) students and sandwich students. Also, the study is not restricted to any gender. It includes both male and female undergraduates at all level of study.</p> <p><strong>1.7 Definition of Terms</strong></p> <p><strong>Repository</strong>: a place or container in which large quantities of something are stored</p> <p><strong>Performance</strong>: this relates to the results and appraisal gotten from studying samples.</p> <p><strong>Undergraduates</strong>: these are students in institutions of higher education.</p> <p><strong>Information and Communication Technology (ICT):</strong> refers to computer based tools used by people to work with the information and communication processing needs of an organization, government agencies or individuals.

In analyzing the structured questionnaire, the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 22) was used. Simple frequency, percentage, charts and graph on some of the variables was generated in this study while content analysis method was also used in analyzing the in-depth interviews conducted.<br/>The researcher was able to deduce from the study that there was evidence of domestic maltreatment of elderly person in  Ugha community. However, most of the abuse and care were caused mostly by the financial and social status of both the elderly person and their supporting relatives. <br/>It was discovered that what the elderly person really need are not material needs most times but emotional needs and they need their love ones around them always. It was discovered that modernization and globalization has really play a key role in the issue of elderly abuse and care, i.e. the cluster of the extended family unit as it were is no longer in existence. Poverty, low income, unemployment of relatives who supposed to be caregivers to the elderly has also contributed to neglect and abuse of the elderly.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1 Background of the study    -    -    <br/>1.2 Statement of the  problem    -    -    -<br/>1.3 Objective of the study    -    -    -<br/>1.4  Research questions    -    -<br/>1.5 Significance of the study    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>2.1 Introduction    -    -    -    <br/>2.2 Review of relevant theory    -    -    -<br/>2.3 Theoretical framework    -    -    <br/>2.4 Hypotheses    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.1 Research Design    -    -    <br/>3.2 The population of the study    -<br/>3.3 Sample size and sampling design    -    -<br/>3.4 Instrument of data collection     -    <br/>3.5 Method of data collection    -    -    <br/>3.6 Method of data analysis     -<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>4.1 Presentation and data analysis    -<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>5.1 Summary of research findings    <br/>5.2 Conclusion     -    -    -    -    -<br/>5.3 Recommendation    -    -    -    -<br/>References    -    -    -    -<br/>Questionnaire    -<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    Background of the Study<br/>Individuals begin their ageing process at the moment of birth, and go through the life course accumulating a range of experiences that may positively or negatively affect their capabilities and wellbeing in later years (Aquilino, 1990). It was revealed in (Wahab, 2013) that ageing is expensive and government in many developing nations is afraid of the costs of maintaining the increasing population of the elderly. Older people are a valuable asset to society, contributing in many ways (economically, socially, intellectually and otherwise,) to the progress of the society (. Unfortunately, in many societies older people have been left out at perpetual risk and uncared for. The aged is, therefore, deprived of smartness, promptness, dynamism, and confidence, which were basic personality features of youth and adulthood. Furthermore, the optimistic outlook of the aged gradually turns into pessimism. <br/>Elderly people in Nigeria suffer a lot of economic and social hardship in an increasingly hostile, competitive and intolerant society. Older people constitute one of the poorest groups in Nigerian society and aging in Nigeria constitutes a painful process attended by poor health, poverty and helplessness (Asagba, 2005). Older people rightly deserve the much needed care and support backed up by programme and policies that will enable them have control over their own live delays (Eldward&amp; Miller 2003:Banks, 2004). Fortunately aging is gradually becoming a global phenomenon and undeniably receiving urgently policy definition by government of developed nations where it has reflected in the government’s vital document of economic and social development strategy (Okoye, 2014).<br/>    Compared with the situation of elderly persons in developed countries, the living profile of the aged population in developing countries is not well understood, due to the paucity of necessary . Although an increasing number of surveys of the elderly have recentlybeen conducted in various developing countries, information gathered is fragmentary and also insufficient to fully understand the status gathered from these surveys. The findings do not report the challenges confronting the elderly and the nature of problems facing them (Wahab, 2013). As the level of economic development advances, the pattern of allocation of support changes from informal to  formal support (Cowgil&amp; Holmes, 1972; Wahab, 2013). Social change in a society affects the lifestyle of the elderly in one way or the other and the traditional respect given to the elderly person in the contemporary society is on the decline (Russell, 2003; Ushasnee, 2004).<br/>The elderly population in most societies is increasing, due to a number of interrelated factors. There has been an exceptional increase in world population in the 20th and 21st centuries in contrast to previous centuries (U.S. Department of Commerce 2007; Sachs 2014). There has also been a decline in infant and childhood mortality; discoveries in the field of medicine prolonging lifespan; increase in the average life-expectancy; declining fertility and increasing longevity have favoured elderly population in the society (Oluwabamide&amp;Eghafona, 2012).<br/>In many countries in the western world, there have been established formal institutions such as older people’s home put in place to care for the elderly. However in the conventional African setting, informal caregiver was the norm. Formal institutions were very few or non-existent, such as those set up by the Catholic social centres, brought in by foreigners. Informal caregiving emerged as a key figure in the promotion of quality of life in a situation of dependence. Informal care was always available in the traditional nuclear and extended family system with the philosophy of communalism, hence, care was provided for babies, young children and elderly in the family and society (Oluwabamide&amp;Eghafona, 2011)<br/>However, with globalization and industrialization changes have emerged. According toOluwabamide(Oluwabamide&amp;Eghafona, 2011) the traditional institution responsible for care-giving is being dismantled. This institution, which is the extended family, is being disintegrated. Consequently, the ageing population is now facing a number of problems. It was further emphasized in Emovon et al, 2007, that the proves of industrialization, colonialism, urbanization and westernization with its attendant effects of change in living arrangements, urban migration, reduction in family size due to economic reasons have combined to make old aged unpleasant, contrary to the past. <br/>    Decades ago, the elderly in the African societies were said to faced little or no challenges because within the African cultures, adequate care and respect for the elderly was part of  the culture (Oluwabamide&amp;Eghafona, 2011). It has further emphasized that the care of older people within their families in Africa was guaranteed until  the intervention of colonial rule, modernization, urbanization and industrialization. The extended family system practiced by most African societies enhanced collective care for the aged. But since 1990s to 2000 upwards the elderly persons are at higher risk, unfortunately, Nigeria government does not provide social security for the elderly and the support from the family are fading out. Therefore,the well-being of the elderly is been compromised (Adebowale, Atter&amp;Ayeni, 2012)<br/>1.2    Statement of the Problem <br/>In many western countries, formal social security is an important policy instrument for governments to redistribute wealth, combat poverty, and reduce inequalities between various segments of society. But in Sub-Saharah Africa including Nigeria, current social security schemes are extremely marginal both in terms of percentage of the labor force that is covered and the size of pension that are received. In most Sub-saharan African settings, national social insurance schemes cover less than 5% of the labor force and expend less than 1.5% of their gross domestic product on pensions (Fox &amp; Palmer, 2014). Consequently, in the majority of countries in Sub-Saharan African including Nigeria, social protection programs for older people in Sub-Saharan African are occupational pension schemes, but these typically cover  only people who have worked in the public sector, in state enterprises, or in large private firms in the modern sector. The self-employed, workers in the informal sector, domestic workers, and the vast majority of the population living in rural areas and engaged in subsistence agriculture or other forms of subsistence living, majority of this group are excluded from formal social security schemes and must rely on their families for support and  protection when they can no longer work (National Academic  Press, 2006).<br/>     Nigeria’ economy is the most viable in Africa. Unfortunately, Nigeria is currently one of the countries in Sub –Saharan Africa with a large percentage of the aged without any firm of social protection. However, the high rate of unemployment and the poor state of infrastructural facilities obstruct the activities of the elderly which within the existing condition expose them to more danger and untimely death. The elderly have contributed to the economy and the society at large and this is an important  stage of their life that should never be ignore, yet there is no formal social security programme to cater for this large population of the aged. Caring for the elderly introduces many problems that are very similar in most developing countries including Nigeria. The conditions under which informal and formal supports are delivered to the elderly may have a major influence on the social and economic security of the pattern of care for the elderly.<br/>This social exclusion has led to increase in challenges confronting this group as they are left to go through Phases of life that hinder smooth aging and the elderly are face with unwholesome challenges which include poverty, isolation, poor nutrition, poor quality health care, poor housing, hunger, inadequate domestic supports and other social services that will enhance smooth aging. These challenges call for adjustment. Adjusting to these and other changes is the central challenge in the social world of the elderly, as they may discover they can no longer cope on their own and have to rely on other people for care and support. Having to rely on caregivers for care and support introduces a new dimension to the social problems of the elderly (Akpan&amp;Umobong, 2013).<br/>Moreso, social and economic security of the elderly is an issue that has not generated the desired research interest for policy makers and administrators in Nigeria as elsewhere in Africa (Wahab, 2013) Compare to the industrialized countries where there are many studies on practically every aspect of social and economic security of the elderly, including; studies on the demographic, economic and social implications of old age (Tout, 1989). Indeed, the developming countries, such as Nigeria, not many systematic empirical studies have been done to examine the situation confronting the elderly concretely. Consequently, there is a dearth of published materials on the social and economic security of the elderly in Nigeria (Wahab, 2013). The present imperative is that societies must respond to the extraordinary potential and range of variability in individual ageing, and seize the opportunity to rethink our notion of limits and recognize the far-reaching benefit societies stand to gain from the continuing contribution to the wellbeing of the elderly (John, 2000).<br/>     The standard of living for the elderly was based on reciprocity, but since the 1990s to 2000 upwards, the elderly persons are at higher risk. Previous studies have indicated that the Nigeria government does not provide social security to the elderly and the supports from the family are fading out, therefore the wellbeing of the elderly is been compromise (Adewale, 2012).<br/>    The effect of increasing diseases and dependence of the older persons is burdensome on the caregiver for both formal and informal caregivers. The needs and opinions of older persons should be integrated into shaping of health policy. Ensuring enabling and supportive environments, urges recommendations for improved housing and living environments of older persons, promoting a positive view of ageing and enhancing public awareness of the important contributions of older persons.<br/>    The inability of government to promote gender equality, protect and promote human rights has created discrimination such as aged discrimination, recognizing the value of older females in the home and societies at large. Culturally, some individuals see the older persons especially the female folks as witches responsible for some of their misfortune in life and in turn, they subject them to abject poverty through total deprivation of basic amenities leaving them to die under harsh condition, hence some of them are forced to go out to look for food inside the dustbins or market places because of hunger and lack of care. This may allow onlookers and passerby to see these elderly as people with mental impairment. Thereby reducing the amount of care rendered or given to them. (Oluwabamide&amp;Eghafona, 2012).<br/>1.3    Objective of the Study<br/>     The broad objective of this study is to understand the challenges confronting the elderly in Ugha Community in Uhuwonde Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>To investigate the challenges facing the aged who are currently underpension scheme.<br/>To ascertain the form of social security available for the elderly population in Ugha community.<br/>To ascertain the challenges facing the aged who are currently under pension scheme.<br/>To suggest solutions to the challenges facing the aged in the community,and the country at large.<br/>1.4    Research Questions<br/>What are the challenges facing the elderly in Ugha community?<br/>What are the forms of social security supporting the elderly in the community?<br/>What are  the specific challenge of the aged pensioners in the community?<br/>How can the aged in the community be supported to live meaningfully in the community?<br/>1.5    Significance of the Study<br/>     The practical implication of this study and the findings can be used to inform policy makers and administrators to know the challenges confronting the elderly population in Nigeria and the need to respond through effective policy formulating and implementation. It would also contribute to the call for policy intervention that will protect the elderly without any institutionalized social support and ameliorate the sufferings of the aged pensioners.<br/>    This study will be of great significant to the extant body of knowledge to academic, practicing social workers in both public and private sector and it will build on the existing knowledge and fill the existing vacuum in data on the elderly in Ugha community in Edo State<br/><br/>\n\nABUSE AND CARE OF THE ELDERLY IN UGHA COMMUNITY, EDO STATE, NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ABUSE AND CARE OF THE ELDERLY IN UGHA COMMUNITY, EDO STATE, NIGERIA", "id": 167}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ATTITUDES OF NIGERIAN TOWARDS THE USE OF NIGERIAN PIDGIN: FINDINGS FROM BENIN METROPOLIS<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    Background to the Study<br/>1.2    Methodology<br/>1.3    Purpose of Study     <br/>1.4    Significance of Study and Justification of Study <br/>Chapter two<br/>Review of relevant literature<br/>2.0    Introduction<br/>2.1     Conceptual Review of Literature  <br/>2.1.1     Attitude<br/>2.1.2    Language Contact<br/>2.1.3    Language Educational Policy<br/>2.1.4.

This attitude may be positive or negative. Crystal (1997:215) define attitude “as the feelings people have about their own language or the languages of others.” Attitude towards a language is not directly attitude towards the language but a reflection of attitude from the speaker of the language on the language. Attitudinal studies aid in identifying how people of one language group new the personal character and social status of speakers of another language and how they form association about other language. <br/>    Language is generally accepted as a means by which people in a community interact and express feelings, thoughts and intentions. Societies rely on language and languages rely on the society. Hence, there must be a relationship that exists between language and society. <br/>    The power of language mainly lies on political reason, whether or not it is an official language of the state as most of the official languages are used in formal settings, such as in education or official document. These usages empower the official languages and while at the same time degraded the unofficial ones. <br/>    In the context of our living place, Benin City, speaking of ‘Nigerian Pidgin English’ one might immediately think of the local official language of Edo. However, Edo language is not the only local language of Benin; actually Benin has quite a number of languages. <br/>    Nigerian Pidgin English is a contact language and like contact languages comes into being under conditions of interaction among people of different linguistics backgrounds. Pidgins usually evolve from the fusion of foreign languages and indigenous languages. Crystal 1997 explained that most of the present day pidgins grew up along the trade routes of the world especially in those parts where British, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Dutch built up their empire. Linguists like Akmajian and others like Elugbe, Omakor (1991) observed that pidgin usually thrive in multi-lingua part of the world. Such communities are made up of different ethnic groups with different language that are not understood by other groups. Hence, in Benin City, pidgin language is found to be useful the people in contact find they cannot do without it. The pidgin becomes a common language. <br/>The origin of Nigeria Pidgin English (henceforth NPE) is traceable to the contact between the coastal peoples ofNigeria and the Europeans.Egbokhare (2006:6) observes that the first contact was made by the Portuguese around 1469. The Dutchfollowed about 1593, but soon faded away to be replaced by the English from 1650 onwards.Elugbe and Omamor (1991:3) claim that some form of Portuguese pidgin must have been spoken along thecoast. This must have been short-lived with the ousting of the Portuguese by the French, the Dutch and theEnglish. Among these groups, the British impact was more enduring and resulted in the development of anEnglish-based pidgin along the Nigerian coast.<br/>The same reasons that led to the evolution of NPE have popularized it in Nigeria. Urbanization, trade and othercontact situations within the country have led to the spread of NPE. The language has become a lingua franca notonly in a multiethnic Niger Delta, but in the whole of Nigeria. The multiethnicity of barracks and urban centreshas also helped in transporting the language inland. The result is that we now have varieties of pidgin basedroughly on the ethnic groups and geographical locations. Elugbe and Omamor (1991) observe that it hascreolized in the Warri and Sapele areas of the Niger Delta.<br/>Mafeni (1971:97) says that NP comprises a base language-English, which has been and continues to be modifiedby indigenous languages.<br/>The present profile of NP is that of a lingua franca, building linguistic and communicative bridges among the400 or so ethnic groups in Nigeria.<br/>NPE can be regarded as ‘a child of necessity’ and a language of convenience. This is because of its use as acontact language and its communicative value among our many ethnic groups. Starting from the coastal regions,it has metamorphosed into a lingua franca, penetrating inland to the nooks and crannies of Nigeria.<br/>1.2    METHODOLOGY<br/>This study employed the primary source of data collection. A questionnaire was designed to elicit responses from members of the public. There was also the direct interview of some respondents in Benin metropolis with the aid of a digital tape recorder. <br/>    Since the population of the people of Benin is much, the simple random sampling technique will be adopted in selecting one hundred (100) respondents both male and female. The responses of the participants shall be manually coded and analyzed in frequency table. <br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF STUDY <br/>    The purposes of the study are:                           <br/>To know the attitude of Nigerians especially those residing in Benin towards Nigerian Pidgin English. <br/>To know if Nigerian Pidgin English can be used as a formal medium of communication in Edo state and consequently other states in Nigeria. <br/>To examine the contribution of Nigerian Pidgin English towards teaching and learning in schools (primary and secondary). <br/>To know if Nigerian Pidgin English is a threat to the vitality of the indigenous Edo language. <br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY AND JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY <br/>    This study is very important because the results can go a long way to establishing the official state of Nigerian Pidgin English as a formal language in Edo state. This work will be of great relevance and a reference point to students of linguistics and it will highlight some issues in language planning and language vitality. It will be a guide for the federal government in planning for effective educational system in the school curriculum.<br/><br/>\n\nATTITUDES OF NIGERIAN TOWARDS THE USE OF NIGERIAN PIDGIN: FINDINGS FROM BENIN METROPOLIS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ATTITUDES OF NIGERIAN TOWARDS THE USE OF NIGERIAN PIDGIN: FINDINGS FROM BENIN METROPOLIS", "id": 168}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE INFLUENCE OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IN COMBATING POVERTY<br/>A CASE STUDY OF EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       Background of the study    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>1.2     Statement Of Problem    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>1.3       Objectives Of Study    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>1.4     Hypotheses    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>1.5         Significance Of Study    -    -    -    -    <br/>1.6`        Scope Of Study-    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>1.7          Definition Of Terms    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>CHAPTRER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>2.0          Review Of Related Literature    -    -    -    <br/>2.1          Review Of Relevant Concepts    -    -    -    -    <br/>2.1.1        Poverty    -    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>2.1.2       Types of Poverty in Nigeria    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>2.1.3         Concept of Community Development    -    -    -    <br/>2.1.4.        Causes Of Poverty    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>2.1.6          Factors Influencing Community Development    -    -    -<br/>2.1.7          Effects of Poverty on Community Development    -    -    -<br/>2.1.8          The Influence of Community Development in Combating Poverty <br/>in Egor Local Government Area    -    -    -    -<br/>2.2         Review of Relevant Theories    -    -    -    -<br/>2.2.1          Individual theory perspective    -    -    -    -    <br/>2.2.2          Cultural perspectives theory    -    -    -    -<br/>2.2.3           Structural perspective theory    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>3.0           Introduction    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>3.1           Research Design    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>3.2           Population Of The Study    -    -    -    -    <br/>3.3           Sample Size And Sampling Technique    -    -<br/>3.4             Research Instrument    -    -    -    -    <br/>3.5             Validility And Reliability    -    -    -    -    <br/>3.6             Method Of Data Collection    -    -    -    -    <br/>3.7            Data Analysis Techniques    -    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER FOUR: DATA ANALYSIS, INTERPRETATION AND DISCUSSION ON FINDINGS<br/>  Introduction    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>4.1    Analysis Of Respondent Character    -    -    -    -    <br/>4.2    Analysis And Discussion Of Hypothesis    -    -    -    <br/>4.3     Research Hypothesis 1    -    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/>5.1     Summary    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>5.2     Conclusion    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>5.3     Recommendation    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>REFERENCES    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>APPENDIX I    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>        LIST OF TABLES<br/>Table 4.1.1         Gender Of Respondents    -    -    -    -    <br/>Table 4.1.2    Age Of Respondents    -    -    -    -    -<br/>Table 4.1.3     Level Of Education Of The Respondent    -    <br/>Table 4.1.4     Marital Status Of Respondents    -    -    -<br/>Table 4.1.5     Religion Of Respondents    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 Background to the Study<br/>Ever since Nigeria gained independence in 1960 from the British colonial government.  Rural or community development has been declared a priority by the successive governments, be it civilian or military. In this regard, several organizations, institutions and agencies have been set up to undertake and monitor the complicated process of nation-building, development and integration (Rahman, 2008). It is observed that over fifty- five years after Nigeria’s independence, most rural areas in Nigeria demonstrate characteristics that indicate lack of prosperity. This situation has not changed much even today. Unless rural people are given the opportunity and means to fully participate in development projects, they will continue to be excluded from its benefits (Nnadozie, &amp; Ibe, 2012)<br/>    It is recorded that inspite of various efforts at developing rural areas, poverty, ignorance and disease are still very prevalent in Nigeria rural areas. Chigbo (2001) opined that most of the rural development projects failed because of faulty goal specification, fraud, and inadequate funding. In the same vein, most of these projects were either borrowed or merely forced on the people, without due consideration of the  political and cultural norms, which of course resulted in failure (Adagba, 2002).  To overcome this ugly situation, a new approach has evolved. This is called “popular participation” whereby local people take initiatives or influence their own development. It implies the active involvement of the rural people, particularly the dis-advantaged groups that form the mass of the rural population. The philosophy guiding this approach is that the resources of the community are mobilized by the community for the good of the community. It should be anchored on the cooperative efforts of the people with or without any external stimuli (Ikeji 2012).<br/>Community development itself is a process aimed at improving the social, economic and environmental situation of the community (Flora &amp; Flora, 2003).  the community becomes more vital, not just economically but as a strong functioning community in itself by constantly improving the ability of communities to collectively make better decisions about the use of resources such as infrastructure, labour and knowledge (Christenson, 2009). For community development to occur, people in a community must believe working together can make a difference and organise to address their shared needs collectively (Flora Alison, 2003).<br/>Regardless of the definition, community development is not just “growth” Growth means more jobs and more investment but implies “more of the same”. It does not necessarily increase choices, networks or ability to manage change one of the symptoms and manifestations of underdevelopment is poverty according to Central Bank of Nigeria (2004) and Word Bank (1991) Nigeria’s poverty rate over the years has continued to grow unabated. The United Nations Reports (2001), Nigeria’s Human Poverty Index (HPI) was 41.6% which places the country among the 25 poorest nations in the world.<br/>Schiller (2008), indicate that poverty has indeed become a pandemic national disease with symptomatic effects of high unemployment rates, poor health care, poor accessibility to water, food, housing, low human development, low per capita income, and poor infrastructural development. This has no doubt made poverty alleviation programme a recurring decimal in Nigeria’s public policy either in the military or the civilian rule as no administration has come to power without initiating a poverty alleviation package (Soludo, 2004). <br/>The failure of previous anti-poverty programmes is partly because of lack of involvement or participation of the people and politicization of the programmes. As carefully demonstrated by some scholars like (Nwatu, 2006; Onah, 2005 &amp; Ukwedeh, 2003).<br/>The National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS, 2004), however declared objectives and policy statements of various governments in Nigeria have been mere rhetoric and smoke-screens intended not only to diffuse criticisms but to hide what the whole thing has been i.e. a systematic exploitation and dehumanization of the rural dwellers. In spite of this criticism, there is no doubt that the Nigerian government and its leaders has not only recognized the fact of the important roles which the rural sector plays in the generation of national wealth but also that over 70% of Nigerians live in rural areas. It is to be noted that Nigeria is not alone in the recognition of these facts. Leaders of the developing countries in Africa have also come to accept the development of rural areas as a sine qua non for national development (Afolabi, 2008),<br/>From the above background we can deduce that, these are the major causes of poverty in community development, which are unemployment, corruption, bad governance, low productivity among others.<br/>1.2 Statement Of Problem<br/>It has been observed that inspite of abundant natural, physical and human resources that Nigeria is endowed with; there is still high incidence rate of poverty in Nigeria especially in the rural areas. In Edo State, majority of the people live in the rural areas and they depend mainly on agriculture. They operate fragmented and marginal holdings while some others concentrate on craft making (Abdullahi, 2006:2) strong argued that despite the obvious role of farming and crafting in the economy of the state, rural people tend to remain poor. On that note, Aboyade (1999) states that, generally they share several characteristics such as low levels of educational attainment, a relatively large number of children, relatively low access to material resources, physical and social infrastructures, higher susceptibility to community-wide exogenous shocks such as weather induced crop losses and natural disasters (Onimode, 2003). However, it must be noted that rural communities also vary greatly with regard to the condition of their rural economies and rural development needs. <br/>Olaniyan (2003) observes that: Communities in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State, Nigeria have been involved in community development projects over the years, but their participation output seemed not to have yielded any dividends of prosperity. It was further observed that systematic research aimed at understanding factors influencing poverty status in Egor through participation in community development projects seemed to be lacking (Omofonmwan &amp; Odia, 2000). These communities need improvement in the quality of their living standards. This, therefore, was of great concern, hence the decision to investigate the influence of level of development in combating poverty elevating in Egor Local Government Area. <br/>1.3   Objectives Of Study<br/>  The specific aims and objectives are as follows:<br/>1.     To determine factors that influence participation of people in community development projects <br/>2.     To suggest measures that would enhance the effectiveness of the programme in Egor local government area.<br/>3.     To find out the strategies in solving problems of poverty alleviation in Egor Local Government Area. <br/>4.     To assess the role of community development in eradicating poverty in Egor local government. <br/>5.     To identify poverty alleviation programme earmarked by the government in Egor local government area. <br/>1.4     Hypotheses <br/>1.     Factors influencing participation in community development will not significantly combat poverty. <br/>2.     Measures that enhance effectiveness of community programmes will not significantly combat poverty.<br/>3.     Available poverty eradication methods will not significantly combat poverty.<br/>4.     Community development will not significantly eradicate poverty.<br/>5.     The community development strategies already in place in Egor Local Government will not significantly combat poverty.<br/>1.5 Significance Of Study<br/>This study would be of significance in a number of ways, however, some of this are highlighted below:<br/>It will enlighten the public in the state and degree of poverty in Egor local government area of Edo state and also it is expected to provide information on the desirability or potential of community development in facilitating poverty alleviation among people. Such information is capable of correcting the misconception commonly believed that community development is not capable of alleviating poverty. The findings made will also raise the awareness of most people in the area about community programmes being able to alleviate poverty among them. It will suggest ways by which poverty can be averted, prevented and manage by means of acquisition of community through the Edo state government,<br/>Moreover it will provide source of information on how best poverty can be eradicated, managed and improved or enhanced by community planners. In addition the findings made will enable the Edo state government authority to become aware of the need to provide or make available both material and human resources and equipment necessary for motivating people to participate in community development programmes put in place for helping people acquire skills that would facilitate self-reliance and poverty alleviation. <br/>Most importantly, the finding of the study will also guide government at all level to discover and appreciate some of the problems of poverty which can also make the policy makers adopt policies to ensure success of programmes put in place. <br/>The study will draw the attention of government and make it more committed to the course of providing good road networks within and outside the local government area and also effort should also be concentrated in the grading of earth roads linking various communities in the local government area.  Incentives necessary for promoting self-reliance and poverty alleviation among populace will be stressed.<br/>1.6` Scope Of Study<br/>The study is limited to Egor Local Government Area, Edo State. <br/>1.7 Definition Of Terms<br/>Community Development: It is an effort designed to advance the living standard of all the people who live in a particular area. It is often referred to as development of rural areas in Nigeria.<br/>Poverty: This is the state of being poor. It can also be defined as a state of being unable to satisfy most basic and elementary requirements of human needs in terms of shelter, food and clothing.<br/>Community: A group of people with a shared identity. Hence, community development relies on interaction between people and joint action, rather than individual activity<br/>Development: is a process that increases choices. It means new options, diversification, thinking about apparent issues differently and anticipating change<br/>Alleviation: This involves or implies eradication of poverty and the consequences its existence among the people. <br/>Role: a character or part played by performer or actor<br/>Government: the body with power to make and/ or enforce laws to control a country, land area, people or organization<br/><br/>\n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IN COMBATING POVERTY: A CASE STUDY OF EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE INFLUENCE OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IN COMBATING POVERTY: A CASE STUDY OF EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT", "id": 169}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>IMPACT OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE ON OLDER ADULT<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       Background of the study    -<br/>1.2    Statement of the Problem    -    -    -    -<br/>1.3    Objective of the Study    -    -    -    <br/>1.4    Hypotheses    -    -    <br/>1.5    Significance of Study    -    -    -<br/>1.6    Scope of Study    -    -    -    -<br/>1.7    Definition of Terms    -    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>Review of Relevant Concepts    -    -    -    -<br/>2.2    Effect of Substance Abuse    -    -    -    -<br/>2.3    Review of Theoretical Framework    -    -<br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>      Research Design    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>3.2    Population of the Study    -    -    -    -<br/>3.3    Sample and Sampling Techniques    -    -    <br/>3.4    Instrument of Data Collection    -    -    -    -    -<br/>3.5    Method of Data Collection    -    -    -    -<br/>3.6    Validity of Research Instrument    -    -    -<br/>3.7    Data Analysis    -    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER FOUR: DATA ANALYSIS, INTERPRETATION AND DISCUSSION ON FINDINGS<br/>Introduction    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>4.0.1    Analysis Of Respondent Character    -    -    -<br/>4.2.0    Analysis And Discussion Of Hypothesis    -    -    <br/>4.2.1     Research Hypothesis 1    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/>5.1     Summary    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>    Conclusion    -    -    -    -<br/>5.3     Recommendation    -    -    -    -    <br/>REFERENCES    -    -    -    -    -<br/>APPENDIX I    -    -    -    -<br/>LIST OF TABLES<br/>Table 4.1.1 gender of respondents    -    -    -    <br/>Table 4.1.2 age of respondents    -    -    -    -    <br/>Table 4.1.3 Level Of Education Of The Respondent    -    <br/>Table 4.1.4 Marital Status Of Respondents    -    -    <br/>Table 4.1.5 Religion Of Respondents    -<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    Background of the study <br/>Elderly, make up the largest growing segment of the population in the world. Over the next 18 years the U.S. Administration on Aging (2010) reports that the baby boom cohort, defined as those born between 1946 and 1964, will turn 65 years old at the rate of approximately 8,000 persons per day. By the year 2030, this population will make up approximately 19% of the total population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000). As the size of the older adult population grows, so will the substance abuse issues among this cohort, which has been called an invisible and silent epidemic (Ferrell &amp; Sorocco, 2006)<br/>          Substance abuse, particularly of alcohol and prescription drugs, among adults 60 and older is one of the fastest growing health problems facing the world. Yet, even as the number of older adults suffering from these disorders climbs, the situation remains underestimated, under-identified, under-diagnosed, and under-treated. Until relatively recently, alcohol and prescription drug misuse, which affects up to 17 percent of older adults, was not discussed in either the substance abuse or the gerontological literature (D'Archangelo,1993; Bucholz et al., 1995; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 1988; Minnis, 1988; Atkinson, 1987, 1990). <br/>Insufficient knowledge, limited research data, and hurried office visits, health care providers often overlook substance abuse and misuse among older adults. Diagnosis may be difficult because symptoms of substance abuse in older individuals sometimes mimic symptoms of other medical and behavioral disorders common among this population, such as diabetes, dementia, and depression. Often drug trials of new medications do not include older subjects, so a clinician has no way of predicting or recognizing an adverse reaction or unexpected psychoactive effect.( United nation,2004)<br/>Other factors responsible for the lack of attention to substance abuse include the current older cohort's disapproval and shame about use and misuse of substances, along with a reluctance to seek professional help for what many in this age group consider a private matter. Many relatives of older individuals with substance use disorders, particularly their adult children, are also ashamed of the problem and choose not to address it. Ageism also contributes to the problem and to the silence, Anderson (1995) state that Younger adults often unconsciously assign different quality-of-life standards to older adults. Such attitudes are reflected in remarks like, \"Grandmother's cocktails are the only thing that makes her happy,\" or \"What difference does it make; he won't be around much longer anyway.\" There is an unspoken but pervasive assumption that it's not worth treating older adults for substance use disorders. Ajala (2006) posit that Behavior considered a problem in younger adults does not inspire the same urgency for care among older adults. Along with the impression that alcohol or substance abuse problems cannot be successfully treated in older adults, there is the assumption that treatment for this population is a waste of health care resources, (Scribner, 2000)<br/>These attitudes are not only callous, they rest on misperceptions. Most older adults can and do live independently: Only 4.6 percent of adults over 65 are nursing home or personal home care residents (Altpeter,1994). Furthermore, Grandmother's cocktails aren't cheering her up: Older adults who \"self-medicate\" with alcohol or prescription drugs are more likely to characterize themselves as lonely and to report lower life satisfaction (Hendricks, 1991). Older women with alcohol problems are more likely to have had a problem-drinking spouse, to have lost their spouses to death, to have experienced depression, and to have been injured in falls (Wilsnack &amp; Wilsnack, 1995).<br/>       The reality is that misuse and abuse of alcohol and other drugs take a greater toll on affected older aging also ushers in biomedical changes that influence the effects that alcohol and drugs have on the body. Alcohol abuse, for example, may accelerate the normal decline in physiological functioning that occurs with age (Gambert &amp; Katsoyannis, 1995). In addition, alcohol may elevate older adults' already high risk for injury, illness, and socioeconomic decline (Tarter, 1995).<br/>1.2    Statement of the Problem<br/>It will be increasingly difficult for older adult’s substance abuse to remain a hidden problem as the demographic bulge known as the Baby Boom approaches old age early in the next century. Census estimates predict that 1994's older adult population of 33 million will more than double to 80 million by 2050 (Spencer, 1989; U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1996). Most of that growth will occur between 2010 and 2030, when the number of adults over 65 will grow by an average of 2.8 percent annually (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1996). In 1990, 13 percent of Americans were over 65; by 2030, that bloc will represent 21 percent of the population (U. S. Bureaus of the Census, 1996).<br/>Health care and social service providers who currently care for  age 60 and older will mainly encounter abuse or misuse of alcohol or prescribed drugs. Abuse of heroin and other opioids is rare, although some older adults misuse over-the-counter drugs that have a high alcohol content, such as cough suppressants. Many of these over-the-counter drugs negatively interact with other medications and alcohol. Problems stemming from alcohol consumption, including interactions of alcohol with prescribed and over-the-counter drugs, far outnumber any other substance abuse problem among older adults. Community prevalence rates range from 3 to 25 percent for \"heavy alcohol use\" and from 2.2 to 9.6 percent for \"alcohol abuse\" depending on the population sampled (Liberto. 1992).<br/>1.3    Objective of the Study<br/>1.         To examine the impact of substance abuse on older adult<br/>2.   To investigate the extend at which substance abuse can impair decision making<br/>3.        To determine the psychological effect of substance abuse on older adult<br/>4.         To find out the effect of substance abuse on the social life of older adult<br/>1.4    Hypotheses <br/>Substance abuse will not significantly affect older adult.<br/>Substance abuse will not significantly impact older adult decision making.<br/>Substance abuse will not significantly impact on psychological wellbeing of older adult. <br/>Substance abuse will not significantly impact on sexual relationship of older adult.<br/>1.5    Significance of Study<br/>This study  will be very beneficial to parent, lectures and government. This is due to the fact this study will expose us to know the impact of substance abuse on older adult. It will also educate us on the danger of substance misuse. However, it will also help to minimize substance abuse among older adult.<br/>Policy maker, universities, government agencies and other social welfare agency, will also find this research useful. <br/>1.6    Scope of Study<br/>The study covers all older adult between the age of 65 and above. <br/>1.7    Definition of Terms<br/> substance:    The real or essential part or element of anything; essence, reality, or basic matter.<br/> Abuse: This means the misuse of something. It can also be described as the illegal use of something. <br/> substance Abuse:   This is the misuse of drugs. It could be defined as the illegal use of substance which interferes with the human behavior.<br/> Impact: This could be defined as a powerful or major influence or effect<br/> addiction: This is a state of periodic or chronic intoxication, detrimental to the individual and society, produced by the repeated consumption of a drug<br/>Psychological well¬¬¬-being: It is a mental stable state of mind of an individual that is considered to  be stable and balanced.<br/>Decision making; Is regarded as the cognitive process resulting in the selection of a belief or a course of action among several alternative possibilities.<br/>Social relationship: The sum of the social interactions between people over time.

A STUDY OF EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, BENIN CITY<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Over the years, the issues of Marital Rape like every other social issue bothering on human sexuality and abnormal behavior have attracted a lot of writings by researchers and social commentators born out of the complexities of intellectual cobwebs surrounding the subject matter. These complexities are not unconnected to the vagaries of subjective meanings and misconceptions tied to the apron string of socio-cultural perceptions encompassing norms, values and belief which shape the moral, ideological and philosophical inclinations in this context. To this end, this research sought to determine the socio-cultural perception of marital rape in Nigeria using Egor Local Government Area of Benin City as a case study paying attention to the interplay between certain social indicators that can shape these perceptions especially the recognition on cultural relativity in the context of the “Western-African Culture Divide”. In achieving this, detailed theoretical explanations where implored. Information where retrieved from the field using the questionnaire as the primary instrument of data collection. Results where analyzed and interpreted using Chi-Square and Simple Percentage Table. Findings, conclusions and implication for Social Work Practice in Nigeria where offered.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY-    -    -    -    <br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM-    -    -    -    <br/>1.3 RESEARCH QUESTIONS-    -    -    -    -<br/>1.4 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY-    -    -    -    -    <br/>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY-    -    -    -<br/>1.6 DEFINITION OF TERMS-    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW    <br/>2.1 REVIEW OF THEORITICAL LITERATURE-    -    -<br/>2.2 REVIEW OF EMPIRICAL LITERATURE-    -    <br/>2.3 REVIEW OF RELEVANT THEORIES-    -    -<br/>2.4 THEORITICAL FRAMEWORK-    -    -    -    -<br/>2.5 FORMATION OF HYPOTHESIS-    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>3.1 STUDY DESIGN-    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>3.2 SCOPE AND AREA OF STUDY-    -    -    -<br/>3.3 POPULATION OF STUDY-    -    -    -    <br/>3.4 SAMPLE SIZE AND SAMPLING TECHNIQUE-    -    <br/>3.5 INSTRUMENT OF DATA COLLECTION-    -    -<br/>3.6 METHOD OF DATA COLLECTION-    -    -    -    -<br/>3.7 METHOD OF DATA ANALYSIS-    -    -    <br/>CHAPTER FOUR: DATA PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS AND TEST OF HYPOTHESIS<br/>4.1 SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS <br/>OF RESPONDENTS-    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>4.2 MAJOR RESEARCH ISSUES-    -    -    -    -<br/>4.3 CROSS TABULATION OF RESEARCH VARIABLES-    <br/>4.4 TEST OF HYPOTHESIS-    -    -    -    -<br/>4.5 DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS-    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br/>5.1 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS-    -    -    -<br/>5.2 CONCLUSION-    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>5.3 IMPLICATION FOR SOCIAL WORK PRACTICE <br/>IN NIGERIA    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    <br/>5.4 RECOMMENDATIONS-    -    -    -    -<br/>REFERENCES    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>APPENDIX    -    -    -    -    -    -<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>Violence against women is a major cause of death and incapacity. (World Development Report, 1993)Violence against women has also been defined in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, as a prevalent harm to the basic rights, freedoms, health and welfare of women.Unfortunately however, the issue of marital rape which is a form of sexual violence against women has often been ignored and in fact left unattended to by social workers and researchers. This may be attributed to the complexities of social and cultural issues and perceptions underlying the subject matter.<br/>The discussion on culturally relevant social work has gathered momentum in recent years and its merits and demerits have been debated vehemently by various scholars in the profession. Indigenization therefore, has become a popular term in social work literatures just as social workers have continuously advocated for a more indigenous approach to the practice of the profession. This is because, the western knowledge base of social work does not suit the complexities, intricacies, interactions and relationships in which values, norms and social beliefs of the Nigerian people are embedded.<br/>The above view was supported by Anucha (2008), when she asserted that the American and British models of professional social work that has been exported to Africa has been critiqued as unable to address the unique issues and cultural characteristics of the majority of Africans.<br/>    According to kwaku (1993), the need for indigenization is based upon the realization that social work in Africa has failed to respond appropriately to the major social problems confronting the region. According to him, the social work profession is heavily influenced by western theories and no meaningful attempt has been made to ensure that the profession fits into the social, economic, and practical environment in which it operates.<br/>    It is against this backdrop that indigenization is seen as modalities adopted in making western social work knowledge base and practice to be culturally relevant to the contemporary African and Nigerian society. Gray et al (2008) opined that the core elements of indigenization should include integration, adjustment, creative synthesis, adaptation, localization, realignment, appropriateness and authentication among others. Indigenization therefore implies adapting imported ideas to fit local needs. (Hall, 1990).<br/>    In discussing the models of indigenization, Chang (2005) identifies three models to include transnational model, the theoretical-reasoning model and the grounded model. The trans-national model attacks the blind application of western concepts to non-western societies and emphasizes native studies from an epic point of view by native scholars. The theoretical-reasoning model focuses on a socio-cultural critique and attacks the dominance of empiricism. The grounded model however stresses the importance of grounded research with careful fieldwork and demands indigenous scholars to develop their own problems and research agendas relevant to indigenous societies.<br/>    The above mentioned models of indigenization are intended through this research work to demystify the core issue of marital rape within the context of the Nigerian society. The trans-national model of indigenization which attacks the blind application of western concepts to non-western societies supposes that the conceptualization of marital rape may not be in conformity with the principle of universalism. The theoretical-reasoning model which gives impetus to socio-cultural critiques advocates for a cultural realization of the concept of marital rape with a view to appreciating its indigenous knowledge and understanding. This research work is also intended to satisfy the grounded model through an indigenous focused research on the subject matter.<br/>According to Monsiola and Olusegun as cited in Sexual Violence Research Initiative (2007), marital rape refers to any unwanted and undesired sexual act by a spouse which is committed without consent or against the persons will. According to them, marital rape can serve multiple functions including its use as a socially sanctioned strategy to punish women, a tactic to assert masculinity and maintain a patriarchal social order as well as serving as a method to ‘resolve’ domestic conflicts, and a male behavior to take sexual pleasure.<br/>There is therefore the need not only to assess the public perception of marital rape in the Nigerian context but also to evaluate certain socio-cultural factors like religion, unbalanced gender (male superiority), norms, early marriage and power relations that serves as the moral lens used in the contextualization and evaluation of human behavior as determined by values with which the indigenous society underscores its own problematiques.<br/>This research work is therefore intended to unravel the nitty-gritty of socio-cultural, legal, and political issues surrounding marital rape in the Nigerian context. This will aid the social worker in understanding the basic indigenous knowledge and natural helping networks to be utilized in practicing with diverse social and marginalized groups in Nigeria.<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM    <br/>    During the past two decades, the physical and sexual abuse of women has become widely recognized.Marital rape is a common form of sexual violence. It accounts for approximately 25% of all rape cases and is experienced by 10 - 14% of married women. (Rabbi, 2006).Sexism is at the heart of marital rape, just as it is at the heart of most forms of sexual violence. This is because of the widespread idea that a husband has a right to sex and often, the marriage vows are seen as giving contractual consent to sex.<br/>    Traditionally, rape has been defined legally as forced intercourse without the consent of the woman other than the wife. (Kersti, 1996). According to an early British Jurist, “the husband cannot be guilty of rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual matrimonial consent and contract, the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract.” (Matthew Hale, 1680).<br/>    The definition of marital rape can be stated simply as forced sex without the consent of the woman in cases where the perpetrator and victims are legally married. This definition appears clear and succinct, yet, there are ambiguities embedded within it. First, the phenomenon of “marital” rape is not limited to legally married couples. Cohabiting couples have relationships quite comparable to husbands and wives. (Yllo and Straus, 1983).<br/>    The issue of force and consent must be addressed in all rape cases. However, the nature of the spousal relationship makes these issues more complex.The kind of social cohesion regarding marital sex is institutionalized in the Nigerian culture and internalized in individuals. While such cohesion can be degrading and detrimental, especially when accompanied by other forms of male entitlement and control, it does not fall within a useful definition of rape.<br/>    Firstly, marital rape is not recognized in the Nigerian culture.(Uwaoma, Njoku and Madukwe, 2011). The Nigerian culture which is a conglomeration of our social beliefs, norms, values, attitudes, religion and customs all do not believe that a married woman can be raped by her lawful and legally wedded husband. While it can be argued that this assumption is subjective and not objective, it is widely believed that a people’s culture is part of their human existence.<br/>    Also, the concept of marital rape relegates the institution of marriage in the African context in that it puts to question the supremacy of the husband over the wife. It is also a fact that marital rape negates the initial consent to marriage which in itself includes but not limited to the consent to sex.Furthermore, all crimes are relative. The relativity of all reported crimes sets in motion a particular context to each crime. It becomes questionable therefore, to consider rape within the marriage context. Perhaps, more appropriate contextualization could imply “forced sex in marriage” in place of “marital rape”.<br/>    In addition, religion is a fundamental aspect of the people’s culture. Both the Christian religion and the Islamic religion have doctrines and teachings embedded in its holy scriptures that negates the possibility of marital rape. According to the Biblical standpoint, 1 Corinthians 7:5, (New International  Standard Version) “the wife’s body does not belong to her alone but  also to her husband; in the same way, the husband’s body does not belong to him alone but also to his wife. Do not deprive each other, except by mutual consent, and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan does not tempt you because of lack of self control”. This suggests that both couples should always meet one another’s sexual desires. These religious injunctions have played an unconscious socialization role among Nigerians who therefore do not believe in marital rape.<br/>    Furthermore, it is worthy to note that religious injunctions stem from such laws as the canon law of the Roman Catholic Church. The evolutionary nature of the Nigerian legal system has proven that, both the criminal code and the penal code are traceable to the religious teachings of the church which has been greatly influenced by the canon law. This explains why neither the criminal code nor the penal code does not recognize the occurrence of marital rape neither does it make provisions for punishment of likely offenders.<br/>    Finally, the lack of reporting system in Nigeria has made it difficult if not totally impossible to keep necessary records and statistics on cases of rape, and marital rape. This explains why neither the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs nor the National Bureau of Statistics has a reliable statistics on marital rape cases in <br/>Nigeria.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS  <br/> What are the socio-cultural perceptions of the Nigerian people on marital rape?<br/> To what extent does the concept of marital rape negate the initial consent to marriage which already implies consent to matrimonial sex?<br/> Given the relativity and contextualization of all crimes, would it be indigenously and culturally appropriate to use the word “rape” in a “marital” context?<br/> What impact do religious beliefs and other socio-cultural determinants have on the prevalence of marital rape in Nigeria?<br/> What is the influence of the law of the land on the occurrence of marital rape in Nigeria?<br/>How does the lack of reporting system in Nigeria accentuate the prevalence of marital rape?<br/> What are the possible implications for indigenous social work practice in Nigeria?<br/>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>This research work is expected among other things:<br/>To examine the cultural beliefs of the Nigerian people on the concept and issues of marital rape.<br/>To unravel the nitty-gritty of socio-cultural, legal and political issues surrounding marital rape in the Nigerian context.<br/>To assess the influence of values and social norms on the prevalence of marital rape in Nigeria.<br/>To evaluate the impact of marital rape on the family institution in particular and the Nigerian society in general.<br/>To determine what socio-cultural factors can exacerbate the prevalence of marital rape in Nigeria. <br/>To adduce some feasible theoretical explanations associated with marital rape.<br/>To demonstrate proper conceptual clarifications on marital rape in the light of the prevailing disparity between the western world and the Nigerian society.<br/>To challenge respondents to articulate and examine their values towards marital rape.<br/>And to consolidate on existing research on the subject matter and express the need for further research by social workers and other line-professionals.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>It has been established by various literatures and opinion papers that marital rape in most of the sub-Saharan African countries especially Nigeria is legally and culturally accepted which invariably makes it the least researched form of gender based violence. (Dilek, 2011; Omoniyi, 2011; Chika, 2011; Salaam, 2003).<br/>In other for social workers to intervene appropriately through policy formulation, it is imperative to explore and clarify the socio-cultural perceptions of Nigerians on marital rape. This research work is important in that it aims at creating a beginning understanding of cultural knowledge and perceptions so as to equip the social worker with a firsthand indigenous knowledge in working with diverse populations especially with those affected by marital rape. <br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS AND CONCEPTS <br/> RAPE <br/>Rape refers to a carnal knowledge of a woman forcibly and against her will. This implies an unwanted sexual intercourse that involves the use of force and the lack of consent. <br/>MARRIAGE <br/>Marriage is a contract for the production and maintenance of children. It is an institution that sanctions the relationship of a man and a woman and binds them in a system of mutual obligations as a husband and wife which provides them with rights essential to the functioning of family life.<br/>MARITAL RAPE<br/>Marital rape is a non-consensual sex in which the perpetrator is the victims’ spouse.

One of the discrimination and abuse is violence. In recent years awareness of the problem of violence against women has broadened from being a ‘women’s issue’ and a feminist concern to being widely acknowledged as a human rights, public health, and a development problem (Jonikaite, 2006).<br/>    Domestic violence is a global problem that affects women of all races, ages, economic statuses, and religions with statistics emphasizing the devastating effects of domestic violence on the lives of battered women. Domestic violence was once viewed as a private matter, but today domestic violence is seen as a public health issue with consequences for batterers that are enforced by the criminal justice system (Salazar, Baker, Price&amp; Carlin. 2003).<br/>    According to the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violenceagainst Women (DEVAW), violence against women isany act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. (cited in United Nations Development Fund for Women [UNIFEM], n.d.)<br/>Domestic violence can be defined as “a type of repeated pattern of behaviors an abusive intimate partner uses to gain power and control over another” (Brodwin &amp; Siu, 2007) and as “repeated or frequent moderate acts of violence, sexual coercion through threats of violence or rape, any act of violence that causes injury no matter how infrequent” (Bograd &amp; Mederos, 1999). The disaster caused by this act of violence is enormous as Grovert (2008) asserted that in 2001, domestic violence made up twenty percent of all non fatal violence against adult women - around 600,000 crimes. Matthews, (2004) opined that in 2000, about 1200 women were killed by an intimate partner. This number made up about 33 percent of female murder victims<br/>In all these it shows that domestic violence is but a humane treatment on a particular gender, age or race. Studies reveal that In European countries, domestic violence is a major cause of death and disability for women ages 16 to 44 years and accounts for more deaths than cancer or traffic accidents (US department of Justice, 2010).<br/>In 2005, a study carried out by World Health Organization (WHO, 2005) on women's health and domestic violence, observed that the rates of domestic violence incidents in 10 countries revealed that 72% of Ethiopian women experienced violence with an intimate partner, followed by women from Peru, Bangladesh, Tanzania, Thailand, Samoa, Brazil, Namibia, Serbia, and Japan. Women who experience domestic violence are more likely to experience health consequences, with 80% more likely to have a stroke, 70% more likely to have heart disease, 60% more likely to have asthma, and 70% more likely to drink heavily than women who have not experienced intimate partner abuse (Family Violence Prevention Fund, 2008).<br/>    In addition, domestic violence is linked to a range of reproductive health issues, including but not limited to sexually transmitted disease and HIV transmission, miscarriages, and unsafe sexual behaviour (Davis, 2013). In support of this view a study conducted by Thomas, Joshi, Wittenberg, and McCloskey (2008) explored how domestic violence affects the health of women who are victims and included the battered woman’s description of how intimate partner violence affected their health. The study consisted of 40 women in eight focus groups, ranging in age from 18 to 64 years. The racial makeup was 79% African American, 8% White, 5% Latina, and 8% multiracial or ethnic. Of the 40 participants, 38 described experiencing physical or sexual abuse within the past year, and two participants described experiencing physical or sexual abuse in their lifetime.<br/>The aftermath effect of this oppressive act and action has a psychological undertone on the women as stated earlier and in the Nigeria context where male dominance is highly recognized because of its cultural backing there are tendency that an unending foresight to this anomalies is not eminent (Obarisiagbon &amp; Alenkhe, 2014). Women in Nigeria over the years could not be equated with their male counterpart as the act of marginalization, segregation and social participation is limited mostly to the opposite sex (Sadoh, Alenkhe &amp; Agbontaen-Eghafona, 2013). And the aftermath impact has a diehard consequence on the health of the individual and other aspect of the individual social, emotional and mental state.<br/>It is a general known fact that violence affects the lives of millions of women worldwide. UNICEF (United Nations Children’s Fund, Nigeria (1998) noted that any violence meted out to women has a direct effect on their health. Previous statistics shows that roughly 60 million women who should have been alive die as a result of a spectrum of violence of various kind. However, only about half of all incidents of intimate violence experienced by women are reported to the police (Wallace &amp; Seymour, 1999). In the light of these the study examines the impact of domestic violence against women in Egor Local Government Area.<br/>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Every fourth Nigerian woman suffers domestic violence in her lifetime, claims report by a consultant psychiatrist, (Ejiofor, 2015). Ejiofor, (2015) told that the worst forms of domestic violence are rape and homicide, and that domestic violence is one of the major social issues in Nigeria. Battering and trafficking are other grave forms of abuse experienced by Nigerian girls and women. Battered women suffer physical and mental problems as a result of domestic violence. Ejiofor further added that 25 per cent of women in Nigeria have to go through ordeal of domestic violence. The worst forms of them are battering, trafficking, rape and homicide, report claims.<br/>    According to 2013 global review of available data, 35 per cent of Women Worldwide has experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence. It is a great concern that in most underdeveloped countries in the world with special reference to Bangladesh, that Violence against Women are rated second in the world, with 47 percent of the women being assaulted by men (Mahmood, 2004).<br/>The Nigeria law on domestic violence is clearly inadequate, particularly regarding violence against women e.g. wife beating (Nworah, 2009). Resent survey has shown that a higher percentage of violence against women happen among women of lower social status, that is the uneducated. Due to their level of exposure they accept whatever is meted out to them by their male partners and accept this gender based violence as a norm (Nworah, 2009). <br/>However, there are dearth’s in statistics on the aftermath impact of domestic violence in Nigeria; hence the study seeks to examine the impact of domestic violence on women in Egor LGA of Edo state. <br/>1.3    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The main objective of the study is to examine the implication of domestic violence against women in Egor LGA. Other specific objectives include:<br/>To determine the causes of violence against women in Egor LGA<br/>To find out the socio-economic impact of violence against women in Egor LGA<br/>To ascertain the socio-cultural impact of violence against women in Egor LGA<br/>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTION<br/> What are the causes of violence against women in Egor LGA?<br/>What are the socio-economic impact of violence against women in Egor LGA?<br/>Is suspicion against the opposite sex is a psychosocial impact of violence against women in Egor LGA?<br/>What are the socio-cultural impact of violence against women in Egor LGA<br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is of great importance to all, especially those that have the concern of family development at heart. The study will further increase our knowledge on the evil of domestic violence in the society and will show the ills of this menace to the society. It will be add to already existing literature on similar topics as it relates to violence against women and domestic violence in modern society. It will expose all to the causes and the impact of domestic violence in Egor LGA. Benin City. Finally, it will help welfare organization, NGOs and other relevant organizations to know how wide spread domestic violence is in the society. <br/>1.6    JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY <br/>    This research is to find out again and gain. This research intend to find out fact about the causes and impact of domestic violence against women in Egor L.G.A. and to measure the degree of which the research work can affect the changes of people attitude towards violence against women to avoid reoccurrence  and further damages.<br/>1.7    SCOPE OF STUDY<br/>This study covers selected area in Aduwawa community; these are area with women of ages 20 to 50 years of age who are married. This is because married women who are under the coverage of cultural values and are married are more likely experience domestic violence.<br/> 1.8    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Discrimination: Selective evil<br/>Domestic: Homely <br/>Force: Coarse <br/>Gender: A particular sex especially the female<br/>Physically: Real<br/>Psychologically: Mental and emotional<br/>Society: Area <br/>Violence: Hostile, abuse<br/>Women: Married female sex<br/><br/>\n\nIMPACT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, BENIN CITY, EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, BENIN CITY, EDO STATE", "id": 172}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div align=\"center\">EFFECT OF STREET HAWKING ON CHILDREN<br/></div><div align=\"center\">Case Study Ibagi Local Government Area, Kogi State.<br/></div><br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>Introduction<br/>1.1 Background to the Study<br/>Street hawking is a form of selling of goods along the road from one place to the other (Umar 2009). It could also mean an act of canvassing for sale items carried by a hawker along the street, from house to house or in the public space (Ikechebebu 2008) Street hawking is a veritable means of socialization in the western part of<br/><div>Nigeria and it is widely practiced despite the attendant moral and physical dangers for children  (Ebigbo  2003). In Nigeria, street hawking is done mostly by female children. Children hawk different items, ranging from food to different types of non- edible items. Some children have a particular spot where they stay to sell their wares.</div><div>Some move from place to place along the street, while others go from door to door in residential area (Grootaert and Kanbur 1995). Child hawkers sell tray of goods on their head by moving from one street to the other. The hawker that sell similar goods walk different directions while those that sell goods that complement each other like food and drinks walk in the same direction. The youngest among these hawkers are followed by an adult child who also sells different things in order to teach the younger ones how to calculate or protect the child against any occurrence. These child hawkers shout on top of their voices to announce what they are selling in the<br/></div><div>community so as to attract the attention of intending buyer of their arrival. Street hawking is rampant among children in Ibagi Local Government, Kogi state, Nigeria as was observed personally by the researcher. According to the local community leader, street hawking has been in existence there for a very long time. As the major occupation is farming and trading, during the time of trade by barter, when a farmer’s harvests crop, he takes from the harvested crops for food consumption. The remaining has to be traded within the neighbourhood by the wives and children, so that they will get the money needed to purchase some other things needed in the household. Due to structural change (discovery of cruel oil), currently many people are moving out of the agricultural sector and migrating to the city for a decent job.</div><div>There is not much attention for farming any longer. As a consequence most  households  nowadays  buy  things  for  the  children  to  hawk  around  the neighbourhood with their mother. By so doing, children are taught how to trade for future purposes (personal observation)<br/></div><div><br/></div><div>1.2 Statement of the Problem<br/></div>The prevalence of child labour exist in various forms but some are clearly visible  than  the  other.  Children  are  seen  getting  involve  in  different  kind  of<br/>production work ranging from agriculture, manufacturing, industries and domestic work. In Nigeria, street hawking seems to be more popular form of child labour. Children hawk a wide range of cheap articles, edible and products such as sachet water,  vegetable,  bread,  slippers,  newspapers,  fruits  to  mention  but  few.  Street hawking is considered to be one form of child labour and exploitative because of the excessively long hour of trading by the children, hindrance of school attendance,<br/><div>effectiveness on child’s health (Ibanga 2007). Many Nigerian children are compelled to work because of their parents’ joblessness, poor or uneducated. Ibanga study shows that traditional custom especially polygamy contribute to poor living standard and push children into the street due to parents giving birth to many children.</div><div>Some of the street hawking children spends the entire day and sometimes until late in the night  selling  goods  under  harsh  weather  condition.  These  forms  of  economic activities by children interfere with emotional, educational and social development of children. There is a need to be specifically concerned about street hawking children.<br/></div><div>As indicated by Admassie  (2003), street hawking as a form of child labour is considered as violation children’s human rights in as much as children are force to partake in abusive, harmful and exploitative work which may affect their physical capabilities. It deprives children of their childhood freedom, that is, their right to play and recreate and of their natural development. Street hawking affects the educational development of a child and is a disinvestment in human capital formation and has negative effects on the private and social returns of a child (Admassie, 2002). The social characteristic of household such as household income, household size, household head literacy level, sex of the household head and his/her perception of the relevance of child’s education for the future development will all be considered.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div>1.3 Objectives of the Study<br/></div><div>The main objective of this research is to shed light on street hawking children in Ibagi Local Government Area of Kogi state, Nigeria and to inform policy makers  on  how  possibly to  support  these  children.  This  implies  pursuit  of  the following: <br/></div><div>- To investigate into the conditions of street hawking children in Ibagi local government, Kogi state.</div>- To examine the influence and decision-making patterns of children, parents and/or other caretakers or peers as regards participation of children in street hawking.<br/><div>- To find out about efforts made to reduce street hawking or by relevant actors (government, NGOs, community and other).</div><div>- To present the views of street hawking children on their situation and what they think will be an improvement for them.</div><div>- To suggest ways to strengthen policy-intervention for street hawking children.</div><div><br/></div><div>..4 Research Questions</div>1. What are the forces that drive street hawking by children?<br/>2. What are the working conditions for street hawking children?<br/>3. What policies are in place to assist street hawking in Ibagi local government?<br/>4. Are there interventions in support of street hawking children either from the government, NGOs or communities in Nigeria or elsewhere?<br/><div><br/></div><div>1.5 Research Hypotheses</div>1. There is no effect between street hawking and child academic performance.<br/>2. Street Hawking does not have any effects on students’ academic performance.<br/>3. The socio-economic status of parents is of no significant relationship to children’s involvement in street hawking.<br/><br/>1.6 Significance of the study<br/>The main objective of this research work is to evaluate the “Prevalence and Perceived Effect of Street Hawking on Child Education in Ibagi Local Government Area”. The survey examines the extent to which Street Hawking have been felt so far affecting the Child Education in Kogi state.<br/><br/>1.7 Scope of the Study<br/>Child hawking is a general social problem in Nigeria. It cuts across many states in Nigeria. However, this study covered only Ibagi Local Government Area of Kogi state.

Based on this general interest, the study further explores several related research questions, such as what specific aspects of marital conflict lead to adolescent adjustment problems, whether changes in marital conflict predict changes in adolescent problems, what kinds of adolescent problems are exhibited, and by what processes the relation between marital conflict and adolescent adjustment problems operates. While focusing on these research issues, this study also tries to overcome some of the methodological limitations in previous studies. The study used data from the Iowa Youth and Families Project. The results from structural equation modeling and latent growth curve analyses demonstrated that (1) two specific aspects of marital conflict, overt marital conflict and conflict over child-rearing, as well as general marital distress, had negative influences on adolescent adjustment; (2) increases in general marital distress and overt marital conflict predicted increases in adolescent problems over time; (3) poor parenting behavior mediated the relation between marital problems and adolescent poor well-being, externalizing problems, and internalizing problems; whereas adolescent feelings of insecurity mediated the relation between marital problems and adolescent poor emotional well-being and internalizing problems; (4) no moderating effect by poor parenting behavior or adolescent feelings of insecurity was found;and (5) the findings did not differ by adolescent gender.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>    CHAPTER ONE.

Exposure to high levels of marital conflict have been associated with the development of a wide variety of problems in children and adolescents, including externalizing problems, internalizing problems, social maladjustment, and deficits in cognitive competency (e.g., Davies, Hops, Alpert, &amp; Sheeber, 1998; Goodman, Barfoot, Frye, &amp; Belli, 1999; Grych, 1998; Stocker &amp; Youngblade, 1999). For earlier studies, see reviews in Cummings &amp; Davies (1994), Emery (1982), and Grych and Fincham (1990). Additionally, the relationship between marital conflict and child adjustment has been documented in both clinical and nonclinical samples (Grych &amp; Fincham, 1990; Reid &amp; Crisafulli, 1990), among boys as well as girls (Emery &amp; O'Leary, 1984; Purcell &amp; Kaslow, 1994), and across a wide range of ages including preschoolers (Dadds &amp; Powell, 1991; Jouriles, Pfiffner, &amp; O'Leary, 1988), school-aged children (Cummings, Davies, &amp; Simpson, 1994; Davies &amp; Cummings, 1998; Kerig, 1998; Smith &amp; Jenkins, 1991), and adolescents (Brody &amp; Forehand, 1990; Fauber, Forehand, Thomas, &amp; Wierson, 1990; Grych, Fincham, Jouriles, &amp; McDonald, 2000; Johnson, Gonzales, &amp; Campbell, 1987; Long, Forehand, Fauber, &amp; Brody, 1987; Peterson &amp; Zill, 1986; Wierson, Forehand, Fauber, &amp; McCombs, 1989).<br/>With the association between marital conflict and child adjustment problems well- documented, the research question has changed to one that asks what specific aspects of marital conflict are related to what particular aspects of child adjustment (Fincham, 1994). In this regard, two theoretical frameworks are especially pertinent for the present investigation.Grych and Fincham's (1990) \"Cognitive Contextual Framework\" proposes that maritalconflict that is intense, poorly resolved, and child-related represents a destructive form ofconflict that is particularly upsetting to children. Their framework also proposes that thedegree of threat perceived by the child as a result of interparental conflict will have a significant influence on the child's development. They argue that marital conflict that is more threatening to children will invoke greater fear in children and will, therefore, have a greater impact on them.<br/>Davies and Cummings' (1994) \"Emotional Security Hypothesis\" proposes that some forms of marital conflict are especially likely to undermine children's sense of emotional security and psychological well-being. They propose that marital conflicts that are intense, that involve direct threat to children, and are child-related are particularly stressful for children. When these types of conflict occur, they are likely to decrease children's emotional security. Both of these hypotheses agree that marital conflict that is intense, openly hostile, and that involves child-related issues is especially harmful for children. Many studies have supported the hypotheses and found that child problems are most likely to occur when marital conflict is openly hostile (e.g., Buehler et al., 1998; Hetherington, Cox, &amp; Cox, 1982; Katz &amp; Gottman, 1993; Rutter et al., 1974) and child related (e.g., Dadds &amp; Powell, 1991;<br/>Grych &amp; Fincham, 1993; Nixon &amp; Cummings, 1999; Snyder, Klein, Gdowski, Faulstich, &amp; LaCombe, 1988). Moreover, some studies have shown that the impact of marital conflict on children is greater than the influence of general marital distress which concerns spousal reports of their unhappiness, dissatisfaction, or lack of commitment in their marriage (Grych &amp; Fincham, 1990). The present study examines whether overt marital conflict and conflict over child-rearing, the two specific aspects of marital conflict proposed to be most damaging by the cognitive contextual framework and the emotional security hypothesis, have negativeinfluences on various adolescent adjustment problems. The research also evaluates whetherthe impact of overt and child-related marital conflict is more damaging to child adjustmentthan general marital distress.<br/> Even though several studies have provided evidence that marital conflict influences child adjustment problems, little has been done to examine whether level or change in marital conflict have an impact on changes in child problems over time (Fincham, Grych, &amp; Osborne, 1994). Because most previous studies have not involved longitudinal designs, evidence is sparse with regard to this research question. The present prospective, longitudinal study extends earlier research by investigating (1) whether the level of marital conflict leads to increases in adolescent maladjustment; (2) whether increases in marital conflict over time will predict increases in adolescent adjustment problems; (3) which type of marital conflict over time is most detrimental to adolescents; and (4) which types of adolescent problems are most affected in the long run.<br/>  Another research question that has drawn great interest concerns how marital conflict leads to child adjustment problems. The Disrupted Discipline Hypothesis (Emery, 1982), for example, argues that conflict in the marital relationship adversely affects the quality and consistency of parenting. Parents in conflict may be lax in their management of child behavior or may use opposing discipline strategies. These inconsistencies in parental discipline, in turn, contribute to adjustment problems in children. According to Davies and Cummings' (1994) Emotional Security Hypothesis, marital conflict can also directly undermine children's sense of security, which in turn, has an impact on child adjustment. Studies have found support for both poor parenting (e.g., Conger, Conger, Elder, Lorenz, Simons, &amp; Whitbeck, 1993; Fauber, et al, 1990) and emotional security (e.g., Davies &amp; Cummings, 1998) as mediators of the relationship between marital conflict and child adjustment problems. However, some studies found that, instead of mediating, parenting behavior and children's appraisal of marital conflict moderate the relationship between marital conflict and child adjustment problems (e.g., Black &amp; Pedro-Carroll, 1993; El-Sheikh<br/>    Harger, 2001; Frosch &amp; Mangelsdorf, 2001; Kerig, 1998). The present study will examine whether parenting behavior and adolescent feelings of insecurity mediate or moderate the relationship between marital conflict and adolescent adjustment problems.<br/>With regard to children's gender differences in response to marital conflict, earlier studies show that boys are more likely to exhibit externalizing problems whereas girls are at greater risk for internalizing problems (e.g., Block, Block, &amp; Morrison, 1981; Cummings &amp; Davies, 1994). Moreover, gender differences also have been found in the mediating process. For example, Block and colleagues (1981) suggest that boys are more affected by inconsistent parenting than girls when marital conflict occurs. However, some studies found that boys and girls are similarly affected by exposure to marital conflict (e.g., Buehler et al., 1998; Johnson &amp; O'Leary, 1987). The present study tries to further understanding of whether boys and girls react differently to marital conflict and whether the possible mediating or moderating processes involving parenting behavior and adolescent feelings of insecurity vary by adolescent gender.<br/>Another important aspect of the present study is that it examines the influence of marital conflict on three separate adolescent outcomes. Previous studies have tended to examine a single domain of adjustment problems, such as conduct problems or internalizingproblems; or alternatively, some studies have aggregated various dimensions of adolescent adjustment (see Johnson, 1996). The present study will use poor emotional well-being, externalizing problems, and internalizing problems as separate adolescent outcome measures to examine whether marital conflict has the same or different effects on different aspects of adolescent development.<br/>The next chapter provides a review of theories and previous studies in the area of marital conflict and child adjustment problems. Based on these theories and previous studies, the analytic models propose that (1) both overt marital conflict and conflict over child- rearing will have adverse influences on adolescent adjustment, and their influence will be stronger than the effect of general marital distress; (2) both the level of and increases in marital conflict will lead to increases in adolescent adjustment problems over time; and (3) poor parenting behavior and adolescent feelings of insecurity will mediate or moderate the relationship between marital conflict and adolescent adjustment problems. As mentioned previously, the study will examine the influence of marital conflict on different domains of adolescent outcomes separately. Also, adolescent gender differences will be tested. In subsequent chapters, methods of study are reviewed, results are presented, and the findings are discussed in relation to the aims of the research. Using a prospective, longitudinal design, the present study focuses on 5 assessments of 451 adolescents and their parents over a period of 6 years. Both latent structural equation modeling and latent growth curve analyses are used to evaluate the analytic models.<br/>\n\nMARITAL CONFLICT: ITS IMPACT ON ADOLESCENT ADJUSTMENT <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MARITAL CONFLICT: ITS IMPACT ON ADOLESCENT ADJUSTMENT ", "id": 174}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CAUSES AND EFFECT OF NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TO IMMUNIZATION AMONG COUPLES</b><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>BACKGROUND: Lack of information has been associated with couples anxiety or concern in a number of healthcare areas.<br/>OBJECTIVES: (1) Identify the proportion of parents who agreed, were neutral, and disagreed that they had access to enough information to make a decision about immunizing their child; (2) examine how parents who agreed and disagreed differed with respect to sociodemographic characteristics, and their attitudes about immunizations, their child's healthcare provider, immunization requirements/exemptions, and immunization policymakers; and (3) identify if differences exist in specific immunization concerns.<br/>METHODS: A sample of parents with at least one child aged &lt; or =6 years (n=642) was analyzed using data from the HealthStyles survey conducted during July and August 2003. Odds ratios and the Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test were used for analysis.<br/>RESULTS: Response rate for HealthStyles was 69% (4035/5845). The largest proportion of parents agreed they had access to enough information (67%) compared to parents who were neutral (20%) or who disagreed (13%). Compared to parents who agreed, parents who disagreed were more likely to be less confident in the safety of childhood vaccines (odds ratio [OR]=5.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]=3.3-8.9), and to disagree that their child's main healthcare provider is easy to talk to (OR=10.3, 95% CI=3.7-28.1). There was a significant linear trend in the percentage of parents expressing immunization concerns among those who agreed, were neutral, and who disagreed they had access to enough information (p&lt;0.05; df=1).<br/>CONCLUSIONS: While most parents agreed that they had access to enough immunization information, approximately a third did not. Perceived lack of information was associated with negative attitudes about immunizations and toward healthcare providers. Basic information about the benefits and risks of vaccines presented by a trusted provider could go a long way toward maintaining and/or improving confidence in the immunization process.<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>Immunization is recognized as a safe and effective method of preventing disease (National Advisory Committee on Immunization, 1998); however, not all parents choose to immunize their children and not all couples choose to maintain or update their own immunization status. The goal of this thesis is to understand why young couples (parents or future parents) make the decisions they do and how they arrive at those decisions. Health scientists need to acquire an understanding of the experience of people in relation to their environments for the purpose of increasing their potential for health. Improved health policies may be developed if we can understand how to serve our populations better as a whole. It is more useful to put into place policy that will be meaningful and followed, than blanket statements that do not put the population's needs first. This study contributes to a better understanding of the thought processes behind persons who choose to delay or refuse immunizations irrespective of the policy environment. The area of immunization is as complex as a mosaic, and true to this metaphor, every tile of information contributes to the overall picture while remaining distinct. This thesis is presented as another tile. Currently in Amuzi community in Obowo L.G.A, mainstream immunization is voluntary, though strongly encouraged and freely dispensed to all citizens. Changes are on-going in mandatory immunization policy provincially. Alberta and Saskatchewan pride themselves in not having moved to mandatory laws due to the public health delivery systems in place. (Personal communication, P. Hasselback, January, 2002). As long as most people comply, the herd immunity remains strong and the risk for developing vaccine reventable diseases remains low. However, certain groups in the population do not agree with immunization for a variety of reasons. Some of these reasons include theological constraints, belief structures that favor \"natural\" immunity, beliefs that immunization is dangerous to children, mistrust in pharmaceutical companies and a belief in alternative health therapies such as provided by naturopaths and chiropractors.<br/>What about apathy? Funk and Wagnells (1982) describe this as indifference and lack of interest. Do couples feel immunization is important? Do they think about it during their daily lives? What will our future generation of parents do to contribute to herd immunity when they have never seen the diseases the vaccines are designed to prevent? What will happen when the next generation feels overly confident that they will not be touched by these diseases because they are perceived as a \"Third World problem\" or when they do not understand the ramifications of the diseases? Lack of knowledge of our own immune systems in the general population is high. Because of the complexity of interactions between anatomical structures and biochemistry most laypersons shrug their shoulders when asked how basic immunological functions occur.<br/>Policies encouraging health education may emphasize the importance of citizens taking a pro-active role in understanding their bodies and what they can do to remain healthy. In  this day of reduced health care budgets more emphasis needs to be placed on prevention of disease. Immunization is an integral cog to the wheel. An analysis of this issue indicates a need for more knowledge to guide health care workers and policy-makers in contributing to immunization.<br/> DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT<br/>The purpose of this project is to ascertain the beliefs of young couples regarding immunization for their children or future children.<br/>The overall objectives of this qualitative study are to:<br/>a. Determine the theological constructs of young couples who refuse or delay immunization among their children or future children for religious beliefs.<br/>b. Determine the beliefs of young couples who engage in alternative health practices and refuse or delay their children's or future children's immunizations.<br/>c. Determine whether youngcouples (non-parents) are thinking ahead regarding immunization.<br/>d. Determine if there are gender differences between perspectives regarding immunization.<br/>e. Determine if there are vocational/academic differences between groups regarding immunization.<br/>f. Determine the relationship between various groups who do not immunize regarding their decision-making.<br/> OBJECTIVES<br/>The main objective of the study was to deepen our understanding of the knowledge, attitudes, practices, fears and beliefs about immunization among children.  Specifically the objectives were:<br/>To identify myths and misconceptions about immunization among couples.<br/>To identify knowledge, attitudes, practices, fears and beliefs (KAPBF) about childhood immunization.<br/>To determine motivating and de-motivating factors in parents seeking immunization amoung couples.<br/> RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>The aim of this study was to answer the following research questions in order to describe and explain:<br/>a.

According to Oyelayo (2003), there are over two hundred and fifty groups in Nigeria. Similarly, Asiyanbi and Oladimeji (2007) pointed out that, Nigeria Federation was a direct product of colonial masters brought this ethnic group together through the amalgamation of the Northern and Southern protectorates championed by Fredrick Lord Laggard in 1914.<br/>The ethnic groups spread across the entire geopolitical Zones in the country. In the North are Hausa, Fulani that dominates other groups such as Tiv, Igalas, Kataf, Kabba, Gwasi, Angasi, Jukus, etc.<br/>In the west are the Yoruba ethnic groups denominating others such as Egun, Urobbo, Itsekiri, Isoko, Ishan, Kwales, Edos, Ijaws, in the river side of Ondo and Ekiti region where the Igbo are the dominant ethnic groups with the minorities such as Ijaws, Ibibios, Efiks Anang, Kalabari, Ekoi, Agbos, Ikwerre, Ogoni, e.t.c. (Asiyanbi and Oladimaji 2007)<br/>             However, of all the ethnic groups in Nigeria, three namely, the Yoruba, the Igbo and the Hausa are the dominant. Thus, most discussions have been centered on these three prominent groups.<br/>Before a country artificially created in this way could develop internal unity, before its various people could begin to fuel a common loyalty to their new country, much would need to be done. However, they gave these new African states (Nigeria inclusive) new common institution, which forced the peoples to accept common activities.<br/>This laid the foundation for the growth of new common loyalties and gradually, each country develop its own ‘nationalism” above the smaller nationalism of its common peoples (Ibrahim 2009),<br/>It is understandable from the Ibrahim” submission that, consciously it unconsciously, the imperialist had simply laid a foundation upon which the inter relationship among the Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo could be build.<br/>             Apart from the colonial creations, there had been a long sustained interrelationship among various ethnic groups in Nigeria before the pre-colonial era, especially between the Hausa and Yoruba. This relationship includes Migration. Substantiating the above claim Tijani (2008) submitted that, history or inter-ethnic in pre-colonial Nigeria has show that diversity of culture and ethnicity has not always led to conflicts. According to Tijani people had found common grounds to resolve their groups difference when they cane into contract with one another similarly, Nnoh (1998) explained that, it is not inter-ethnic contract among Nigeria groups that breed conflict; rather it is the extent of competing claims that are associated with the economic and political problems of modern nation states.<br/>             Nevertheless, the ecology of Nigeria also encourages the development of interrelationship among Nigeria ethnic groups and sought blessing beyond the political and or geographical boundaries of each of them.<br/>No matter how carefully any group might have chosen its side, it was unlikely that is produced all that its settlers needed. Variation in the ecology, nature of the soil and climatic conditions usually encouraged specialization need for exchange, migration and above all, inter relations. Although, Tijani (2008) agreed that there were May factors that rationalized the migration of the Hausa to the Yoruba, he strongly believed that the main factor that led to the migration of Hausa people in the pre-colonial period into Yoruba land generally was trade and commerce.<br/>             Important factor that provided sufficient basis for the development of commercial relationship between Yoruba land and Hausa land was the geographical locations of their regions. Hausa land is strategically location at the end of the transiahara trade routes, it continuously received variety of valuable goods of oriental origin through North Africa, which the Hausa traders controlled the coastal trade in the European goods in to Hausa land. Each of them has established middle-men trading position in such goods to which they had direct access (Tijani, 2003)<br/>             The above exploration indicates that there was a robust relationship between Hausa and Yoruba people, even before the adventure of colonialism. A part from religious motives, Yoruba Hausa relationship was strongly built on trade and commerce contracts through trade, migration between the Yoruba and the Hausa people had, for the time immemorial strengthen and the land between the Yoruba and the Hausa people. As at today the Yoruba are widely spread across the Hausa land. It is common to see Yoruba people referring to some personalities as “Baba lie Hausa” lya lie Hausa” meaning man in Hausa land or woman in Hausa land respectively.<br/>             Moreover, Hausa people are found across the Yoruba land. Their strong zeal for trade and commerce make it work perfectly for them in the land. One notice able thing is that, the Hausa people always live in group or in union wherever they are found. This, sabo and sango in Yoruba land usually signify the Hausa community in the land. The Hausa people in most cases live among their kinsmen in sango or sabo across Yoruba lands.<br/>             However, saki is a Yoruba town situated in the northern part of Oyo state in the western Nigeria. Saki is strategically located as it is the border town to Benin Republic. Saki town is blessed with fertile soil coupled with conducive climatic condition. Thus, the people of saki are well known for agriculture and trade. This blessed nature of saki makes the town a home for foreigners Hausa people inclusive. Like in many of Yoruba land, Hausa people are widely spread across the books and crannies of saki. The desire to examine the involvement of Hausa people in socio-economic activities in Saki land is the heart of this study.<br/>This study was, therefore, designed to examine the impact if the Hausa migrant in socio-economic activities of saki land.<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>There exist in Nigeria many diverse ethnic groups, the Yoruba, the Hausa and the Igbo are the dominant. The struggle for politician socio economic power has always resulted in tensions and crises among the three dominant ethnic groups. Therefore, there is need to conduct a study that will show case how one ethnic group has been coping in another’s land with a view to enhancing National integration using the information gathered from such a study. This is part of the researchable gap that the present study intends to fill.<br/>             Although the present researcher is aware that series of researches have been conducted on ethnic relation in Nigeria.<br/>             For instance, Tijani (2008) conducted a study on ethnic relation; A study of Hausa community in Ogbomoso, Nigeria. Adebisi (2010), carried out a study on ethnic relations and polities in Nigeria also Gbadebo (2007) worked on ethnocentrism and future Nigeria nevertheless Asiyanbi and oladimeji (2007) worked on federalism and Democratic principles are  sustenance of Nigeria body polity; The place of ethnic minorities. None of these studies, to the best of this researcher knowledge specifically examined how Hausa people have been coping in the border town-saki in the west of Nigeria. However saki is a unique Yoruba land. It is a confluence of Nigeria and foreigners, particular from republic of Benin. By this, any research republic carried out in other part of Yoruba Land may not be able to depict the situation in Saki with exactitude. This has thus created a researchable gap, part of which this study intends to fill up by investigating ‘the involvement of Hausa people in socio-economic activities of Saki’<br/>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>             Generally, the purpose of this study was to examine the involvement of Hausa people in socio-economic activities of Hausa people of Saki land .specifically, it was designed to investigate the structure of involvement of socio-economic activities of Hausa in Saki land ,the nature of inter –ethnic relationship between the Hausa and their host community Saki the ethnic differences between the Hausa and their host community Saki and the coping strategies ,the similarities between the Hausa and the Saki .Yoruba’s culture and the probable time the Hausa first entered Saki and the motivations to stay for so long.<br/>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>Research is conduct in education with a view to finding solution to the existing problem or discovering new useful information thus the result of this finding would be useful to Government, peace and ethnic resolution agents and the future researchers. Government would benefit from the result of this finding as it would provide them with useful information needed to properly build national integration.<br/>             Also peace and conflict agent may find the result of this study useful information in understanding the nature of co-existence between the Hausa and their Yoruba host community particularly Saki.<br/>             Furthermore, the result of this finding would serve as a solid foundation for subsequent researcher who may wish to carry out further studies on the present issue.<br/> 1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>             This study investigated the involvement of Hausa people in socio-economic activities of Saki land .It is limited to investigating the involvement of socio-economic activities of Hausa people in Saki West local government Area of Oyo State due to time factor, competence level and financial.<br/>1.6 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>             The method of research discuss the general procedure for the conduct of the study .it describe the research design, sample and  the sampling techniques, research instrument ,procedure for collecting data and analysis techniques<br/>1.7 RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>             For this finding, the following questions were as raised to guide the study, and were answered later in the study.<br/>I When did Hausa people enter Saki?<br/>Ii what has been the motivation to come and stay so long in the saki?<br/>Iii what is the structure of Hausa institution in Saki land.<br/>IV What are the ethnic differences between the Hausa and the Saki Yoruba and the coping strategist?<br/>V What are the Similarities between the Hausa and the Saki Yoruba’s culture?<br/>1.8 DEFINITION OF TERM<br/>             For the purpose of understanding this study, the following terms were defined as used in the study.<br/>i Institution; An organized group of people living in a particular are as a union because of their common future and perhaps, common goals.<br/>ii Hausa ;A tribe from the northern part of Nigeria.<br/>Iii Saki ;A Yoruba town situated in the Northern part of Oyo state in the Western Nigeria .It is also the head quarter of Local government called Saki West .<br/>Iv Ethnic group ;A group of people who feel themselves bound together through personalities and who possess a coherence and solidarity which have grow-up through a common life, common experience, common cultural traits and common tradition.<br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE INVOLVEMENT OF HAUSA MIGRANTS IN SOCIO-ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES OF SAKI, 1980-2000<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE INVOLVEMENT OF HAUSA MIGRANTS IN SOCIO-ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES OF SAKI, 1980-2000", "id": 176}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>OYO YORUBA AND ILORIN RELATIONS IN 19TH CENTURY<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>It is an undisputed fact that communities graduated from various stages viz primitive to the sophisticated stage hence there is bound to be relationship between these communities and localities. The nature and type of relationship that exist between these communities differs as there is no water, light compartment be among the communities. This study intends to investigate and explore the nature of the relationship that existed between the Oyo-Yorubas and the Ilorins in the 19th century when the zeal for expansionist is very high among the imperial powers.Consequently, in order to get accurate and reliable information views of various authors on related literatures were consulted so also personal interviews were conducted to people who has first hand information about happenings in the 19th century.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>Historians agreed that crises and warfare predominated in Yoruba during the 19th century. However, up till now, historians have not put all what happened in that century, under a common historical phenomenon. It is true that several writers dealt with different aspects of crises and wars, but only very few of them recognize and even timidly, that they are part of an essentially holistic global phenomenon imperialism.<br/>Furthermore, this study intends to show all that happened in Yoruba land during the 19th century was the manifestation of imperialism arising out of state and individual expansionist as well as exploitative tendencies which was set in motion by -Yoruba group and subsequently nurtured. It as a result of the nature of its relations with Ilorin. However we shall examine the relations from political economic and socio-cultural perspective.<br/>Before doing that, three issues require attention. The first is the justification for the adoption of the frame work of imperialism. It is imperialist inclination that spurred certain states to embark on territorial and power aggrandizement. In order words, not all states can be imperialist, hence the existence of mini states or segmentary societies.<br/>Inspite of this, imperialism cannot be categorized into ancient and modern as some European writers do, while imperialism may be atavistic in the sense of being as old as the emergence of organized states, all imperialisms in whatever geopolitical environment have the same objectives of exploiting the human and the material resources of all conquered or weaker people in order to ensure their own survival, for instance old  empire and its -Yorubas successor states of Ibadan, Ijaye and new  as well as Ilorin in varying degrees had similar objectives.<br/>Obviously, such objectives were mainly the product of internal dynamics within the imperialist states arising out of internal and at times external political and economic power differentiation. This invariably leads to expansion and domination for the imperialist state and individual member of the ruling class, such tendencies bring glory and prestige but exploitation to the subdued groups.<br/>This development in turn creates two centrifugal forces. The first is intermittent struggles for position and power among the members of the ruling class of the imperialist state. The other is in the form of determination of the subject peoples to free themselves from imperial oppression and return their states to the status quo or launch their own imperialism on others. Under this circumstances, there is bound to be crises and wars not only between the imperialist states but also between them and the hitherto exploited groups. This is what happened in Yoruba land during the 19th century.<br/>The second issue is relation. Relations between states or human grouping are as complex as they are between idealistic particulars. This is because they are the product and in many cases the consequences of intricately linked political, economic, socio-cultural as well as attitudinal factors. These factors are sot static, they change with time and situation. They are also not exclusive to one another, rather, they operate simultaneously, but often times at different qualitative levels. For example, two states at war can continue to allow trade between them. In the same way, socio-cultural exchanges can continue inspite of hostilities on the political level.<br/>The name -Yoruba is the third issue. Obviously this name has been bused before by few historians but it has not gained enough currency. One may attribute this to the pervasive use of geographical and generic nomenclature. We find the latter inadequate for two reasons.<br/>First is that several Yoruba ethnic groups are intermingled in the same geographical areas of northeast, northwest and central Yoruba land.<br/>Second, it is necessary to avoid the use of qualitative reference to any Yoruba group as being either proper or true. -Yoruba which is based on ethno dialectal approach allows for the identification of different Yoruba groups. Consequently, apart from , we also hae Egba, Ekiti, Ife, Ijesa. Okun and Ondo Yoruba group. <br/>The -Yoruba formed the largest single unit bin Yoruba land during the 19th century. They are believed to be the descendants of Oranmiyan, the founder of old  empire and cram of his conquering army. Before the fall of that provinces of Ekun Otun (West of Ogun River) and Ekun Osi (East of Ogun River), Ibolo to the southeast of the latter and Epo to its southwest. Today, the group populate the presence  and parts of Osun state as well as Asa, Ilorin, Moro, Ofa and Oyun local government areas of Kwara state.<br/>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>This study is aimed at having adequate knowledge of various activities and events that took place during the 19th century in Yoruba land. This involved the origin of Oyo people, and Ilorin their political relations in the 19th century and factors that dictated Ilorin’s imperialism with the area of expansion.<br/>It also aimed at making available the reasons that determined old  empire’s reaction to the expansion of Ilorin to the interested readers and future researchers (especially History students) from various institutions of higher learning in addition to have adequate knowledge of the economic and socio-cultural linkages between  and Ilorin in the 19th century.<br/>SCOPE AND LIMITATION TO THE STUDY <br/>The scope of this study will cover the relations of -Yoruba and Ilorin in the 19th century. This essay will focus its search light on the origin of Oyo and Ilorin. The political relation of Oyo and Ilorin in the 19th century will be discuss and other activities that took place such as: economic and socio-cultural linkages between Oyo and Ilorin in the 19th century with their intergroup relations.<br/>On the basis of the limitation, it is however necessary to mention the problem encountered on this study.<br/>The major problem was that of distortion of facts and numerous versions of history, financial  constraints, also poses another problem in studying the relations fullest for this project.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>This work would contribute to the existing body of knowledge in various ways because of its usefulness to the society as follows:<br/>It is belief that project would be useful to the people who want to know more about the origin of  people, the origin and foundation of Ilorin, the political relation of Oyo and Ilorin  in the 19th century.<br/>Also, the economic and socio-cultural linkages between Oyo and Ilorin in the 19th century and likewise their socio-cultural intergroup relations.<br/>This project would also be of benefit to the older generation, a few who might have been actual witness to some of the events during the 19th century highlighted in the discussion it would certainly bring to their memories and serve as remainder of a golden age in Ilorin and  traditional history.<br/>It is also believed that this project would correct people’s misconception about the formation of Ilorin and her relations with -Yoruba.<br/>This work also shed lights to the factors that dictated Ilorin’s imperialism which are as follows:-<br/>First, for the survival of the new polity, Ilorin needed to strengthen its military forces. This could only be achieved by producing large supplies of slaves, food stuffs and ammunition from other areas either through conquest or diplomacy.<br/>Second, the possession of slaves by the members of the ruling class was a source of power and glory. Consequently they encouraged wars of expansion.<br/>Third, Ilorin as an Islamic state, its territorial expansion and conquest necessarily involved the extension of Islamic culture and religion by both overt political action and other subtle means.<br/>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>This study was carried out through investigation, by means of oral interview.<br/>A random sample of individuals in were consulted for first hand information needed as regards the relationship that took place within Oyo and Ilorin based on personal observation.<br/>Apart from this, printed materials were also used such as textbooks, archival materials for vital information about the relationship between -Yoruba and Ilorin in the 19th century.<br/> REFERENCES<br/>Oral Interview granted by Mrs. Esther Babatunde on the 10th of February, 2015, Aged 75 years.<br/>Oral Interview granted by Mr. Saheed Adewale on the 21st of February, 2015, Aged 57 years.<br/>Nigerian Gazette Extra-Ordinary (1952) Volume 39 No 463<br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nOYO YORUBA AND ILORIN RELATIONS IN 19TH CENTURY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " OYO YORUBA AND ILORIN RELATIONS IN 19TH CENTURY", "id": 177}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>LECTURER’S PERCEPTION OF FASHION REFORM AGAINST SKIMPY DRESSING AMONGST STUDENTS OF EKITI STATE UNIVERSITY, ADO EKITI<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>        While some university authorities argue that mode of dress is an important factor in determining student’s success of failure and should thus be subjected to rules, orders especially in the humanities and social sciences remains uncounted. Realizing the evil effect of the vice of indecent dressing, this study is targeted at finding lecturers perception of fashion reforms in higher institutions.<br/>        To achieve this, a simple random sampling technique was adopted to select 120 lecturers from department in Ekiti state university as respondents. The method used for collecting data was questionnaire.<br/>        The data collected was analyzed using frequency count and percentage index and simple methods tools to test the formulated hypothesis.<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Background of the study.<br/>Among the three main basic need of man, clothing stand to be admirable in all admirable in all societies. There is probably no sphere of human activities in which our values and lifestyles are more clearly rejected than the clothes we wear. Kelechi, (2009) stated in every group religion occupation or community. There are certain accepted standard of dress considered right proper and appropriate. He maintained that in a group there are some social norms which govern the clothing behaviour of that group.<br/>Ezinwo (2002) argued that it is one’s husband, wife or medical personnel that are allowed to see these sensitive area for a woman, her breast, armpit, buttock and thigh are to be covered especially in public. For instance, it is considered a healthy practice to put on clothes that adequately cover some sensitive part of the body. The role played by clothing in stimulating or diminishing sexual urge is symbolic of the moral standard of a given culture. Indecent dressing that exposes the body especially in the part of female role attracts an undue attention from male which do lead to sexual harassment that at times leads to rape.<br/>From experience Nigeria Universities are facing problems associated with indecent dressing among the undergraduates on campuses at on unprecedented rate. Ebonughu (2004) reported that some of the universities have implemented dress code to counter the ills and to improve the quality of education. Dress code in Nigeria is not new. Religious groups government workers, banker, nursery/primary and secondary school students, marriage and burial ceremonies all have dress code.<br/>Kube (2003) Olori (2004) Edukugbo (2004) lamented that most of the female undergraduates students have shifted from the socially approved mode of dressing to offensive and provocative styles.<br/>Abube, (2002) and Ezinwo  (2003) are of the opinion that very skimpy skirts, short thigh blouses that exposes the stomach, ting blouses, and tops are some of the crazy undergraduate dresses. According to them, these crazy dresses are copied from foreign culture. It is observed that these undergraduate dress in such a way that they have nothing for imagination of their beholder and through their dressing the willingly or unwillingly subject themselves to opposite sex including students, lecturers and visitors to various forms of sexual embarrassment.<br/>As madness is creeping into the universities in leaps and bands the question that comes to mind is to know their parents views on this situation.<br/>Ezinwo (2002) and Abube (2002) also wondered if these undergraduates received adequate clothing from their parent and weather they are in the right frame of mind when they are putting on those dressing design. Akorede (2009) stated that tertiary institution as citadel of learning have great interaction with the government, parents, undergraduates and the public. He further stated that by the end of completion of the student programme in the university, the graduate should be found worthy in character and learning. To this regard, the universities are delegated with the responsibilities of maintaining an effective and  orderly environment conductive for teaching and learning.<br/>Ebonugwo (2004) and Edukugbo (2004) reported that the following universities have implemented dress code.<br/>_Bayero University Kano (BUK)<br/>_University of ilorin (Unilorin)<br/>_ University of Maiduguri (Unimaid)<br/>_Usman Dan Fodio University.Sokoto<br/>_Enugu State University of Technology<br/>_ Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA)<br/>_OlabisiOnabanjo University (OOU)<br/>_Ekiti State University (EKSU)<br/>_University of Lagos (UNILAG)<br/>_ Lagos State University (LASU)<br/>_Kwara State University(KWASU)<br/>_University of Ibadan (UNIBADAN)<br/> Statement of the problem <br/>Fashion reforms or dress code are lay down regulations to be strictly followed by the students. Kayola (2007) noted that institutional arrangement require certain norms know as the code of conduct of dressing designed by the good dressing habit.<br/>Damilare (2005) observed that our value has broken down completely and so adult and youth alike act without moral scruples. The general emphasis in the focus is the lecturer’s perception of fashion reforms against skimpy dressing among students.<br/>This study stands to reveal the reception of lecturer on fashion reforms in various higher institutions in Nigeria. This study will be in no doubt expose the acceptability or reflection of this reform on the part of lecturers who have interest in the studentsbahaviour before and after the reforms. This is because the lecturers stand the high chance of giving the advantages and disadvantages of the reforms.<br/>Purpose of the study<br/>The main purpose of this study is ascertain the opinion of lecturers on fashion reforms and its relevance  as prescribed and implemented by some Universities in the country and their contemporaries.

It was finally suggested that, the absence of policy guidelines to define what constitutes sexual harassment could in turn have encouraged the perpetration of the act in the institutions studied. Institutes higher education without explicit policies against sexual harassment are less likely to have to stress-free environment that will promote positive employee and students attitude. Secondly, there is a need for student and their trainers to be educated on what constitutes sexual harassment. Strongly disciplinary measures, including dismissal must be taken to the lecturers who harass female students and legislation which protect female students from sexual harassment must be introduced as there seems to be unwillingness in the part of society to recognize the problem.<br/> TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>Background to the Study<br/>Statement of the Problem<br/>Purpose of the Study<br/>Research Questions<br/>Significance of the Study<br/>Scope and Limitation of the Study<br/>Operational Definition of Terms<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Review of Related Literature                                     <br/>Theoretical Background on Sexual Harassment<br/>Theories of Adolescence<br/>Empirical Review of Literature on Sexual<br/> Harassment                                              <br/>Causes of Sexual Harassment<br/> Effects of Sexual Harassment on the Academic<br/>Performanceof Higher Institution Students in Schools       <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>Research Method<br/>Research Design<br/>Population of the Study<br/>3.3   Sample and Sampling Techniques<br/>Research Instrument<br/>Validity of the Research Instrument<br/>Reliability of the Research Instrument<br/>Administration of Instrument<br/>Method of Data Analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/> Analysis of Data and Results                                     <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>Summary, Conclusion and Recommendations               <br/> Suggestion for further studies<br/>References<br/>Appendix<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>Sexual harassment is bulling or coercion of a sexual nature, or the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favours. In most modern legal contexts, sexual harassment is illegal. (Akinboye, 2009).<br/>As defined by the Adubuola, (1988) \"It is unlawful to harass a person (an applicant or employee) because of that person sex Harassment can include \"sexual harassment\" or unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours, and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature.<br/>The legal definition of sexual harassment differs by Jurisdiction. Sexual harassment is subject to a directive in the European Union. (Omideyi, 1988).<br/>Where laws surrounding sexual harassment exist, they generally do not prohibit simple teasing offhand comments, or mirror isolated incidents. In the workplace harassment may be considered illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it create a hostile or offensive work environment or when it result in an verse employment decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted, or when the victim decides to quit job). (Ojeme, 1994).<br/>The legal and social understanding of sexual harassment, however, varies by nature.<br/>In the context of US employment, the harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, Harjit, (2003)a co-worker or someone who is not an employee of employer, such as a client or customer and harassers or victims can be either male or female.<br/>The concept of sexual harassment, in its modern understanding, is a relatively new one, dating from 1970's onward; although other related concepts have existed prior to this in many cultures.<br/>The term sexual harassment was used in 1973 in \"Saturn's Rings\" a report authored by Mary Rowe to the then president and chancellor of about various forms of gender issues. (Coffey, 2008)<br/>Rowe has stated that she believes she was not the first to use the term, since sexual harassment was being discussed in women's groups in Massachusetts in the early 1970's, but that MIT may have been the first or one of the first large organizations to discuss the topic (in the MIT Academic Council) and to develop relevant policies and procedures. MIT at the time also recognized the injuries caused by racial harassment and the harassment of women of color which may be both racial and sexual (Kohlbery, 2001)<br/>The president of MIT also stated that harassment (and favoritism) are antithetical to the mission of a university as well as intolerable for individuals.<br/>In Nigeria, over the years, secondary education has regarded as the minimum educational qualification required for entering into higher citadel of learning or learning a trade, Awosika, (2002), regards secondary education as and still regarded by a greater percentage of Nigerian as necessary precondition for social mobility.<br/>In the same vein, Nwankwo, (2000), says secondary education is the gateway to higher social status, position and career success.<br/>Therefore, it is not amazing that the Ladeni, (2004) revised edition adopted education as an instrument per excellence for effective national development, it also proposed the objectives of education at all levels.<br/>The objectives of secondary education as stated in the national policy on education in specific terms should:<br/>Provide an increasing number of primary school pupils with the opportunity for education of higher quality, irrespective of sex or social, religious and ethnic background.<br/>Diversity its curriculum to cater for the differences in talents opportunities and roles possessed by or open to higher institution students;<br/>Equip higher institution student to love effectively in our modern age of science and technology;<br/>Develop and protect Nigerian culture, art and language as well as the world cultural heritage.<br/>Raise a generation of people who can think for themselves, respect the views and feeling of others, respect the views and feelings of others, respect the dignity of labour and appreciate those values specific under our broad national aims and level as good citizens;<br/>Foster Nigerian unity with an emphasis on the communities that unite us in our diversity, and;<br/>Inspire it higher institution student with a desire for achievement and self-improvement both at school and in later life Osuala, (1993).<br/>        Those objective(s) are worthwhile, however the achievement depend on their implementation Adarelegbe, (2001), while expressing his view on this argues that it is the task of the school to calculate moral and ethical values in learner's along with their learning experiences.<br/>The said task of inculcating moral values which was placed before the school is in line with what Adesina, (2002), described as production of boys and girls who stressed the need to wipe away moral decadence at all levels of education.<br/>The chief role of school is to bring higher institution students up morally to become acceptable adult in the society, moreover, the school is required to provide higher institution students with adequate knowledge for the preparation towards entering into a profession.<br/>Therefore, the educational, social and psychological roles of the school in the loves of the higher institution students are also paramount.<br/>However, drawing its members from diverse homes, the school serves as a meeting place for higher institution students of different socio-economic backgrounds to display worthwhile and vice-versa behaviours. Coffey, (2002).<br/>In the developing country like Nigeria, people tend to look at sexual harassment as a disease that has eaten deep the fabrics of the society, due to the gross misconduct of the sexual harassments.<br/>It's incessant increase nowadays made it look like no effort has been made to diagnose the causes and effects of sexual harassment on schools, not that schools deliberately plan to breed delinquents pupils, but the complexity of the society (Elizabeth, 1992).<br/>According to sexual harassment law (1998), sexual harassment is a person who is under the age of eighteen years, it must be noted that for a sexual harassment to be called a delinquent, his or her conduct must be so deviant and fall so short of the expectation of the society (Adesina, 1999).<br/>Hopkins (2000) defines a sexual harassment as a boy or a girl aged from twelve and eighteen years who fails or neglects to do what duty or laws required.<br/>In encyclopedia of the new universal library (2001); sexual harassment is defined as tendency of individual or group to break the law or moral code of a society.<br/>Pizza, (2002) said that, it represents a form of adolescent adaptive behaviour arising out of a complex of social-economic psychologic and emotional disturbances.<br/>Harjit, (1998) emphasis that harassment literally means indulging in truancy, destruction of properties, disobedience, assault, aggressiveness, fighting to mention but few.<br/>Meanwhile, Akinboye, (2000) stated that \"poor home condition might be responsible for harassment when we heard any establishment of behaviour that can militate against the achievement of set objective organization\".<br/>Therefore, this is the study of the factors influencing sexual harassment among students in Emmanuel Alayande College of Education with a view of recommending useful suggestions towards the possible ways of controlling and eradicating this menace in our society.<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>It has been discovered that these exist prevalence of the sexual harassment in the world today and it seems the bulk of this is in higher institution, through many categorized the prevalence and the causes of the sexual harassment among the society as a result of the youthful exorbitant power testing.<br/>Also these have not been critical effort to examine the causes and prevention of the sexual harassment among higher institution student, especially in our country (Nigeria).<br/>Many researchers refused to understand that youths are the ones that characterized the large population of the society, also there are many ideas of the situation that prompted me to carry out this particular study, because of so many report of sexual harassment among or outside the higher institution in our country and how people that has been harassed whether through hugging, kissing, hanging around a poem, touching an employee's cloth, hair, body or unwanted letters, telephones calls etc. feels.<br/>All this aforementioned among all are what makes the researcher to carry out this study.<br/>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of the study are:<br/>i.  The main purpose of the study is be examine the factors influence  sexual Harassment<br/>ii. To determine the nature and trend of sexual Harassment among students  of Emmanuel Alayande College of Education<br/>iii. To ascertain the causes of sexual Harassment as perceived by students    in Higher Education Institution<br/>iv. To examine the psychological consequences of sexual Harassment on the   victims<br/>v. To recommend possible institutional response to control occurrence of sexual Harassment among students at Emmanuel Alayande Colleges of Education<br/>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>The following research questions are generated to guide the study;<br/>i.       What are the causes sexual harassment?<br/>ii.      What are the factors influencing sexual harassment among the students in Emmanuel Alayande College of Education?<br/>iii.     What are the effects of sexual harassment among the students in Emmanuel Alayande College of Education?<br/>        iv      What are the ways to curb sexual harassment among students in Emmanuel Alayande College of Education?<br/>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The significance of this study cannot be over emphasized in the sense that, it will provide information on sexual Harassment findings. On this study will contribute immensely to enlightening in the adolescents who contributes majority population of the college and pupils at large to acquire positive attitude towards sexual Harassment students as the main anchor of this research will be made to see the negative effect of sexual Harassment and for the society at large, to see the problems of premature death of our promising young girls, emanating from abortion of unwanted pregnancies will minimized.<br/>Based on this research works, student reader would also gain so much based on the need to utilize the professional knowledge they have acquired while providing vocational, educational and socio-personal counseling to students. The students will also offer solutions to sexual Harassment and problems of premarital sex. The parents, guardians, teachers, social workers, educational administrations and the future researchers who will use the project as a reference point for various undertakings. It will shed more light on factor responsible for who might wish to carry out research in this area.<br/>1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>This study is delimitated to students of Emmanuel Alyande College of Education, the write intends to highlight possible factor responsible for sexual Harassment among students of Emmanuel Alayande College of Education and general survey of effects of sexual Harassment on them.<br/>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>SEXUAL HARASSMENT: Illegal forceful of opposite into sex relationship.<br/>PEER GROUP: playmate or age mate, age group that play together.<br/>TERTIARY: Next level of education after secondary school level.<br/>YOUTHFUL: means having the qualities that are typical of young people.<br/>TRAUMA: Severe emotional shock and pain caused by an extremely upsetting experiencing<br/>SEXUAL: Sex of reproduction occurring by fusion of male and female cell.<br/>SEX: Either of the two main groups \"male and female into which living things are placed according to their reproductive functions.<br/><br/><br/>\n\nFACTOR INFLUENCING SEXUAL HARRASSMENT AMONG STUDENTS IN EMMANUELALAYANDECOLLEGE OF EDUCATION, OYO<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FACTOR INFLUENCING SEXUAL HARRASSMENT AMONG STUDENTS IN EMMANUELALAYANDECOLLEGE OF EDUCATION, OYO", "id": 179}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p> <b>POVERTY AND CRIME RATE IN NIGERIA,  (2008-2010)</b></p><p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/> 1.1   INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>         The effects of Poverty on Nigerians are multidimensional. This is to say its has negative influences amongst others on the socio-cultural, economic, political, moral, health, security and educational lives of the people using the multidimensional schematic framework of underdevelopment, the effects of desolate poverty manifest in, low per capita income, low consumption level, poor health services, high death rate, high birth limited freedom to choose between variables that satisfy human wants, poor educational and other social services with its attendant consequences of lack of shelter, homelessness, hunger, both the body and the mind, malnutrition, target for diseases and sickness, short life expectancy, mental retardation, and political alienation, to mention but a few. This situation which is a self-reinforcing phenomenon tends to perpetuate undesirable consequences which leads to other social vices.<br/>         As noted by Adams (2004: 54), poverty has several consequences. One of such consequences is that poverty creates social vices such as armed robbery, stealing, prostitution, drug peddling etc. This is because every human being wants to get the best out of life,  and when  such basic necessities of life are hard to come by, the natural tendency is to engage in illicit activities in other to make ends meet. Cases of prostitution armed robbery, stealing and drug use that abound in Nigeria today arise from the biting ‘Pangs’ of Poverty, among the populace particularly in the rural areas.<br/>         In his final analysis, Adams has remarked that, poverty induces corruption in the sense that people who indulge in corrupt practices, at both the private and official levels, do so to shield themselves from poverty. Political and bureaucratic corruption thrive in our society today because of the need to secure one’s life and that of one’s immediate and, in some cases, extended family, against poverty.<br/>         Supporting the above view, Huntington (1968:59), has contended that in modernizing states such as Nigeria, poverty interfaces with corruption, and corruption subsist because of weak political institutionalization. As a modernizing state, Nigeria, with weak political institutions, lack the capacity to curb the excesses of personal and parochial interest exhibited by public office-holders. Public-office-holders therefore cash-in on these weaknesses and loot as much as they can from the national tilts. Such stolen public funds are stached away in foreign vaults, far way from the Nigeria economy.<br/>         With Calabar South Local Government Area as our study area, this work will be interested in investigating the impact of poverty on the level of crime rate in the area.<br/> 1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>         Though successive governments have tried to address the issue of poverty, the effect of the strategies and programmes has been that of mixed feelings.<br/>         Every government embarks on one form of poverty reduction strategy or the other. However, what has not been answered is the extent to which these programme have impacted on the poor people that is the target population. Still, it seems that the efforts of various government are ineffective and therefore not much has been done to actualized the benefits.<br/>         Also, the most disturbing is the fact that despite the amount of resources committed to those program the poverty situation still get worst, and more and more people region instead of escaping.<br/>         The inability of government efforts to reduce the level of poverty in the society has led to some undesired consequences, and one of such is the increase in crime rate in the society. It is common knowledge that poverty and crime go, hand-in-hand. Crime prevents so many things from thriving by increasing instability and uncertainty (at micro and macro economic levels) in the market, be it national, regional, municipal or even neighborhood.<br/>         The vicious cycle of poverty and crime on the other hand has the capacity to take an economy into a vicious cycle that causes unemployment and low growth which indicates that economic cycles may affect change in poverty and violent crimes. But most important of all, the characteristic of poverty and crime is that they are both geographically concentrated in the same areas, that is where one find poverty is also where crime exist. And this reveals the strong connections between the two issues. This study attempts to examine the following problems:<br/><br/><br/></p>\n\n POVERTY AND CRIME RATE IN NIGERIA,  (2008-2010)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  POVERTY AND CRIME RATE IN NIGERIA,  (2008-2010)", "id": 180}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EFFECT OF POLYGYNY ON ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF MUSLIM STUDENTS IN SELECTED SECONDARY SCHOOLS, SAKI WEST<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The work examined the effect of polygyny on academic performance of students in secondary schools in Saki.

Another scholar viewed it that marriage is the union of man and a woman who makes a permanent and exclusive commitment to each other of the type that is naturally fulfilled by bearing and rearing children together and renewed by acts that constitute the behavior part of the process of production.<br/>A polygyny marriage is the state or practice of having more than one wife’s at the same time. Islamicshariah law permits a man to marry up to four wives. Even (Q 4 Vs 3) permits man to marry up to four wives. This marriage is widely practice and not as cohesive as it was before in Nigeria, this form of marriage is commonly practiced.<br/>1.2 Purpose of the Study<br/>The purpose of the study is to find out the effects of polygyny practice on Muslim students in selected secondary schools in saki west local government area and also to examine polygyny system of marriage and what makes men involved in polygyny system of marriage the relationship between the husband, wife and their children can affect academic achievement of their children in the education progress<br/>1.3 Significance of the Study<br/>The finding of this study hopefully will be of great help to community and make it realize the effect of polygynous system of marriage on academic achievement of their children. The findings of the study will also enable the parents to make useful and helpful decisions about the academic achievement of their children in school. The school administrator will find it useful in the effective administration. It will also assist them in carrying out the effective of implementation of the school curriculum programmed. Also, individuals and society at large shall be able to see that polygyny is a blessing and not than male so as to avoid adultery and fornications. Through, it was seen as a source of economis empowerment in the olden days, it equally makes both mature male and female to be responsible.<br/>1.4 Statement of the Problem<br/>        It is believed that lovers want attention, happiness and discipline main ingredients for the proper growth of a child. All these can be found within a family that possesses peaceful atmosphere. However, lack of some marriage qualities by a family will have adverse effects on the children’s academic performance. The problems that emanate from the practice of polygyny among various people world wide have made almost everybody to believe that there cannot be any social advantage in it. Some people even attribute the death of any member of their family to be practice of polygyny. Equally, people have it at the back of their minds that hardly would any family member attain success in his human opinion that it debars progress, achievement and prosperity of the family. In view of these and many other similar problems, this project is aimed at finding answers to the following operational questions.<br/>- How does a man with more than one wife behaves between or among his wives?<br/> Research Questions<br/>1.5 Scope of the Study<br/>The study focuses on the effect of polygyny practice on Muslim students it is equally limited the geographical expression (Saki west).

The data was collected by the researcher through the administration of two hundred (200) questionnaires with men from different religion and social background. This examined the awareness, attitude and various factors militating against the effectiveness of family planning. The result showed that majority of men in Ogbomosho North Local Government are aware of the existence of family planning for men, but they are not practicing it. Some of the factors militating against the effectiveness of family planning identified are: religion efforts, cost of practice, and lack of adequate knowledge of applying the various methods of family planning available for men. This study made some recommendations such as; Increasing the level of awareness of family planning for men through organization of seminars and orientation. Introduction of sex education into the school curriculum at all level of education; Organization of reproductive health programme; There should be provision of subsidy on any methods chosen by men; Counseling unit of the government hospitals should rise to the challenge by creating awareness of the importance of family planning to men.<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/> One of the most serious problems that developing countries still have to solve is their rapid and uncontrollable increase in population, because while the world continues to experience a geometric increase rate in population growth. Thus there is need for government, non-governmental bodies and individuals to rise and proffer favourable solutions to this rapid and uncontrollable increase in population. It is documented that men’s general knowledge and attitude concerning the ideal family size, gender preference for children idea spacing between child births and contraceptive method use greatly influence women’s preference and opinions. However, fertility and family planning research and programmes have ignored men’s role in the past focusing more on women’s behaviour, and services are traditionally presented within the context of material and child health.            <br/>Since the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPDS) and the UN 1995 world conference on women’s interest in men’s involvement in reproductive health has increased. In September, 2014 a special session to the General Assembly endorsed the findings of the 20 years review and government committed to intensified efforts to address gaps and emerging challenges. The (ICPD) programmes of action, adopted in 1994 by 179 members states, lays out a far-sighted plan for advancing human well-being that places the human rights of individuals, rather than numerical population target at the centre of the global development agenda.<br/>It calls attention to the ways in which women and youth especially in their sexual and reproductive health can impact environmental sustainability and population dynamics. The Cairo programme of action that individual dignity and human rights are the foundation of a resilient sustainable future was ground breaking in 1994, but has been validated by a series of in-depth reviews. There has also been a shift in objectives of male participation and concerns, form increasing contraceptive use and achieving demographic goals to achieve gender equality and fulfilling various reproductive responsibilities. The large number of conference, research projects and debates on this subject bear testimony to the importance of this issue, both from the programmatic point of view and as a process for bringing about a gender balance in men’s and women’s reproductive rights and responsibilities.<br/>In Nigeria, the high rate of population growth has been driven by higher fertility rates, which have fallen much less rapidly than the crude death rate. According to Ogundele (2002) stated that rapid increase in the world population could have been a thing of great joy but unfortunately and ironically too, the current estimate by the end of the century had all continued to pose serious threat to any individual and almost all nations of the world. It is estimated that in 1999 the world’s population would hit six (6) billion and seven (7) billion by the year 2010.He stressed further that family planning was recognized as an essential component of primary health care for the world health assembly in Alma Ata in 2005 which made a commitment to health for all by the year 2000.<br/>Researchers have suggested various reasons to explain why, despite the high fertility rate, acceptance and utilization of modern family planning methods remains low.<br/>Factors that brings about this includes:<br/>Poor accessibility of services;<br/>The low status of women;<br/>The high illiteracy rate among female population;<br/>The patriarchal nature of the society; and<br/>A gender lack of male involvement in family planning<br/>The family unit in Nigeria is essentially patriarchal and patrimonial; with all the important decisions taken by the male head while the woman’s fundamental social role is to bear and raise children and engage in productive tasks within the household. Wives are usually, socially and economically dependent on their husbands. A study of reproductive motivation conducted in four Nigeria cities and large semi-urban settlement by the developmental agencies revealed that men wanted more children than women did, as children were believed to give status to men, often it was the men who decide whether to have another child. Oni and Mc McCarthy 1990, also found that even though virtually all men in their sample knew of at least one method of contraception, they were less knowledgeable about where to obtain contraceptives. They also thought that women should take responsibility for using contraception, but that men should control the decision making.<br/>Available studies shows that in many developing countries, male often dominates in making important decisions in the family, including those concerned with reproduction, family size, and contraceptive use. Men are also recognized to be responsible for the large proportion of ill reproductive wealth suffered by their female partners. Men involvement helps not only in accepting a contraceptive but also in its effective use and reproductive goals suggested that the couple has an egalitarian relationship. Studies have shown that couples who discuss the number of children they desire or the use of family planning are more likely to use a contraceptive and achieve the reproductive goals than those who do not.<br/>In Nigeria, unfortunately, data on the knowledge and use of modern contraception among men participation in reproductive health are generally scanty, and the existing studies are rather similar in focus and limited in scope. While Oni and McCarthy 1990, assessed the baseline level of knowledge, attitude and practice of adult males in Ilorin, Nigeria.<br/>Oyediran etal; 1995 examined the variables that determined ever-married men’s level of contraceptive knowledge and use in Imo and Ondo states.<br/>        In today’s age, when couples are busy with their respective careers age, when couple are busy with their respectively in careers, many are opting for smaller family or sometimes no children at all. There is also a high cost of living challenge to the couples. For couple who want to stop after having one or two children, there are variety of family planning methods, couple can opt for natural methods and artificial methods of family planning.<br/>        More over, many of these family planning methods are concentrated on women than men. This means women are much accessible to the variety of method of family planning than men. For instance, method like, emergency pills, intrauterine device (IUD), sterilization by tubectomy or tubaligation and abstinence are used by women, while methods like, abstinence, withdrawal, condoms and sterilization by vasectomy are for men. From the above, we can observe that there are more methods of family planning for women than men. Therefore, this makes the researcher to look into.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>It was found out that men did not see the issue of family planning as being a concern to them, they think it is a burden that should be borne by women. Many of the men were of the opinion that women are adults who should know how to take care of themselves.<br/>The much needed support need by women in the use of contraceptive and other means of family planning are not forth-coming from men. This matter has generated lot of controversies and often resulted to problems among couples. The uncaring attitude of men towards family planning has endangered many women.<br/>The researcher is of the opinion that both the men and the women should be the major stakeholders and should not be left in the hands of women alone.<br/>It is for this reason that the researcher thought that this matter should be looked into so that men should not treat women as lone ranger on the issue of family planning.<br/>This study therefore intended to correct the bad attitude of men towards family planning.<br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study aimed at examining the attitude of men towards family planning and to achieve the stated aim, the following objectives will be examined:<br/>To determine the attitude of men toward family planning<br/>To examine whether their religion influence their attitude towards family planning.<br/>To examine whether their attitude is influenced by the economic situation.<br/>To check whether their level of education influence their attitude towards family planning.<br/> SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is very significant in the following ways:<br/>It will go a long way to reveal the attitude of men towards family planning.<br/>It will also contribute to make men more aware of the need for family planning.<br/>It will educate men on how important this family planning is.<br/>It could be essential for the youth who are preparing to marry to limit their birth rate in order to escape over population in their different homes.<br/>It could also educate men who are less educated with the advantages of family planning.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>The researcher intended to check the following questions<br/>Are men aware of the existence of family planning?<br/>Do men support the practice of family planning?<br/>Does the religions support family planning?<br/>What are the various factors militating against the effectiveness of family planning? <br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is limited to Ogbomoso North Local Government, Oyo State in Nigeria and men from different families, different areas and different religion were chosen for the study with the use of random sampling technique.<br/>OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Geometric Increase:- This means a very high rate of increase something (population).<br/>Arithmetic Rate:- An increase in a slight rate.<br/>Population:- This means to the total number of people living in a particular region at a given period of time.<br/>Standard of Living:- This means the extent to which individuals of families can satisfy their wants.<br/>Family Planning:- This is the process of controlling the number of children one has through contraceptives.<br/>Contraceptive:- This is the practice of preventing women from getting pregnant.<br/>Demographic:- This means the statistical study of human population.<br/>Artificial Method:- This means the man-made method of family planning or improvised method.<br/>Condom:- A rubber sheath worn on the penis during sex to prevent infection or unwanted pregnancy.  <br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nATTITUDE OF MEN TOWARDS FAMILY PLANNING IN OGBOMOSO NORTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ATTITUDE OF MEN TOWARDS FAMILY PLANNING IN OGBOMOSO NORTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT", "id": 182}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ETHICAL EVALUATION OF CIVIL UNREST IN PLATEAU STATE<br/>FROM 2001-2015</b><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1     BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>Civil unrest is a common feature of social life in all types of societies. The scale, trend and patterns of civil unrest vary across societies and periods (Alemika 1997). The prevalence of civil unrest both locally and internationally has manifested a lot of devastation in human civilization. Civil unrest have in no small measure debilitated advancement in developing countries. Even in the most advanced countries, civil unrest has continued to be a reoccurring saga and thus poses a need for collaborative efforts in combating its dangers. Civil unrest has consequently affected the behavioural patterns of various social groups and religious adherents. The consequences of civil unrest therefore have continually drawn the attention of various governments, voluntary agencies, religious organizations and the academia towards controlling the spectre of its persistence considering ethical philosophy.. The Nigerian situation presents a good case for examining the intricate patterns of persistent civil unrest. Moreover, there is a complete admixture of the effects of the triad religious faiths, African Traditional Religion, Islam and Christianity. Notably, Islam and Christianity are pitched to be the major rallying forces in escalating the scale of civil unrest in Nigeria.<br/>Civil unrest is a broad term that is typically used by law enforcement to describe unrest that is caused by a group of people. Civil unrest is also described as “any public disturbance involving acts of violence by assemblages of three or more persons, which cause an immediate danger of or results in damage or injury to the property or person of any other individual.” during civil unrest people generally choose not to observe a certain law, regulation to rule, this is usually to bring attention to their cause or concern (Falola, 1998). Civil unrest also known as civil disturbance can include a form of protest against major socio-political problems. It is essentially the breakdown of orderly society, of which examples can include: illegal parades, sit-ins, riots, sabotage, and other forms of crime. Even on occasions where it is typically intended to be a demonstration to the public or the government, such can escalate into general chaos.<br/>Civil unrest can take many forms such as small gatherings or mass groups of people often blocking access to a specific building or disrupting day-to-day activities. Creating loud noises, shouting, or imitating a certain person is generally the disruptions that occur in civil unrest. The severity of civil unrest can often get out of hand leading to a riot with mob burns and terrorizing an individual. There can be inconvenience that civil unrest can cause by blocking roads, sidewalks, building (Falola, 1998). By people blocking this disturbs and interferes with the citizens that are not involved in the civil riot which is against the normal societal ethical practices.<br/>Plateau state that the researcher is examining ethically based on the spate of civil unrest has had its own fair share of civil unrest which in recent years kept its people in fear of the unknown. However, various measures put in place at all levels has seen the gradual return of peace to the state. The past decade has seen recurrent crises across the state, in urban and rural areas. Thousands of lives have been lost in these violent conflicts, there has been extensive damage to property, and the development prospects of the state have been set back. The civil unrest has mainly been along religious lines, between Muslims and Christians, but ethnicity also has a central role in the conflicts and there are considerable political interests at stake. Jos, the state capital and a major northern city with a population of some one million inhabitants, is the epicentre of much of the insecurity in Plateau State and has been the site of some of the worst of the civil unrest. Episodes of mass killing and destruction have occurred in Jos in 2001, 2002, 2008 and 2010. The civil unrest has also affected other parts of the high plateau, in rural areas outside of Jos particularly in 2001 and 2010, when hundreds of people were killed in villages, in their fields, or while tending cattle. There have been massacres in the old mining settlements on the plateau, notably in 2001 and 2010. In rural areas there has also been widespread civil unrest between Berom farmers and Fulani pastoralists. This is generally framed as a conflict over land, but contrary to media reports, many of those involved tend not to think the conflict is about a struggle for grazing land or farmland. In some areas valuable dry-season farmland has changed hands, with Hausa and Fulani farmers being forced off the land (Blench, 2004). But much of the civil unrest appears to be politically inspired and xenophobic rather than arising out of competition for land – as the killings in the old mining settlements suggest.<br/>The civil unrest in Plateau State began after two decades of increasing collective violence in other parts of northern Nigeria, the worst of which occurred in Kano, Kaduna and Bauchi States. Plateau State was largely peaceful during this period, 1980-2000. In fact, the first episode of mass violence in Jos since the anti-Igbo pogroms in 1966 occurred in 2001 (Danfulani &amp; Fwatshak, 2002; Higazi, 2007).<br/>Plateau State is one of the thirty-six constituent states of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and according to the 2006 census has a population of 3.1 million people. It is a majority Christian state within northern Nigeria. Northern Nigeria as a whole has a majority Muslim population but there are also large numbers of Christians living there, both in the far north (all of the main cities have Christian areas, mainly in „new? neighbourhoods – established during the colonial period – called Sabon Garis) and in the middle-belt, which is mainly Christian but still considered part of the north. Plateau State is located in the north-central zone and forms part of the middle-belt, a geopolitical idea which demographically consists mainly of national minorities – most of them now Christian – within the old Northern Region. Plateau State takes its name from the high plateau which dominates the state’s topography. The social development of plateau peoples and the historical position of the Plateau in relation to the rest of what is now northern Nigeria are somewhat distinctive, partly due to the terrain and the tremendous ethno-linguistic diversity of the area. There are dozens of languages spoken in Plateau State, marking it out from the predominantly Hausa-speaking areas further north – although, being the regional lingua franca of northern Nigeria, Hausa is also widely spoken on the Plateau. There has been a reaction against this in some areas, with a cultural resurgence that is encouraging the replacement of Hausa place names and ethnonyms with indigenous ones, and to a lesser extent the use of indigenous languages rather than Hausa. The sense of difference on the Plateau is also clear in social attitudes, politics, and patterns of life, and has affected trajectories of contemporary civil unrest in Plateau State, with mobilization around ethnicity and ideas of indigeneity being of major importance. However, this study is providing an ethical evaluation of civil unrest in Plateau State from 2001 to 2015.<br/>1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>This study explores the ethical implications of the peace in Plateau State was broken in 2001, when the city was previously known for its relative harmony and cosmopolitan outlook. Since 2001, violence has erupted in Jos city, capital of Plateau state, in Nigeria’s Middle Belt region. The ostensible dispute is over the “rights” of the indigene Berom/Anaguta/Afizere (BAA) group and the rival claims of the Hausa-Fulani settlers to land, power and resources. Indigene-settler conflicts are not new to Nigeria, but the country is currently experiencing widespread intercommunal strife, which particularly affects the nation unity with the trend of decaying ethical values.<br/>1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The following are the objectives of this study:<br/>To evaluate from the ethical point of view the civil unrest in Plateau State from 2001 to 2015.<br/>To examine the causes of civil unrest in Plateau State from 2001 to 2015.<br/>To examine the impact of civil unrest in Plateau State from 2001 to 2015.<br/>1.4     RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>What is the ethical implication of the civil unrest in Plateau State from 2001 to 2015?<br/>What are the causes of civil unrest in Plateau State from 2001 to 2015?<br/>What is the impact of civil unrest in Plateau State from 2001 to 2015?<br/>1.5     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The following are the significance of this study:<br/>The outcome of this study will be useful to the society in providing ethical standpoint against civil unrest. It will also educate on the civil unrest in Plateau State from an ethical point of view.<br/>This research will be a contribution to the body of literature in the area of ethical evaluation of civil unrest in Plateau State, thereby constituting the empirical literature for future research in the subject area.<br/>1.6     SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY<br/>This study will be limited to Jos, the State capital of Plateau State with specific focus on Jos North Local government Area which is the main capital city. It will also cover the ethical and moral assumptions from the civil unrest between 2001 and 2015 in Jos North Local government Area.<br/> REFERENCES<br/>Alemika, E.E.D. “Criminal Violence and Insecurity in Lagos State, Nigeria.” African Peace Review: Journal of Centre for Peace Research and Conflict Resolution 3.2 (1997): 72-97.<br/>Blench, R. 2004.

To achieve this, six research questions were quoted from the study, the study was delimited to only 100 Christian Religious Studies Students in Iseyin District Grammar School, Iseyin, Oyo State. Questionnaire was developed as the main instrument for the collection of data; findings established the fact that the marital or parental conflict determines the variation in Christian Religious Studies Students academic performances. It is recommended that the responsibility of solving the problem of parental on Christian Religious Studies Student’s Academic achievement is a collective one, and the burden is majorly on parents.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Iseyin is a city located in the Nigerian state of Oyo. It is approximately 100 kilometers North of Ibadan. The city is estimated to have a population commission of Nigeria (web). The primary industry of the area is cotton-based textiles. Iseyin city is the Third largest city in Oyo State after Ibadan, Ogbomoso and Oyo cities respectively. It is also known as the Home of ‘Aso Oke’. Aso Oke is a popular local fabric material mostly used for ceremonies in Nigeria, Tobacco is grown there and it is a result of this that one of the biggest tobacco owned by the British and Americans had an office in the city. Frieslam Campina (Wamco) also has a milk center in the city. There is Ikere Gorge dam located in the city. It was said to be the second largest dam when it was discovered alongside, Kanji dam during Obasanjo regime(military) Iseyin has a Technical college and the Oyo State NYSC (National Youth Service Corps) permanent orientation camp was also sited in the city. There are massive of land which can be used for industries and school purposes. Iseyin city which is also known as EBEDI City is centrally located with road networks accessible from Ibadan, Oyo, Abeokuta and Ogbomoso. The title of the monarch of Iseyin City is ‘The Aseyin of Iseyin Land’.<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>Iseyin District Grammar School was established on the 24th of January, (1964), by the Anglican and Methodist mission. The school was later handed over to the Iseyin and its district comprising Ipapo, Ojaja, Otu, Komu, Igbojaye, Okeamu and Baba-ode. The school then was named Iseyin Grammar School later became Iseyin District Grammar School, Iseyin. The Anglican mission produced and pay the principal and staff while the Iseyin Community provided the infrastructure. The pioneer principal is Venerable Adesina G.O. The school now has closed to two thousand students and a staff strength of thirty one. The immediate past principal of the school is Chief Adeniyi Falade who is at present a permanent secretary school administration. Mrs Siyanbola Florence Omoniyi is the incumbent principal and of course the first woman to head the school since inception.<br/>Marital relationships exist between a man and a woman when the two of them agree to live together and to establish their own family and live together until the end of their lives or till death separates them. Horny (1978) said that marriage is a union of man and a woman as husband and wife, most societies establish certain procedure and activities that must be followed before a marital relationship between a man and a woman can take place. These procedures include a period of courtship, the introduction of the man to the woman and vice versa. There will be marital dowry. All these are done to make the marital relationship a lasting and happy one. But all these notwithstanding, one finds that some marital relationships do not go along well with each other. Even though they had made a serious vow to live happily together either by the church or the traditional rite.<br/>Conflict occurs in all human societies but, it occurs in various degrees, marital conflict is that situation between man and woman. This is where husband and wife have different opinion about issues, events or activities which cannot be mutually resolved. Marital conflict usually arises mostly due to lack of understanding between the man and the woman. This comes in different ways such as difference in education and social backgrounds, physical maintenance, love making, extra marital affairs. As people become more educated and society becomes more enlightened, one expects the frequency of marital conflicts to reduce but ironically, the reverse has been the case. The divorce rate has been on the increase, this project work attempts to examine conflicts, and suggest ways of reducing their rate of occurrence.<br/> STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>One wonders why our society has remained passively perplexed and helpless to the high increase of divorce rate which is a result and effect of marital conflicts in most societies, it was still in the tradition for parents to choose marital partners for their children. This has been one of the major causes of marital conflict and possibly divorce because the spouses are not opportuned to know and understand themselves before getting married. The rate of divorce in our locality is increasing because many get into marriage without been matured enough for it. This again is another factor of marital conflict in the society. In this, they have no experiences that guides them in the marriage institution. This study will look into the influence that marital conflicts seems to have on the academic performances of children (students) in schools.<br/>In Nigeria, people hardly spare the thought for the role of parents on effective influence in the child academic performance. For instance, most parents are observed to rarely bother about their children’s progress at school. They feel they have fulfilled their responsibilities by paying their children school fees and providing them with school materials. They seems quite obvious of the fact that their children’s performance at school will contribute a lot to the achievement of their children. Most parents now-a-days are too pre-occupied to take interest in their children academic progress. They now feel it is the duty of the teacher to ensure that the children do well in the school. After all, that is what they are paid for. Consequently, it cannot be over emphasized in this study that parents of a child(student) must play the greatest role and impact in the process of influencing the child’s / student’s high academic performance in the school particularly at the first stage of development.<br/> PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The objectives of this study are:<br/>To examine the influence of social influence, taste and competitive living<br/>To find out the serve consequences of early marriage as it leads to divorce and separation (man and woman going into it unprepared).<br/>To find out whether pressure from family members can lead to marital conflict<br/>To find out the effect of marital conflicts on the child academic performance<br/>To investigate into the areas of conflicts among married couple or people to be able to solve its sources of conflict.<br/> SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The importance of this study is that the society as a whole will stand to benefit greatly in the sense that, it will aim at bringing out the effects, marital conflict people in the society will have less marital and psychological problems and as such, they will be able to contribute their maximum potential to the benefit of the community. This research will help the members of the society to know those things that bring about marital conflicts between married people so as to avoid divorce and also quest to keep a simple eye and avoid competitive living. The exposure in this area of study would serve as a pointer towards remediating poor academic performance. This would pave way for Nigeria’s technological development and social harmony and stability of student’s concept.<br/>The findings of this study would also add to the relationship between marital conflicts and academic achievement of Christian religious studies students in Iseyin, Oyo State since their attitude to learning determines their success or failure. It is also hoped that this study would be of great value to other researchers who would live to manipulate other variables affecting academic achievement of their students in schools. Above all, it would assist teacher’s educational psychologists, school administrators and guidance counselors to affect a positive and dynamic change in them when their parental influence as a result of marital conflict are understood.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>The following research questions are therefore formulated<br/>Do marital conflicts bring about broken homes?<br/>Does inability of family head to meet up with assumed social status may affect the child’s academic performance?<br/>Does immaturity of couple’s cause marital conflict?<br/>Do students from divorced home often isolate themselves from children of stable home?<br/>Does marital conflict has any effect in families?<br/>Does marital conflict expose the children to bad influence?<br/> COPE OF STUDY<br/>The study focuses on a survey of opinion on marital conflicts and academic achievement of Christian religious studies students in Iseyin District Grammar School, Oyo State. However, for the purpose of simplicity and effectiveness, this study was limited to Christian religious studies students in Iseyin and specifically, Iseyin District Grammar School, Oyo State is put into consideration. In like manner, Christian religious studies students in the school shall be considered alongside since their impacts towards the effect of marital conflict cannot be over emphasize. Consequently, questionnaire aires bothering on the earlier stated research question were developed to elicit responses from the students under study. The same were administered to the students and collected for analysis<br/> DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>These are some terms used in the report which needs to be explained so that readers will not be at sea when reading it.

Mother are not expected to neglect their child for care givers to play their roles who  are just offering assistance for them , Rather they should always create time , out of their busy schedule to see to the welfare of their children . If it is necessary for the child to be put in the day care center , effort should be made to select good play materials for the children .<br/>The National Policy on Education, (NPE) specifically stipulated that there is need for equal education opportunities to all Nigeria children irrespective of any real or imagined disabilities. The policy   facilities that would ensure easy access to education shall be provided via inclusive education on integration of special class and unity in to ordinary / public class under the universal Basic education (UBE) programme.<br/>Parents are the fist teacher of their children and they suppose to play their role by promoting their development.<br/>If care givers do not have much experience in higher education , the materials may be presented in a different way than it would be for care givers who have some college experience , or provided through on _site monitoring rather in a classroom setting prior training in child care center may also have a relationship to content.<br/>If care givers have already participated in some training , the topic of the initiative may need to be build or extend on what they have already learn .<br/> Even more important, the service delivery strategies and the content of the initiative must be related to the anticipated outcome. For example, if the goals is to reduce isolation and to enhance access to social support the initiative design may include opportunities for care givers to meet together in addition to home visiting , topic may include information on activities that care givers can do with the children in the community.<br/> Statement of the Problem<br/>This research work deals with influence of child care center on the children and seeks to explain the causes and the reason why some parents have interest in taking their children to child care center , the influence of the child care centre on the development of children and the impact of child care center on the social relationship of children with others.<br/> Purpose of the Study <br/>To analyze the effects of child care center on children.<br/>To assess the significance of child care center on children. <br/>To show the relationship between care givers and the parent.<br/>To show the relationship between care giver and children. <br/>To show the impact of care centre on the development of children.<br/>1.4  Significance of the Study <br/>It is hoped that this research work will highlight the influence of child care  center on cognitive development of children .The research work will make government and private organization to locate the child care center and give support.<br/>1.5    Scope and Limitation to the Study <br/>This research work examine the influence of location of child care center on cognitive development of children in Atiba local government .Also this study would have covered a wide range area but because of time, and finance constraint  it will be limited to Atiba local government area.<br/> 1.6    Definition of Terms<br/>CHILD: This is defined as any person who depends on his /her own parent for survival.<br/>A Child is a young human being below the age of full physical development or below the legal age of maturity .<br/>EMOTION: Is a strong feeling of an individual .it is psycho –physiological experience of an individuals,  state of mind as interacting with or around by intense feeling .<br/>CRECHE CENTER: Is a place where babies and children of school age are care for in a safe stimulating environment to provide education for children.<br/>CARE GIVER: Is anyone who provides help or care to the children.<br/>COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT: Is the dramatic role of brain development in infants, It helps to explain their hunger for stimulation.<br/>1.7 Research Questions<br/>1.     Is there any relationship between child care centre and the development of children?<br/>2.     Is there any relationship between location of child centre and the cognitive development of children?<br/>3.     Does the quality of child care centre has influence on the cognitive?<br/>4.     Does child care centre has negative effects on the development?<br/><br/><br/>\n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF CHILD CARE CENTRES ON COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN IN ATIBA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF OYO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE INFLUENCE OF CHILD CARE CENTRES ON COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN IN ATIBA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF OYO STATE", "id": 185}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE IMPLICATION OF BOKO-HARAM INSRUGENCY ON EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>          This study examined the Implication of Boko-Haram Insurgency on Educational Development in Nigeria. It covered the Nigerian security Officers, Media Houses and Tertiary Institution. The research design adopted for the purpose of this study was a descriptive survey method. A self design questionnaire tagged ‘the Implication of Boko-Haram Insurgency on Educational Development in Nigeria was used to gather responses from the respondents. The sample consisted of one hundred and twenty(120) workers in which forty (40) were selected from each of the three (3) quarter used. Simple percentage and chi-square analysis were the statistical methods used for the study. The outcome of the study revealed that Boko-Haram sect has seriously affected the Educational development in Nigeria. It also showed that the Boko-Haram sect has truly crippled into the development of education in Nigeria through the listed items in the research questions. The outcome also showed that the items listed on the possible solution of Boko-Har¬am sect and its effect on the quality of Education in Nigeria are the possible ways due to the respondent’s response.<br/>          Hence, the following recommendations were made among others: the government should implement the poverty education programme, injustice should be addressed in Nigeria, government should make education mandatory and compulsory for all, the government should provide employment opportunities for those unemployed etc.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>Background to the study.<br/>Terrorism is an illegitimate means of attempting to effect political charge by the indiscriminate use of violence (Lodge 1998:5)<br/>Also, Madunagu (2001:51) maintains that, terrorism is the use of violence to achieve political objectives. The bottom line of the above definitions is that, terrorism is an aspect of political violence. Since September 11 2001, multiple attacks on the twin towers of the world trade centre and pentagon in the United States of America, terrorism has become a household discussion in the world.<br/>Boko-Haram according to Omenma D.A. (Dr) 2011 is traceable to the militia group called Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) which enjoyed the patronage of top politicians in other parts of the Northern Nigeria, began to patronize the group through budgetary allocations.<br/>A seminar was presented in Caritas University by Omenma(2012), the boko haram insurgent started as a militia group called ECOMOG, which have being sponsored by prominent politicians in the North – Eastern States of Borno and Yobe during thw build up to the 2003 general election. Later, other politicians in other parts of Northern Nigeria began to sponsor the group, they provided them with huge sums of money, provision of training grounds on mountains scattered in the Northern region as well as protection against arrest by the federal government (Omenma 2012:15),<br/>        The sect spokesman Abdul’ Qaqa in one of his confessions in 2012 stated that Boko-Haram sect started as a fundamental group offcially called AtilusSunna Lid Dawatis Jihad but now popularly known as Boko–Haram. Since the inception of the activities of this group, Nigeria’s security has been threatened and it has also affected the quality of education in some parts of the country.<br/>        Since July 2009, the Islamist armed group, Jam’atuAhlisSunnahL’adda’awatihwal Jihad (People Committee) to the propagation of the prophets teachings and Jihad commonly referred to as Boko-Haram (meaning Western Education is Forbidden) and individuals or groups clamming to be members of Boko-Haram has claimed resonsibility for bombings and gun attacks across Northern and Central Nigeria. The group has killed Muslims, Clerics and worshippers, politicians journalists and lawyers and also police personnel and soldier. Boko-Haram has claimed responsibility for attacks on churches, prisons, police stations, school building, newspaper offices and the United Nation (UN) office.<br/>        The Human Right Wath (2012) estimated that out of 164 attacks launch by the sect, 935 people were recorded dead. Human rights also estimated that 550 people were killed in 155 boko-haram attack in 2011 alone.<br/>        Annesty International (2013) also estimated that in 2011 at least not less than 500 people were killed in attacks by and government officials were claimed. Also, thousands of people have been displace, turned to orphans and widows.<br/>        Nigerian who goes out in the moving can not guarantee his or her return, especially in the Northern part of the country. This is a panic situation of Nigerian society.<br/>        The economic activities especially in the Northern part of the country with particular reference to Borno, Bauchi, Yobe and Plateau state is nothing to write home about because some notable markets anre under lock and key due to bomb explosion here and there.<br/>        Politial wise, the activities of Boko-Haram has forced the government to impose the emergency rule on 15 prome areas. The affected local government are: GamboruNgala, BarkinLadi and Riyom in (Plateau State), DamaturuGeidam, Potisloum, Gujba and bade in (Yobe State). Nigeria tribune (2012) concluded.<br/>        However, the aim of researher is to ensure the peace and traquility in the nation, rather than bombing, killing and panicking everywhere most especially in the Boko-Haram prone states in the Northern part of the country. The lives and property of the citizen should be protected.<br/>        Every individual as a member or group of the nation should desist from the statement that is capable of breaking up of the country, for instance, the call from Boko-Haram that the people from Southern part of the country and christians should vacate the Northern therefore capable of breaking up of the country. Also, the threat statement by the Niger Delta that have prepared to launch attack on the North and Muslim living in the Niger Delata are if killinf of innocent people from south did not stop.<br/>        All these threat statements are capable of breaking up of the country. Therefore, the protection of live properly with peace and tranquility is the bedrock for the continue existence of the nation.<br/>        Since June 2013, several school children have been killed and injured in attacks on schools. In july 2013, purpoted leader of Boko-Haram AbubakaShekau, in a video statement, said Boko-Haram were attacking schools because they are Un-Islamic. He also called for more teachers to be killed. In it, he said ‘teachers who teach Western Education, ‘We will kill them’. We would burn down the schools, if they are Islamic schools. We don’t touch small children. Our religion does not allow that, but we will burn down the schoold’.<br/>        The spate of bombing now is targeted at primary schools, secondary schools and tertiary institutions respectively. Killing and maiming students, teachers, lecturers as well as burning school building at will which forved majority of scchools to close down in the North espeiallyBorno, Yobe and Adamawa state respectively.<br/>        The trend of insecurity in the country especially with activities of the dreaded Islamic sect popularly known as Boko-Haram has become a major concern for every Nigerian. Significant stakeholders in the country have offered suggesstions on the need to check the new security challenges posed by the dreaded Islamic sect in the country.<br/>        While some suggested amnesty be offered to the group, other called for collaborations with World leaders and International organizations as strategies to rid the country of Boko-Haram terrorists. Some also suggested the need for strenghtening the internal security to comback the sect.<br/>        It is against this background that this study is out to investigate into the insrugency of Boko-Haram and its effects on the quality of education in Nigeria.<br/> Statement of the Problem<br/>           In the past decades, education has gone a long way in the development of our country (Nigeria) but in some years back, schools in the Northern part of Nigeria faced attack by Boko-Haram which led to the destruction of school, system, school building, kidnapping of school children targeting and killing of school teacher which brings about bastardization of education sector and reduce the quality of education in Nigeria. The problem fews study wants to address therefore is to examine the impact of Boko Haram insurgency on educationing development.<br/>Purpose of the Study<br/>The purpose of the study is to look at the following<br/>To examine the origin and cause of Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria,<br/>To evaluate the impact of Boko Haram insurgency on the Education development<br/>To provide possible solution to the insurgency of Boko Haram on the quality of education in Nigeria.<br/> Research Hypothesis<br/>There are no significant factors causing Boko-Haram in Nigeria<br/>There are no significant effects of Boko Haram in Nigeria<br/>There are no significant relationship between Boko-Haram insurgency and education development<br/>There are no remedies to Boko-Haram uprising in Nigeria<br/> Research Question<br/>What are the causes of Boko-Haram in Nigeria?<br/>What are the effets of Boko-Haram in Nigeria?<br/>What are the impact of Boko Haram on Educational development in Nigeria<br/>What are the solutions to Boko Haram uprising in Nigeria?<br/> Significance of the Study<br/>           Education occupies an important place in most play for economic and social development whichever way we look at it the educational sector is important in human development or a supplier of the tarred manpower. It is a pre-requisite for the accomplishment of over development goal. It is the main sector through when national identity goals and aspirations are evaluated and realized (Adebiyi 2010).<br/>            Despite the high contribution from the government on education, Nigeria Education system has been faced with the problem of killing of the innocent students, bomb blast, and sexual harrassment by the notorious group (Boko Haram). The research of this topic has been carried out over years have not really achieve it prior objective. The effect of Boko Haram insurgency on the development and education in Nigeria. It is therefore hoped that this study will be relevant and of benefits to the government and its agency, students, scholars of political science, history, intelligent and security studies and the society at large in formulation of policy.<br/> Definition of Term<br/>           BOKO HARAM: The term BokoHaramis a derivation of Hausa word Bokon meaning amnesty Western or otherwise non – Islamic education while Haram is a word with Arabic origin that favouratively means sin but literally, forbidden.

The need for political stability in Nigeria cannot be overemphasized. Indeed, all segments of the Nigerian society are interested in the political future of the nation. However, this interest is approached from various dimensions. A major interest in the Nigerian polity is the Christian participation in politics, moral concern in contemporary Nigeria.<br/>Politics is about the acquisition of power and the use of such power. The Oxford Dictionary of Words defines politics as “matters concerned with acquiring or exercising power, within a group or an organization”. Onyekpe (1998) defines the term politics as the struggle for power which itself is the authority to determine or formulate and execute decisions and policies, which must be accepted by the society. It is the struggle for power of governance, especially executive authority (Onyekpe 1998).<br/>Onyekpe however gives a caveat to the first part of his definition. According to him, the struggle for or the acquisition of power and the reaction of the society to it, depend greatly on the level of political development of the country. In an undemocratic society, it does not really matter whether the decisions and policies are accepted by the society. Thus the value of political power or politics leaves little or no room for the people to have input, except where democracy has already been entrenched.<br/>Abogunrin (1984) in his paper titled “Towards a Unifying Political Ideology and Peaceful Coexistence in Nigeria: A Christian View”Dal et al, (1999) opines that Christianity and politics are two inseparable institutions in the human social psyche and structure. He equally asserts that earthly governments are mere agents of God’s theocratic governance of the physical and the spiritual world (Abogunrin, 1984). He, however, points out that the ideals of Christianity is a good guide to better political conducts, but the practices of such ideals are usually influenced by the socio-cultural institutions in the society, including politics.<br/>Christians have always present argument based on the statement of Jesus Christ that “Give unto Caesar what is Caesar and unto God the things that are God’s” (Matt. 22:17-22). This phrase has often been used to exclude from participation Christians and clergymen, who want to venture into politics. Matthew Hassan Kukah however, disagrees with this school of thought, with an exegesis on this passage. He writes that what Jesus really meant was not that Christianity and politics do not mix, nor did He mean that Christians should not participate in politics, the coin was representation of the power of Caesar and that was why the coin had Caesar’s sign. In the case of God, His authority is over and above the realm of Caesar’s empire. In that sense both Caesar and his coin are under the aegis of God and the issue of separation or Christians should not participate in politics is an aberration (Kukah 1998). It should be noted that the argument of these opposing schools are hinged on their belief, perhaps based on experience, that politics often corrupt Christian religion. Also that political leaders use Christianity as a platform to deceive the people.<br/> According to Leicester Webb, these societies are united by certain political values, closely associated with Christian doctrines and ethics as it relates to justice, morality, freedom, equity, etc (Alfold 1981). However, B. Alford suggests that there is a possibility of effective and successful governance if Christians are actively participating in politics. Christians in Nigeria would rather not get involved in politics but the fact remains that Jesus Christ did not discourage political participation for the faithfuls. In Judaism, which provided background to Christianity, the God of Israel, Yahweh is the God of war (Josh. 6:20ff), economy (Ex. 16) and God of obedience and moral virtues (Num. 21:4-8). Yahweh is all in all in Judaic traditional thought and politics. Even though, politics in Nigeria has been marred with corruption, violence and even murder, these are against the Christian ethics and believe. This morality issue has been limiting the participation Nigerian Christians in politics.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>The uncertainty about the future of Nigeria is unfortunately tied to poor democratic culture, which is an important ingredient of political life of every nation. Nigeria has been tagged, a failure in all fronts (political, economic, social and moral). Despite an abundance of economic resources, attempts to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development have not become a reality in Nigeria. Lack of political will, corruption, a deficiency of proper coordination for sustainable development programs, and wasteful patterns of production and consumption have hindered any meaningful progress in Nigeria. The non-participation of Christians in politics, monetization of politics and predentialism (popularly known as God-fatherism and God-son syndrome), violent behaviors of politicians such as political thuggery, political motivated assassinations, molestation of innocent citizens, seizure of ballot boxes, and wanton destruction of properties (ARSON), intimidation of political opponents, political sycophancy, looting, prevalence of cult’s activities and incitement of religious crisis in the name of politics, are negative behaviors exhibited by the political thugs in the name of politics in Nigeria. These aforementioned anti-social behaviors portrays the politicians as having no more fear of God, nor respect on their father’s land and human life, because money has been introduced into politics in Nigeria. This however, has made it necessary for the researcher to examine the Christian participation in politics considering the moral concerns in contemporary Nigeria.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The following are the objectives of this study:<br/>To examine the level of Christian participation in politics considering the moral concerns in contemporary Nigeria.<br/>To examine the factors limiting Christian participation in politics in Nigeria.<br/>To determine the prospects of Christians active participation in politics in Nigeria.<br/>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>What is the level of Christian participation in politics considering the moral concerns in contemporary Nigeria?<br/>What are the factors limiting Christian participation in politics in Nigeria?<br/>What are the prospects of Christian’s active participation in politics in Nigeria?<br/> 1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The following are the significance of this study:<br/>Finding from this study will educate the general public on the level of participation of Christians in Nigerian politics and will also enlighten on how the teachings of Christianity can be used as a tool for national development through eradication of corruption and other social vices.<br/>This research will also serve as a resource base to other scholars and researchers interested in carrying out further research in this field subsequently, if applied will go to an extent to provide new explanation to the topic.<br/>1.7    SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY<br/>This study on Christian participation in politics, moral concern in contemporary Nigeria will cover the practice of Christianity as a religion in Nigeria and its influence on the politics. It will cover the participation of Christians in politics considering the moral concerns.<br/> LIMITATION OF STUDY<br/>Financial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<br/> Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work. This consequently will cut down on the time devoted for the research work.<br/><br/>\n\nCHRISTIAN PARTICIPATION IN POLITICS: A MORAL CONCERN IN CONTEMPORARY NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CHRISTIAN PARTICIPATION IN POLITICS: A MORAL CONCERN IN CONTEMPORARY NIGERIA", "id": 187}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>FACTORS INFLUENCING THE ATTITUDE OF WOMEN TOWARDS FAMILY PLANNING<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>        The purpose of this study is to find out the factors that influence the attitudes of women towards family planning in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State.  Specifically, the study attempts to find out the influence of education, health, religion, culture, age of women and income on the attitudes of women towards family planning.<br/>        This research work deals with the types of contraceptive methods, importance of family planning and the benefits of family planning.  The subjects were selected using simple random sampling.  A total of 100 questionnaires were administered to subjects of the target population which are the educated women randomly selected from five communities under Egor Local Government:  Uselu, Uwasota, Osasogie, Evbareke, Osakpamwan.  The data collected were analyzed using percentage approach and the results showed that:<br/>Women recognize the impact of family planning on their families.<br/>Family planning is an opportunity for couples to actually plan their family towards better standard of living.<br/>Recommendations were made based on findings from the data analyzed, amongst which are that:<br/>There should be enlightenment programmes to educate people on the need for family planning.<br/>Incentives should be provided for couples that practice family planning so as to encourage more people towards it.<br/> TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE:  INTRODUCTION<br/>Background to the Study     <br/>Statement of Problem         <br/>Purpose of the Study          <br/>Research Questions            <br/>Significance of the Study     <br/>Delimitation of the Study     <br/>Definition of Terms             <br/>CHAPTER TWO:  LITERATURE REVIEW<br/>Meaning and Definition of Family Planning      <br/>Methods of Contraception    <br/>Traditional Method of Birth Control<br/>Non-Appliance Method <br/>Appliance Method               <br/>Natural Methods of Birth Control   <br/>Modern Methods of Birth Control<br/>Permanent Methods of Birth Control<br/>Importance of Family Planning     <br/>Benefits of Family Planning          <br/>Factors that Influence the Attitude of Women towards<br/>Family Planning          <br/>CHAPTER THREE:  RESEARCH METHODOLOGY<br/>Research Design         <br/>Population of the Study       <br/>Sample and Sampling Techniques         <br/>Instrumentation          -      <br/>Validity of the Instrument     -      <br/>Reliability of the Instrument         <br/>Procedure for Data Collection       <br/>Method of Data Analysis              <br/>CHAPTER FOUR:         DATA PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS AND<br/>DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS<br/> Research Question 1           <br/>Research Question 2   <br/>Research Question 3           <br/>Research Question 4           <br/>Research Question 5           <br/>Research Question 6           <br/>Discussion of Findings          <br/>CHAPTER FIVE:  SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND <br/>  RECOMMENDATIONS<br/> Summary          <br/>Conclusion         <br/>Recommendations      <br/>References        <br/>Appendices<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Background of the Study<br/>        Family planning as the name implies is having children by choice and not by chance; it is the process of having specific number of children at intervals acceptable by individuals or couples, to promote the health and welfare of the family.  Family planning is not a new idea all over the world and also applies to Egor Local Government Area of Edo State.  Throughout the ages, individuals and families have tried to regulate their fertility either by using herbs, abstinence during ovulation, prolonged breast feeding and living with parent in-laws to avoid sex or polygamy.<br/>        Historically, most communities in the past used to have policies that encourage large population.  Traditionally, in Africa, the low level of economic development and heavy reliance on agriculture have brought about several factors that encourage high fertility.  In addition, according to Namboze J.M.E. (1985), religious and cultural traditions favour large families because children are expected to help their parents financially and to ensure a kind of family immortality by continuity of the family name.<br/>        African women traditionally have played major roles in agricultural production, though their primary roles are that of wives and mothers having limited right as subordinates to the males in the household.  The status of women is further eroded by the practice of polygamy because they have limited opportunities.  At the societal level, child bearing is therefore an important way for them to gain status through the number of children raised.<br/>        Children are also needed for labour in the farm and a potential old age security which they provide in later life, especially for their mothers because women are often denied inheritance right or forfeit right to use land upon death of husband; and they need children especially sons to ensure that someone cares for them in their old age.  Also, a man’s health and integrity are often determined by the number of wives and children he has and since the African religion was highly practiced, it was believed that ancestors are expected to reincarnate through childbirth as descendents.<br/>        Women have come to see that cooking, house keeping chores combined with making a living, bearing and raising children are arduous tasks and gradually retards the health of both mother and children.  Today, many parents have realized that having a large family may bring difficulty in feeding, clothing and providing good education for them all.  In 1956, family planning was introduced by a body of elites in Lagos due to the alarming rate of abandoned children resulting from teenage pregnancy, criminal abortions and death.  This group of elite formed a body known as the marriage guidance counselors which later liaised with the international Planned Parenthood Federation of Nigeria (PPFN).<br/>        In 1958, Dr. Adeyemi Jones started the first family planning clinic in Ibadan but it did not last due to lack of funds.  In 1959, the Family Planning Council of Nigeria was formed while later it became the Planned Parenthood Federation of Nigeria (PPFN).  Since the vastness of child bearing has gradually led to population explosion, many individuals and organizations have complained and said that parents should cut down their family size and have made family planning an issue of moral, social and political considerations.  Such agencies include the International Planned Parenthood Association, the Pathfinder Fund, International Training for Health Programme, World Health Organization, etc.<br/>        Some leaders have equally spoken of the need for family planning in different ways.  According to Delano (1990), while quoting Julius Nyerere of Tanzania in 1959, “giving birth is something in which mankind and animals are equal but rearing the young and especially educating them for many years is something which is a unique gift and responsibility of man.  It is for this reason that it is important for man to put an emphasis on caring for children and the ability to look after them properly, rather than thinking about the number or sex of children”.  Looking at the past, inspite of the fact that our forefathers believed in large families as stated earlier, birth control measures were also in use.  This manifested itself in forms of sex taboos (frowning at pre-marital sex), abstinence, wearing of magical charms and talisman made from the worm of the lioness and even the use of a child’s tooth or cat’s liver for protection against unwanted pregnancies and consequent abortion.<br/>        Davis (1992) also supported the above method adding that our forefathers recognized the need for child spacing via traditional methods that were applicable to their circumstances at that time.  According to Delano (1990) while tracing the encyclopedia, the oldest recorded family planning theories are contained in the ancient Egyptian Petri papyrus, written about 1850 BC and the Ebers papyrus dated about 1550 BC, which described some methods of contraception.  Even in Greece and Rome, there were much concern over fertility regulations.<br/>        The ancient knowledge was incorporated into writing of scientific doctors and was of scientific basis for contraception up to the late 17th century.  From this, it should be noted that contraception had a place in the days of old as a means of preserving the health of the child and mother.<br/>        However, when compared with the modern contraceptives some of this traditional methods appear strange in their preparations and applications.  It is via intensive research that the modern methods of birth control emerged in an attempt to minimize complications, develop effective and non-injurious, convenient, reliable, enjoyable, easily accessible and also able to meet the needs of individuals and couples.  It is on this note that various birth workers like Jeremy Bentheam of England, Margaret Sawyer of USA are known and remembered for championing the cause of birth control in different countries and at different point of history.<br/>        In this study, therefore, attempts shall be made to find out what women in Egor Community understand about the concept of family planning, methods of contraception commonly practiced, specifically, finding out about the effect of education, income, religion, culture, age, health, as they influence the attitude of women towards family planning; dealing extensively with the importance and benefits of family planning.<br/>Statement of Problem<br/>        Various individuals, national and international organizations such as the World Health Organization, Population Reference Bureau, etc, have cried out over the dangers associated with population explosion and have equally suggested that couples cut down their family size.<br/>        Depreciating standard of living, inadequate facilities due to increase in population demands are also part of the issues that plague our society.  From the observation, this research is an attempt to study the factors that influence the attitude of women towards family planning.<br/>Purpose of Study<br/>        The purpose of this study is to carry out a survey on the influence of education, age, culture, religion, income and health on the attitude of women towards family planning.<br/>Research Questions<br/>        In dealing with this research topic, various problems were identified and research questions were drawn.  They are:<br/>Does education influence the attitude of women towards family planning?<br/>Does the health of women influence the attitude of women towards family planning?<br/>Does culture influence the attitude of women towards family planning?<br/>Does income influence the attitude of women towards family planning?<br/>Does the age of women influence their attitude towards family planning?<br/>Does religion influence the attitude of women towards family planning?<br/> Significance of the Study<br/>        This research will be of benefit to women and the society at large.  They will again a lot from the facts contained in this project work.  It is envisaged that this research work will further assist the growth, development, expansion and awareness of family planning and its importance to the society at large.<br/>        To also make recommendations that will alleviate the identified mistaken notions that affect the practice of family planning.<br/>Delimitation of the Study<br/>        This study is limited to the women in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State.  It does not intend to judge the efficiency of family planning, but to find out what influences the attitude of women towards family planning.  It does not cover treatment of side effects or failures of the methods.<br/>Definition of Terms<br/>Family Planning:       This implies the ability of individuals and couples to anticipate and attain their desired number of children and the spacing and timing of their birth.<br/>Contraception:  Method and practice of preventing conception is the fertilization of an ovum.<br/>Menstruation:   The monthly elimination of the blood filled lining of the uterus (womb), which takes about four to five days, depending on individual physiology.<br/>Ovulation:         The release of ripe egg cells from the ovary about once a month.<br/>Vasectomy:       Cutting of the vascle ferens through which the sperms reach the penis, so that they are not ejaculated.<br/>Tubalization:    Cutting of the female fallopian tube so that egg cells cannot enter the uterus.<br/><br/>\n\nFACTORS INFLUENCING THE ATTITUDE OF WOMEN TOWARDS FAMILY PLANNING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FACTORS INFLUENCING THE ATTITUDE OF WOMEN TOWARDS FAMILY PLANNING", "id": 188}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF EXERCISE AMONG PREGNANT MOTHERS IN IKWO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA EBONYI STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The study examines the perceived benefits of exercise among pregnant mothers in ikwo local government area ebonyi state and also, the outcome of exercise among pregnant women.

This reflects the need to clarify their effects for mother and fetus, as some women of childbearing age report exercising and may continue their exercise practice during pregnancy, whereas other sedentary women may start this practice only during pregnancy.<br/>As the effects of healthy lifestyle are well known andsupported by studies that show it is safe for bothmother and fetus, physical exercise is recommendedactivity for pregnant women. The American Collegeof Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendsthat all healthy pregnant women followthe American College of Sports Medicine-Centersfor Disease Control and Preventions general guidelinesfor physical exercise by engaging in 30 min ormore of moderate physical activity per day in themajority or preferably all days of the week.Women who were active before pregnancy maycontinue their activities, but change intensity andfrequency over the course of pregnancy.Other guidelines for physical exercise duringpregnancy and the postpartum period have beenpublished, such as the Canadian guidelines for exerciseduring pregnancy in 2003, and the recommendationsof the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 2006. Some researchersargue for the necessity of incorporating strengthtraining and muscle conditioning, revising the definitionof moderate exercise, and increasing theamount of vigorous intensity exercises and weeklyphysical activity expenditure.<br/>Aerobic exercise is recommended to maintain cardiovascular fitness and to help prevent chronic diseases, apart from avoiding excessive weight gain (Valim et al, 2011). They should involve large muscle groups in activities such as when walking or jogging, using stationary bicycle, treadmill, swimming, water aerobics exercises, aerobic dance, or low-impact aerobics. Regardless of the choice of activity, it is important that women find a modality of exercise to which they will adhere over the long term. Those exercises that increase the risk of falling, abdominal traumas and contacts sports should be contraindicated (Valim et al, 2011).<br/>Recent recommendations add strength training to the routine exercise of pregnant women. They suggest that light strength training during second and third trimesters does not affect newborn size or overall health. These effects have been rarely studied, although many women looking for muscle conditioning during pregnancy think that practices such as Pilates and yoga, circuit-type resistance training, and weight training could be beneficial (Artal&amp;O’Tolle, 2003). The possible benefits of increasing strength and stretching training are improvement in overall bodystrength, good posture and body core strengtheningthat may contribute in labor, birth, and prevent musculoskeletal discomforts. In addition, pelvicfloor muscle strengthening is also an importantcomponent in pregnant women’s exercise. Routineexercise is required to reduce the prevalence of urinary incontinence. Nevertheless, there is little evidence-based literature concerning thesepractices, so it should be recommended to be carefulwhen women plan to be engaged in these activities,mainly when starting only during pregnancy.Attention should also be paid in avoiding exercisein supine position during the second half ofpregnancy in order to prevent hypotension andavoid the Valsalva maneuver throughout the pregnancy.<br/>Previously, sedentary women should start with 15 min of exercise three times a week and gradually increase to 30 min four times a week at low-to moderate intensity. Active women may keep their routine exercise or perform at least moderate-to vigorous exercise four times a week in sessions of 30 min or more. Athletes or women who have higher fitness status should be evaluated individually. Some high-impact activities or sports with fall or trauma risks should be avoided, and the intensity of exercise like running should be reduced. For all, brief warm-up and cool-down periods should be incorporated to each session of exercise.<br/>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>In Nigeria, there has been increased awareness about the benefits of exercise among pregnant women. Some clinical trials have been conducted to evaluatethe effect of exercise on maternal outcome such aslow back/pelvic pain, depression during pregnancy and postpartum, gestational weight gain and excessive weight gain, gestational diabetes and insulin resistance, urinary incontinence symptoms, cardiovascular fitness, and the impact of exercise on quality of lifeand health status perception.<br/>Musculoskeletal discomforts such as lower back,pelvic, and/or joint pain are common complaintsduring pregnancy associated with the anatomicaladaptations during pregnancy and previous risks factors. However, active women were able to better handlethe condition. Musculoskeletal pain can also beattenuated with physical activity in some womenwho present mild pelvic and lumbar discomfort. So, this study is coming at the right time to assess the perception of pregnant women in Ikwo Local Government Area of Ebonyi State on the benefits of exercise during pregnancy.<br/>1.3   OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The following are the objectives of this study:<br/>    To examine the perception of pregnant women in Ikwo Local Government Area of Ebonyi State on the benefits of exercise during pregnancy.<br/>    To examine the importance and benefits of exercise among pregnant women.<br/>    To identify the outcome of exercise among pregnant women.<br/>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>    What is the perception of pregnant women in Ikwo Local Government Area of Ebonyi State on the benefits of exercise during pregnancy?<br/>    What is the importance and benefits of exercise among pregnant women?<br/>    What is the outcome of exercise among pregnant women?<br/>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The following are the significance of this study:<br/>    The result from this study will reveal the perception of pregnant women on exercise. The outcome of this study will also educate on the benefits and outcome of regular exercise by pregnant women.<br/>    This research will be a contribution to the body of literature in the area of the effect of personality trait on student’s academic performance, thereby constituting the empirical literature for future research in the subject area.<br/>1.7   SCOPE/LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY<br/>This study will cover the views of the women of Ikwo Local Government Area of Ebonyi State on exercise among pregnant women.<br/>LIMITATION OF STUDY<br/>Financial constraint- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).<br/>Time constraint- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work.

It is in light of this that Caldwell (2009) coined the term “educare”, to help widen the scope described. The new expansion of childhood now includes child minding centres for infants, kindergarten and nursery schools. Let us take our minds back to the word, ‘Kindergarten’. Can you remember? We first saw that word in our discussion on the historical background on the concept and practice of early childhood. Then we saw the word was actually coined by the German educator, Friedrich Froebel. In his conception, “kindergarten” literally means. “Child’s garden”. Internationally, “educare” or childcare in a group setting could be offered in a crèche, day-care or childcare centres, nursery and kindergarten schools. However, as previously noted, the usage of these terms varies from country to country, depending too on their philosophical inclination for the custodial nature of monitorial infant education. Importantly, early childhood education especially kindergarten or nursery goes beyond mere provision of childhood services; it also improves the general welfare of the child. It also improves the general welfare of the child. It is also in line with this that we will in this unit look at the place of child welfare in early childhood education, as well as parental role.<br/>Early childhood education in most nations is also offered in day care centres, nursery and kindergarten schools. Until recently, with increasing modernity, there were two types of nursery schools in Nigeria. These are the “Akara” school and the traditional Western-type nursery and day care centres. The first was typical of low-income families. The “Akara’ school was usually poorly organised and often run by unqualified teachers. However, in more recent times, it is fast disappearing, even though there are yet in existence, sub-standard nursery schools. Formal education for the Nigerian child actually begins in nursery school or kindergarten. Formal nursery education is described by the Nigerian National Policy on Education, (NPE, 1998:11), as that school-like activity given in an institution for children aged three to five. This is with an aim to promoting school readiness. Basically, the programmes of Nigerian early childhood education could be said to provide socialization and custodial roles, and, as most parents believe, they actually aim at giving the child a head-start in formal school, the expectation is a smooth transition to the primary stage of learning. Generally, early childhood education or pre-education in the Nigerian context includes the crèche, the nursery and the kindergarten.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>        The research which deals with the knowledge and attitude of early childhood education students towards the study of early child education as a course of study in Colben is relatively a new department in the Nigeria educational system hence there was the problem of insufficient materials in the field.<br/>        Also, another problem of the study is the poor attention giving to early child education in Nigeria by the government as early childcare education is left in the hands of the private individuals in the country. Lack of adequate funding, infrastructure is another problem of early childcare education in Nigeria.  <br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>The objective of the study is to find out the knowledge and attitude of early childhood education students towards the study of early child education in Colben in Ovia North East Local Government Area, Edo State.<br/>The specific objective includes;<br/>1.   The concept of early childhood education.<br/>2.   The importance of early childhood education Nigerian.<br/>3.   The role of parents in early childhood education.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>1.   Does students have positive attitude towards the study of early childhood education in College of Education, Ekiadolor –Benin in Ovia North East Local Government Area?  <br/>2.   Are the students aware of the importance of early childhood education?<br/>3.   Does lack of adequate facilities affect early childhood education among Colben Students?<br/>4.   Does government help to finance early childhood education in Nigeria? <br/>5.   Does early child education enhance the cognitive development of the child?<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>The study of early childhood education differ from country to country. Essentially, day care and crèches provide supervision and care for infants and young ones during the day time so that their parents can hold their jobs. This first phase of childcare and education is from birth or 3 months to 3 years. The first idea of day care centres were warm, safe environments where children could be cared for. It was also aimed at creating opportunities for these young toddlers to interact. In other words, besides the custodial roles played by day care centres and day nursery, there has been increasing evidence that young children in such centres can benefit substantially from involvement in some form of playful learning activities.<br/>Early childhood education is also important in fostering children’s cognitive and physical development. This is outside the expected custodial roles. In the same vein, the aim of childcare from birth till 3 years in Argentina centres on social and psycho-emotional development. On the other hand, Nursery schools or kindergarten actually known as Maternal Schools are designed to promote intellectual and social experiences for children. Like it is with the case in day care or day nursery, the objectives of nursery school also emphasizes social skills and at other times, there is focus on intellectual development. Significantly, for Nursery schools that follow the Montessorian ideal, the objective is to employ a carefully designed set of materials, so as to create an environment that fosters sensory, motor and language development.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY:<br/>The study is set out to determine the attitude and knowledge of students towards the study of early childhood education in College of education, Ekiadolor-Benin, Edo State. Therefore, the study is restricted only to Colben student in Ovia North East Local Government Area, Edo State.<br/>CHILD LABOUR: A CASE STUDY OF CHILDREN IN BENIN CITY<br/>ABSTRACT<br/>This study examined child labour in Edo State with focus on Benin City. This was examined on their everyday activities on the major streets and especially in the social-cultural settings in which they grew up. Oral interviews were conducted on children randomly drawn from two (2) Local Governments’ Areas in Benin City, (i.e. Oredo and Ikpoba Okha) as the sample for the study. The total number of children in the two (2) Local Government were thirty six (36) five (5) experts and adults were also interviewed. The names of the markets are Oliha market in Oredo Local Government and Oka Market in Ikpoba Okha Local Government. The research instrument used as an unstructured interview. The questions sought personal data such as name, age, home address, school etc. it also examined various aspects of the children. The findings show that many of the children suffer a lot of hardship in order to survive. The findings further reveal that majority of the children engage in hawking on the major roads, working as bus conductors, as “any work” and pushing wheel barrows I the market places. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>Chapter one       <br/>Introduction<br/>Background of the study<br/>Research question<br/>Purpose of study<br/>Significance of the study<br/>Scope of study<br/>Limitation of the study<br/>Definition of terms<br/>Chapter two       <br/>Literature review<br/>Summary<br/>Chapter three    <br/>Methodology<br/>Population of the study<br/>Sampling techniques<br/>Research instrument<br/>Validity of instrument<br/>Procedure for data collection<br/>Method of data analysis<br/>Chapter four      <br/>Analysis of data<br/>Chapter five      <br/>Summary, Conclusion and Recommendation<br/>Suggestion for further research<br/>Reference <br/>Questionnaire <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>A case of child labour in societies today is not a new phenomenon as some might have argued. According to a school of thought, child labour is not alien to our cultural values. It is part of our traditional culture whereby a child is expected to help the parents in augmenting the meager income or resources by selling or hawking farm produce like pepper, tomatoes, okro, vegetables etc on the street or in the nieighbourhood. This practice is to train child, the ability to be self sufficient and helping in giving him courage to face future challenges in marriage either as a woman or man (Adamson, 1993).<br/>Even though this line of argument is not generally acceptable among the scholar, it was however acknowledge that child labour if there has been any benefit derived by the child morally, has become a monster threatening the lives of this vulnerable, Nigerian child in the contemporary time of ours (Bouhdiba, 1982). Increased incidences of child labour in urban and metropolitan cities across Nigerian in recent times has received a lot of attention from the press, Non-governmental organization (NGO) poets, musicians, visual artist and researcher in our higher institution of learning. One of the major factors responsible for the increase according to Gwon (1991) is the distmalling of the traditional culture which by extended family system regards child care as a community responsibility but has been destroyed by capitalistic culture or orientation of our modern times. In Benin City a capital of Edo State, child labour has significantly increased from insignificantly number, it was soe years back to a worrisome state which deserves a drastic and urgent attention from all the stakeholders in child development – the parents, government and the society. Though there are no statistical figures to backup the increase, the number of children seen daily on the streets in Benin metropolis as petty hawkers, touts, bus conductors, car washers, wheel barrow pushers etc is a clear indication that the menace of child labour is gradually becoming a complex and intricate problem. It is on this basic that this project will attempt to study the daily life of children in Benin City and the traumatic experiences they pass through daily.                <br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>The purpose of this study is to investigate the daily harrowing life experiences of the children on the street of Benin City trying to eke out a living. This study was also carried out to know the extent the environment, which the children lives contributed to his predicament in terms of his psychological and personality development. It is a known fact that most parents has adjusted their responsibilities to the children hence they took the streets to fend for themselves.<br/>This study hoped to bring to the force the health hazards inherent in this act thereby enlighten the parents not to just bring the children but also make appropriates provision for their well being. Finally, the study hoped to assist the appropriate authority responsible for children welfare, to see to it that most of the identified problems are addressed thereby making the child truly a future leader responsible and capable of occupying the position the future has for him.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>Child labour is common in most part of the state capital Benin City which comprises three (3) Local Government Areas. But for the purpose of this project, two (2) Local Government Areas namely; Oredo and Ikpoba Okha Local government Area will be focused on, due to its prevalence in these areas.  <br/>SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY <br/>Child they say are the hope of tomorrow. It is therefore important and necessary to engage in efforts that will enhance their well being by drawing to their present predicaments; thereby helping the government to form formulates policies that will protect the rights of these weak members of the society in order to guarantee a better future.<br/>This project will go a long way in creating awareness among the populace of the needs to take adequate care of their children and expose the danger inherent in the works these children engaged in. it will also help in changing the perspective of some of the parent who believed that nothing is wrong in child labour since they are in support of the family or train the child to be independent.<br/>   Equally too, it will go a long way in documenting the types of child labour prevalent in Benin City and help the child welfare ministry to find appropriates solutions that will discourage the children in engaging in this act. Finally, it will serve as a document for future researchers who might be interested in the activities of the children in Benin City or other parts of the state.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Abuse: Any violation of a child’s right or anything contrary to what principals of 417 and 9 of the undeclaration of 1`959 on children is more or less child abuse.<br/> Any Work: A slang given to children running errands in the University Benin Campus for gratification.<br/>Conductor: A person who calls for the passengers and collect fares on bus.<br/>Networking: Is a process of fishing out organizations working in any area of child abuse and neglect and child welfare and linking up one another.

In the course of this study, the following research questions were developed: <br/>How profound is your knowledge I the issue of family planning? <br/>Is the general public still ignorant to the issue of family planning in this modern world? <br/>What are the effects or barriers of family planning to the society and to our self? <br/>Does family planning has any barriers on women? <br/>Has there been any proper awareness on the use of family planning in Ovia North East Local Government Area? <br/>Does the government have a role to play in the issue of family planning? <br/>A total of eighty (80) questionnaires were administered to the target audience. To test the research questions using the questionnaire, analysis of data obtained in the field was done through simple percentage, although people agreed that they are aware of family planning. However, based on these findings, it was therefore concluded that something should be done to help the programme achieve its aims, based on the findings, adequate recommendation were made.    <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE   <br/>Introduction<br/>Statement of problems<br/>Purpose of study<br/>Significance of the study<br/>Limitation<br/>Scope of the study<br/>Definition of terms<br/>CHAPTER TWO <br/>Literature review<br/>CHAPTER THREE         <br/>Research design<br/>Population<br/>Description of sample selection<br/>Research instrument<br/>Pilot study<br/>Validation of instrument<br/>Administration of instrument<br/>Method of data analysis<br/>Interview with students<br/>Chapter Four     <br/>Data Presentation and Analysis<br/>CHAPTER FIVE  <br/>Summary<br/>Recommendations<br/>Conclusion<br/>REFERENCES               <br/>QUESTIONNAIRE       <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY  <br/>Family planning has been a common problem with the developing countries in the world, due to lack of family planning the population of the developing countries using Nigeria as a typical example when unchecked increased geometrically. The lack of family planning which led to an increase in Nigeria population is as a result of lack of women education, poverty etc.<br/>It is a common observation to everybody that what we often say is a blessing could turn to be a curse as in the case of the increasing population of a country. The only way this can be prevented is through the use of birth control or family planning and this is one of the major way in which Nigeria population can be reduced. One question that always comes to my mind is that if fertility is not controlled and it grows beyond its carrying capacity, then there will be a huge problem in population control, as we all know over populations a problem to a country especially the developing countries. The above mentioned facts has led the researcher into the topic; family planning as an agent of reduction of the increasing population in Nigeria, a case study of Ovia North East Local Government Area. <br/>        It is important to know that whatsoever happens in any society always begin from the family. However, another question that can really come to mind is this. What is family planning? Though many authors has defined it in various way. Family planning is defined as a process whereby parents or couples have their children by choice and not by chance by this we mean that couples can control the number of children they want and when they want them. Though more people use family planning than ever before. More than half of the couples in the developing countries use family planning today compared with 10% in the 1960s. This dramatic increase in family planning use has caused fertility to decline much more rapidly in the developing countries and if this is achieved it can lead to the attainment of optimal population which is the best type of population in both developed countries and developing countries.  <br/>        Family planning helps save women and children’s live and preserves their health by preventing untimely and unwanted pregnancies reducing women’s exposure to health risk of child birth and abortion and giving women who are often the sole care givers more time to care for their children. As countries has modernized and become more urban and as women have achieved higher levels of education and have begun to marry late. Couples want fewer children. The growing availability of modern family planning method through the use of contraceptive such as pills, injections, intrauterine devices and sterilization etc, has made it possible for women and couples to space the births of their children and it as made it possible to have fewer children and this has help and will continue to help to reduce the over-population rate of Nigeria.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM     <br/>        Over a long period of time the issue of family planning as been neglected because so many believe that children are blessing from God and children are to be given birth by chance and not by choice which is the opposite of family planning and this as an effect on the Nigeria population.<br/>        Hence this research work is carried out in order to know if the people are still in the shadow of ignorance over the facts of family planning through the data collected and also to enlighten the populace of the importance, harmlessness of proper family planning to the society and to oneself.<br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The general purpose of this study is;<br/>To enlighten the public on the meaning of family planning.<br/>To examine the family planning facilities available<br/>To examine the benefit of family planning to Nigeria as a country to oneself.<br/>To identify the barriers attached to the use of family planning.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The findings of this study will be immensely important to all those connected with family planning control most especially the health works. Information gathered from this project will help educate the illiterate couples and also the literate couples, it will also give the general public on the importance of family planning in the society.<br/>        The researcher who will want to carry out further research into this project topic. The information available from this project will add to the pool of data or ideas to be used in planning and developing the general public. <br/>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>1.     How profound is your knowledge in the issue of family planning?<br/>2.     Is the general public still ignorant to the issue of family planning in the modern world?<br/>3.     What are the effect or barriers of family planning to the society and to our self?<br/>4.     Does family planning has any barriers on women?<br/>5.     has there been proper awareness on the use of family planning in Ovia North East Local Government Area?<br/>6.     Does the government have a role to play in the issue of family planning? <br/>1.7    SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The focus and coverage of the research work is on Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State.

These young people see selling of their bodies as the fastest way of getting income for their keeps. In the past those engaged in prostitution use to be women selling their bodies. However, today men have joined the trade of selling their bodies for different reasons including drugs, jobs or contracts and also good grades in exams. This is because sex consumers include politicians, bosses in offices, lecturers who find pleasure in exploiting the lower class by offering mouth watering opportunities in exchange for sex. (Alufohai, 2007). She further stated that some of the causes of prostitution are high level of poverty due to unemployment rate in the society, bribery and corruption. Family expectations and other problems are factors why men and women get involved in prostitution. Women most especially are pressured into the business to be able to cater for family and siblings education.<br/>Prostitution leads to the spread of STDs (sexually transmitted diseases), AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), HPV (human papiloma virus), herpes amongst others. Some women suffer trauma and pelvic pains, in most cases these women are subjected to drinking and smoking to ease off the pain and this habit could cause cancer which puts their lives in more jeopardy and increases mortality rate of the country. (Alufohai, 2007)<br/>A university don, Prof. Elizabeth Balogun, on Wednesday (2007) in Abeokuta, Ogun State, expressed her concern over the prevalence of prostitution among female undergraduates in the country. Balogun said the sex trade had become rampant on Nigerian campuses to such an extent that 80 percent of prostitutes that patronize night clubs, hotels and tourist centres in Ogun State are students of tertiary institutions. Prof. Balogun, a Biochemistry lecturer at the University of Ilorin, said this at a seminar organized by the National Association of Nigerian Students to mark its 31st anniversary where she delivered a lecture titled “Prostitution on our campuses: Effects and solutions.”<br/>The guest speaker, who expressed regret said, “It is absurd to the level that young undergraduate lady would leave normal academic chores of attending lectures and visiting libraries for further studies during the day, only to metamorphose in the evening into a call-girl or pimp. “There is no doubt that prostitution in the long run corrupts the quality of the nation’s future leaders and affects their values. Understanding that young females constitute appreciable percentage of the nation’s population, little could be expected from them productively if they had been turned into cheap sexual machines, with warped self-esteem and self- actualization. “Inordinate desire for affluence and desperation by many Nigerians, especially ladies lure them to engage in immoral and illicit activities, despite high level of religiousness which Nigerians overtly demonstrate. Even the present scourge of HIV/AIDS and the menace of ritual killers that find easy prey among prostitutes, have not been strong enough to curb the rising trend of the practice.” She urged the government to improve funding on education in order to drastically reduce cost of attaining higher education which will curb the rising trend of the practice.<br/>According to Alfred Obiora Uzokwe (2008) Prostitution is said to be one of the oldest professions in the world. It is alluded to in the bible and ancient civilizations, like Rome and Greece, had to contend with it. As I write, inspite of the penalties entrenched in the laws of most nations, against this illicit trade, it still flourishes. In most cases, though, those who engage in the trade are independent women, old enough to make decisions for themselves and willing to bear attendant repercussions. What happens, however, when prostitution becomes a pastime for young girls still dependent on their parents for subsistence? More specifically, what happens when the act of prostitution shifts from the cigarette smoke-filled rooms of brothels and the dark alleyways of major cities, to the esteemed halls of citadels of higher learning? Essentially, some of our young girls, sent to universities to acquire knowledge and become productive citizens in the nation, have found a vocation in prostitution.<br/>According to Punch Online (June 10, 2008) they now ply the trade right inside the university campuses. By day, they masquerade as students, attending classes and going to the libraries like other students but by night, they shed their academic garbs and don that of the oldest profession in the world. The Punch Online story sent cold chills down my spine and one is certain that when parents of young girls in Nigerian universities read this story, they will find themselves scampering after their children to ask some poignant questions. It goes without saying that every aspect of this news is bad for the universities as well as for the nation. Our female undergraduates are not only exposing themselves to danger, they are also mortgaging their future on the altar of quick money and instant sensual gratification. Furthermore, Nigerian universities that used to be the source of pride to those of us that passed through them, no longer bear any resemblance to the institutions we once knew. Standard of education has fallen; armed robbers and cultists have moved in and now the campuses are deluged by students-turned prostitutes.<br/>The researcher in her view said that the interest she developed in this issue stems from her belief that if not arrested, it will deal a devastating and final blow on the standard of education in Nigeria, summarily shattering, to smithereens, the moral fabric of a nation that is already in tatters. It is shocking that this malady has largely been left unchecked and is spreading like wild fire. \"The trend is ever becoming more dangerous in Nigeria today as prostitution is no longer a thing of the street and brothels but is fast turning higher institutions in the country into red light districts.<br/>Today, the Nasarawa State University is fast gaining a reputation as an abode for girls of easy going virtues despite the high prevalence of HIV/AIDs in the country and particularly in Nasarawa State. (George Okoh, 2007). He further confesses that if he had to guess where this illicit trade would be flourishing; Nasarawa State University would not have been on my list. But I guess that times have really changed immensely. Most people may be wondering why prostitution would be flourishing inside university/college campuses, under the very nose of university staff and security agents. One of the principle reasons believe, is that university campus authorities have failed to strike the right balance between ensuring student liberty and enforcement of existing campus codes of conduct. Saying that the students are adults that should know better, they let them call the shots. The problem is that with unbridled liberty and freedom, the students began to push the limits of acceptable behavior, making unrestricted foray into the sublime and dangerous. Taking advantage of the freedom bestowed on them as \"adults\", our young girls devised creative ways to trade in prostitution right inside the campuses. Investigations conducted by various newspaper correspondents’ show that the method of operation, employed by these girls, vary from campus to another and from one individual to another. The hardened ones, who see their campuses as too boring, do not operate inside the university campuses. Instead, they brazenly take their trade directly to their customers \"where the real action is\". In other words, at night, they taxi into nearby cities or towns, to hot spots that would give them maximum exposure to men willing to pay anything for sensual pleasure. Some walk the streets, when they get to town, until male customers, who are willing to patronize them, materialize. Because the girls do not fear for their safety or health, they follow the customers to their homes, brothels or nightclubs.<br/>According to Okoh, (2008) young female undergraduates of Colleges of Education, mainly between the ages of 18 to 25 years, take advantage of the proximity of their school to the major cities. The girls leave their campus dorms on Fridays, pretending to be going home for the weekend, when their actual destinations are high brow brothels, night clubs and the streets in different cities. Their sole aim is to go and pleasure, for money, men that some call \"aristo\"- a term of endearment for wealthy and powerful men. Okoh further reports that, \"In most cases, they [the girls] return back to the school, after the weekend, with large sums of money. To some of these girls, it's just having fun on the weekend but for the fact that in most times they sleep around and collect money from men they hardly know.\"<br/>        The world prostitution is the act or practice of providing sexual services to another person in return for payment. The person who receives payment for sexual services is called a prostitute and the person who receives such services is known by a multitude of terms including “John” prostitution is one of the branches of sex industry. The legal status of prostitution varies from country to country, from being a punishable crime to a regulated profession. Estimates place the annual revenue generated from the global prostitution industry to be over 100 billion. Prostitution is sometimes referred to as “the world’s oldest profession. Prostitution occurs in a variety of forms. Brothels are establishments specifically dedicated to prostitution. In escort prostitution, the act may take place at the customers’ residence or hotel room (referred to as out-call) or at the escort’ residence (called in-call). Another form in street prostitution. Sex tourism refers to traveling, typically from developed to under-developed nations of one type of human trafficking is defined as using coercion or force to transport an unwilling person into prostitution or other sexual exploitation.<br/>        Prostitute is defined from the Latin prostitute. Some sources cite the verb as a composition of “pro” meaning “up front” or “forward” and “situere” defined as to off up for sale. Another exploitation is that prostitute is a composition of pro and stature (to cause to stand to station place erect). A literal translation therefore would be to put up front for sale or to place forward. The online Etymology Dictionary states, “the notion of sex for hire is not inherent in the etymology, which rather suggests one exposed to lust or sex indiscriminately offered. The word prostitute was then carried down through various languages to the present day western society. Most sex worker activists group reject the word prostitute and since the late 1970s have used the term sex work instead. However, a sex worker can also mean anyone who works within the sex industry or whose work is of a sex nature and is not limited solely to prostitutes. In the early 17th century, there was widespread male and female prostitution throughout the cities of Isyoto, Edo and Osaka, Japan. Oiran were Courtesaus in Japan during the Edo period. The Oiran were considered a type of Yojo “woman of pleasure” or prostitute. Among the Oiran the Taju was considered the highest rank of courtesan available only to the wealthiest and highest rank of courtesaus available only to the wealthiest and highest ranking men. To entertain their client, Oiran practiced the arts of dance, music, poetry, and calligraphy as well as sexual services, and educated with was considered essential for sophisticated conversation. Many became celebrities of their times outside the pleasure district. Their art and fashion often set trends among wealthy women. The last recorded Oiran was in (1961). Although illegal in modern Japan, the definition of prostitution does not extend to a private reached between a woman and man in a brothel. Yoshiware has a large number of soap lands that began when explicit prostitution in Japan became illegal, where women washed men’s bodies. They were originally known as Toruko-buro, meaning Turkish bath. In ancient Greek society, prostitution was engaged in by both women and boys. The Greek word for prostitutes is porne derived from the verb pernemi (tonseu), with the evident modern evolution. The English word pornography, and its corollaries in other languages are directly derived from the Greek word porno. Female prostitutes could be independent and sometimes influential women.<br/>They were required to wear distinctive dresses and had to pay taxes. Some similarities have been found between the Greek hetaera and the Japanese Oiran. Some prostitutes in ancient Greece such as lais were as famous for their company as their beauty but some of these women charged extraordinary sums for their services. In ancient Rome, a registered prostitute was called a meretrix while unregistered one fell under the broad category prostibulae. There were some commonalities with the Greek system, but as the empire grew, prostitutes were often foreign slaves captured, purchased, or raised for that purpose sometimes by large scale prostitute farmers who took abandoned children. Indeed, abandoned children were almost always raised as prostitutes. Enslavement into prostitution was sometimes used as a legal punishment against criminal free women. Buyers were allowed to inspect naked men and women for sale in private and there was no stigma attached to the purchase of males by a man aristocrat.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>          Statistically, prostitution is an alarming problem to the human society. Prostitution is a form of violence against women, it is violation of human rights. With a higher instance of physical violence perpetrated        against them, female prostitutes are more likely to get murdered. This is a common occurrence across the country and contributes to the incidence of children without parents. Prostitutes have an increase incidence of sexually transmitted diseases. A study in Minecapolis, Minnesota revealed that only 15% of prostitutes who had prostituted for at least six months has an S.T.D. This figure does not include HIV/AIDS, Gynecological examination of the prostitutes in this study revealed an alarming incidence of positive pap tests. These women are at greater risk of cervical cancer and could spread the human papiloma virus among the population of the Minecapolis St. Paul Metropolitan area, either through direct transmission or indirect transmission.<br/>        The research reveals that rather than facing conditions of slavery men and women working as prostitutes are subjected to abuses which are similar in nature to those experienced by others working in low stratus jobs in the informal sector. However, the marginal position of sex workers in society excludes them from the international, national and customary protection afforded to other as citizens, workers or women. Their vulnerability to human and labor rights violations is greater than that of others because of the stigma and criminal charges widely attached to sex work. The report recommend that all national legislation which in intent or in practice results in the placing of sex workers outside the scope of the rule of law, should be repealed. The abolitionist approach declares that the institution of prostitution itself constitutes a violation of human rights. Raymond wishes to establish that all immigrant women working as prostitutes are victims f slavery and abuse. Average prostitution in Edo State was 70% female, 20%, male prostitutes and 10% customer. Whereas street prostitution accounts between 10 to 20% of the prostitution in Edo State. Research revealed that only 3-5% of the sexually transmitted diseases in Edo State relented to prostitution compared with 30-35% among teenagers. However, prevalent rate for prostitutes was approximately 50 percent in Edo State.<br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>          The purpose of the study is to investigate into the causes, prevalence and effect of female prostitution in Nigerian tertiary institutions: College of Education, Ekiadolor as a case study.<br/>        Another objective of the study is also to find out whether poverty is a major cause of female prostitution in the Nigerian tertiary institutions. <br/>1.4    HYPOTHESIS <br/>Involvement of female students in prostitution leads to poor academic performance.<br/>Personal greed leads to student involvement in prostitution.<br/>Offering sex for grades is a form of campus prostitution.<br/>Involvement in prostitution causes neglect of academic work.<br/>Many female students of College of Education, Ekiadolor engage in prostitution.<br/>The economic status of a country affects the spread of female prostitution in Nigerian tertiary institutions.<br/>The friends one move with influence one into prostitution<br/>Prostitution affects health state and results in communicable diseases.<br/>Campus prostitution is now a common business in Nigerian tertiary institutions, especially College of Education, Benin City, Edo State.<br/>Poor  financial background of parents enhances the spread of female prostitution<br/>Corruption lead to female prostitution<br/>Poverty lead to female prostitution.<br/>Female students sell their bodies to teacher/lecturers because they want to get high grades in examination.<br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>         This study will help the government to re-evaluate its previous policies about prostitution and come up with a more realistic policies and programmes.<br/>Parents will also benefit, in that it will make them to become more alive to their responsibilities.<br/>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>          The scope of this study covers the four schools in the College of Education, Ekiadolor-Benin which are school of sciences, school of arts and social sciences, school of vocational and technical studies, and school of languages.<br/>1.8    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Prostitution: The practice of engaging in relatively indiscriminate sexual activity in general with individual other than a spouse in exchange for immediate payment in cash or kind.<br/>Youth: An individual that is aged between twenty and forty.<br/>Contraceptive: A device, drug or chemical agent that is intended to prevent conception.<br/>Abortion: It involves force termination of pregnancy by drugs or any other means.<br/>Venereal diseases: It refers to those diseases got from sexual intercourse.<br/>AIDS: Acquire Immune Deficiency Syndrome.<br/>HIV: Human Immuno Deficiency Virus.<br/>  <br/><br/>\n\nAN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES, PREVALENCE AND EFFECT OF FEMALE PROSTITUTION IN NIGERIA TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS:  COLLEGE OF EDUCATION, EKIADOLOR-BENIN AS A CASE STUDY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES, PREVALENCE AND EFFECT OF FEMALE PROSTITUTION IN NIGERIA TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS:  COLLEGE OF EDUCATION, EKIADOLOR-BENIN AS A CASE STUDY", "id": 192}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE ROLE OF SOCIAL WELFARE SERVICES ON BROKEN HOMES A CASE STUDY OF OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE.<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This study was carried out in order to find out the role of social welfare services on broken homes in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo state.       The idea of this investigation is to expose the form of social welfare services in the Local Government, the utilization of the available services and the awareness of the people on the available social welfare service in the Local Government.

Where female children dominate in marriage, less attention are given to those children are sending them to school or paying of school fees and provision of material or school requirement are problem.<br/>        According to Paul (2006) says that another factors that can lead to broken home is polygamy where the man marries more than one which lead to having many children. The first wife to be neglected  due to unhealthy rivary from other women and lack of love from their spouse ,pack out of such homes undermining the consequences on their children.<br/>        In broken homes, children hardly related well with their parents, this can affect them emotionally and psychologically. Broken homes or pre-mature separation if allowed to persist for a long time it can lead girls to grow up anxious and neurotic, while boys can be bullies and delinquent. This is why social welfare services are needed so as to ease family relations problems and such family problem like broken home.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>        In the society today, issue of broken homes have becomes controversial and this constitute a social problem. My strong emphasis is on Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>        Majority of the people are mainly illiterates, this situation constitute a problem that harbor some element of superstitions. Some men believe that once their wives or wife cannot give birth to male child, the next thing is to look for another wife not knowing that the fact is the male that determines the sex of a child and not the female.<br/>        Also in a family where we have polygamy in operation, the husband tend to show more love to one wife not minding what the reaction of the other wife or wives would be, this action brings separation among family and can cause broken home.<br/>        Some people are suspicious of the services rendered by the social welfare agents and they see no reason why such people should interfere in their family problems.<br/>        Some are not willing to co-operate at all because they felt that social welfare services are a mere waste ones time.<br/>        In course of this study we shall consider the role of social welfare services on broken homes.<br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>Broken home is a major problem in our society today as it has a lot of effect on the child and his general achievement in life. The home is the bedrock of the child’s socialization processes. A child starts to learn about life as soon as he comes into this world.<br/>As a social animal the child does not learn in a vacuum but rather he actively learn in a society of human beings who influence his progress.

The lack of family planning which led to an increase in Nigeria population is as a result of lack of women education, poverty etc.<br/>It is a common observation to everybody that what we often say is a blessing could turn to be a curse as in the case of the increasing population of a country. The only way this can be prevented is through the use of birth control or family planning and this is one of the major way in which Nigeria population can be reduced. One question that always comes to my mind is that if fertility is not controlled and it grows beyond its carrying capacity, then there will be a huge problem in population control, as we all know over populations a problem to a country especially the developing countries. The above mentioned facts has led the researcher into the topic; family planning as an agent of reduction of the increasing population in Nigeria, a case study of Oredo Local Government Area. <br/>        It is important to know that whatsoever happens in any society always begin from the family. However, another question that can really come to mind is this. What is family planning? Though many authors has defined it in various way. Family planning is defined as a process whereby parents or couples have their children by choice and not by chance by this we mean that couples can control the number of children they want and when they want them. Though more people use family planning than ever before. More than half of the couples in the developing countries use family planning today compared with 10% in the 1960s. This dramatic increase in family planning use has caused fertility to decline much more rapidly in the developing countries and if this is achieved it can lead to the attainment of optimal population which is the best type of population in both developed countries and developing countries. <br/>        Family planning helps save women and children’s live and preserves their health by preventing untimely and unwanted pregnancies reducing women’s exposure to health risk of child birth and abortion and giving women who are often the sole care givers more time to care for their children. As countries has modernized and become more urban and as women have achieved higher levels of education and have begun to marry late. Couples want fewer children. The growing availability of modern family planning method through the use of contraceptive such as pills, injections, intrauterine devices and sterilization etc, has made it possible for women and couples to space the births of their children and it as made it possible to have fewer children and this has help and will continue to help to reduce the over-population rate of Nigeria.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM     <br/>        Over a long period of time the issue of family planning as been neglected because so many believe that children are blessing from God and children are to be given birth by chance and not by choice which is the opposite of family planning and this as an effect on the Nigeria population.<br/>        Hence this research work is carried out in order to know if the people are still in the shadow of ignorance over the facts of family planning through the data collected and also to enlighten the populace of the importance, harmlessness of proper family planning to the society and to oneself.<br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The general purpose of this study is;<br/>To enlighten the public on the meaning of family planning.<br/>To examine the family planning facilities available<br/>To examine the benefit of family planning to Nigeria as a country to oneself.<br/>To identify the barriers attached to the use of family planning.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The findings of this study will be immensely important to all those connected with family planning control most especially the health works. Information gathered from this project will help educate the illiterate couples and also the literate couples, it will also give the general public on the importance of family planning in the society.<br/>        The researcher who will want to carry out further research into this project topic. The information available from this project will add to the pool of data or ideas to be used in planning and developing the general public. <br/>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>1.     How profound is your knowledge in the issue of family planning?<br/>2.     Is the general public still ignorant to the issue of family planning in the modern world?<br/>3.     What are the effect or barriers of family planning to the society and to our self?<br/>4.     Does family planning has any barriers on women?<br/>5.     has there been proper awareness on the use of family planning in Oredo Local Government Area?<br/>6.     Does the government have a role to play in the issue of family planning? <br/>1.7    SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The focus and coverage of the research work is on Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State. It examines the significance of family planning as an agent of population reduction in Nigeria. The research selected the following communities for the study;<br/>Ugbowo, Ekiadolor<br/>Oluku<br/>Iguosa and Idowina. All in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.   <br/>1.9    DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Family Planning: It can be define as a situation whereby couples decides to have their children by choice and not by chance.<br/>Agent: In this context agent means a force that causes a change.<br/>Contraceptive: A device or drug serving to prevent pregnancy.<br/>Population: Is the total number of people who live in a particular area, city or country.<br/>Control: The power to make decision about how country an area, an organization is run.<br/>Increasing: To make greater in amount or value.<br/>  <br/><br/>\n\nSIGNIFICANCE OF FAMILY PLANNING IN THE CONTROL OF INCREASING POPULATION IN NIGERIA: A CASE STUDY OF OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " SIGNIFICANCE OF FAMILY PLANNING IN THE CONTROL OF INCREASING POPULATION IN NIGERIA: A CASE STUDY OF OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE", "id": 194}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EDUCATING THE GIRL CHILD IN A POLYGAMOUS FAMILY IN NIGERIA: A CASE STUDY OF OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The purpose of this study is to attempt to find the role polygamous play in the performance of a child especially the girl child. This question has raised other questions for varying reasons. And scholars in education and psychology have attempted to proffer a solution in this regard which would lead to good performance of the child educationally. To help solve this question some statement were drawn up such as: (1) in a polygamous home educa5ion of the girl child is not often given top priority. (2) Having many children in a polygamous home affects the educational prospect of the girl child. (3) in polygamous homes parental motivation and supervision are lacking the methodology of this study shows statistics comprehension of the research based on the data collected. Data collected were analyzed with the instrument of a percentage. The last chapter is a summary of the work conclusion and recommendations of the project. From the findings, some recommendations were made such as; (1) it is recommended that people should be practicing monogamy. Even if polygamous is to be practiced. It should be for the wealth group who has the needed recourse to career for the well-being of individual family. (2) on the part of the government, the public should be enlightened at regular intervals on how to live happily in a family. Government should also make people to be aware of the implication of polygamous system of marriage.  <br/>    TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>Chapter One<br/>Background of the study <br/>Statement of the problem<br/>Purpose of the study<br/>Significance of the study<br/>Scope of the study<br/>Basic assumption<br/>Chapter Two      <br/>Literature review<br/>Chapter Three<br/>Methodology<br/>Research Method<br/>Population of the study<br/>Sample/Sampling techniques<br/>Research Instrument<br/>Method of administration<br/>Method of data analysis<br/>Chapter Four<br/>Data analysis<br/>Discussion of the findings<br/>Chapter Five      <br/>Summary, Recommendations and Conclusion<br/>Summary<br/>Recommendations<br/>Conclusions<br/>References<br/>Questionnaire    <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>        In the context of human society, a  family (from latin word familia) is a group of people affiliated by consanguinity (by recognized birth), affinity (by marriage) or co-residence and/or shared consumption (see nurture kinship). Members of the immediate family includes, spouses, parents, brothers, sisters, sons and/or daughters. Members of the extended family may include grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, nieces and/or siblings-in-law.<br/>In most societies, the family is the principal institution for the socialization of children. As the basic unit for raising children anthropologists generally classify most family organization as multifocal (a mother and her children); conjugal (a husband, his wife, and children also called nuclear family) a avuncular (for example, a grandparents, a brother, his sister and her children) or extended parents and children co-reside with other members of one parents family. Sexual relations among the members are regulated by rules concerning incest such as the incest taboo.<br/>Family is used metaphorically to create more inclusive categories such as community nationhood, global village and humanism. Generally is a field which aims to trace family lineages through history. Family is also an important economic unit studied in family economic. One of the primary functions of the family involves providing a framework for the production and reproduction of persons, biologically and/or socially. This can occur through the sharing of materials/substances (such as food), the giving and receiving of care and nurture (nurture kinship) jural rights and obligation and moral and sentimental ties. Thus ones experience of ones family shifts over time. From the perspective of children, the family is a “family of orientation”. The family serves to locate children socially and plays a major role in their enculturation and socialization. From the point of view of the parents(s) the family is a family of procreation, the goal of which is to produce and enculturation and socialize children. However, producing children is not the only function of the family in societies with a sexual division of labor, marriage, and the resulting relationship between two people, it is necessary for the formation of an economically productive household.<br/>Christopher Harris notes that the western conception of family is ambiguous, and confused with the household, as revealed in the different contexts in which the word is used and so many. There are different types of family units which are monoigamo8us and polygamous are inclusive. Monogamous family is based on legal or social monogamy. In this case, an individual has only one (official) partner during their life’s time or at any one time (serial monogamy). This means that a person may not have several different legal spouses at the same time, as this is usually prohibited by bigamy laws, in jurisdictions that require monogamous marriages.<br/>Polygamous family unit is a marriage that includes more than two partners when a man is married to more than one wife at a time, the relationship is called polygamy, and when woman is married to more than one husband at a time, it is called polyandry. If a marriage includes multiple husband and wives, it can be called polygamy, group or conjoint marriage. The effect of this marriage on the girl child is what the researcher is basing her research. This type of marriage is preferred in Nigeria, particularly, Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>Polygamy is the type of marriage system practiced in t he traditional Africa society whereby a man takes more than one wife at the same time. It is practiced because of the prestige it accorded a man, in the society in which he lives. Religiously, most religion encouraged the practice of marrying more than one wife for instance in slam you are encouraged to marry as many wives as you can, depending on your purchasing power.   <br/>1.2    HISTORICAL BACKGROUND <br/>        Oredo local government area is situated in the middle region of Edo state, politically Oredo is divided into nine villages or clans and has produced a lot of political figures in the state and the country in general, and Benin City is the administrative headquarter of Oredo local government area. The dwellers are the original producer of staple food such as cassava maize, yam, cocoa, etc. the Oba of Benin Omo Noba Nedo Uku Akpolokpolo Oba Erediauwa, Chief Sam igbe who is the Iyase of Benin Kingdom Late Chief Engineer Ima Igiehon, who was the Obayhayomwn of Benin Kingdom, Chief Gabriel Osawaru Igbinedion the Esama of Benin Kingdom , Prince Adun Akanzua and many other prominent princes and chiefs. It has an area of 249km2 and a population of 374, 671 at the 2006 census. The postal code of the area is 300.<br/>1.3    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>        In every societies of the world there are some specific structure designated to meet the immediate nee3d of the society consequent upon this is Oredo settlement she has a robust nature of socialization which clearly defines the role of both sexes (male and female). Over the years position of women in Nigeria societies, especially in Oredo, has not be given a serious concern. The girl child’s education has not be given the priority attention especially in the polygamous family. She contributes to languish in social inequality (such as education) and relegated to the background. The resultant effect of this lack of fortune, the girl child is not given adequate attention she is retorted to both growth and development; this is as a result of the unhealthy waling that existed in polygamous family there are always constant quarrels, hatred, disunity, hostility as well as diabolism. Another striking effect inherent in weak or mismanagement of polygamous family is the audience of a broken home.<br/>1.4    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  <br/>        The purpose of this study is to identify the effects of polygamous family unit on the child education in Oredo local government area. To highlight the factors which gave rise to polygamous family unit, to offer suggestion that will bring about lasting solution to this menace and eventual happiness to both men and women, to educate parents on the need for educating the girl child.<br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>        The importance of the study will be of immense benefit to the following: the married women because they are majority involved in this type of marriage the opinion of the parents about the education of girl in a polygamous family unit in Oredo local government area of Edo state the findings of the re3search will be carefully analyzed and interpreted through the data collected and solution will be provided to a given problems.<br/>1.7    RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>        In order to achieve the objective of the study of the following questions were raised to know whether or not they affect the att6itude of polygamous parents on the education of girls.<br/>Why do men involve in polygamous?<br/>What are the effects of this type of marriage on a girl child?<br/>How will people avoid the negative effect posed by such marriage?<br/>What happens to such family when the man dies/<br/>Do you think educated parent will indulge themselves in polygamous?<br/>1.8    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>EDUCATION: Is the totality of processes through which an individual acquires knowledge, skills, attitude and abilities which enable him or her to positively contribute towards the meaningful development of the society.

According to Oichl and Datrymple (2009) when more than 50% of a community population are immunized against a disease, the possibility of epidemic is removed. Supporting this view, Ogbuibe (2005) pointed out that the entry point to be fill introduction of all elements of primary health care system, immunization against diseases in one of the fairly they elements of the child’s survival and development. The national programme of immunization was for certain target groups of the population mainly children within the large group of 0-2 years and pregnant mothers or women. It is target against the six deadly and childhood diseases. These diseases are tuberculosis, measles, poliomyelitis, tetanus, chicken pox and whooping cough. The high rate of mortality from disease preventable by immunization underscores the need for immunization was the most effective programme to reduce these diseases for which satisfactory immunization procedures have been established.<br/>When a disease is peculiar to certain area, health authorities may recommend immunization of all persons in that area particularly those who are likely to be exposed to it. To buttress this view, Anderson (2000) suggested that mass immunization against typhoid fever is not advocated but if an epidemic occurs in a community, health authorities may implore all susceptible persons to be immunized. The success of any immunization programme depends largely on the target population. It is pertinent to note that mothers are the persons in the issues of the children rearing pattern in our society whereby the mothers rather than fathers are the home keepers and know better about their children’s immunization status. Therefore, all children should be protected. All mothers should understand the importance of immunization to ensure this, Sohem (2005) recommended the vaccination of all new born children should be registered at all health clinics for routine immunization. This entails that they should undergo all stages of immunization.<br/>According to the oxford advanced learners dictionary (2004), immunization is the process of protecting an individual or animal from a disease especially by giving them an injection or a vaccine. Immunization is also defined as a process by which human beings protect themselves from, or against deadly diseases such as poliomyelitis, measles, tuberculosis, diphtheria, whooping cough, vaccination is also another name for immunizing living things against deadly diseases. Immunization is done to make the body resist invasion of pathogenic microbes like bacteria, protozoa and virus. In immunization, a small quantity of a dead parasitic organism is injected into the body of a healthy person (somebody that is free from that parasite organism), the body recognized the antigen as foreign response by realizing specialized protein called antibodies. These antibodies have specific protective properties and the body become immune against the disease that are caused by micro-organisms. Immunization can be active, positive, natural, or acquired.<br/>        Immunization is the act of protecting someone against a disease by the intake of inoculation of vaccine or other protective agents which stimulate natural body resistance. It could be active or passive. Immunization is the active which involves administering agents which stimulates the receivers’ own immunological mechanism who responds by producing reactions in his resistance to infect by the organisms from which the antigen was derived or obtained. This takes several weeks to produce effective protection hence, it has a prophylactic value but last forever. On the other hand, immunization is said to be passive by the giving of already made anti-bodies formed by another lost in response to natural injection. This has immediate protective and therapeutic value but last for a short period.<br/>        Parent especially the mothers in question do not get their children immunized. The superstition belief or idea that disease are caused by witches and wizards are strongly rooted in their mind, some believes that diseases are caused by evil spirit and the only way out for them to avoid it is by offering sacrifice and some believe that it is the sin that the parents have committed towards the gods that make the child to be like that and there is no solution to the sickness of the child.<br/>        Some parent know where and how to obtain it but do not take their children to the clinic for immunization while others that made attempts to take their children to the clinic for immunization may start and will not complete the normal dose they are supposed to give to that child. In a particular health center, i.e. Ikpoba Okha Health center in Edo State, between January 2007 to December 2010, fifty six thousand six hundred and forty two (56,642) children were registered for different types of immunization. Out of these only thirty four thousand six hundred and twenty two (34, 622) children completed their immunization, the remaining twenty two thousand and twenty (22,020) fall to complete their immunization. Some mothers later brought their children to complete their immunization after a long time. When they asked them why they did not bring their children ever since, the most population reason they gave was that, they were not chanced due to their jobs. They devoted much time to their jobs e.g. trading, government workers etc others said they came several times but in most occasions, the nurses asked them to go home that the health of their babies was poor.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>        The decision to carry out the study was due to the problem associated with immunization of children among the illiterate mothers in Esan West Local Government Area. In the past, many children died before the age of 5 or before the school age due to communicable diseases e.g. tuberculosis, diphtheria, poliomyelitis, whooping cough, measles, tetanus etc. they did not know that these disease could be prevented. These communicable disease were discovered by scientific researcher, clinics are established where the disease can be  prevented by treatment. Many people are not still making use of the clinic and health center, perhaps due to ignorance, inability of mothers to get the facilities or non availability of vaccine or lack of understanding.<br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY   <br/>        This research work is an attempt to study the attitude of mothers towards immunization in Esan West Local Government Area in Edo State. The purpose of this study is to:<br/>To find out why mothers refused to bring their children for immunization<br/>To know why some mothers started but refuse to complete the normal schedule<br/>To know or find out how many children register in the clinic and health center for the immunization during the period of January 2010 to December 2010.<br/>To know the number of children who started the immunization and completed the normal schedule<br/>To know the number of children that started the immunization but refuse to complete it.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY    <br/>        This research is expected to be of great importance to parents and the general public in Esan West Local Government Area who will appreciate the implication of the problem of immunization and know the best way to handle them. The study conducted was done to aid the following group of people.<br/>The mothers<br/>The health center<br/>Ministry of health, Edo State.<br/>The Mothers: The mother will be advice properly on what they should do. The information gathered will be of great importance which may change mother’s attitudes towards immunization programme.<br/>The health center: The suggestion made will be used as a source of correction measure to health persons on one way or the other may have contributed to the lukewarm attitude of mothers when they bring their children for immunization through health education and lack of follow up visit to trace defaulters.<br/>Ministry of health, Edo State: The findings may serve as a clue for Edo State Ministry of health to make better plan by making of health to make better plan by making adequate provision of vaccine and training more people into the health sector to promote child immunization in Edo State.<br/>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTIONS    <br/>        Based on the assumption made, the following research questions are postulated.<br/>Does ignorance of mothers contribute to their attitude towards immunization?<br/>Does lack of immunization lead to death of children?<br/>Do mother get actively involved and delighted in the immunization of the children?<br/>Does the behaviour of health workers affect mothers in the immunization of their children?<br/>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY   <br/>        This is restricted to the attitude of mothers towards immunization in some selected health centres in Esan West Local Government Area of Edo State. The sample population is made up of mothers who were selected by simple random process.<br/>1.8    DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Health: The state of well being physically and mentally.<br/>Health Center: A building where group of doctors, nurses and health workers see their patients.<br/>Mothers: A female parent of a child.<br/>Child: A young human who is not yet an adult.<br/>Immunization: To protect a person or an animal from disease or an animal from disease especially by giving them an injection or a vaccine.<br/>Measles: An infectious disease especially of children that cause fever and small red spots that cover the whole body.<br/>Tuberculosis: A serious infectious disease in which swellings appear on the lungs and other part of the body.<br/><br/>\n\nPROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH IMMUNIZATION OF CHILDREN AMONG THE ILLITERATE MOTHERS IN ESAN WEST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH IMMUNIZATION OF CHILDREN AMONG THE ILLITERATE MOTHERS IN ESAN WEST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA ", "id": 196}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>STREET TRADING AND RAPE IN OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE: CAUSES AND EFFECT<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Street trading and rate, the causes and the effect in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.

Any critical observer of Nigerians socio-economic condition will agree that the living condition of some people are below standard. It can be observed that majority of these street trading are exposed to danger, for instance female street vendors frequently become victims of rate, this is dangerous because forced sexual activity may cause infection that may cause irreparable damage to her reproductive system. This project therefore will examine street trading and rape in Oredo Local government Area of Edo State.<br/>        Oredo Local Government Area is one of the three local government areas that make up the state capital, Benin City with its administrative headquarter at king square in the city centre. The people there are mostly sole proprietors, small scale traders and also street traders and as such could not afford large scale enterprises, hence they embrace little that can yield income for them to cater for themselves and families. Some examples of the traders done on street are;<br/>1)   Sales of recharge cards<br/>2)  Mini provision kiosks<br/>3)  Retail shops<br/>4)  Selling of corn<br/>5)  Roasting of plantain (i.e. bole). Etc.<br/>Street trading according to Uwoyo (1995) is a trade done on a public road in city, town or village. It is as a result of low financial status of the people with the inability of creating lager business enterprises that can yield good income street trading in Oredo Local Government Areas is mostly caused by poverty. For example; a commercial motorcyclist popularly known as Okada Riders, with a family if 6 (six) children and whose wife finds it difficult to use the money gotten from his Okada Business to cater for his family will set up a little sole proprietorship business or give his wife little money to open any street trade to help the family. However in another view by Nwoyo (2005), street trading can also be caused by lack of education, high birth rate, frustration, etc.<br/>        Okeyo (1998) gave the following as the main criteria used to describe street trading:<br/>1)   It is usually sited on streets<br/>2)   It is usually a sole proprietorship business<br/>3)   Financial strength<br/>4)   Scale of value<br/>5)   Relative size and initial capital outlay<br/>Basically, as a manifestation of various attempts by the developing world to chart the course of new economic growth and development, it is also vital to note the prospects; Ogoke (2005) explained that in Nigeria, street trading constitutes the largest proportion of societal trade sector.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM   <br/>This work is designed to show the causes and the effect of rape.<br/>To examine the factor responsible for rape.<br/>This research work is also designed to suggest workable solution to the problems of street trading and rape.<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>To examine the factors responsible for street trading<br/>To enlighten people about the effect of street trading and rape.<br/>To bring government attention to street trading.<br/>To proffer solution to these factors responsible for street trading and rape.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS  <br/>1)   What are the causes of street trading?<br/>2)   Does street trading effects the people in Oredo Local Government?<br/>3)   What are the reasons for rape<br/>4)   How can street trading be minimized in Oredo Local Government Area.<br/>5)   What are the role of parents in street trading?<br/>6)   What are the role of government in the street trading?  <br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY  <br/>          The major significance of this study is to proffer solution to the menace of street trading and rape in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State. it is hoped that the study will help in minimizing problems associated with street trading and will increase the body of knowledge on the operation of street trading which is in form of sole Proprietorship business, it is also helped that the study will be useful to economic planners, sole proprietors, street traders and decision makers.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>        This research work is limited to Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.

According to a school of thought, child labour is not alien to our cultural values. It is part and parcel of our traditional culture where by a child is expected to help the parent in augmenting the meager income or resources by selling or hawking farm produce like pepper, tomatoes, okro, vegetable etc on the street or in the neighborhood. This practices is to train child, the ability is to be sufficient and helping in giving him courage to face future challenges in marriage either as a woman of a man.<br/>Even Though this line of argument is not generally acceptable among the scholar, it was however acknowledged that child labour if there has been any benefit derived by the child morally, has become monster threatening the lives of these vulnerable, Nigeria child in the contemporary time of ours.<br/> Increased incidence of child labour in urban and metropolitan cities across Nigeria in record. Times have received a lot of attention from the press, no Governmental organization (N. G. O) poets, musicians visual artist and researchers is our higher institution of learning. One of the major factors responsible for the increase according to Gwon (1991-23) is the dissembling of the traditional culture which by extended family system regards child care as a community responsibility but has been destroyed by capitalistic culture or orientation of our modern times.<br/>In Benin City, a capital of Edo state, child labour has significantly increased from insignificant number, it was some years back to worrisome which deserves a drastic and urgent attention from all the stake Holden’s in child development the parents, government and the society. Though there is no statistical figures to back up the increase, the number of children see daily on the streets in Benin metropolis as path hawkers, touts, bus conductors, car washers, wheelbarrow pushers etc is a clear indication that the menace of child labour is gradually becoming a complex and intricate problem.<br/>It is on this basis that this project will attempt to study the daily life of children in Benin City and the traumatic experiences they pass through daily.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>        The issue of child labour in Edo State with special focus on Benin City in general has some problems associated with it in this project the researcher intends to  identify the problems and strategies of solving them in doing this the following question are to  guide;<br/>What are the roles of government in child labour?  <br/>What are the effects of child labour in the society?<br/>What are the roles of the parents in child labour?<br/>What are the ways child labour can be eradicated?<br/>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>        The aims and objective of this study is to investigate the issues of child labour and also provide solutions to the problem of child labour in Edo State with special focus on Benin City.<br/>To investigate the causes of child labour<br/>To provide information on the effect of child labour<br/>To investigate the role of government in child labour.<br/>To provide infor5mation on how to minimize child labour.<br/>To find out the role of parents in child labour.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>        Child they say are the hope of tomorrow.

The concept of family planning is used interchangeably with contraceptives. There are many different types of family planning methods which have so far been developed for the purpose of preventing conception. The current methods in existence have been categorized in to five groups. Firstly, we have “hormonal methods” which are currently being regarded as the most common methods of birth control. (Sai F. 2004). Hormonal methods which appear in the form of Birth control pill, Depo-provera, Lunelle, Vaginal ring all contain manufactured forms of the hormones Estrogen and or Progesterone. All the different types containing the mentioned hormones work in three ways; firstly by preventing woman’s ovaries from releasing an egg each month; secondly by causing the cervical mucus to thicken making it hard for sperm to reach and penetrate the egg and lastly by thinning the lining of the uterus which reduces the likelihood that a fertilized egg will implant in the uterus wall. (Williamson L.M, ParkesA. Wight D. Petticre M; Hart G, 2009)<br/>The second category of birth control methods is “barrier methods”. These family planning methods work by physically preventing sperm from entering the female reproductive system. These devices include Male condom, Female condom, Spermicides, Diaphragm, Cervical cap and Contraceptive sponge. The third category of birth control method is “withdrawal” and “sterilization”. Withdrawal involves the removal of the erect penis from the vagina prior to ejaculation; on the other hand sterilization involves the surgical closing, tying or blocking of the fallopian tube so eggs cannot travel through the uterus. There also exists male sterilization which is the surgical closing of tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the penis.<br/>The forth category of birth control methods is abstinence. As a means of conception, abstinence is the voluntary refraining from sexual intercourse. This method is regarded as the only family planning method that is 100% effective in the prevention of both pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. The last category of birth control methods is the fertility awareness method which is often called “natural family planning”. Apart from abstinence and withdrawal method, this is the third method that does not rely on devices or medication to prevent pregnancy. The natural family planning method uses the natural functions of the female body and menstrual cycle to calculate ovulation. It requires abstinence from sexual intercourse during the ovulation period. (Williamson L.M, ParkesA. Wight D. Petticre M; Hart G, 2009).<br/>According to Gribble J and Haffey, J. (2008) Demographers regard withdrawal and abstinence as traditional methods while the other methods are regarded as modern methods of contraception. The vast majority of the African countries and national governments encourage citizens to make use of available family planning methods to promote small family sizes and prevent unwanted pregnancies. All these come as an overall initiative to slow population growth and avoid some of the consequences of population growth.<br/>A combination of good access to family planning services and increased family planning use has led to a decline in fertility rates in Southern India and Sri Lanka. Access to good quality, voluntary family planning services and increasingly higher levels of family planning awareness are credited for supporting declines in family sizes. For fertility to fall to low levels, many factors are key, this include a significant increase in the use of family planning. Sufficient evidence exist to show that the high fertility in the African continent is not because women in Africa want to have more children than women in other regions; the skewed rates I argue reflect the prevalence of family planning use as well as challenges in accessing family planning services in this particular region. Clearly most people in developed countries want and are having smaller families than in the past. This development has been greatly helped by the wider availability of high quality, safe and affordable family planning services in some regions. However the opposite is observed in some other regions such as Africa; many people are still having more children than they want. (Gribble J.; Haffey James 2000)<br/>The 2008 estimates indicated that sub-Saharan Africa had about 14 million unintended pregnancies, with almost half occurring among women aged 15-25 years. Today, there are 24.8 percent of women who want to use family planning but lack access leaving them with no other options but to continue having unwanted pregnancies. According to the Millennium Development Goals report, one in four women who wish to delay or stop child bearing is not using any family planning method. Achieving the desired population growth rates will require expanded access to family planning especially in the poorest countries. People regardless of their age must have access to a wide range of family planning methods at all stages of their reproductive lives. The impact access to family planning has on the rate of fertility in sub-Saharan Africa is of vital importance; it therefore requires urgent attention from national governments. The African continent should bear in mind that the more women use family planning, the less fertility rate, natural increase and growth rate in Africa. (Dodoo, F. N 2001).<br/>Family planning has been a common problem with the developing countries in the world, due to lack of family planning the population of the developing countries using Nigeria as a typical example when unchecked increased geometrically. The lack of family planning which led to an increase in Nigeria population is as a result of lack of women education, poverty etc.<br/>It is a common observation to everybody that what we often say is a blessing could turn to be a curse as in the case of the increasing population of a country. The only way this can be prevented is through the use of birth control or family planning and this is one of the major way in which Nigeria population can be reduced. One question that always comes to my mind is that if fertility is not controlled and it grows beyond its carrying capacity, then there will be a huge problem in population control, as we all know over populations a problem to a country especially the developing countries. The above mentioned facts has led the researcher into the topic; family planning as an agent of reduction of the increasing population in Nigeria, a case study of Oredo Local Government Area. <br/>        It is important to know that whatsoever happens in any society always begin from the family. However, another question that can really come to mind is this. What is family planning? Though many authors has defined it in various way. Family planning is defined as a process whereby parents or couples have their children by choice and not by chance by this we mean that couples can control the number of children they want and when they want them. Though more people use family planning than ever before. More than half of the couples in the developing countries use family planning today compared with 10% in the 1960s. This dramatic increase in family planning use has caused fertility to decline much more rapidly in the developing countries and if this is achieved it can lead to the attainment of optimal population which is the best type of population in both developed countries and developing countries. <br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM     <br/>        Over a long period of time the issue of family planning as been neglected because so many believe that children are blessing from God and children are to be given birth by chance and not by choice which is the opposite of family planning and this as an effect on the Nigeria population.<br/>        Hence this research work is carried out in order to know if the people are still in the shadow of ignorance over the facts of family planning through the data collected and also to enlighten the populace of the importance, harmlessness of proper family planning to the society and to oneself.<br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The general purpose of this study is;<br/>To enlighten the public on the meaning of family planning.<br/>To examine the family planning facilities available<br/>To examine the benefit of family planning to Nigeria as a country to oneself.<br/>To identify the barriers attached to the use of family planning.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The findings of this study will be immensely important to all those connected with family planning control most especially the health works. Information gathered from this project will help educate the illiterate couples and also the literate couples, it will also give the general public on the importance of family planning in the society.<br/>        The researcher who will want to carry out further research into this project topic. The information available from this project will add to the pool of data or ideas to be used in planning and developing the general public. <br/>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTION<br/>1.     How profound is your knowledge in the issue of family planning?<br/>2.     Is the general public still ignorant to the issue of family planning in the modern world?<br/>3.     What are the effect or barriers of family planning to the society and to our self?<br/>4.     Does family planning has any barriers on women?<br/>5.     has there been proper awareness on the use of family planning in Oredo Local Government Area?<br/>6.     Does the government have a role to play in the issue of family planning? <br/>1.7    SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The focus and coverage of the research work is on Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.

Some literatures were consulted and reviewed. The instrument for data collection was questionnaire methods, using 200 respondents. The data was analyzed using percentage method, it was found among others that family planning had an effect on population control and that workers are effective in educating parents on the importance of family planning etc. consequently, the following recommendations were made such as couples are encouraged to go for family planning as a way of controlling birth population. An enlightenment campaign should be carried out to sensitize parents on the importance of family planning. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE  <br/>Introduction<br/>Statement of the problem<br/>Research questions<br/>Purpose of the study<br/>Significance of the study<br/>Scope of the study   <br/>Operational definition of terms<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Literature review<br/>CHAPTER THREE      <br/>Research methodology<br/>Research design<br/>Data collection<br/>Population of the study<br/>Sample and sampling procedure<br/>Instrumentation<br/>Validity<br/>Method of data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR        <br/>Data analysis and discussion<br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>Summary<br/>Conclusion<br/>Recommendations<br/>REFERENCES    <br/>QUESTIONNAIRE     <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>        According to Nelson (2001), he sees family planning as a system of limiting family size and the frequency of child bearing by the appropriate use of contraceptive techniques. On the issue of health, Lawrence, (2006) on his own sees family planning as a health service that keeps couples decide whether to have children and if so, when and how many. Telling on the population size of any location. Frederick (2004) writes that “the population size of any location is the ratio of the sum total of the number of persons in an area to the size of the area they occupied per square M2.<br/>        The family is known to comprise of the father, mother and the children. The numbers of children given birth to by each family residing in any locality has either negative or positive impact on the overall population size in such geographical location. Apart from the above definitions of family planning, the writers see family planning as the process of controlling the number of children you have by using contraception.<br/>        Family planning and the problems of population control have been a major concern to both the government and individuals over the years, Nigeria in general and Edo State in particular have been experiencing a geometric increase in population and as a result government budget  and revenue allocation have equally increased. Sincerely speaking, for some couples of years back, Edo State government had made several efforts, especially at the grass root to sensitize people on the needs in family planning in addition to providing adequate basic facilities to meet the needs of the dwellers, it is annoying to see that all these efforts have not yielded positive results. This negatively could be as a result of illiteracy on the parts of the parents.<br/>        Autchinson in Osula, (2000) stated some other reasons for the alarming increase in population. The ever increasing population size is encouraged by several factors such as (i) problems of child spacing (ii) unwanted pregnancy resulting from frustrated youths (iii) pursuance of money (prostitutions)” etc it was in a bid to check this ugly situation that Edo State government is been using mass media, television, radio, workshop, seminars and so on to educate, enlighten and sensitize people on the needs for family planning and the dangers, disadvantages and problems of uncontrolled population rate.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>        This research work principally address the following problems:<br/>Religious belief as a means of discouragement to family planning.<br/>Unwanted pregnancy resulting from frustration and pursuance of money by our youths. <br/>Problem of inadequate information.<br/>Financial predicaments ravaging some homes.<br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The research is designed to find the means to control family planning that results to problems of population control. The study therefore has the following, as its specific objectives.<br/>To find out if religious belief discourages people from family planning.<br/>To identify the causes of unwanted pregnancy resulting to control of population among our youths.<br/>To find out if inadequate information can lead to family planning.<br/>To find out if financial predicaments has role/roles to play in family planning/population control.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>        Specifically, that study will attempt to provide answers to the following questions:<br/>Does finance as a problem contributing to family planning resulting to problem of population control?<br/>Does religion belief discourage family planning?<br/>Is there any difference between unwanted pregnancy and frustration/pursuance of money to population control?<br/>Does inadequate information contribute to the problem of population control?<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The study is aimed at investigating family planning and problem of population control in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State. The result of this finding will go a long way to enhance the positive attitude of couples in spacing out their children. It will also expose couples to the various contraceptives methods. The investigation will also serve as an eye opener to the government in providing adequate basic facilities, and finally, researchers in the field of population statistics, growth and control will find the findings of this study very useful.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>        The terms used in this study are defined within the context of the study. They include.<br/>Child Bearing: An act of giving birth to children.<br/>Child Spacing: Giving birth to child giving enough space.<br/>Population: refers to the number of persons living in an area.<br/>Planning: Refers to measures that could be adopted in regulating occurrence of birth.<br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nFAMILY PLANNING AND PROBLEM OF POPULATION CONTROL IN EDO STATE (A CASE STUDY OF OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA IN EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FAMILY PLANNING AND PROBLEM OF POPULATION CONTROL IN EDO STATE (A CASE STUDY OF OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA IN EDO STATE", "id": 200}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES, PREVALENCE AND EFFECT OF FEMALE PROSTITUTION IN NIGERIA TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS: <br/>A CASE STUDY OF COLLEGE OF EDUCATION, EKIADOLOR-BENIN <br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>Prostitution has become rampant in our society today among growing teens and youths. These young people see selling of their bodies as the fastest way of getting income for their keeps. In the past those engaged in prostitution use to be women selling their bodies. However, today men have joined the trade of selling their bodies for different reasons including drugs, jobs or contracts and also good grades in exams. This is because sex consumers include politicians, bosses in offices, lecturers who find pleasure in exploiting the lower class by offering mouth watering opportunities in exchange for sex. (Alufohai, 2007). She further stated that some of the causes of prostitution are high level of poverty due to unemployment rate in the society, bribery and corruption. Family expectations and other problems are factors why men and women get involved in prostitution. Women most especially are pressured into the business to be able to cater for family and siblings education.<br/>Prostitution leads to the spread of STDs (sexually transmitted diseases), AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), HPV (human papiloma virus), herpes amongst others. Some women suffer trauma and pelvic pains, in most cases these women are subjected to drinking and smoking to ease off the pain and this habit could cause cancer which puts their lives in more jeopardy and increases mortality rate of the country. (Alufohai, 2007)<br/>A university don, Prof. Elizabeth Balogun, on Wednesday (2007) in Abeokuta, Ogun State, expressed her concern over the prevalence of prostitution among female undergraduates in the country. Balogun said the sex trade had become rampant on Nigerian campuses to such an extent that 80 percent of prostitutes that patronise night clubs, hotels and tourist centres in Ogun State are students of tertiary institutions. Prof. Balogun, a Biochemistry lecturer at the University of Ilorin, said this at a seminar organized by the National Association of Nigerian Students to mark its 31st anniversary where she delivered a lecture titled “Prostitution on our campuses: Effects and solutions.”<br/>The guest speaker, who expressed regret said, “It is absurd to the level that young undergraduate lady would leave normal academic chores of attending lectures and visiting libraries for further studies during the day, only to metamorphose in the evening into a call-girl or pimp. “There is no doubt that prostitution in the long run corrupts the quality of the nation’s future leaders and affects their values. Understanding that young females constitute appreciable percentage of the nation’s population, little could be expected from them productively if they had been turned into cheap sexual machines, with warped self-esteem and self- actualization. “Inordinate desire for affluence and desperation by many Nigerians, especially ladies lure them to engage in immoral and illicit activities, despite high level of religiousness which Nigerians overtly demonstrate. Even the present scourge of HIV/AIDS and the menace of ritual killers that find easy prey among prostitutes, have not been strong enough to curb the rising trend of the practice.” She urged the government to improve funding on education in order to drastically reduce cost of attaining higher education which will curb the rising trend of the practice.<br/>According to Alfred Obiora Uzokwe (2008) Prostitution is said to be one of the oldest professions in the world. It is alluded to in the bible and ancient civilizations, like Rome and Greece, had to contend with it. As I write, inspite of the penalties entrenched in the laws of most nations, against this illicit trade, it still flourishes. In most cases, though, those who engage in the trade are independent women, old enough to make decisions for themselves and willing to bear attendant repercussions. What happens, however, when prostitution becomes a pastime for young girls still dependent on their parents for subsistence? More specifically, what happens when the act of prostitution shifts from the cigarette smoke-filled rooms of brothels and the dark alleyways of major cities, to the esteemed halls of citadels of higher learning? Essentially, some of our young girls, sent to universities to acquire knowledge and become productive citizens in the nation, have found a vocation in prostitution.<br/>According to Punch Online [June 10, 2008], they now ply the trade right inside the university campuses. By day, they masquerade as students, attending classes and going to the libraries like other students but by night, they shed their academic garbs and don that of the oldest profession in the world. The Punch Online story sent cold chills down my spine and one is certain that when parents of young girls in Nigerian universities read this story, they will find themselves scampering after their children to ask some poignant questions. It goes without saying that every aspect of this news is bad for the universities as well as for the nation. Our female undergraduates are not only exposing themselves to danger, they are also mortgaging their future on the altar of quick money and instant sensual gratification. Furthermore, Nigerian universities that used to be the source of pride to those of us that passed through them, no longer bear any resemblance to the institutions we once knew. Standard of education has fallen; armed robbers and cultists have moved in and now the campuses are deluged by students-turned prostitutes.<br/>The researcher in her view said that the interest she developed in this issue stems from her belief that if not arrested, it will deal a devastating and final blow on the standard of education in Nigeria, summarily shattering, to smithereens, the moral fabric of a nation that is already in tatters. It is shocking that this malady has largely been left unchecked and is spreading like wild fire. \"The trend is ever becoming more dangerous in Nigeria today as prostitution is no longer a thing of the street and brothels but is fast turning higher institutions in the country into red light districts.<br/>Today, the Nasarawa State University is fast gaining a reputation as an abode for girls of easy going virtues despite the high prevalence of HIV/AIDs in the country and particularly in Nasarawa State. (George Okoh, 2007). He further confesses that if he had to guess where this illicit trade would be flourishing; Nasarawa State University would not have been on my list. But I guess that times have really changed immensely. Most people may be wondering why prostitution would be flourishing inside university/college campuses, under the very nose of university staff and security agents. One of the principle reasons believe, is that university campus authorities have failed to strike the right balance between ensuring student liberty and enforcement of existing campus codes of conduct. Saying that the students are adults that should know better, they let them call the shots. The problem is that with unbridled liberty and freedom, the students began to push the limits of acceptable behavior, making unrestricted foray into the sublime and dangerous. Taking advantage of the freedom bestowed on them as \"adults\", our young girls devised creative ways to trade in prostitution right inside the campuses. Investigations conducted by various newspaper correspondents’ show that the method of operation, employed by these girls, vary from campus to another and from one individual to another. The hardened ones, who see their campuses as too boring, do not operate inside the university campuses. Instead, they brazenly take their trade directly to their customers \"where the real action is\". In other words, at night, they taxi into nearby cities or towns, to hot spots that would give them maximum exposure to men willing to pay anything for sensual pleasure. Some walk the streets, when they get to town, until male customers, who are willing to patronize them, materialize. Because the girls do not fear for their safety or health, they follow the customers to their homes, brothels or nightclubs.<br/>According to Okoh, (2008) young female undergraduates of Colleges of Education, mainly between the ages of 18 to 25 years, take advantage of the proximity of their school to the major cities. The girls leave their campus dorms on Fridays, pretending to be going home for the weekend, when their actual destinations are high brow brothels, night clubs and the streets in different cities. Their sole aim is to go and pleasure, for money, men that some call \"aristo\"- a term of endearment for wealthy and powerful men. Okoh further reports that, \"In most cases, they [the girls] return back to the school, after the weekend, with large sums of money. To some of these girls, it's just having fun on the weekend but for the fact that in most times they sleep around and collect money from men they hardly know.\"<br/>        The world prostitution is the act or practice of providing sexual services to another person in return for payment. The person who receives payment for sexual services is called a prostitute and the person who receives such services is known by a multitude of terms including “John” prostitution is one of the branches of sex industry. The legal status of prostitution varies from country to country, from being a punishable crime to a regulated profession. Estimates place the annual revenue generated from the global prostitution industry to be over 100 billion. Prostitution is sometimes referred to as “the world’s oldest profession. Prostitution occurs in a variety of forms. Brothels are establishments specifically dedicated to prostitution. In escort prostitution, the act may take place at the customers’ residence or hotel room (referred to as out-call) or at the escort’ residence (called in-call). Another form in street prostitution. Sex tourism refers to traveling, typically from developed to under-developed nations of one type of human trafficking is defined as using coercion or force to transport an unwilling person into prostitution or other sexual exploitation.<br/>        Prostitute is defined from the Latin prostitute. Some sources cite the verb as a composition of “pro” meaning “up front” or “forward” and “situere” defined as to off up for sale. Another exploitation is that prostitute is a composition of pro and stature (to cause to stand to station place erect). A literal translation therefore would be to put up front for sale or to place forward. The online Etymology Dictionary states, “the notion of sex for hire is not inherent in the etymology, which rather suggests one exposed to lust or sex indiscriminately offered. The word prostitute was then carried down through various languages to the present day western society. Most sex worker activists group reject the word prostitute and since the late 1970s have used the term sex work instead. However, a sex worker can also mean anyone who works within the sex industry or whose work is of a sex nature and is not limited solely to prostitutes. In the early 17th century, there was widespread male and female prostitution throughout the cities of Isyoto, Edo and Osaka, Japan. Oiran were Courtesaus in Japan during the Edo period. The Oiran were considered a type of Yojo “woman of pleasure” or prostitute. Among the Oiran the Taju was considered the highest rank of courtesan available only to the wealthiest and highest rank of courtesaus available only to the wealthiest and highest ranking men. To entertain their client, Oiran practiced the arts of dance, music, poetry, and calligraphy as well as sexual services, and educated with was considered essential for sophisticated conversation. Many became celebrities of their times outside the pleasure district. Their art and fashion often set trends among wealthy women. The last recorded Oiran was in (1961). Although illegal in modern Japan, the definition of prostitution does not extend to a private reached between a woman and man in a brothel. Yoshiware has a large number of soap lands that began when explicit prostitution in Japan became illegal, where women washed men’s bodies. They were originally known as Toruko-buro, meaning Turkish bath. In ancient Greek society, prostitution was engaged in by both women and boys. The Greek word for prostitutes is porne derived from the verb pernemi (tonseu), with the evident modern evolution. The English word pornography, and its corollaries in other languages are directly derived from the Greek word porno. Female prostitutes could be independent and sometimes influential women.<br/>They were required to wear distinctive dresses and had to pay taxes. Some similarities have been found between the Greek hetaera and the Japanese Oiran. Some prostitutes in ancient Greece such as lais were as famous for their company as their beauty but some of these women charged extraordinary sums for their services. In ancient Rome, a registered prostitute was called a meretrix while unregistered one fell under the broad category prostibulae. There were some commonalities with the Greek system, but as the empire grew, prostitutes were often foreign slaves captured, purchased, or raised for that purpose sometimes by large scale prostitute farmers who took abandoned children. Indeed, abandoned children were almost always raised as prostitutes. Enslavement into prostitution was sometimes used as a legal punishment against criminal free women. Buyers were allowed to inspect naked men and women for sale in private and there was no stigma attached to the purchase of males by a man aristocrat.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>          Statistically, prostitution is an alarming problem to the human society. Prostitution is a form of violence against women, it is violation of human rights. With a higher instance of physical violence perpetrated        against them, female prostitutes are more likely to get murdered. This is a common occurrence across the country and contributes to the incidence of children without parents. Prostitutes have an increase incidence of sexually transmitted diseases. A study in Minecapolis, Minnesota revealed that only 15% of prostitutes who had prostituted for at least six months has an S.T.D. This figure does not include HIV/AIDS, Gynecological examination of the prostitutes in this study revealed an alarming incidence of positive pap tests. These women are at greater risk of cervical cancer and could spread the human papiloma virus among the population of the Minecapolis St. Paul Metropolitan area, either through direct transmission or indirect transmission.<br/>        The research reveals that rather than facing conditions of slavery men and women working as prostitutes are subjected to abuses which are similar in nature to those experienced by others working in low stratus jobs in the informal sector. However, the marginal position of sex workers in society excludes them from the international, national and customary protection afforded to other as citizens, workers or women. Their vulnerability to human and labor rights violations is greater than that of others because of the stigma and criminal charges widely attached to sex work. The report recommend that all national legislation which in intent or in practice results in the placing of sex workers outside the scope of the rule of law, should be repealed. The abolitionist approach declares that the institution of prostitution itself constitutes a violation of human rights. Raymond wishes to establish that all immigrant women working as prostitutes are victims f slavery and abuse. Average prostitution in Edo State was 70% female, 20%, male prostitutes and 10% customer. Whereas street prostitution accounts between 10 to 20% of the prostitution in Edo State. Research revealed that only 3-5% of the sexually transmitted diseases in Edo State relented to prostitution compared with 30-35% among teenagers. However, prevalent rate for prostitutes was approximately 50 percent in Edo State.<br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>          The purpose of the study is to investigate into the causes, prevalence and effect of female prostitution in Nigerian tertiary institutions: college of Education, Ekiadolor as a case study.<br/>        Another objective of the study is also to find out whether poverty is a major cause of female prostitution in the Nigerian tertiary institutions. <br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>Does prostitution have any health effect?<br/>Does unemployment lead to prostitution?<br/>Does the desire to satisfy oneself by a female students lead to prostitution?<br/>Is female prostitution acceptable in Nigeria tertiary institution?<br/>Does peer pressure lead to female prostitution?<br/>Does female prostitution lead to poor academic achievement?<br/>Does corruption lead to female prostitution?<br/>Does poverty lead to female prostitution?<br/>Does quest to make quick money by females lead to female prostitution?<br/>Do female students sell their body to teachers/lecturers because they want to get high grades in examination? <br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>         This study will help the government to re-evaluate its previous policies about prostitution and come up with a more realistic policies and programmes.<br/>Parents will also benefit, in that it will make them to become more alive to their responsibilities.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>          The scope of this study covers the four schools in the College of Education, Ekiadolor-Benin which are school of sciences, school of arts and social sciences, school of vocational and technical studies, and school of languages.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Prostitution: Is the practice of engaging in relatively indiscriminate sexual activity in general with individual other than a spouse in exchange for immediate payment in money.<br/>Youth: An individual that is aged between twenty and forty.<br/>Contraceptive: All involve the use of drugs to prevent conception.<br/>Abortion: It involves force terminate of pregnancy by drugs or any other means.<br/>General diseases: It refers to those diseases got from sexual intercourse.<br/>Aids: Acquire Immune Deficiency Syndrome.<br/>Hiv: Human Immuno Deficiency Virus.<br/><br/>\n\nAN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES, PREVALENCE AND EFFECT OF FEMALE PROSTITUTION IN NIGERIA TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS: A CASE STUDY OF COLLEGE OF EDUCATION, EKIADOLOR-BENIN <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES, PREVALENCE AND EFFECT OF FEMALE PROSTITUTION IN NIGERIA TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS: A CASE STUDY OF COLLEGE OF EDUCATION, EKIADOLOR-BENIN ", "id": 201}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>PROBLEM OF EXTENDED FAMILY SYSTEM ON THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE <br/>OF STUDENTS IN SOME SELECTED SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE  <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The study is aimed at investigating the problems of extended family system and how it affects student’s performance in secondary schools. It is believed that the study will help families to know the implications of not making peace among themselves and caring for their children. The method for collecting data was the questionnaire method; the respondents were randomly sampled from different secondary schools in Oredo Local Government Area. The fully completed questionnaires were analysed from the responses given by students and families who derive much benefit from this study. By the end, the researcher recommended that this research topic be carried out by other researchers to suggest other ways of eliminating the problems of extended family system in our society. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1        Background of the study<br/>1.2        Statement of the problems <br/>1.3        Purpose of the study<br/>1.4        Significance of the study<br/>1.5        Research questions<br/>1.6        Scope of the study<br/>1.7        Limitation of the study<br/>1.8        Definition of terms<br/>1.9        Assumptions<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Literature review<br/>CHAPTER THREE                 <br/>3.1        Method of investigation       <br/>3.2        Instrument for data collection<br/>3.3        Procedure for data collection<br/>3.4        Limitation of the data<br/>3.5        Problems of the data collected<br/>CHAPTER FOUR                    <br/>4.1        Analysis and interpretation of data<br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>Findings, recommendation and conclusion<br/>5.1        Findings<br/>5.2        Conclusion<br/>5.3        Recommendation<br/>REFERENCES     <br/>QUESTIONNAIRE       <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>        Students performance in secondary schools over the years, have not been very encouraging. This has been giving the government and parents a lot of causes for concern. Some analysts have likened the cause for concern of this problem to the incessant strike action embarked upon by teachers as a result of irregular payment of salaries. Others attribute it to lack of seriousness on the part of the students. These facts may not be far from the truth. The analysis however, cannot be said to be thorough without researching on student’s family background which goes a long way to affect their performance in school. This is what the study intends to make a research on. To spread the scope and concept of family and extended family system and its impacts on secondary school students performance in school. in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State the effects of extended family system on students performance has been prevalent, the performance of students from extended family has not been too impressive and since the system is practiced in Nigeria and Africa in general students cannot do without socializing with other family members.      <br/>        According to Humbling and Matters (1976), “Hunanbings are basically social creatures created by society primarily through family’s influence” society creates the individual; the individual does not create the society. Therefore, in the local government man is allowed two or more wives and this is known as polygamy. Polygamy has constituted academic problems to students. Finally, extended family system has some positive impacts on students since it is the commonest family unit in the society. Members who are financially buoyant assist students who are related to them thereby enabling them to meet some of their needs in school. Against, this background, extended family system is one of the numerous traditional practices which western civilization has not been able to erase in the local government and it may be with us for a long time even in the presence of western threat.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>        In this research attempt will be made to look at the problems students face in some secondary schools in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State as a result of extended family system. The study will also include some suggestions which can help to improve on their performance in school.<br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The aim of this study is to analyze the problems associated with extended family system in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State. And to highlight some factors that gave rise to the system. The study also aims at giving recognition to families as the center of the society and how the family also influences student’s performances in school.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The poor performances of students in school are as a result of extended family system. Therefore is important to study these problems so that the researcher will be in a better position to give appropriate advice to people concerned.<br/>        This study will be of importance to social studies teachers as they would in the position to act as counsellors to the students. This work will make parents to be aware of various factors responsible for student’s poor performance in school. Nevertheless, parents have always blamed poor student’s academic attainment on laxity and lack of interest on the part of the teacher.<br/>1.5    SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>        In this study, I have limited myself to some secondary schools in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State. This is due to time factor, financial constraints and transportation problems.<br/>1.6    HYPOTHESIS <br/>        The following hypotheses are to be tested in this research.<br/>Extended family system has a significant impact on student’s performance in secondary schools.<br/>Students who put their family problems behind them in their school work performance better academically<br/>The low performance of students in secondary schools is associated with extended family system.<br/>When students are emotionally unstable, it affects their performance in school?     <br/> 1.7   DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Bilinea: Relationship through mother and father<br/>Matrilineal: relationship through the mother<br/>Patrilineal: relationship through the father<br/> Polygamy: Custom of have more than one wife at the same time.<br/>  <br/><br/>\n\nPROBLEM OF EXTENDED FAMILY SYSTEM ON THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS IN SOME SELECTED SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE  <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROBLEM OF EXTENDED FAMILY SYSTEM ON THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS IN SOME SELECTED SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE  ", "id": 202}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CHILD ABUSE AND ITS EFFECTS IN OUR SOCIETY AT LARGE <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This project work was embarked upon to review the effect of child abuse in our society at large and to proffer possible solutions to the problem. The review revealed different forms of child abuse melted out on children in Edo State by parents, teachers and guidance. Some of the abuse and consequences were attributed to poverty, ignorance and inadequacies in protection of children while others are seen as deliberate. The population of the study comprises of children in Edo State. A total of 100 questionnaires were used for data collection and the analyses were presented in table one to twenty and the total scores were used to analyze the data. It was revealed that children of school age are thrown out of school because of inability of their parents to train them. Base on the researchers findings, some recommendations were made.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE   <br/>Background of the study<br/>Statement of Problem<br/>Purpose of the study<br/>Significance of the study<br/>Limitation of the study<br/>Scope of the study<br/>Research questions<br/>Definition of Terms<br/>CHAPTER TWO  <br/>Literature review<br/>CHAPTER THREE         <br/>Research methodology<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>Data analysis and interpretation<br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>Summary<br/>Conclusion<br/>Recommendation<br/>REFERENCES    <br/>QUESTIONNAIRE <br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>        Child abuse is also called cruelty to children; the willful infliction of pain and suffering on children through physical, sexual or emotional mistreatment. Prior to the term, child abuse normally referred to only physical mistreatment but since then, its application has expanded to include, in addition to inordinate physical violence, unjustifiable verbal abuse, the failure to furnish proper shelter,, nourishment, medical treatment or emotional support.<br/>        Child abuse can also be seen as the crime of harming a child in a physical, sexual or emotional way. Child abuse is also any illness, impairment or abnormal condition that affects primarily infants and children e.g. those in the age span that begins with the fetus and extends through adolescence.<br/>        Although, for the most part, the diseases of childhood are similar to those of the adult, there are several important differences for example certain specific disorders such as precocious puberty are unique to children. Others such as inflammation of the kidney are common in children and infrequent in adults. At the same time, some diseases that are common in adults are infrequent to children. These include essential hypertension (high blood pressure).<br/>        Education is an instrument of social, mental and economic development through which right values and attitude for proper development are inculcated. Child abuse and its consequences which is the unjust treatment given to a child, disturb this development process.<br/>        It is a practice whereby children are battered, deprived of some basic needs in the home and at school. The saying that the child is the father of the man recognizes the fact that the quality of today’s child will determine the quality of tomorrow’s man.<br/>        Truly, the present economic hardship in the country is a fascination of child abuse. In this condition, education of the child becomes the victim of economic down turn of the nation. For those that attend school, many are hawking and pushing wheel-barrow, car wash as part time job to raise the school fees. While others feeds ad cloth the family through the venture. As a result of this abusing condition, the cumulative influence of these activities may have poor academic performance as its consequences.         The offshoot of this child abuse and the consequences is examination malpractice to make for academic deficiencies resulting from failure to attend school regularly and devotion to class activities. Thus, a child generally is a boy or a girl of any age between infancy and adolescence. But for the convince of law, a definite age bracket is ascribed to a child. According to Eigbe (2006), a child in the southern states in Nigeria is a person between the age of 0 – 14 years and in northern states between 0 – 12 years.<br/>        Child abuse is a type of physical or mental injury or maltreatment of a person who is regarded as a child. The definition of child abuse has been expanded considerably to include more than just the beaten and sexually abuse child. It extends to any condition injurious to child’s physical or emotional health that has been inflicted by parents, guidance or other caretakers and school mates. The situation should be that of intentional infliction of injuries other than accidental means like suffering, harm by reasons of consequences, malnutrition, sexual abuse of growing up under condition which threaten his or her survival. Definite knowledge as to the nature and scope of child abuse appears to be lacking due to the difficulties associated with the definition of the concept as well as the cross cultural global issue regarding what is and what is not child abuse. In western orientation, child abuse extends to various misuses of children, especially with regards to functions relating to certain responsibilities such as “child labour” either in the form of “farm work “, or street hawking which many children in African cultural content embark upon as an acquired work rule in an extended family system.<br/>        Children belong to the defenseless and disadvantaged group. They should not be harmed or maltreated in any way as they are incapable of appreciating the dangers they face and the adverse effects which ill treatment have on their future development. Other children, especially adolescents are exposed, as are adults to environmental hazards that they deliberately seek such as cigarette smoking and the use of alcohol and other drugs. This article reviews the scope of diseases that affect children with particular emphasis on the ways in which the unique attributes of the growing child and special aspects of his environment serve to modify the causes, effects and treatment of particular diseases.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS <br/>        Edo State has witnessed in human act of child abuse and its consequences and its devastating effect on the child development. This becomes obvious when viewed from treatment melted on the children from broken home and parental neglect. The following are some abuse and consequences meted on a child;<br/>a.           Inadequate care for the children by parents and guardians in terms of providing basic needs.<br/>b.           Deprivation of certain children’s right both in the home and at school.<br/>c.           Child prostitution through hawking<br/>d.           Child kidnapping or death through hawking<br/>e.           Exposure to danger of death or harm through kidnapping<br/>f.            Misuse of children in various working areas.<br/> PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>        The finding of this study will enable parents and guardians to have alternative way of child rearing with abuse of children. There will be improvement on children enrolment in the school as the findings of the study will be known to the society at large.<br/>        The study will also help educational personnel to understand what constitute child abuse and its consequences (like working on the teacher’s farm during school hours, sex abuse by senior students, lack of teaching materials etc its perpetuating force and effect so that they know where and how to start combating it. This study will also help the government to know the various forms of child abuse prevalent in Edo State and the ways of fighting them.<br/>SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY<br/>        This will simply states the usefulness of the study in terms of its implication in the study and also its application to practice. The people of Edo state will benefit from this research when reading it, that many students has drop out of school due to the effect of child abuse in the society.<br/>        This study will also expose the students not to fall into child abuse in the process of having children in their marriage life.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>This study is restricted to the effect of child abuse in our society at large. Due to the fact that the researcher cannot go round the whole Edo State, then the researcher decided to choose Oredo Local Government Area as a case study.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>        The following research questions were stated to guide the study:<br/>a.           What constitute child abuse?<br/>b.           What are the causes of child abuse?<br/>c.           How does child abuse affect the academic performance of the children involved?<br/>d.           In what ways can child abuse be controlled?<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>        The following terms were used during this study.<br/>Child: A young boy or girl who is not at the age of adult<br/>Abuse: The use of something in a way that is wrong or harmful e.g. drug, food, drink etc<br/>Child abuse: The crime of harming a child in a physical, sexual or emotional way.<br/>Children: Young human who is not yet an adult<br/>Consequences: What happened as a result of something<br/>Sexual abuse: Connected with the physical activity of sex in a harmful way<br/>Malnutrition: A poor condition of health caused by lack of food<br/>Child labour: Misused of children in various working areas<br/>Deprivation: The fact of not having enough something that you need like enough food<br/>Devastating: The fact of causing a lot of damage and destruction<br/>Melted: To give somebody a punishment, to make somebody suffer bad treatment<br/><br/>\n\nCHILD ABUSE AND ITS EFFECTS IN OUR SOCIETY AT LARGE <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CHILD ABUSE AND ITS EFFECTS IN OUR SOCIETY AT LARGE ", "id": 203}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ITS EFFECT AMONG SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Students prefer an autonomous and independent life that is free from control, there by engaging in various delinquent acts (drug abuse, rape, robbery, cultism and vandalism) that are dangerous to the home, community, school and the nation. The impact of drug abuse among adolescents has been a stigma of moral decadence, violence, thugery, assault, madness and murder. The menace of drug abuse has eaten deep into the fabrics of our society; however, with effective counselling programmes, the problems can be tackled through campaign against drug abuse by government and other relevant authorities Drug control counselling centres should be established in every community and qualified health counsellors should be employed in helping drug addicts by giving them special advice on how to go about the withdrawal system. Drug awareness units to be set up in all states by the federal, state and<br/>local government not to try people who use drugs as criminals, but to help solve their socio-psychological problem.

The use of drugs in itself does not constitute any danger, because drugs correctly administered have been a blessing. Falco (1988) as cited by Sambo (2008) viewed that “chronic use of substances can cause serious, sometimes irreversible damage to adolescent’s physical and psychological development. The use of drugs could be beneficial or harmful depending on the mode of use.<br/>A drug refers to a substance that could bring about a change in the biological function through its chemical actions (Okoye, 2001). It is also considered as a substance that modifies perceptions, cognition, mood, behaviour and general body functions (Balogun, 2006). They could thus, be considered as chemical modifiers of the living tissues that could bring about physiological and behavioural changes (Nnachi, 2007). Drug abuse is a major public health problem all over the world (UNODC) (2005). The use and abuse of drugs by adolescents have become one of the most disturbing health related<br/>phenomena in Nigeria and other parts of the world (NDLEA; 1997).Several school going adolescents experience mental health programme, either temporarily or for a long period of time. Some become insane, maladjusted to school situations and eventually drop out of school.<br/>According to Fawa (2003), “Drug is defined as any substance, which is used for treatment or prevention of a disease in man and animals. Drug alters the body functions either positively or otherwise depending on the body composition of the user, the type of drug used, the amount used and whether used singly or with other drugs at the same time”.<br/>NAFDAC (2000) as cited by Haladu(2003) explained the term drug abuse as excessive and persistent self-administration of a drug without regard to the medically or culturally accepted patterns. It could also be viewed as the use of a drug to the extent that it interferes with the health and social function of an individual. World Book Encyclopedia (2004) defined drug abuse as the<br/>non-medical use of a drug that interferes with a healthy and productive life Manbe (2008) defined drug abuse as the excessive, maladaptive or addictive use of drugs for non-medical purpose.<br/>Abdulahi (2009) viewed drug abuse as the use of drugs to the extent that interferes with the health and social function of an individual. In essence, drug abuse may be defined as the arbitrary overdependence or mis-use of one particular drug with or without a prior medical diagnosis from qualified health practitioners. It can also be viewed as the unlawful overdose in the use of drug(s). Odejide (2000) warned that drug abusers who exhibit symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, behaviour changes, fatigue and loss or increase in appetite should be treated by medical experts and counsellors to save them from deadly diseases.<br/>        Amunonye (2001) defines drug as a substance which by its chemical nature has an effect upon the body or the higher nervous system (the mind). Therefore, many substances not usually thought of as drugs covered by this definition include caffine, nicotine, alcohol, household chemicals and pollutants. It is important to note that drug abuse is not contained simply to the abuse of dangerous drugs like narcotics-opium, heroine etc but also the abuse of panadol, codeine, antibiotics, laxatives etc in other words every substance apart from food is a drug and must therefore be regarded as being detrimental to health if not taken under proper medical advice or used correctly accordingly to medical prescription.<br/>        According Ebie and Pela (2000) opined that the Nigerian society does not usually frown at the abuse of drugs which does not produce over behavioural changes. The primitive people recognized the use of tobacco, native brewed drinks, cocoa leave and kolanuts to provide pleasurable relief of pain, fatigue and hunger but never realized they were abusing drugs. Different drugs have different effects some, such as cocaine or methamphetamine, may produce an intense “rush” and initial feeli9ng of boundless energy. Others such as heroine, benzodiazepines or the prescription oxycontin may produce excessive feelings of relaxation and calm. What most drugs have in common though is over stimulation of the pleasure centre of the brain. With time the brain’s chemistry is actually altered to the point where not having the drug becomes extremely uncomfortable and even painful. This compelling urge to used, addition, becomes more and more powerful, disrupting work, relationships and health.<br/>        Prescription drug abuse is just as dangerous as street drug use. When used appropriately, prescription drugs in the opiate family, such as vicodin (hydrocodone) and oxycontin, are often prescribed for chronic pain or recovery from surgery. Benzodiazaphines, such as valium or xanax are prescribed to treat anxiety. The problem arises when these drugs begin to be used “off label”.<br/>        Furthermore, prescription of drugs provide an easy point to other family members susceptible to abuse.    Unpleasant youthful activities are widespread in Nigeria and all over Africa to the extent that they have been giving a lot of concern to the government and general public. In primary schools, peer engage in organized crimes and disrupt normal academic programmes. In secondary schools and most Nigerian universities, the activities of secret cults are known to have been source of threat to lives and property. Outside the campuses, a lot of ritual killings are taking place. (Aluede 2000).<br/>        The impact of drug abuse among Nigerian youth’s bankrupt, decadent and wasted generation and loss of our societal values and ideals. The situation now appears to be such that no one can claim ignorance of what is happening. We cannot suit on the fence and criminally pretend on the menace of drug abuse among our young people. Little wonder, then that the former UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan once said “Drugs are tearing apart our societies, spawning crime, spreading diseases such as aids and killing our youths and future”.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>In most Nigerian dailies, different opinions over the effect of drug abuse among youths are expressed in different kinds of articles as “Drug Abuse”, “Drug Misuse”, Drug Addiction” etc, without empirical evidence to support the claims. It would not be scientific to accept these opinions.<br/>There is need therefore to conduct a study on the effect of drug abuse or misuse of drug among youths. The failure of the students to recognize that drug addiction is symptomatic of an underlined psychiatric disorder or psychological conflict has led to the continuous drug taking.<br/>1.3       RESEARCH QUESTION <br/>1.           Does drug abuse among students caused by family background friendship and per group association?<br/>2.           Does drug abuse among students used for psychological purposes like, tension relieving, intensifying perception and so on?<br/>3.           Does drug abuse cause health hazard which can lead to death?<br/>4.           Do parents and teachers have any role to play?<br/>1.4       PURPOSE OF STUDY<br/>This work is an attempt to study the effect of drug abuse among youths and the role of parents and teachers using students in secondary schools in Benin City, Edo State as a case study. This research finding may apply to other primary and post primary institutions in Nigeria. Purpose of this study therefore is to determine the existing finding of other studies like mine.<br/>1.5       SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY<br/>This study is not only important to the two schools under study but to the state in particular and Nigeria in general.<br/>The study is significant especially this period of our national life when the federal government is talking of re-branding, “Nigeria”, Great People Great Nation!

This research work, therefore examines the strategies of entrepreneurial education carried out in two of the universities pioneering it; Federal University of Technology, Akure, and Covenant University Ota, the former being a public university and the latter a private university. The objectives of the study were to appraise if educational styles arouse interest of students in the industries of their discipline; to explore the effectiveness of entrepreneurial development strategy in education in universities that implements it; to see if the current university educational system stimulates entrepreneurial creativity in its students. The methodology adopted was a mixed analysis of quantitative and qualitative parameters based on the survey design which relied on primary and secondary sources ofgathering data, through the use of questionnaires and interview instruments. One hundred (100) questionnaires were administered, and they were all returned. The study adopted quota and simple random sampling technique. The data was analyzed and presented using tables and percentages. The findings of this research portrays a huge disparity between the perception and conceptualization of entrepreneurship in the graduates of each university used in the study, this further highlights the significant impact of the system of teaching entrepreneurship within the two universities. The study shows that entrepreneurial education should be taught with field oriented and practical approaches. It was discovered that graduates from Covenant University are more apt to creating value, and are more self driven and willing to use opportunities available to them whether or not they have an employment. The study recommends that there should be a working partnership, bridging the gap between the higher institutions and the industry. Lecturers should have field experience to aid communication and teaching of the courses and Universities should work toward becoming entrepreneurial hubs for students and young entrepreneurs. The government should also focus more on the youth age group for entrepreneurship development in the country amongst other things critical to the development of the nation.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/> Nigeria is bedeviled by a myriad of problems which, despite her oil wealth, inhibit her development and even threaten her continued existence as a sovereign state. Nigeria’s socio-political and economic circumstances give the significant indication that many of her problems stem from an origin of artificial colonial construct which lumped together a variety of separate peoples. Fragmentation of the nation is seen as a distinct possibility unless its citizens can be induced to accept a new sense of Nigerian identity, involving a commitment to the survival of the present state as a cohesive entity. This would necessitate a number of radical changes, not only in the political and economic structure of the country but also in the psychology of the people.<br/>Nigerians have lived through series of administrations underdifferent governments, and the question still arises, ‘is Nigeria a nation at all?’ A critical look at what the government calls reform reveals a personally instituted concept of governance, filling the seats of power with those they believe to be their kin, rather than have professionals in the positions of merit, and a breed of people typified by their integrity of heart, ingrained in the trainings and qualifications they have received in the course of service to the nation. The increasing number of those who are not gainfully employed or adequately educated in the country, remain preys as political tools of violence as it has been seen in the history of violence occurring in the country over a period of time. The country has depended much on oil as its major source of revenue for years, however, the current administration also fails to recognize that the future of the country may very well depend on the economy of its people(the youths), which is possibly the only untapped, ill harnessed, most lucrative resource of the country. If it remains this way in the next ten years, putting into consideration the effect of increased poverty, lack of employment, poor educational system, it is unpredictable what the result will be. The table below shows the statistical data of the rate of unemployment and the population rate from 2006 to 2011 in Nigeria. It is the result of a survey carried out by the National Bureau of Statistics and shows that persons aged 0-14 years constituted 39.6%, those aged between 15-64 (the economically active population), constituted 56.3%, while those aged 65 years and above constituted 4.2%. Analysis of employment data for the past 5 years show that the rate of new entrants into the labour market has not been uniform in the past five years.<br/>The rate was on the increase from 2007 to 2009 but declined significantly from 2009 to 2010. The rate increased again from 2010 to 2011. Within the five year period, there has been an average of about 1.8 million new entrants into the active labour market per year.<br/> Governments, or local leaders, who are generally not held accountable for how much money is spent, and how education systems are managed,<br/>Sufficiency attitude – What is provided for the poor is good enough<br/> Inadequate pro-poor infrastructure or support systems this makes it difficult to implement successful poverty eradication interventions<br/> A lack of systematic tracking of pro-poor interventions –  in this way, it is extremely difficult to know if the activities and programmes implemented have had any impact at all. Nigeria cannot combat the ills of the society just by raising its budget; there should be a strategic systematic approach to education that would bridge the gap between its service delivery and its effectiveness in the country.<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Education in Nigeria is devoid of the element crucial to averting the surging rate of unemployment in the country, therefore the breeding of psychological dependence on direct access to money. Entrepreneurial development through education will advance the economy of the nation; much credence should be given to it and ingrained with focus on profitable personal development. Unemployment prevails in the country, hence, the growth of violence, poverty and segregation amongst citizens, because the educational system itself fails to empower the ones passing through it. This should be the core message of the evolving educational policy of Nigeria which is devoid of a system of education that emphasizes on the need to culture the country's young through the knowledge of rudimentary entrepreneurial development, common cultural heritage, and identification of exploitable strengths of structures, systems and cultures of others.<br/>Objectives of the Study<br/>1.     To appraise if educational styles arouse interest of students in the industries of their discipline.<br/>2.     To explore the effectiveness of entrepreneurial development course/training in education in universities that offers it.<br/>3.     To see if the current university educational system stimulates entrepreneurial creativity in its students<br/>1.4 Research Questions<br/>Can unemployment problem in Nigeria be solved through entrepreneurial development? <br/>Is the entrepreneurial development programmes of government been able to lessen the unemployment problem in Nigeria?<br/>The role of entrepreneurs in economic development is to increasing per capital output and income of a country?<br/>Entrepreneurship facilitates the use of local raw materials and other resources?<br/>Entrepreneurship education promotes interdependence of business in a country?<br/>1.5 Significance of the Study<br/>The focus of this study brings to the fore the crucial need for entrepreneurial education in Nigeria, putting more consideration on the educational system, strategies and its eventual social developmental effect in the society. The study highlights the problems of the level of education in the country and its equivalence to level of poverty in the society by virtue of lack of employment or knowledge of how to startup businesses. One of the MDG goals highlights education as a critical factor for reducing poverty and dependency in developed nations. Therefore, this thesis contributes to knowledge by identifying what is important to the economy, which is qualitative education focused on the needs of the economy per time, rather than the resolution of the United Nations to increase budgetary details or increasing the number of people that go through school. This is not the first paper on entrepreneurial education; however, it is the first to do a comparative study on what is being implemented by different universities to see its effectiveness in order to ascertain the strategy which would eventually help for the Nigerian economy in truly eradicating unemployment in Nigeria.<br/>1.6 Scope of the Study<br/>The study examines the role of entrepreneurial education in the development of Nigeria, its significance in the reduction of unemployment in Nigeria and  including a comparison between universities that implement para-entrepreneurship educational systems. The study considered the undergraduates of the current university system, from levels one to the final year, those who gained admission into the university in the last five (5) years. This study period is considered to be relevant because of its immediate impact on the future of Nigeria, through which one can discover if the role education plays currently will facilitate national development. The study considers students and graduates of Covenant University, Ota and Federal University of Technology, Akure as case studies. It is a comparative study between the two universities; the former being a Christian private university, and the latter a federal university. The two universities have embraced entrepreneurial education as part of their curriculums for at least three (3) years.<br/><br/>\n\nENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION AS A TOOL FOR REDUCING UNEMPLOYMENT IN NIGERIA <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION AS A TOOL FOR REDUCING UNEMPLOYMENT IN NIGERIA ", "id": 205}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES, PREVALENCE AND EFFECT OF FEMALE PROSTITUTION IN NIGERIAN TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS:<br/>A CASE STUDY OF COLLEGE OF EDUCATION, EKIADOLOR-BENIN <br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The study investigated into the causes, prevalence and effect of female prostitution in Nigerian tertiary institutions: a case study of College of Education, Ekiadolor-Benin.

The simple percentage data analysis was used for the collection. A total of ninety (90) respondents were used in conclusion, some recommendations were suggested to maltreat some of the identified problems.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>Prostitution has become rampant in our society today among growing teens and youths. These young people see selling of their bodies as the fastest way of getting income for their keeps. In the past those engaged in prostitution use to be women selling their bodies. However, today men have joined the trade of selling their bodies for different reasons including drugs, jobs or contracts and also good grades in exams. This is because sex consumers include politicians, bosses in offices, lecturers who find pleasure in exploiting the lower class by offering mouth watering opportunities in exchange for sex. (Alufohai, 2007). She further stated that some of the causes of prostitution are high level of poverty due to unemployment rate in the society, bribery and corruption. Family expectations and other problems are factors why men and women get involved in prostitution. Women most especially are pressured into the business to be able to cater for family and siblings education.<br/>Prostitution leads to the spread of STDs (sexually transmitted diseases), AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), HPV (human papiloma virus), herpes amongst others. Some women suffer trauma and pelvic pains, in most cases these women are subjected to drinking and smoking to ease off the pain and this habit could cause cancer which puts their lives in more jeopardy and increases mortality rate of the country. (Alufohai, 2007)<br/>A university don, Prof. Elizabeth Balogun, on Wednesday (2007) in Abeokuta, Ogun State, expressed her concern over the prevalence of prostitution among female undergraduates in the country. Balogun said the sex trade had become rampant on Nigerian campuses to such an extent that 80 percent of prostitutes that patronize night clubs, hotels and tourist centres in Ogun State are students of tertiary institutions. Prof. Balogun, a Biochemistry lecturer at the University of Ilorin, said this at a seminar organized by the National Association of Nigerian Students to mark its 31st anniversary where she delivered a lecture titled “Prostitution on our campuses: Effects and solutions.”<br/>The guest speaker, who expressed regret said, “It is absurd to the level that young undergraduate lady would leave normal academic chores of attending lectures and visiting libraries for further studies during the day, only to metamorphose in the evening into a call-girl or pimp. “There is no doubt that prostitution in the long run corrupts the quality of the nation’s future leaders and affects their values. Understanding that young females constitute appreciable percentage of the nation’s population, little could be expected from them productively if they had been turned into cheap sexual machines, with warped self-esteem and self- actualization. “Inordinate desire for affluence and desperation by many Nigerians, especially ladies lure them to engage in immoral and illicit activities, despite high level of religiousness which Nigerians overtly demonstrate. Even the present scourge of HIV/AIDS and the menace of ritual killers that find easy prey among prostitutes, have not been strong enough to curb the rising trend of the practice.” She urged the government to improve funding on education in order to drastically reduce cost of attaining higher education which will curb the rising trend of the practice.<br/>According to Alfred Obiora Uzokwe (2008) Prostitution is said to be one of the oldest professions in the world. It is alluded to in the bible and ancient civilizations, like Rome and Greece, had to contend with it. As I write, inspite of the penalties entrenched in the laws of most nations, against this illicit trade, it still flourishes. In most cases, though, those who engage in the trade are independent women, old enough to make decisions for themselves and willing to bear attendant repercussions. What happens, however, when prostitution becomes a pastime for young girls still dependent on their parents for subsistence? More specifically, what happens when the act of prostitution shifts from the cigarette smoke-filled rooms of brothels and the dark alleyways of major cities, to the esteemed halls of citadels of higher learning? Essentially, some of our young girls, sent to universities to acquire knowledge and become productive citizens in the nation, have found a vocation in prostitution.<br/>According to Punch Online (June 10, 2008) they now ply the trade right inside the university campuses. By day, they masquerade as students, attending classes and going to the libraries like other students but by night, they shed their academic garbs and don that of the oldest profession in the world. The Punch Online story sent cold chills down my spine and one is certain that when parents of young girls in Nigerian universities read this story, they will find themselves scampering after their children to ask some poignant questions. It goes without saying that every aspect of this news is bad for the universities as well as for the nation. Our female undergraduates are not only exposing themselves to danger, they are also mortgaging their future on the altar of quick money and instant sensual gratification. Furthermore, Nigerian universities that used to be the source of pride to those of us that passed through them, no longer bear any resemblance to the institutions we once knew. Standard of education has fallen; armed robbers and cultists have moved in and now the campuses are deluged by students-turned prostitutes.<br/>The researcher in her view said that the interest she developed in this issue stems from her belief that if not arrested, it will deal a devastating and final blow on the standard of education in Nigeria, summarily shattering, to smithereens, the moral fabric of a nation that is already in tatters. It is shocking that this malady has largely been left unchecked and is spreading like wild fire. \"The trend is ever becoming more dangerous in Nigeria today as prostitution is no longer a thing of the street and brothels but is fast turning higher institutions in the country into red light districts.<br/>Today, the Nasarawa State University is fast gaining a reputation as an abode for girls of easy going virtues despite the high prevalence of HIV/AIDs in the country and particularly in Nasarawa State. (George Okoh, 2007). He further confesses that if he had to guess where this illicit trade would be flourishing; Nasarawa State University would not have been on my list. But I guess that times have really changed immensely. Most people may be wondering why prostitution would be flourishing inside university/college campuses, under the very nose of university staff and security agents. One of the principle reasons believe, is that university campus authorities have failed to strike the right balance between ensuring student liberty and enforcement of existing campus codes of conduct. Saying that the students are adults that should know better, they let them call the shots. The problem is that with unbridled liberty and freedom, the students began to push the limits of acceptable behavior, making unrestricted foray into the sublime and dangerous. Taking advantage of the freedom bestowed on them as \"adults\", our young girls devised creative ways to trade in prostitution right inside the campuses. Investigations conducted by various newspaper correspondents’ show that the method of operation, employed by these girls, vary from campus to another and from one individual to another. The hardened ones, who see their campuses as too boring, do not operate inside the university campuses. Instead, they brazenly take their trade directly to their customers \"where the real action is\". In other words, at night, they taxi into nearby cities or towns, to hot spots that would give them maximum exposure to men willing to pay anything for sensual pleasure. Some walk the streets, when they get to town, until male customers, who are willing to patronize them, materialize. Because the girls do not fear for their safety or health, they follow the customers to their homes, brothels or nightclubs.<br/>According to Okoh, (2008) young female undergraduates of Colleges of Education, mainly between the ages of 18 to 25 years, take advantage of the proximity of their school to the major cities. The girls leave their campus dorms on Fridays, pretending to be going home for the weekend, when their actual destinations are high brow brothels, night clubs and the streets in different cities. Their sole aim is to go and pleasure, for money, men that some call \"aristo\"- a term of endearment for wealthy and powerful men. Okoh further reports that, \"In most cases, they [the girls] return back to the school, after the weekend, with large sums of money. To some of these girls, it's just having fun on the weekend but for the fact that in most times they sleep around and collect money from men they hardly know.\"<br/>        The world prostitution is the act or practice of providing sexual services to another person in return for payment. The person who receives payment for sexual services is called a prostitute and the person who receives such services is known by a multitude of terms including “John” prostitution is one of the branches of sex industry. The legal status of prostitution varies from country to country, from being a punishable crime to a regulated profession. Estimates place the annual revenue generated from the global prostitution industry to be over 100 billion. Prostitution is sometimes referred to as “the world’s oldest profession. Prostitution occurs in a variety of forms. Brothels are establishments specifically dedicated to prostitution. In escort prostitution, the act may take place at the customers’ residence or hotel room (referred to as out-call) or at the escort’ residence (called in-call). Another form in street prostitution. Sex tourism refers to traveling, typically from developed to under-developed nations of one type of human trafficking is defined as using coercion or force to transport an unwilling person into prostitution or other sexual exploitation.<br/>        Prostitute is defined from the Latin prostitute. Some sources cite the verb as a composition of “pro” meaning “up front” or “forward” and “situere” defined as to off up for sale. Another exploitation is that prostitute is a composition of pro and stature (to cause to stand to station place erect). A literal translation therefore would be to put up front for sale or to place forward. The online Etymology Dictionary states, “the notion of sex for hire is not inherent in the etymology, which rather suggests one exposed to lust or sex indiscriminately offered. The word prostitute was then carried down through various languages to the present day western society. Most sex worker activists group reject the word prostitute and since the late 1970s have used the term sex work instead. However, a sex worker can also mean anyone who works within the sex industry or whose work is of a sex nature and is not limited solely to prostitutes. In the early 17th century, there was widespread male and female prostitution throughout the cities of Isyoto, Edo and Osaka, Japan. Oiran were Courtesaus in Japan during the Edo period. The Oiran were considered a type of Yojo “woman of pleasure” or prostitute. Among the Oiran the Taju was considered the highest rank of courtesan available only to the wealthiest and highest rank of courtesaus available only to the wealthiest and highest ranking men. To entertain their client, Oiran practiced the arts of dance, music, poetry, and calligraphy as well as sexual services, and educated with was considered essential for sophisticated conversation. Many became celebrities of their times outside the pleasure district. Their art and fashion often set trends among wealthy women. The last recorded Oiran was in (1961). Although illegal in modern Japan, the definition of prostitution does not extend to a private reached between a woman and man in a brothel. Yoshiware has a large number of soap lands that began when explicit prostitution in Japan became illegal, where women washed men’s bodies. They were originally known as Toruko-buro, meaning Turkish bath. In ancient Greek society, prostitution was engaged in by both women and boys. The Greek word for prostitutes is porne derived from the verb pernemi (tonseu), with the evident modern evolution. The English word pornography, and its corollaries in other languages are directly derived from the Greek word porno. Female prostitutes could be independent and sometimes influential women.<br/>They were required to wear distinctive dresses and had to pay taxes. Some similarities have been found between the Greek hetaera and the Japanese Oiran. Some prostitutes in ancient Greece such as lais were as famous for their company as their beauty but some of these women charged extraordinary sums for their services. In ancient Rome, a registered prostitute was called a meretrix while unregistered one fell under the broad category prostibulae. There were some commonalities with the Greek system, but as the empire grew, prostitutes were often foreign slaves captured, purchased, or raised for that purpose sometimes by large scale prostitute farmers who took abandoned children. Indeed, abandoned children were almost always raised as prostitutes. Enslavement into prostitution was sometimes used as a legal punishment against criminal free women. Buyers were allowed to inspect naked men and women for sale in private and there was no stigma attached to the purchase of males by a man aristocrat.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>          Statistically, prostitution is an alarming problem to the human society. Prostitution is a form of violence against women, it is violation of human rights. With a higher instance of physical violence perpetrated        against them, female prostitutes are more likely to get murdered. This is a common occurrence across the country and contributes to the incidence of children without parents. Prostitutes have an increase incidence of sexually transmitted diseases. A study in Minecapolis, Minnesota revealed that only 15% of prostitutes who had prostituted for at least six months has an S.T.D. This figure does not include HIV/AIDS, Gynecological examination of the prostitutes in this study revealed an alarming incidence of positive pap tests. These women are at greater risk of cervical cancer and could spread the human papiloma virus among the population of the Minecapolis St. Paul Metropolitan area, either through direct transmission or indirect transmission.<br/>        The research reveals that rather than facing conditions of slavery men and women working as prostitutes are subjected to abuses which are similar in nature to those experienced by others working in low stratus jobs in the informal sector. However, the marginal position of sex workers in society excludes them from the international, national and customary protection afforded to other as citizens, workers or women. Their vulnerability to human and labor rights violations is greater than that of others because of the stigma and criminal charges widely attached to sex work. The report recommend that all national legislation which in intent or in practice results in the placing of sex workers outside the scope of the rule of law, should be repealed. The abolitionist approach declares that the institution of prostitution itself constitutes a violation of human rights. Raymond wishes to establish that all immigrant women working as prostitutes are victims f slavery and abuse. Average prostitution in Edo State was 70% female, 20%, male prostitutes and 10% customer. Whereas street prostitution accounts between 10 to 20% of the prostitution in Edo State. Research revealed that only 3-5% of the sexually transmitted diseases in Edo State relented to prostitution compared with 30-35% among teenagers. However, prevalent rate for prostitutes was approximately 50 percent in Edo State.<br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>          The purpose of the study is to investigate into the causes, prevalence and effect of female prostitution in Nigerian tertiary institutions: College of Education, Ekiadolor as a case study.<br/>        Another objective of the study is also to find out whether poverty is a major cause of female prostitution in the Nigerian tertiary institutions. <br/>1.4    HYPOTHESIS <br/>Involvement of female students in prostitution leads to poor academic performance.<br/>Personal greed leads to student involvement in prostitution.<br/>Offering sex for grades is a form of campus prostitution.<br/>Involvement in prostitution causes neglect of academic work.<br/>Many female students of College of Education, Ekiadolor engage in prostitution.<br/>The economic status of a country affects the spread of female prostitution in Nigerian tertiary institutions.<br/>The friends one move with influence one into prostitution<br/>Prostitution affects health state and results in communicable diseases.<br/>Campus prostitution is now a common business in Nigerian tertiary institutions, especially College of Education, Benin City, Edo State.<br/>Poor  financial background of parents enhances the spread of female prostitution<br/>Corruption lead to female prostitution<br/>Poverty lead to female prostitution.<br/>Female students sell their bodies to teacher/lecturers because they want to get high grades in examination.<br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>         This study will help the government to re-evaluate its previous policies about prostitution and come up with a more realistic policies and programmes.<br/>Parents will also benefit, in that it will make them to become more alive to their responsibilities.<br/>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>          The scope of this study covers the four schools in the College of Education, Ekiadolor-Benin which are school of sciences, school of arts and social sciences, school of vocational and technical studies, and school of languages.<br/>1.8    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Prostitution: The practice of engaging in relatively indiscriminate sexual activity in general with individual other than a spouse in exchange for immediate payment in cash or kind.<br/>Youth: An individual that is aged between twenty and forty.<br/>Contraceptive: A device, drug or chemical agent that is intended to prevent conception.<br/>Abortion: It involves force termination of pregnancy by drugs or any other means.<br/>Venereal diseases: It refers to those diseases got from sexual intercourse.<br/>AIDS: Acquire Immune Deficiency Syndrome.<br/>HIV: Human Immuno Deficiency Virus.<br/>  <br/><br/>\n\nAN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES, PREVALENCE AND EFFECT OF FEMALE PROSTITUTION IN NIGERIAN TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS:  A CASE STUDY OF COLLEGE OF EDUCATION, EKIADOLOR-BENIN <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES, PREVALENCE AND EFFECT OF FEMALE PROSTITUTION IN NIGERIAN TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS:  A CASE STUDY OF COLLEGE OF EDUCATION, EKIADOLOR-BENIN ", "id": 206}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE SOCIAL CULTURAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE USE OF FAMILY PLANNING: A CASE STUDY OF OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The social-cultural factors affecting the use of family planning in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State, the objective or aim of this study is to proffer solution to those social-cultural factors that is still affecting the use of family planning in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.

A better access to good quality reproductive health service particularly family planning is the key to improving healthy status especially for women.<br/>        In Africa i8 percent of women use modern contraceptive as a family planning method and those women begin childbearing in their teens and have an average of six children or more has led to a high birth rate in Nigeria, were family planning in receiving government support, various agencies have been saddled with responsibilities of promoting and educating the people concerning its use. The Planned Parenthood federation is one agency, also family planning clinics have been set up in hospitals to encourage people to plan their families, and avoid unwanted pregnancies that are for the women by bearing only the number of children they can adequately cater for. <br/>        “Rosen and Conly (1998) state” we see the need through family planning to prevent the health risk of frequent child bearing, but also to reduce the high toll of illness and death associated with pregnancy and child birth and to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) including HIV/AIDS. We must explicitly state that despite various efforts made by the Nigeria government to discourage high fertility or birth increase through the use of contraceptive, awareness campaigns, and prolonged breastfeeding by mother’s etc. popular growth rate is still rising.<br/>        The research would try to ascertain how the social-cultural factors (such as norms, values, education, religion, social class, custom) are affecting the use of family planning in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State., family planning has different meaning to people, to some, it is a method of giving birth to children by choice and not by chance, to health workers, it is the space of children. It can also be having only as many children as one can provide for, so that one can give the children proper care, enough food and opportunities for a happy life. The methods of family planning use are viz; Traditional methods (through calendar, rhythm, withdrawal and abstinence) folk methods (such as pills, condoms, vaginal methods, injection, inter-uterine, contraceptive devices (IUD), female sterilization, spermicides, impacts diaphragm etc. family planning and disease such as AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). Family planning services must be also includes access to long acting clinical method.<br/>        Janowite et al (1999) acknowledge the fact that currently, about ten million Sub-Sahara Africa women currently make use of family planning method. Family planning is beneficial to society. Rose and Conly (1998) aggress. Stating that the access to family planning would benefit the individual and sloe down Africa’s galloping or rising population.<br/>        In Nigeria, the trend of marrying many wives and having many children is still high despite the reduction in child mortality made possible by improvement in modern health care system, at the end of the research, we should know the social-cultural factors actually affecting the use of family planning in our study area, Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>        It was against the background of the projected world population growth especially in the developing countries and considering the consequences associated with current patterns of population control measure. In Africa, not all governments considered rapid population growth to constitute a problem to development. However, those countries that considered a rapid rise in their population as a major obstacle to development attempted to reduce the growth rate, countries such as Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Gambia adopted policies and programmes towards fertility and birth control in the countries.<br/>        Mrs. Saidu, a nurse at the Gwarinps General Hospital Abuja reiterated this stating that the need to control the increasing birth rate in Nigeria made family planning an acceptable programme. The traditional method came into existence it was seen as a taboo for a man to “meet with a woman he was not married to children were taught to abstain from sex. The girls were encouraged to maintain their virginity in some societies, any girl discovered to have defied her virginity before marriage was usually stoned to death. Others methods such as withdrawal, rhythm were used in our traditional societies. The culture of marrying many wives also served as a family planning method through child spacing a woman could not “meet” with her husband until she accepted traditionally, they were not very effective however for instance during withdrawal, some men could be released mistakenly before the withdrawal, leading to a “mistaken” pregnancy. Towards the beginning of the 20th century, modern contraceptive methods of family planning through the use contraceptive were invented, especially for women, the use of pills, injections, implant, condoms spermicides, diciphragm, intra-urine device (IUD) are such in Africa , there has been an increasing rate of injectable contraceptive use. These methods are seen to be a more effective method of birth control than the traditional method. In china, contraceptive are free and available to all. This has led to a drop in the birth rate by approximately 50 percent (Adams and Win Stane 1976).<br/>        Donald light and Keller S (1975) argued that three out of the very four married couples using contraceptive in 1975 favoured the most effective methods, the pills the IUD and the sterilization. Sterilization is the most popular method for couples who have been married for ten years or longer. The increasing use of sterilization as a form of contraceptive in an indication that couples are more willing to accept the irreversibility of the decision to terminate childbearing.<br/>        Despite the availability of thes1e contraceptive, population is still increasing people still feel that having large families is better, especially in the rural areas. However, educating the people on how to use family planning methods would make them more susceptible to its use which would invariably check population increase.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM     <br/>The work is designed to show the social-cultural factors affecting the use of family planning in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>To examine the factors responsible for the ineffectiveness of family planning in Oredo Local Government Area.<br/>To sort out the problem facing the development of family planning in Oredo Local Government Area.                        <br/>This research work is also designed to suggest workable solution to the problem of family planning in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The objectives of this study are as follows;<br/>To identify the different social-cultural factors that affects the use of family planning in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>To highlight the different methods of family planning.<br/>To create awareness campaign on the use of family planning in Oredo Local Government Area.<br/>To educate people on how the use of these methods of family planning.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTION <br/>Is family planning felt in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State?<br/>How enlighten are the people of Oredo Local Government about the use of family planning?<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>        This research work is limited to Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State; it is to examine the social-cultural factors affecting the use of family planning in Oredo Local Government Area.

According to a school of thought, child labour is not alien to our cultural values. It is part of our traditional culture whereby a child is expected to help the parents in augmenting the meager income or resources by selling or hawking farm produce like pepper, tomatoes, okro, vegetables etc on the street or in the nieighbourhood. This practice is to train child, the ability to be self sufficient and helping in giving him courage to face future challenges in marriage either as a woman or man (Adamson, 1993).<br/>Even though this line of argument is not generally acceptable among the scholar, it was however acknowledge that child labour if there has been any benefit derived by the child morally, has become a monster threatening the lives of this vulnerable, Nigerian child in the contemporary time of ours (Bouhdiba, 1982). Increased incidences of child labour in urban and metropolitan cities across Nigerian in recent times has received a lot of attention from the press, Non-governmental organization (NGO) poets, musicians, visual artist and researcher in our higher institution of learning. One of the major factors responsible for the increase according to Gwon (1991) is the distmalling of the traditional culture which by extended family system regards child care as a community responsibility but has been destroyed by capitalistic culture or orientation of our modern times. In Benin City a capital of Edo State, child labour has significantly increased from insignificantly number, it was soe years back to a worrisome state which deserves a drastic and urgent attention from all the stakeholders in child development – the parents, government and the society. Though there are no statistical figures to backup the increase, the number of children seen daily on the streets in Benin metropolis as petty hawkers, touts, bus conductors, car washers, wheel barrow pushers etc is a clear indication that the menace of child labour is gradually becoming a complex and intricate problem. It is on this basic that this project will attempt to study the daily life of children in Benin City and the traumatic experiences they pass through daily.                <br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>The purpose of this study is to investigate the daily harrowing life experiences of the children on the street of Benin City trying to eke out a living. This study was also carried out to know the extent the environment, which the children lives contributed to his predicament in terms of his psychological and personality development. It is a known fact that most parents has adjusted their responsibilities to the children hence they took the streets to fend for themselves.<br/>This study hoped to bring to the force the health hazards inherent in this act thereby enlighten the parents not to just bring the children but also make appropriates provision for their well being. Finally, the study hoped to assist the appropriate authority responsible for children welfare, to see to it that most of the identified problems are addressed thereby making the child truly a future leader responsible and capable of occupying the position the future has for him.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>Child labour is common in most part of the state capital Benin City which comprises three (3) Local Government Areas. But for the purpose of this project, two (2) Local Government Areas namely; Oredo and Ikpoba Okha Local government Area will be focused on, due to its prevalence in these areas.  <br/>SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY <br/>Child they say are the hope of tomorrow. It is therefore important and necessary to engage in efforts that will enhance their well being by drawing to their present predicaments; thereby helping the government to form formulates policies that will protect the rights of these weak members of the society in order to guarantee a better future.<br/>This project will go a long way in creating awareness among the populace of the needs to take adequate care of their children and expose the danger inherent in the works these children engaged in. it will also help in changing the perspective of some of the parent who believed that nothing is wrong in child labour since they are in support of the family or train the child to be independent.<br/>   Equally too, it will go a long way in documenting the types of child labour prevalent in Benin City and help the child welfare ministry to find appropriates solutions that will discourage the children in engaging in this act. Finally, it will serve as a document for future researchers who might be interested in the activities of the children in Benin City or other parts of the state.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Abuse: Any violation of a child’s right or anything contrary to what principals of 417 and 9 of the undeclaration of 1`959 on children is more or less child abuse.<br/> Any Work: A slang given to children running errands in the University Benin Campus for gratification.<br/>Conductor: A person who calls for the passengers and collect fares on bus.<br/>Networking: Is a process of fishing out organizations working in any area of child abuse and neglect and child welfare and linking up one another.

It is in light of this that Caldwell (2009) coined the term “educare”, to help widen the scope described. The new expansion of childhood now includes child minding centres for infants, kindergarten and nursery schools. Let us take our minds back to the word, ‘Kindergarten’. Can you remember? We first saw that word in our discussion on the historical background on the concept and practice of early childhood. Then we saw the word was actually coined by the German educator, Friedrich Froebel. In his conception, “kindergarten” literally means. “Child’s garden”. Internationally, “educare” or childcare in a group setting could be offered in a crèche, day-care or childcare centres, nursery and kindergarten schools. However, as previously noted, the usage of these terms varies from country to country, depending too on their philosophical inclination for the custodial nature of monitorial infant education. Importantly, early childhood education especially kindergarten or nursery goes beyond mere provision of childhood services; it also improves the general welfare of the child. It also improves the general welfare of the child. It is also in line with this that we will in this unit look at the place of child welfare in early childhood education, as well as parental role.<br/>Early childhood education in most nations is also offered in day care centres, nursery and kindergarten schools. Until recently, with increasing modernity, there were two types of nursery schools in Nigeria. These are the “Akara” school and the traditional Western-type nursery and day care centres. The first was typical of low-income families. The “Akara’ school was usually poorly organised and often run by unqualified teachers. However, in more recent times, it is fast disappearing, even though there are yet in existence, sub-standard nursery schools. Formal education for the Nigerian child actually begins in nursery school or kindergarten. Formal nursery education is described by the Nigerian National Policy on Education, (NPE, 1998:11), as that school-like activity given in an institution for children aged three to five. This is with an aim to promoting school readiness. Basically, the programmes of Nigerian early childhood education could be said to provide socialization and custodial roles, and, as most parents believe, they actually aim at giving the child a head-start in formal school, the expectation is a smooth transition to the primary stage of learning. Generally, early childhood education or pre-education in the Nigerian context includes the crèche, the nursery and the kindergarten.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>        The research which deals with the knowledge and attitude of early childhood education students towards the study of early child education as a course of study in Colben is relatively a new department in the Nigeria educational system hence there was the problem of insufficient materials in the field.<br/>        Also, another problem of the study is the poor attention giving to early child education in Nigeria by the government as early childcare education is left in the hands of the private individuals in the country. Lack of adequate funding, infrastructure is another problem of early childcare education in Nigeria.  <br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>The objective of the study is to find out the knowledge and attitude of early childhood education students towards the study of early child education in Colben in Ovia North East Local Government Area, Edo State.<br/>The specific objective includes;<br/>1.   The concept of early childhood education.<br/>2.   The importance of early childhood education Nigerian.<br/>3.   The role of parents in early childhood education.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>1.   Does students have positive attitude towards the study of early childhood education in College of Education, Ekiadolor –Benin in Ovia North East Local Government Area?  <br/>2.   Are the students aware of the importance of early childhood education?<br/>3.   Does lack of adequate facilities affect early childhood education among Colben Students?<br/>4.   Does government help to finance early childhood education in Nigeria? <br/>5.   Does early child education enhance the cognitive development of the child?<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>The study of early childhood education differ from country to country. Essentially, day care and crèches provide supervision and care for infants and young ones during the day time so that their parents can hold their jobs. This first phase of childcare and education is from birth or 3 months to 3 years. The first idea of day care centres were warm, safe environments where children could be cared for. It was also aimed at creating opportunities for these young toddlers to interact. In other words, besides the custodial roles played by day care centres and day nursery, there has been increasing evidence that young children in such centres can benefit substantially from involvement in some form of playful learning activities.<br/>Early childhood education is also important in fostering children’s cognitive and physical development. This is outside the expected custodial roles. In the same vein, the aim of childcare from birth till 3 years in Argentina centres on social and psycho-emotional development. On the other hand, Nursery schools or kindergarten actually known as Maternal Schools are designed to promote intellectual and social experiences for children. Like it is with the case in day care or day nursery, the objectives of nursery school also emphasizes social skills and at other times, there is focus on intellectual development. Significantly, for Nursery schools that follow the Montessorian ideal, the objective is to employ a carefully designed set of materials, so as to create an environment that fosters sensory, motor and language development.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY:<br/>The study is set out to determine the attitude and knowledge of students towards the study of early childhood education in College of education, Ekiadolor-Benin, Edo State. Therefore, the study is restricted only to Colben student in Ovia North East Local Government Area, Edo State.<br/>CHILD LABOUR: A CASE STUDY OF CHILDREN IN BENIN CITY<br/>ABSTRACT<br/>This study examined child labour in Edo State with focus on Benin City.

The story began a long time ago. AIDS was to enter the world’s consciousness and became part of the vocabulary of the human soul as a result of a dawning awareness of the advent of a new and strange disease first reported in California, in 1981. In July 1981, the New York Times reported an outbreak of a rare form of cancer among gay men in New York and California, first referred to as the \"gay cancer\"; but medically know as Kaposi Sarcoma. About the same time, emergency rooms in New York City began to see a rash of seemingly healthy young men presenting with fevers, flu like symptoms, and a pneumonia called Pneumocystis. About a year later, the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) link the illness to blood and coins the term AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). In that first year over 1600 cases were diagnosed with close to 700 deaths (CDC, 1981). Probably, no one actually expected the magnitude of the epidemic that was in the making. However, evidence of a gathering storm was soon arriving. The presence of related retroviruses in African monkeys and apes and the close relationship of HIV to a Chimpanzee Immunodeficiency virus all suggest that Central Africa may have been the site of evolution of HIV. Some people think that there are other possible origins of HIV. One of these is the suggestion that HIV was a deliberate or accidental product of biological warfare research. That is not possible, since the technology and the basic knowledge that would have been necessary to create such a virus had not been developed in 1975, when the epidemic began to grow.<br/> HIV is a virus. Viruses infect the cells of living organisms and replicate (make new copies of themselves) within those cells. A virus can also damage human cells, which is one of the things that can make an infected creature become ill. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. People can become infected with HIV from other people who already have it, and when they are infected they can then go on to infect other people. Basically, this is how HIV is spread. HIV stands for the 'Human Immunodeficiency Virus'. Someone who is diagnosed as infected with HIV is said to be 'HIV+' or 'HIV positive'.<br/> The full name of AIDS is Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. As the name implies, it is a disease caused by a deficiency in the body’s immune system. It is a syndrome because there are a range of different symptoms which are not always found in each case. It is acquired because AIDS is an infectious disease caused by a virus which is spread from person to person through a variety of routes. This makes it different from immune deficiency from other causes such as treatment with anti-cancer drugs or immune system suppressing drugs given to persons receiving transplant (Hubley, 1995).<br/> A damaged immune system is not only more vulnerable to HIV, but also to the attacks of other infections. It will not always have the strength to fight off things that would not have bothered it before. As time goes by, a person who has been infected with HIV is likely to become ill more and more often until, usually several years after infection, they become ill with one of a number of particularly severe illnesses. It is at this point that they are said to have AIDS - when they first become seriously ill, or when the number of immune system cells left in their body drops below a particular point. Different countries have slightly different ways of defining the point at which a person is said to have AIDS rather than HIV. AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) is an extremely serious condition, and at this stage the body has very little defense against any sort of infection.<br/> No one knows exactly where the AIDS virus came from but many scientists like Jasmine (2000:14) think it originated in Africa.  According to Jasmine (2000:14) theory, sometime in the past, one of the monkey viruses undergo a change mutation that enabled it to survive in the human body. This mutation was passed on to the virus’s “offspring” and eventually some of the mutated viruses found their way into the human body, perhaps, as a result of a person being bitten or by eating a monkey (monkey brains are popularly found in Africa). Once inside the human body the virus may have mutated further until it become the virus known today as the AIDS Virus. Regardless of exactly where it started, AIDS is now a cankerworm that has eaten deep into the world population today, as the case maybe, taking a case study of those admitted in Comprehensive Health Centers Gbor-Yowgon Kasina-Ala Local Government, Benue State from 2001-2010.<br/> AIDS was discovered in America in the year 1981 by Dr, Montegor, California University. But today, AIDS has been reported in over every countries of the world.<br/><br/><br/></p>\n\nTHE SPREAD AND CONTROL OF HIV/AIDS IN COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CENTER<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE SPREAD AND CONTROL OF HIV/AIDS IN COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CENTER", "id": 210}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><b>AVAILABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY AS INFLUENCING FACTORS OF HIV/AIDS INFORMATION UTILIZATION AMONG WOMEN </b></p><p><b>CHAPTER ONE<br/> INTRODUCTION</b><br/> &lt;&gt;1.1     All the human activities that result in problem solving and the production of goods and services depend on the availability, accessibility and utilization of information to effect communication.  Communication in this context, is the sharing of information by human beings. The process can be carried out in different ways and through different media of communication. <br/>      In this era of HIV/AIDS, community members are involved in complex behaviour to solving the problems posed by the presence of HIV/AIDS, as noted by Donohue and Kochen ( 1973 ), concerning the complex social setting. <br/>      In the current setting of HIV/AIDS pandemic, the everyday information needs of the average community member in the remotest village of our local government areas, has become a very critical issue.  However, sad enough, as noted by Dervin ( 1976 ) as quoted by Okwilagwe (1993).<br/>        The first cases of HIV/AIDS in the world were identified in the United States of America among a group of homosexuals (Rosenberg , 1992) and WHO (1999) noted that about 50 million people worldwide were living with the virus;  90 percent were in developing countries with a sizeable proportion of them being children and women.<br/>  In Nigeria, HIV/AIDS was identified in 1986 (Okafor, 1996), and the prevalence rate rose steadily to a peak of 5.8 percent by 2002.  The prevalence rate reduced in 2003, putting the country at 5.0 percent as reported in the Nigerian National Sentinel prevalence study of 2003 by ( Uneze, 2005 ).<br/>        The HIV prevalence study by state, 1991-2003, placed Cross River State at the top of the table with 12.5 percent rate. That meant that as at 2003, at least 240,000 people were living with the virus in Cross River State. The high prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS in Cross River State is alarming and questionable. Unfortunately twenty-four years into the pandemic, the vast majority of young people remain uninformed about safe sex and issues relating to sexually transmitted infections {STIs).<br/>        Information must not only be available, adequate and accessible but must be presented in a way that is culturally acceptable to facilitate the acceptability and eventual utilization of the information.           <br/>       There are many socio-cultural factors affecting the lives of African young women which make them more vulnerable to HIV infection ( Uwakwe, 1997 ).  He suggested that women are the worst victims of unprotected sexual intercourse because they lack the bargaining power to negotiate for safer sex practices with their male counterparts.  This lack of bargaining powers is culturally embedded in our African society.  This is also coupled with the fact that, the women are generally marginalized in terms of accessibility to educational information and other social amenities ( Uwakwe, 1997 ).  During the periods of postnatal, sexual abstinence for productive age women, husbands often establish sexual relationships with other women which may expose them to HIV transmission ( Hernandez and Vandale, 1993 ).  Economic dependence, urbanization and civil strife have negative consequences, in addition, traditional sexual inequality increases women’s risk of being infected with HIV   (Seidel, 1993 ).      <br/> HIV/AIDS situation in Nigeria<br/>       Nigeria with a population of about 140 million is one of the countries where the existence of HIV/AIDS has been reported, and where fears of further spread of the deadly disease have been expressed ( Asagba, 1992; Ozoemene, 1992; Abiodu, 1993; Okafor, 1997). The prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria has not been steady, nonetheless the high rates of infection is still of great concern. Nigeria has the highest number of HIV/AIDS infected adults in West Africa ( UN, 2004 ). Nigeria is also the third  country in the world after South Africa and India with the highest number of people living with HIV/AIDS ( Peter-Omale and Taiwo, 2006 ). It has been projected by USAIDS ( 2002 ) that, by 2010 there will be 10-15 million HIV cases in Nigeria.  Research data in Nigeria shows that HIV/AIDS is evident in rural as well as urban areas of the country therefore, education and prevention efforts should not be concentrated only in the urban centers   (Okafor, 1997 ).  Poverty, ignorance and illiteracy make it difficult for some women to have access to information.  This perhaps has been one of the major reasons for the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria.<br/>   HIV/AIDS in Cross River State<br/>        The study area is Cross River State of Nigeria.  Cross River State is one of the 36 states of Nigeria located in the South- South Geo Political Zone. Its population is estimated at 2,888,966 (National Population Commission, 2006), out of which 1,396,501 are women. The indigenes are mostly farmers, fishermen and traders.  <br/>            HIV/AIDS prevalence rate in Cross River State has been increasing and as at the last sentinel survey (2003), 12.5% was the highest in the country. The rate of spread is alarming and this calls for investigation.  At varying times, Cross River State prevalence rate has been put at: 1991/92 (0.0%); 1993/94 (4.1%); and 1995/96 (1.4%).  It dropped and rose again in 1999 to ( 5.8% ); 2001 ( 8.0% ) and 2004 ( 12. 5% )  ( Technical Report, 2004  ).  In 2006, the prevalence rate dropped from 12.5% to 6% in Cross River State, ( Akpan, 2006 ).  According to a report in the Daily Independent, 2008, the wife of Cross River State Governor, Mrs Llyel Imoke lamented the increasing cases of HIV/AIDS infections which she said has resulted in rise in cases of divorce in the state. <br/> HIV/AIDS Information Behaviour.<br/>         Information behaviour is regarded as an interplay between information needs, access to  information, utilization and the effects of information use. These four aspects are treated as problem areas to which research questions are related. The behaviour is to a large extent affected and formed by a social context in which various demands, expectations and ideas affect an individual’s ways and possibilities to act (Davenport, 1997).<br/>         The rural women, due to their ignorance and low level of education may have difficulty in searching for adequate information at the appropriate time to solve their problems, socially and economically. For instance, there are some rural women who are not aware of HIV/AIDS; as such they do not believe that AIDS is real (Personal discussion).  The  women, if properly informed could change their behaviour towards HIV/AIDS. <br/><br/><br/></p>\n\nAVAILABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY AS INFLUENCING FACTORS OF HIV/AIDS INFORMATION UTILIZATION AMONG WOMEN <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AVAILABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY AS INFLUENCING FACTORS OF HIV/AIDS INFORMATION UTILIZATION AMONG WOMEN ", "id": 211}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ROLE OF INTERIOR DESIGN IN HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY ( CASE STUDY CUTTING WROUGHT IRON)<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The saying “good look is a good business” is no more a new thing in hospitality industries.

It is the frame work through which the prospective guests view the hospitality industry which include residential, establishment restaurants, fast foods, outlets and hotels.<br/>          In any residential establishment, the basic requirements for guest are food, drink and accommodation. The statement “that first impression last longer” is very true as the guest from his/her impression on entering decides if he/she will come back again. On arrival the guest enter the front office and gain the impression of the establishment from what can be seen mainly from the setups of the establishment, the decorations the interior decorations and as the guest move on his/her room has more time to explore the surroundings more closely. Also the guest takes a close look at the decorations finishing and decides if it is likely to meet with the requirements and provide satisfaction.<br/>In the past, it was true that the room of a hotel should as far as possible give appearance of home away from home. But it is now realised that the guest who wants to feel at home expects so much difference in the way of decoration.<br/>          Design suitable for home often have a cold appearance and look very cool and attractive. Nowadays new architectural exterior and interior designs have been formulated to give the outside and the room a warm, friendly and luxury appearance. The role of interior design in hospitality cannot be underestimated as warm, colour good furniture attracts guest to hospitality industry like every other business organisation needs to maximise profit. This makes it necessary for the hospitality industry to pay strict attention to interior design.<br/>1.1    Objective of Study<br/>          The research is to examine the effect and prospect of interior design in the hospitality industry ands how interior has faired in the wake of its problem and whether interior design would be able to harness these challenge into opportunities that ensure growth and development.<br/>To accomplish these aims, the study shall focus on the following objectives:<br/>(a)      To examine critically on the present development in interior design in hospitality industry<br/>(b)      To examine the effect and social contribution of interior design in hospitality industry<br/>(c)      To evaluate the profit income that interior design has brought into the hospitality industry<br/>1.2    Statement of problem<br/>          Interior design is an activity that every hotel should undertake so as to eliminate the danger of customer rejection of rooms. Most hotels do not have a policy for new interior décor as a result of this they find it difficult to have the customer patronisation and face the competition in the market.<br/>          Poor management decisions on management of interior design can jeopardise an organisation change of goal.<br/>1.3    Significance of Study<br/>          The study would contribute in no small measure to the development of interior designed in hospitality industry that interiors design in the establishment cannot be overemphasised. Therefore interior needs not be thoroughly and adequately appraised.<br/>          The research would be useful in other prospective researchers in interior decoration in hospitality industry. Also the study will help in polishing people’s orientation about decorations and design.<br/>1.4    Scope of Study<br/>          The main scope of the study is to make it plan to the general, the effect of interior design and also the important of interior design in hospitality industry.<br/>1.6    Hypothesis<br/>Hypothesis is a tentative statement. It is defined as a set of assumption provisionally accepted as a basis of reading experiment or investigation.<br/>          The hypothesis to be tested are<br/>H0:     Interior design has contributed to the development of hospitality industry<br/>H1:     Interior design has not contributed to the development of hospitality industry.<br/>          The acceptance on rejection of the hypothesis will be based on the sample drawn from the interviews and intensive research conducted in the various institution and operation in hospitality industry; this will also be couple with the result obtained from the test of hypothesis.<br/>1.7    Definition of Terms<br/>          Hospitality industry: According to Wall-block he defines hospitality ‘as the act of making guest or tourist to feel at home by providing foods, drinks accommodation and entertainment for their staying. Also Luckwood defines hospitality as the people’s business of providing security physical and psychology comfort reward.<br/>          Oyeniyi also defines hospitality as a friendly and a generous reception and entertainment of guest.<br/>Hospitality industry: This is the industry that provides food, beverage, accommodation and entertainment to meet the need of the domestic and international leisure and tourism market. Hospitality industry also provides service in offices factories and clubs. Hospitality industry can also be defined as an industry that deals with the provision of food, drinks and accommodation for permanents or stopover guest.<br/>Hotel: According to the hotel proprietors Act 1956 ‘An hotel is an establishment offering food and drink and sleeping accommodation, if required by anybody travelling who appear able and willing to pay for service and facilities provided.<br/>          By Common Law a hotel can offer food beverage and accommodation to its guest but it must also assume a liability for the provision of a high standard of cleanliness and sanitation.  Also a hotel is a residential apartment providing foods and drinks.<br/>Interior: According to Oxford mini reference dictionary define interior design as the art or job of choosing the paint, carpets, Furniture e.t.c decorate the inside of a house.<br/>          In hospital industry, interior design does not necessary mean the inside of a hotel but extent o the immediate surroundings of the hotel also interior design gives someone practical information about planning, building and decorating inside of a hotel and when people lives and work.<br/>Design: This is a general form or arrangement line or shapes forming a decoration also according to Oxford dictionary defines design as the art or process of deciding how something will look, work e.t.c. by something may be made arrangement of lines and shapes as a decoration.  Also a drawing that shows how a thing is to be made.<br/>Role: This is defines as the function importance of something.

There is a lack of research, however, pertaining to cohabitation. The main goals of this study are to determine if there are variations in delinquency between cohabitating and other family types, and to examine the extent to which parental social control measures account for the variation in delinquency by family structure. Juvenile delinquency is seen as one of the menace that destroys life and property in our society today. Because of the nature of crime committed by juvenile parents, guidance, sponsors and well-wishers are worried and disturbed about our future leaders. Crime associated with juvenile include: rape, stealing, Kleptomanism, burglary, disobedience, homicide, truancy, vandalization and robbery etc. therefore, this study seeks to look at the nature and consequences of juvenile delinquency. The objective of this study aims at finding out why juvenile engage in delinquent act, why juvenile offenders continue in crime after being punished or sanctioned, what Nigeria government needs to do in order to improve or educate juvenile about crime and the negative impact of crime on individual and society at large. However, the expected outcome of this study is that to reduce or eradicate juvenile delinquency in our society government and voluntary organization should be involved in the following ways: Government should provide employment opportunities for youths, greater thought should be given to setting up more amenities in the rural areas, stoppage of pornographic films and some American films, where our youths learns techniques in stealing and destroying properties, parents should adopt method of positive and negative reinforcement and government should educate or enlightening parent on the effects of unmet needs like starvation (food), parental care and affection etc. on their children to enable them (parents) make adjustment. Method of data collection used in this study was only questionnaire.<br/>  CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>Juvenile delinquency is an intractable problem worldwide and has been increasing phenomenally by as much as 30 percent since the 1990s (World Youth Report, cited in Sheryln, 2008). Anti-social behaviours of young people have been posing a lot of problems to the wellbeing of the people in Nigeria. Citizens, researchers and public officials perceive juvenile delinquency as a major social contemporary concern in Nigeria. Juvenile crimes witnessed in Nigeria include: drug abuse, cultism, bullying, truancy, examination malpractices, prostitution and theft (Ugwuoke, 2010; Sanni, Udoh, Okediji, Modo &amp; Ezeh, 2010).<br/>Shoemaker (2010:3), defined juvenile delinquency as “illegal acts, whether criminal or status offences, which are committed by youth under the age of 18”. From this definition, it is pertinent to highlight the two types of delinquent offences associated with young people, herein referred to as juveniles/children. The first type of offence is a conduct that would be a criminal law violation for an adult, such as rape, burglary, robbery, etc. The other type of delinquent offence called „status�� offences are delinquent conducts that do not apply to adults, such as running away from home, truancy, etc (Alemika &amp; Chukwuma, 2001; Alfrey,2010).<br/>The origin of juvenile delinquency in Nigeria dates back to the 1920s when youth crimes such as pick pocketing and prostitution became predominant issues in Nigerian newspapers in that period. This ugly trend led to the establishment of judicial administrative processes by the colonial administrators to deal with juvenile delinquents (Fourchard, 2006).It is appalling that the worrisome issue of juvenile delinquency still plagues the contemporary Nigerian society in a serious dimension (Muhammed, Salami , Adekeye, Ayinla and Adeoye,2009). However, the problem of juvenile delinquency is not peculiar to Nigeria. In 2007, the law enforcement agencies in the United States of America reported 2.18 million arrests of juveniles (Alfry, 2010). Alfry also reported that the United States Bureau of Justice Statistics found out that 72% of jailed juveniles came from fragmented families.<br/>According to World Youth Report cited in Sheryln (2008), the rate of criminal activity among juveniles in groups in the Russian Federation is about three to four times higher than that of adult offenders. Motivated by the increasing rate of juvenile delinquency in Britain, Juby and Farrington (2001), examined juvenile delinquency and family disruption in a longitudinal survey of South London males from age 8 to 46. The researchers found out that 29% of the boys from disrupted families were convicted as juveniles compared with 18% of the boys from stable families. The researchers concluded that family disruption was one of the contributory factors to the upsurge of juvenile delinquency in Britain.<br/>In Kenya, Muola, Ndugu and Ngesa (2009) cited in Kimani (2010) in a study of the relationship between family functions and juvenile delinquency in Nakuru municipality in Kenya found out that the incidences of juvenile delinquency have increased in recent years in Kenya. Juvenile delinquency was found be significantly related to family instability and mode of discipline. The researchers suggested that there was a relationship between family structure and juvenile delinquency in Portharcourt.<br/>Fourchard (2006) has also decried the increasing trend of juvenile delinquency in Nigeria, attributing the upsurge to familial factors amongst contributory variables. In view of the foregoing issues and trends globally and locally, many researchers agree that the foundation of juvenile delinquency is rooted in the kind of home the child is brought up (Okorodudu, 2010; Igbo, 2007).<br/>Muhammed et al (2009) have observed that family instability is on the increase in Nigeria and that the increasing crime trends among the youths may be attributed to this. Based on the foregoing, this study aims at examining the effect of family structure on juvenile delinquency among school in Nigeria with focus on Portharcourt municipality.<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>Juvenile delinquency in Nigeria is a major social problem which affects the whole society and constitutes a serious impediment to development (Muhammed et al 2009). For instance in Portharcourt municipality today, crime is common among the young people, many of who are caught in one criminal act or the other such as examination malpractice, armed robbery, assault, rape, house breaking, forgery, truancy e.t.c. (Nwankwo, Nwoke, Chukwuocha, Iwuagwu, Obanny, Okereke and Nwoga, 2010). Muhammed et al (2010) have observed that young people in contemporary Nigeria are mostly involved in armed robbery, cultism, kidnapping, drug abuse and other criminal activities. In corroborating this fact, the Imo state commander of National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) lamented that the young people were the most involved in illicit drug usage and dealing (Nkwopara, 2011).The consequences of this malady and other juvenile crimes such as; examination malpractice, alcoholism, forgery, rape, e.t.c in Nigeria include; social violence among youths, armed robbery, mental disorders, lack of respect for elders and other numerous social ills.<br/>In the light of the nauseating problems of juvenile delinquency in Nigeria and Portharcourt Municipality, scholars and concerned citizens have attributed the menace to various factors such as; poverty, peer pressure, family structure, drug abuse and so on(Nwankwo et al 2010). While recognizing these other causes, this study seeks to focus on the effect of family structure on juvenile delinquency among school adolescent in Portharcourt because “the family has a crucial role to play in the development of a conforming or delinquent personality (Igbo, 2007:89)”.<br/>Inadequate supervision arising from family structure seems to be associated with juvenile delinquency (Alfrey, 2010). Alfrey further explained that those children in single-parent families tend to receive lower levels of supervision. According to him, this inadequate parental supervision has a tendency to increase the likelihood of juvenile delinquency.<br/>Dogget (2004), has it that when there is one parent living in the home as opposed to two, it is more difficult to supervise children all the time. According to Dogget, every day activities like errands and work must be completed by the single parent, which leaves no parent in the home. Because of this, children in single-parent homes tend to receive lower levels of supervision (Sanni et al, 2010). Lack of parental monitoring contributes not only directly to children��s anti-social behaviours, but also indirectly as it contributes to exposing them to associate with deviant peers, which is predictive of higher levels of deviant acts (Okorodudu, 2010). From observation, it seems that parents and care givers are not doing much in the supervision of their children in Nigeria because of their numerous economic and social engagements.<br/>This scenario tends to be giving impetus to juvenile delinquency in Nigeria and Portharcourt Municipality in particular. Children from broken homes are more likely to run away from their family than children who come from more stable families (Uwaoma &amp; Udeagha, 2007).Uwaoma and Udeagha further explained that a broken home has an imbalance and as a result is detrimental to a child��s socialization and personality adjustment. The resultant effect is that a child may be more vulnerable to negative peer pressure and may ultimately commit delinquent acts not committed by children from stable families where there is a balanced structure of two parents who act as good role models in the child��s acquiring proper roles (Odebunmi, 2007).<br/>Children growing up in unstable families are at a greater risk of experiencing a variety of behavioural and educational problems, including; smoking, drug abuse, vandalism, violence and criminal acts than children from stable families (Sheryln, 2008). According to Sheryln, changes in the family can affect the levels of self-control in children.<br/>The transitions in the family structure also lead to changes in the organization, monitoring and disciplining of the children. If the changes are widespread, the resulting changes in the adolescents�� levels of self-control will likely lead to anti-social behaviours (Mullens, 2004). Single-parent families are often financially vulnerable as compared to two-parent families. This unfortunate economic circumstance can draw these families to disorganized neighbourhoods where crime and delinquency are rampant (Alfrey, 2010). The implication according to Alfrey is that the children may be exposed to learning delinquent behaviours and they may also be enticed into joining delinquent gangs. It is the opinion of the researcher that financial vulnerability may also be a source of strain to children in single-parent families. Hence, they may not have some of their needs met by their single parent. The effect is that children in such a situation may be pushed to engage in theft, extortion and other delinquent actions to make ends meet.<br/> Muhammed et al (2009) have also attributed the rise of anti-social behaviours among young people in Nigeria to family instability among other factors. They noted that children from unstable families have multiple behavioural problems which impel them to engage in delinquent behaviours. This, according to them is because the warmth, direction, love and protection which the parents would have provided for them are lost and then sought in anti-social behaviours such as drug abuse.<br/>However, there seems to be a controversy on the relationship between family structure and juvenile delinquency. While Alemika and Chukwuma��s (2001) study, among other studies found no relationship between broken homes and juvenile delinquency, Kimani��s (2010) study found a positive relationship between broken homes and juvenile delinquency. As a result, this study aims at bridging the gap in studies on juvenile delinquency and also to ascertain the effect of family structure on juvenile delinquency among school adolescent in Portharcourt municipality.<br/>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of this research is to find out the effect of family structure on juvenile delinquency among school adolescent in portharcourt. Specifically the focus of the research is based on the following objectives:<br/>i) To find out the effect of family structure on juvenile delinquency among school adolescent test in secondary schools.<br/>ii) To ascertain the extent to which the teaching and learning of Social Studies Education in secondary schools can cube juvenile delinquency.<br/>iii) To find out the impact of other personal characteristics in the promotion of delinquent behaviour to lead to low academic performance.<br/>iv) To find workable measures to minimizing the problem of juvenile delinquency in secondary schools.<br/>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS.<br/>The following research questions were drawn from the statement of the<br/>problem presented above:<br/>1. What is the difference between the academic performance of students who always come late to school and that of those who come early?<br/>2. Is there any difference between the academic performance of students who are gang fighters and that of those who do not fight?<br/>3. What is the difference between the academic performance of students who always make noise in the class and those who are always attentive?<br/>1.5 HYPOTHESES<br/>The following Null hypotheses are formulated for test;<br/>1. There is no significant difference between the academic<br/>Performance of delinquent and non-delinquent students before and after treatment.<br/>2. There is no significant different between the academic performance of delinquent students with parents who are literate and illiterate parental background in the experimental group.<br/>3 There is no significant difference in the level of delinquency among students based on age group.<br/>1.6 BASIC ASSUMPTIONS<br/>This study is based on the following assumptions:<br/>1. Delinquent and non-delinquent students have equal opportunities of learning within the school.<br/>2. It is assumed that all delinquent students fail academically.<br/>3. Delinquent and non-delinquent students are taught by qualified teachers.<br/>4. Family structure has negative effect on juvenile delinquency among school adolescent<br/>1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study looks at the effect of family structure on juvenile delinquency among school adolescent in Portharcourt. In all ramifications, the study does not claim the fact that all Nigerian juvenile are criminals or culprits or law violators so to say.<br/>The study is very beneficial to learning and development processes and helps our adolescent to be aware of those things that may lead them to delinquent acts and avoid them. The study will also help parents, guidance, and sponsors etc to know those things they need to do in order to prevent their children from so called delinquent acts.<br/>The study goes a long way to unleash those things our government needs to do in order to educate our juvenile and prevent them from future delinquent acts. In conclusion, this study is significant because it seeks to determine to what extent juvenile commit crime, why they continued in delinquent act and as well as the result of their delinquent acts to themselves and society at large.<br/>1.9 DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Juvenile: This refers to a person who has attained the age of 14 but is under 17 years.

Immunization is also defined as a process by which human beings protect themselves from, or against deadly diseases such as poliomyelitis, measles, tuberculosis, diphtheria, whooping cough, vaccination is also another name for immunizing living things against deadly diseases. Immunization is done to make the body resist invasion of pathogenic microbes like bacteria, protozoa and virus. In immunization, a small quantity of a dead parasitic organism is injected into the body of a healthy person (somebody that is free from that parasite organism), the body recognized the antigen as foreign response by realizing specialized protein called antibodies. These antibodies have specific protective properties and the body become immune against the disease that are caused by micro-organisms. Immunization can be active, positive, natural, or acquired.<br/>          Acquired immunity artificially when there is an epidemic outbreak of small doses, antibodies from an animal are given to people to provide urgent temporary immunity to the body. Active artificial immunity is done by injecting vaccine so as to weakened or kill the bacteria product into the body. In this way, the body can have its own antibodies, an example is the small pox vaccine.<br/>          Parent especially the mothers in question do not get their children immunized. The superstition belief or idea that disease are caused by witches and wizards are strongly rooted in their mind, some believes that diseases are caused by evil spirit and the only way out for them to avoid it is by offering sacrifice and some believe that it is the sin that the parents have committed towards the gods that make the child to be like that and there is no solution to the sickness of the child.<br/>          Some parent know where and how to obtain it but do not take their children to the clinic for immunization while others that made attempts to take their children to the clinic for immunization may start and will not complete the normal dose they are supposed to give to that child. In a particular health center, i.e. Ikpoba Okha Health center in Edo State, between January 2007 to December 2010, fifty six thousand six hundred and forty two (56,642) children were registered for different types of immunization. Out of these only thirty four thousand six hundred and twenty two (34, 622) children completed their immunization, the remaining twenty two thousand and twenty (22,020) fall to complete their immunization. Some mothers later brought their children to complete their immunization after along time. When they asked them why they did not bring their children ever since, the most population reason they gave was that, they were not chanced due to their jobs. They devoted much time to their jobs e.g. trading, government workers etc others said they came several times but in most occasions, the nurses asked them to go home that the health of their babies was poor.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>          The decision to carry out the study was due to the attitude of women towards immunization in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area. In the past, many children died before the age of 5 or before the school age due to communicable diseases e.g. tuberculosis, diphtheria, poliomyelitis, whooping cough, measles, tetanus etc. they did not know that these disease could be prevented. These communicable disease were discovered by scientific researcher, clinics are established where the disease can be  prevented by treatment. Many people are not still making use of the clinic and health center, perhaps due to ignorance, inability of mothers to get the facilities or non availability of vaccine or lack of understanding.<br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY   <br/>          This research work is an attempt to study the attitude of mothers towards immunization in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area in Edo State. The purpose of this study is to:<br/>   To find out why mothers refused to bring their children for immunization<br/>   To know why some mothers started but refuse to complete the normal schedule<br/>   To know or find out how many children register in the clinic and health center for the immunization during the period of January 2010 to December 2010.<br/>   To know the number of children who started the immunization and completed the normal schedule<br/>   To know the number of children that started the immunization but refuse to complete it.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY    <br/>          This research is expected to be of great importance to parents and the general public in Ikpoba Okha Local Government area who will appreciate the implication of the problem of immunization and know the best way to handle them. The study conducted was done to aid the following group of people.<br/>   The mothers<br/>   The health center<br/>   Ministry of health, Edo State.<br/>The Mothers: The mother will be advice properly on what they should do. The information gathered will be of great importance which may change mother’s attitudes towards immunization programme.<br/>The health center: The suggestion made will be used as a source of correction measure to health persons on one way or the other may have contributed to the lukewarm attitude of mothers when they bring their children for immunization through health education and lack of follow up visit to trace defaulters.<br/>Ministry of health, Edo State: The findings may serve as a clue for Edo State Ministry of health to make better plan by making of health to make better plan by making adequate provision of vaccine and training more people into the health sector to promote child immunization in Edo State.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS    <br/>          Based on the assumption made, the following research questions are postulated.<br/>   Does ignorance of mothers contribute to their attitude towards immunization?<br/>   Does lack of immunization lead to death of children?<br/>   Do mother get actively involved and delighted in the immunization of the children?<br/>   Does the behaviour of health workers affect mothers in the immunization of their children?<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY   <br/>          This is restricted to the attitude of mothers towards immunization in some selected health centres in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of Edo State. The sample population is made up of mothers who were selected by simple random process.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Health: The state of well being physically and mentally.<br/>Health Center: A building where group of doctors, nurses and health workers see their patients.<br/>Mothers: A female parent of a child.<br/>Child: A young human who is not yet an adult.<br/>Immunization: To protect a person or an animal from disease or an animal from disease especially by giving them an injection or a vaccine.<br/>Measles: An infectious disease especially of children that cause fever and small red spots that cover the whole body.<br/>Tuberculosis: A serious infectious disease in which swellings appear on the lungs and other part of the body.<br/><br/>\n\nATTITUDE OF MOTHERS TOWARDS IMMUNIZATION IN IKPOBA-OKHA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF  EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ATTITUDE OF MOTHERS TOWARDS IMMUNIZATION IN IKPOBA-OKHA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF  EDO STATE", "id": 214}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>CHILDLESSNESS AND SOCIO CULTURAL IMPACT ON MARRIED COUPLES<br/>A CASE STUDY OF IDAH COMMUNITY IN KOGI STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The research is an in-depth analysis of childlessness and socio-cultural impact on married couples in idah urban community of Kogi State. The study explored ways of reducing pressure both from the family and the society as a whole with particular reference to examining the existing causes and effects of infertility in the society. The instrument for data collection used for this research was questionnaire. The sampling techniques used for this study was cross- sectional survey research design. One hundred (100) respondents were randomly selected. The data collected were analyzed using tables and percentages. From the analysis of the data, it was found that programmer community could help reduce feeling of inferiority complex among childless couples. Negative attitude of childless couples towards child adoption and the significant relationship between childless couples and leadership role were found. The findings from the study necessitated certain recommendations which include the fact that childless couples should seek for medical treatment jointly instead of allowing one partner to carry the burden alone among others.<br/>                     TABLE OF CONTENT                    <br/>  CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION                              <br/>1.1    Background to the Study                                        <br/>1.2    Statement of Problem                                        <br/>1.3    Research Questions  -                                             <br/>1.4    Objectives of the Study                                        <br/>1.5    Significance of the Study                                        <br/>1.6    Definition of Concepts                                        <br/>CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW                         <br/>2.1    Literature Review - -                                             <br/>2.1.1 Medical Treatment for Infertility -                              <br/>2.1.2 The Extent Childless Couples Sort for Medical Solution          <br/>To Their Problems                                                  <br/>2.1.3 Responsible Factors for Infertility                              <br/>2.1.4 Childless Couples and Adoption -                              <br/>2.1.5 The Socio-Cultural Impact of Childlessness On Married Couples<br/>2.2    Review of Related Theories -                                   <br/>2.3    Theoretical Framework-    -                                   <br/>2.4    Study Hypothesis - -         -                                   <br/>CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY                    <br/>3.1    Research Design -                                             <br/>3.2    Study Area - -                                             <br/>3.3    Population of the Study - -                                   <br/>3.4    Sample Size - -    -    -                                   <br/>3.5    Sampling Techniques -    -                                   <br/>3.6    Instruments for Data Collection -                              <br/>3.7    Methods of Data Analysis -    -                              <br/>CHAPTER FOUR: DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS          <br/>4.1    Data Presentation and Analysis -                              <br/>4.2    Analysis of Research Questions -                              <br/>4.3    Test Hypothesis -    -    -    -                              <br/> CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY, CONCLUSION, RECOMMENDATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS<br/> 5.1    Summary -                                                  <br/>5.2    Conclusion                                                  <br/>5.3    Recommendations -                                        <br/>5.4    Suggestions                                                  <br/>References    -                                                  <br/>Appendix    -                                                  <br/>Questionnaire                                                  <br/>  CHAPTER ONE<br/> INTRODUCTION<br/> 1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>In idah urban community, as in most other parts of the country, procreation is one of the major functions of the family. Every man take a wife apparently to have children with them, where this main purpose for marriage is not forth coming into fulfillment, it is then result to tension in most cases which lead to misunderstanding and disputes in the family. In traditional igala society, many wives try to ensure the procreation of children to its fullest limit.<br/>For most of history, childlessness has been regarded as great personal tragedy involving much emotional pain and grief, especially when it is resulted from failure to conceive or from the death of a child (Mail, Charlene, 1986). Before conception was well understood, childlessness was usually blamed on the woman and this in itself added to the high level negative emotional and social effects of childlessness. Some wealthy families also adopted children as a means of providing heirs incase of childlessness or where no son had been born, the monetary incentives offered by westerners desire for children is so strong that a commercial market in the child laundering business exists (McCurry, 2005).<br/> 1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>Throughout the world and particularly in African societies, igala land not exempted, the word “childlessness” se listener and a sense of pity is immediately aroused in the mind. In igala land, children are regarded as great treasure to their parents, relations and their immediate community. Many people suffer from childlessness for so many reasons such as drug abuse, hard drugs effect, contraception, numerous abortions, and genetically inherited sickness and in most cases, psychological problems.<br/>The number of childless couples is tremendously on the increase, this is evident to the fact that attempts to initiate a move which would have been directed towards adoption is taken with serious resistance in some places mostly by couples without even a child. Meanwhile, most couples are childless as a result of the degree of their waywardness while they were youths or younger and unmarried, such as illicit use of drugs in order to avoid pregnancy (Ugwuanyi, 1999).<br/>In idah urban community, childlessness is echoed by the fact that most couples are not aware of the prevalence of medical treatment; this therefore makes them not to seek medical assistance for such form of ailment. According to Nwapa (2004), some couples attribute their problem of childlessness to the supernatural, the hope in God that gives children to remember them at the appropriate time while some couples usually fall back to the fact that adoption, they are comforted for being biological infertile, they no longer want to know the cause of their infertility and solve it or get rid of it Hales, (2000).<br/> According to Dike (2013), the police have smashed a suspected syndicate whose alleged stock in trade was defrauding desperate barren women through false miracle babies. He also narrated the agony of a 61year old barren woman who travel to port Harcourt to consult miracle workers God was using to bless the barren and make them fruitful, they told her to pay #1.5 million, she paid the money and was given some seed to eat, after eating it, she began to stool. It took about nine months before the miracle<br/><br/>\n\nCHILDLESSNESS AND SOCIO CULTURAL IMPACT ON MARRIED COUPLES( A CASE STUDY OF IDAH COMMUNITY IN KOGI STATE)<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CHILDLESSNESS AND SOCIO CULTURAL IMPACT ON MARRIED COUPLES( A CASE STUDY OF IDAH COMMUNITY IN KOGI STATE)", "id": 215}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>EFFECTS OF STAFF MOTIVATION ON JOB PERFORMANCE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The social nature of the human animal makes the phenomenon of needs a sine-qua-non. Because human needs are insatiable, there has always been a continuous craving by man to satisfy his ever-growing needs. Yes! The satisfying of man’s needs, does it motivate him to higher performance and subsequently breeding higher productivity? Has there been fairness or equality in the attitude of employees? Equally, has the employees been duly consulted on their needs as employees? These among other things and questions are what this research work seeks to explore and answer. At the end of this work, we may have ascertained the level of the effects motivation has on job performance with specific consideration of Intercontinental Bank Plc. Onitsha Branch.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       Background to the Study<br/>The study of motivation and behaviour is a search for answer to the perplexing question about human behaviour (Hersey and Blanhers, 1979). The Motivation of people in organization through a popular subject of discussion in seminars, symposia, workshops and written professional journals and books, yet is one of the least understood concepts as a management technique (Francis and Milbourn, 1980). Often people do not know why others behave the way they do.<br/>            Why they are behaving differently at present and how they may likely behave in future under the same conditions (Herbey and Blench, 1979). It is the responsibility or organisational managers to motivate their subordinates and employees to raise their level of output.<br/>            Motivation is a force that is directed by the behaviour of people. It is thus a major factor that determines employees’ means of satisfying their needs as to improve their job performance. Financial institutions are specially considered in this project as areas whose success and survival depends strongly on the ability of the workers to efficiently utilize the available material resources in order to achieve the organisational goal.<br/>            For such task to be performed employees need a lot of incentives as well as a conducive working environment in an organization in order to spur up the workers to work harder for a greater achievement.<br/>            The job attitude of most financial institution workers in Nigeria and Anambra State especially has generated a lot of interest among scholars. The growing interest has always resulted to the seminars and workshops on job satisfaction and motivation. The main concern has always been on how to manage workers in order to put their maximum effort. So far the attempt made has not yielded the required result.<br/>            It is a common reason why Nigerian workers are always being described as “lazy” unproductive, redundant, non-challant and irresponsible.<br/>            Though there is a unanimous agreement on how to motivate a worker, I feel the worker has a need to be met and until this need is met, the worker’s attitude towards his work would remain bad. While some scholars have attempted to identify the various aspects of workers need.<br/>            Alao (1984:16) and Anikpo (1984:38) felt that some of these needs have made workers exhibit negative attitudes towards their job. As the case with the present situation in Anambra State where the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) embarked on a strike action following the refusal of the state governor, Mr. Peter Obi to increase the wages of staff that was agreed upon. The financial institutions are the most affected by this situation especially with the present state of financial crunch in the country and Anambra state in particular resulting in social unrest and holding up activities in financial institutions.<br/>            This research work therefore is set to answer questions raised above as well as to examine the views of scholars on the impact of motivation of staff on job performance with particular reference to the Intercontinental Bank Plc., Onitsha.<br/>1.2       Statement of Problem<br/>            Motivation influences human behaviour in any work place. In recent years, it has been evident that there has been a general drop in the overall rating of performance of financial institutions. It is noted that in Nigeria that when workers are motivated, there will be a high productivity but in western countries other factors rather than money motivate workers.<br/>            Does this hold true in Nigeria? Have employees been duly consulted on their needs as employees in the financial institution? This research work is designed to study these problems.<br/>1.3                Research Questions <br/>       To carry out this research therefore, the following questions have been formulated by the researcher.<br/>1.         What motivate employees in the financial sector?<br/>2.         In what ways can employees in financial institutions be motivated?<br/>3.         What are the factors responsible for work attitudes in financial institution?<br/>4.         What are the possible solutions to the challenges facing employee in the financial institution?<br/> 1.4       Objectives of Study<br/>            For some years most organizations and industries, both public and private, have showed concern on increased productivity and have produced a wealth of literature on the issues of motivation. Therefore the objectives of the study are as follows:<br/>(1)        To establish what motivates employees in the financial sector.<br/>(2)        To find out how employees of financial institutions can be motivated.<br/>(3)        To ascertain the factors responsible for work attitudes in financial institutions.<br/>(4)        To suggest the possible solution to the challenges facing employees in the financial institutions.<br/> 1.5      Significance of Study<br/>            This research is aimed at finding out how to make employees increase their performance and hence increase productivity. It is intended to contribute to the growing literature on work motivation here in Anambra State, especially on financial institutions. It is also hoped that the study will provide a practical guide to the solution of perennial labour unrest in Nigeria.<br/>            Another major significance of this research is its theoretical usefulness. Since the study is based on experimental data, it would yield insights that will affirm or challenge some of the basic assumptions of the classical theories of motivation.<br/>            In addition, this research will make meaningful contribution in the area of public especially those that affect financial institutions.<br/> 1.6      Definition of Concepts<br/>Capital: This is defined as wealth which may be used for producing more wealth.<br/>Labour: All human efforts of any kind, mental or physical, are known collectively as labour.<br/>Money: Is something which people generally accept a payment. Money is a medium of exchange.<br/>Motivation: To provide someone with a very strong reason or cause for doing something.<br/>Production: This is defined as the transformation of one thing into another.<br/><br/>\n\nEFFECTS OF STAFF MOTIVATION ON JOB PERFORMANCE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECTS OF STAFF MOTIVATION ON JOB PERFORMANCE", "id": 216}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ASSESSMENT OF SERVICES OF THE PHYSICALLY CHALLENGED IN ENUGU STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The necessity to improve the plight of the physically challenged in Enugu State gave rise to the assessment of the services of the centre for the rehabilitation of the physically challenged persons in Enugu State. It is worthy to note that this thesis is specifically tailored to appraise the performance of the centre and ascertain the extent to which these services have promoted the overall welfare and wellbeing of the inmates of the centre.  Moreso, this study strives to unravel various besetting the general operations of the centre. This study made specific recommendations that could improve the services of the centre vis-à-vis the development of the inmates. Essentially, this research work is divided into five chapters, so as to articulate and analyze all the major issues involved in the rehabilitation of the physically challenged in Enugu State.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       Background to the Study<br/>            The quest for the rehabilitation of the physically challenged has always been a major concern and challenge to many governments in different countries of the world especially among the African Nations. Every human society is undoubtedly faced with enormous problems of daily provision of certain services to its teaming populace. Rehabilitation of the physically challenged people on Nigeria has become an increasing societal problems basically because of ineffective social policy.<br/>            According to Isaac (2004), the physically challenged in Nigeria have bee confronted by chronic problems which often incapacitate their social and emotional development. In his words, the physically challenged are those who have non-sensory physical limitations, that is not because of sense organs like eyes or ears, but because of other organs like limbs, bones, joints, or muscles studies have shown widespread lack of adequate and sustainable care for the physically challenged in Nigeria society (Shamer, 2002). These problems facing the physically challenged in Enugu State are sequel to lack of inter-sectoral approach towards their plight. The need to improve the welfare and wellbeing of the physically challenged in our society led to the establishment of Emene Rehabilitation centre, whose sole mandate is to ensure complete and unconditional rehabilitation of the physically challenged.<br/>            But one basic question that should be of concern to every Nigerian is how the government has faired in providing supportive services to these people and to what extent has the Enugu State Rehabilitation centre rendered its services to the physically challenged? The centre mentioned above was established to render services to earn a living and contribute to the development of the society to which they are members.<br/>            However, it is regrettable that the centre has performed below expectation. In essence, this research study is designed to thoroughly and meticulously do an assessment of the services of the physically challenged in Enugu State Rehabilitation Centre. This is necessary if we really want to appreciate the plight of the physically challenged and improve their standard of living. This will create an enabling environment and provide a platform for the formulation of feasible socio-economic policies aimed at enhancing the overall status of the physically challenged in our society particularly in Enugu State. Most Nigerian children who are physically challenged would contribute meaningfully to society in all spheres of life if they are rehabilitated and reintegrated into the society.<br/> 1.2      Statement of the Problem<br/>            Over the years, there have been series of social policies by successive governments in the country which were designed to guarantee meaningful and sustainable development of every member of Nigerian society. Most of the target goals failed owing to ineffective framework as well as unfaithful implementation of the policies.<br/>            There are millions of Nigeria people who have been victims of this unfortunate circumstance following their physical limitations. They are always confronted with the problem of developing under rehabilitating economic, social or psychological conditions as many wallow in crises because of high level and rate of poverty in the society.<br/>            In Nigeria, the government ha designed child legislations and child welfare services as means of reducing the problem of the Nigeria children. There are lots of child legislations that stipulate the social welfare services that are provided to children in Nigeria. It is one thing to stipulate child welfare services, and another thing to provide the services to the children as stated in the legislations and policies. Looking at the Nigeria children who are supposed to be the direct beneficiaries of these child welfare services, one may actually provide especially to the physically challenged in Enugu State.<br/>            This work is basically tailored to elaborate on the welfare services of the physically challenged in the rehabilitation centre Emene in Enugu State. The researcher is set to appraise the services of the centre so as to establish whether the centre actually provide its services to the physically challenged in State. In other words, this research work will determine the factors that impede or promote the operations and performance of the centre. Effective rehabilitation of the physically challenged in Nigeria and Enugu State in particular has become a global issue in the contemporary time.<br/>1.3       Research Questions<br/>            There are a number of issues, and questions that this research study intends to verify and find answers to in the course of this research. To this extent, the following research questions will be employed.<br/>1.         What are the problems besetting the rehabilitation of the physically challenged in Enugu State?<br/>2.         What welfare services are available to the physically challenged in Enugu State?<br/>3.         What is the general attitude of the public towards the plight of the physically challenged?<br/>4.         What are the factors that impede the overall performance of the centre for the rehabilitation of the physically challenged in Enugu State?<br/>5.         What roles should Non-Governmental Organisations and civil society organizations play in the rehabilitation process?<br/>6.         What is the impact of social welfare services on the physically challenged in Enugu State?<br/> 1.4      Objectives of the Study <br/>            The general objective of this study is to assess the services provided to the physically challenged in Emene Rehabilitation centre. The specific objectives are as follows:<br/>1.         To ascertain the welfare services available to the physically challenged in Emene rehabilitation centre.<br/>2.         To determine various factors that impedes or promotes operations of the centre.<br/>3.         To find out the supportive legislations for the physically challenged in Nigeria.<br/>4.         To suggest strategies for effective rehabilitation of the physically challenged.<br/>1.5       Significance of the Study<br/>            The prevailing socio-economic and psychological trauma of the physically challenged justifies this research study. In any academic research of this nature, the main significance of study could simply be of two folds, that is theoretical significance and practical significance.<br/>The Theoretical Significance: This work will provide a tentative basis for future study of social welfare services and legislations available for the physically challenged in Nigeria. Given its precedence, other researchers will find this work a valuable resource material that will contribute towards the enhancement of the plight of the physically challenged. This work will also help in policy-making and formulation, as it will give ideas on how the existing legislations can be amended in order to be applicable considering the socio-economic status of the physically challenged.<br/>Practical Significance: A very good grasp of the practical benefits of social welfare services and legislations will contribute immensely to effective rehabilitation of the physically challenged in our society. This research work is relevant to various organizations, agencies, and individuals, who may have the interest of the physically challenged at heart. In essence, it will give a first hand challenged to the government and on-governmental organizations who are responsible for the welfare of Nigerians who are physically incapacitated.<br/>            Finally, this work will assist the centre for the rehabilitation of the physically challenged in Enugu State to evaluate the degree of its rehabilitation programmes and services.<br/> 1.6      Definition of Concepts<br/>            The research will define some of the terms or concepts that are adopted in this research work. These concepts will include the following:<br/>Physically Challenged: These are people who are notable to do things without external support.<br/>Physical Limitations: This refers to the body incapacitation of a person.<br/>Social Welfare: This is an organised system of social services and groups within satisfying standards of life and health, personnel and social relationship.<br/>Physical Neglect: This is an act of omission that endangers a persons health or society. This includes lack of provision of adequate food, clothing, shelter or supervision.<br/>Socio-economic Status: This refers to the total earnings of a person as well as his/her educational and occupational level.<br/>Legislation: This is law made to guarantee adequate welfare services for the physically challenged.<br/>Social Policy: This refers to a persistent course of action taken to provide solution to a social problem.<br/>Rehabilitation: This refers to restoring the physically challenged socially, economically, occupationally and mentally to maximize usefulness of which he/she is capable.<br/><br/>\n\nASSESSMENT OF SERVICES OF THE PHYSICALLY CHALLENGED IN ENUGU STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF SERVICES OF THE PHYSICALLY CHALLENGED IN ENUGU STATE", "id": 217}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>AN ASSESSMENT OF THE REHABILITATORY FUNCTION OF NIGERIAN PRISON SERVICE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The central thrust of this research is to assess the Rehabilitatory function of Nigeria prison using Makurdi prison. Prison have always been considered as rehabilitative and reformatory centre, However, in reality as a result of a number of factors this may not be completely successful as expected. It may become a breeding ground for criminals. This is the problem facing every society and Nigeria prison are not insulated from this problem. Against this backdrop this study attempts to empirically assess the rehabilitation in Nigeria prison with Makurdi (Medium security Prison ) as a case study. To achieve this sample size, of 20 prison officials and 80 inmates were selected through simple random sampling by the use of prison register. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected through the use of questionnaire and interview method. Also the analysis of data was through the combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis. This result of the data analysis showed that  the respondents varied in socio-demographic characteristics such as  age, sex, marital status, educational qualification, religion offence committed etc. Further, the data showed that many of the inmates said that there is Rehabilitatory scheme such as carpentry work, electrical work ,shoe making etc. Through some opined that despite the existing scheme it was only meant for convicts and only awaiting trail inmates  were excluded from t benefiting in such schemes. The data also showed that the few among the inmates who are convicts said that they would be better person on release and will enable them secure job either at formal or informal sector. Most of the inmates considered the prison as place of rehabilitation are inadequate, Also, the study showed that inadequate funding ,societal stigmatization, congestion, inadequate attention from government has contributed to the hitches of rehabilitation in Makurdi prison. Despite the aforementioned problems the prison still has been able to play the role of rehabilitation at a small measure. Finally, the study discovered that congestion of inmates, stigmatization of  convicts by the society has been a big challenge to the institution, On the basis of the findings the study recommended that issues of prison rehabilitation and reformation must be taken seriously in other to achieve the set objectives of rehabilitation which the prison was established.<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>                                                INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1  Background to the Study<br/>       Prison is an institution designed  to securely house people who have been convicted of crime or are on awaiting trial. These individuals known as prisoners or inmates are kept in continuous custody on a short or long-term basis. Individuals who commit the most heinous crime are sent to prison for more years, the more serious the offence ,the longer the prison term imposed (Microsoft Encarta 2008).<br/>        Also according to McCorkle and Korn (1970)., Prison can be defined  as a physical structures in a geographical location, where a number of people living under highly specialized condition utilize the resources and adjust to the alternatives presented to them by a unique kind of social environment.<br/>A prison is seen as a total institution or a place of residence  and work  where a large number of  like situated individuals are cut off from the wider society for appreciable period of time together lead and enforce formally administered round of life.<br/>      Adelola, (1982), opined that the physical appearance of prison is of  tall wall supplanted with barbwires an iron gates antiquated buildings separated<br/>Prisons from its larger community outside. These isolated structures according to him are meant to accomplish the confinement aspect. While confinement is made to detach the prisoners from his previous infectious groups, this new, environment is expected to provide the prisoner with particular opportunities of rethinking, stock taking and repentance from old ways.<br/>         Historically, this type of punishment for crime had been determined by economic and political relationship rather than by the public police or any Penological theory. In early English or German law, a system of adjusting  wrongs and injuries existed. where by the offender was  able to buy off the vengeance against him and his kin by compensation, fines, mutilation, banishment ,enslavement and death were other types of  punishment for offenders, Long-term imprisonment was virtually unknown until modern times. In ancient Greece and Rome for example, Mamertine  prison, constructed in Rome in the  17th century B.C, consisted of  a vast network of dungeons under the cities main sewer (Morris 1978: 475). These subterranean laws held political dissident and criminals for periods of time in cramped, miserable conditions. However, the  practice of confining wrong doers for long period as<br/>in form of punishment was not wide spread until after 15th century (Microsoft Encarta, 2010).<br/>       More so, imprisonment as a form of punishment of offenders was not known to many pre- colonial communities in African. There were traditional institutions in Nigeria that served as prison before British rule. For example, the  ‘‘Evedo” of  Edo group and  “Ogboni” of  Yoruba  group houses respectively were all places for keeping those put away for some time while other forms existed among the Fulanis and Tivs  (Akeredulo Ale 1979:156)<br/>        Rehabilitation according to oxford advanced learner’s dictionary means to help some body returned to a normal life or therapy.<br/>       Rehabilitation  penology was said to have developed at the  beginning of the 20th century in England (Carten and Cook,1989). It was more concern with the criminal than mere punishment. In other words, an individual sentencing was aimed at removing the causes of his criminal behavior (Tamerbraun 19780.<br/>         Prison goals as laid down in the Nigerian Prison training manual state that prison service establishment, are based on the custodial and rehabilitative roles of prison of prison institutions usually, the resettlements of discharging<br/>prisoners into purposeful, meaningful community life is the major role and aim<br/>of the Nigerian prison. Accordingly, prison education and vocational training programmes have been at the centre of the process adopted by the institutions in the realization of these goals. One hidden agenda of  imprisonment has been to punish criminals for their crime and to deter offenders  from committing crime. The way prisoners perceive the objectives of  imprisonment, it is assumed will affect their responsiveness to prison  rehabilitation programmes, especially vocational training. But up till date  this continues  to be the  ideal picture of  Nigerian  prison and other prisons world wide.<br/>           According to Awake (2005), there are four reasons why law  breakers are put in prison to punish the offender. To rehabilitate the criminal, teaching him or her to be law abiding and productive after release , to protect the  society and prevent future crimes has been the  ideal role of Nigeria prisons.<br/>         Although prison policy called for  provision of  legal, religions, educational , vocational, and social welfare services, Nigeria’s prison system as in most third world  countries is grossly  inadequate. There is no systematic classification of prisoners, so that young and the old, and suspects  for minor offences most of  whom are pretrial detainees and  first time offenders incarcerated for  extended  periods and eventual release  upon acquittal  were<br/>inter-mixed with dangerous  and deranged criminals or repeat offenders. This  has worsened the role of  Nigeria prison to rehabilitate inmates or prisoner effectively.<br/>          However, the extent to which Nigerian prison fulfils these roles may be doubtful in view of the nature of the treatment of the offenders and resources available to accomplish these roles of rehabilitating inmate in prison. Therefore, the major concern of this study is to carry out an assessment of  the rehabilitative function of Nigeria prison to see whether Nigeria prison are accomplishing these set tasks  of rehabilitation for which they were established using the Makurdi Medium Security Prison to determine to what extent it has successful in performing this function of rehabilitation and to proffer solutions.<br/>1.2  Statement of research  problem<br/>       One begins to wonder whether the Nigerian prison  is performing  these role of rehabilitation as a set  objective considering the tremendous upsurge  in the number of crimal activities such as: arm robbery, burglar, economic saboteur, drug pushing ,pipe-line vandalism, coup d’état and other dissident whose action threatens the social fabric of the nation.<br/>        Also over the year, the prison as   rehablitatory institution has been subject of various studies. However, very  little attention has been paid to how the<br/>system of government and other external factors affects positively or negatively on rehabilitation in prison in Nigeria. There is a growing concern among the Nigerian public that prisons are fast loosing its value to the fact that it has failed to rehabilitate and reform criminals. Studies have shown that the condition of most Nigerian prison is unfavorable for the full realization of rehabilitation goals.<br/>         For instance, life in Nigerian prison is so regimented to the extent that it appears that the primary purpose is punctive. Once as put succinctly by Chiemeka B. (2005;5) is that  the current state of affair of  prisons can only  take  criminals off the street for a while, it seems that they do little, if any thing to deter  crime in the long term.<br/>   Some prisoners come out of the prison  and form a clique of hoodlums and engage in criminal activities that are more devastating and debilitating to the society. The work therefore, is designed to bring lime or make an assessment of the rehabilitative function of Nigeria prison in Makurdi. The following questions are designed to guide the study.<br/>1.3  Research Questions<br/>1.   What is the extent of rehabilitation in Nigeria prison service?<br/>2.   What are the living conditions of inmates in Makurdi prison?<br/>3.   What are the barriers to rehabilitation in Nigeria  prison service?<br/>4.   What can be done to make noble prison objectives of rehabilitation in Nigeria prison more  realizable?<br/>1.4  Objectives of the Study<br/>The general objective of this study is to assess the rehabilitation of prisoners (i.e inmates) in Makurdi prison. To attain this objective, the following objectives were used.<br/>i.     To assess the extent of rehabilitation in the Nigeria prison service.<br/>ii.   To assess the living conditions of the prisoners with respect to accommodation, feeding, recreational facilities e.t.c.<br/>iii.              To find out the barriers to rehabilitation in Nigeria prison service.<br/>iv.              To proffer solution that could make noble prison objectives of rehabilitation more realizable.<br/>1.5  Significance of the study<br/>        Since such has not been done in Nigeria, thus this study when carried out will elicit necessary feed stock, which can facilitate the improvement of rehabilitation among prisons inmates in Makurdi and Nigeria at large. This study will generally provide a window to a glimpse into the factors affecting the performance of the Nigerian prisons  in the rehabilitation of inmates.<br/>          This study is also significant because if carefully carried out or done will serve  as a spring board for future research  in the field of rehabilitation among prisoners.<br/>         Finally, it can also aid policy making towards the improvement of the prisons system in Nigeria such that after prisoners might have been released will have been acquainted with skills for self sustainance and will go along  way to foretell and expose criminal activities in Nigeria.<br/>1.6   Definition of terms        <br/>      In this study, efforts will be made to provide operational definition of important concepts as below:<br/>A. Rehabilitation: According to Ahire . (2004:8) rehabilitation refers to post- release efforts made to make it easier for the offender to resettle (or be resettled) in the society. Also according to the national Development Policy  of  Nigeria(1989:4) defined rehabilitation as a process whereby a disabled person is restored to the fullest physical, mental, psychological, social, vocational and economic usefulness of which the individual is capable. In my own view, rehabilitation could <br/>B.   mean to recivilize  an individual who have erred or breached a law to become a conformer to conventional rules.<br/>C.    Prison: (1997:33) define prison as A place or building delimited and declared as such by law of the state and created to ensure restraint and custody of individual accused or convicted of  violating the criminal laws of the state. According to M C Corke and Korn (1971) Prison can be defined as a physical structure in a geographical conditions utilize the resources and adjust to the alternatives presented to them by a unique kind of social environment. The researcher view the prison to be a building that houses people that are been accused or convicted of crime to serve as punishment and deference to potential offender or violators.<br/>D.   Prisoners: Prisoners according to oxford learners dictionary, a prisoner is a person who is kept in  a conformed place known as the prison as punishment while they are awaiting for trial. In my own understanding a prisoner is an offender or law breaker who is kept in the prison and undergoes some certain punishment as he awaits trail.<br/>E.    Punitive: Punitive according to the oxford advanced learners dictionary,<br/>F.    they are very severe measures or punishment that people find it difficult to pay ‘taxes’ which are intended as punishment.<br/>G.   Punishment: Punishment are rough treatment or an act of punishing, inflicting or imposing pains on an individual to deter others from committing crime.<br/>H.   Imprisonment: Imprisonment is to put somebody in a prison or in another place from which they cannot escape.<br/>I.       Inmates: An inmate according to the oxford advanced learners dictionary are persons living in instituted on such as a prison or a mental hospital.<br/>J.      Offender: An offender is a person who commits crime or who is a violator of law.<br/>K.   Rehabilitatory institutions: According to Ahire . (2005) Rehabilitatory  institutions are organization that have particular purpose that are aimed at helping somebody to have a normal useful life again after they have been very sick or in prison for a long time.                                  <br/><br/>\n\nAN ASSESSMENT OF THE REHABILITATORY FUNCTION OF NIGERIAN PRISON SERVICES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AN ASSESSMENT OF THE REHABILITATORY FUNCTION OF NIGERIAN PRISON SERVICES", "id": 218}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE BEIJING CONFERENCE AND ITS INFLUENCE ON GENDER EQUALITY<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Gender equality is one of the major problem that is affecting people in the society, it affect everybody in one way of the other. The study identified the level of gender equality in Makurdi local government Area, Benue State. The objective of the study is to explain the causes of gender equality in Makurdi. To explain the roles and status of women in Makurdi local government area, Benue State. To determine or explain how gender equality hinder or affect the Social economic and political development of people in Makurdi. Data was collected from one source which is the primary through the use of questionnaire: Sample from the research is one hundred and twenty (120) people, which was gotten through random technique. Table 10 from the findings indicates that the status and roles of women in Makurdi local government Area of Benue State have considerately change after the Beijing conference, it shows that as much as 95(79.1%) respondents agreed that formal education for women in Benue State have increased over the years and teenage marriage declined. The study recommends that, there should exist a mutual relationship and inter-networking projects between local women groups, N.G.O’S and government agencies so that more women can be involved in the efforts towards achieving women empowerment. <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1                       Background to the study<br/>         The history of women equality in Nigeria can be traced to pre-colonial, colonial and post colonial to the present dispensation, globally, the struggle of gender equality occurred for over a long period of time by leading countries such as the United States of America, France and Britain (ojiakolor and Nwachukwu, 1998). Early efforts were made at the 4th world conference on women held in Beijing, china, between 4th _15th September, 1995 in order to adopt a women’s right charter which would allow women to compete favorably with their male counterparts and ensure global gender equality.<br/>       Despites the provision in the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, religion, ethnic group and state, it has been duly observed that the male folk in Nigeria have continued to treat women as inferior and subordinate.  Women have been grossly marginalized in organizations and public offices where leadership positions are reserved only for men, in most societies, the place of women no matter how educated they are believed to be, the kitchen. Toye olori,  (2005).<br/>      Going by statistics in Benue state, Angya (2003) holds that women have continued to be underrepresented in higher post in the civil service, judiciary executive and legislative arms of the government at the detriment of woman, although they have immensely contributed towards the nations socioeconomic development at least, women have remained the unheard voice, disempowered by un even distribution in the allocation of power, wealth and status. Women in Makurdi area of Benue state have been stratified, manipulated, relegated and marginalized against the back drop of a century were they represent a potent force in agricultural and economic production and also constituting an unprecedented percentage of global population.<br/>     There are various disparities in the socio existence of people due to the  differences based on their sexes and fair balance which would ensure that one sex has no advantage over the other is what is implied here to mean gender equality, it is against this background that this research work aims at assessing the impact of the fourth world conference and women held in 1995, Beijing, china, the declaration and the adoption of the plat form for action on the status with particular reference to Makurdi local government area of Benue state.                                                                 <br/>1.2  Statement of the problem<br/>       Gender inequality has remained a serious problem in all societies world over.  The debate on women equality has attracted vast attention in many countries recently, the united state of America, various demonstration and protests over rights against discrimination and violence against women have become salient in the country’s history. In Makurdi Benue state, the situation is not quite different, it more appalling. Over the years, Benue state have experienced a tremendous occurrence of gender equality given the fact that women have contributed significantly to the general development of their various societies yet their effort are not recognized.    This is more evident in rural communities were women are actively involved in the cultivation of food and cash crops to boost the economy of family and state, but their effort in this direction are often not appreciated and they lack the right to decide in the allocation of the resources they produce.<br/>     Women in Makurdi local government area of Benue state have always played five key roles which include that of mother’s agricultural producers, sex providers, house wives and community organizers, but despite their increasing population and crucial roles in the development process, the division of roles between males and females assigns the subordinate position to females. This is usually prescribed by the dominant culture where by customary practices are biased against women and only serve to further oppress and subjugate, them.<br/>    This undermining their individual self esteem, rural communities in Benue state have approved practices such as preference for the male child, degrading widowhood rites, physical abuse, molestation and sexual abuse etc. even in urban centre’s and civilized circles, the stereotyped, gender roles condition women into accepting social debasements and over playing their felinity by accepting the position of the weaker sex, and this over emphasizing the dainty nature of their sex.<br/>    In other words, the question on the lips of many is what changes has the world conference on women held in 1995 in Beijing, china brought to Makurdi local government area of Benue state are exposed has not really changed for the better compared to what it used to be during the pre-colonial era , therefore the negligence of women as a main gender classification in Makurdi local government area of Benue state and how the    Beijing conference have influenced their status gave rise to the study of this research project.<br/>1.3    Research Question<br/>        The following research questions will guide this study <br/>a.     What are the causes of gender equality in Makurdi local government    area of Benue state?  <br/>b.      What are the roles and status of women in Makurdi local government area of Benue state?<br/>c.    How does gender inequality hinder or affect the social economic and political development of Benue state.<br/>d.    To what extent do the Beijing declaration and the platform for action affect gender equality in Makurdi local government area of Benue state?<br/>e.     How can discrimination against women and all forms of gender based violence be curbed. Makurdi local government area of Benue state.<br/>f.  How can women be empowered in Benue state. <br/>1.4       Objective of the study<br/>            Based on the research questions, the objectives of the study can be concisely summarized as follows<br/>a)   To explain the causes of gender equality in Makurdi local government area of Benue state.<br/>b)    To explain the roles and status of women in Makurdi local<br/>Government Area, Benue state?<br/>c)    To determine or explain how gender equality hinders or affects the social economic and political development of people in Makurdi local government area of Benue state?<br/>d)   To determine the extent Beijing declaration and the platform for action affect gender equality in Makurdi local government area of Benue state?<br/>e)    To ascertain how discrimination against women and all forms of gender based violence can be curbed in Makurdi local government area of Benue state?<br/>f)      To examined ways of empowering women in Makurdi local<br/>Government Area, Benue state?<br/>1.5       Significance of the study<br/>          The study of gender equality is a very sensitive barometer of social problems and an indicator that sheds light on many important social problems, and the level of development a society has attained.<br/>In Makurdi local government area of Benue state, the process of the establishment of gender equality is going ahead in an inseparable unity with society’s economic political and cultural process.<br/>This study is significant because it will highlight the role of gender equality in societal development, similarly, it is hope that the findings and recommendations of this study will help many Non- governmental organization (NGO), and international organizations in devising and planning appropriate ways towards women empowerment and it will also influence policy makers to better status of women in Nigeria.<br/>Finally, this research is hoped to serve as a source of information to various authorities that could help for further research project would also serve as a reference point for the other researchers interested in gender related issues.<br/> 1.6       Definition of terms <br/>Gender<br/>         Gender refers to those characteristics of men and women that are socially and culturally defined, that is the different behaviours, roles, expectations and responsibilities all men and women learn in the context of their own societies (American Health organization, 1997).<br/>            Women<br/>The united nations (1986) defined women as the feminine components of the human species who apart  from serving as a vehicle  of nurturing human life also sere agents for  fostering a whole some political, social and economic development in any society, women are different from male counterparts, which reflects the genetic and biological make up of the sexes.<br/>        Gender Mainstream <br/>According to the united nations economic and social council (1997;2), gender mainstreaming is the process of assessing the implications for women and men of planned action, including, legislation, policy and programming in all and at all levels.<br/>Gender Inequality<br/>Gender or women inequality is defined by article one of the united nations convention on the elimination of all forms of violence and discrimination against women as any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effects or purpose of impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economical, social, cultural, civil or any other field.<br/>                 Women Empowerment<br/>According to sand brook (1993), women empowerment can be defined as a process which involves the transformation of the economic, social, psychological, political and legal circumstances of women.<br/>Women empowerment also refers to the dismantling of the cultural norms and traditional practices that devalue, disempowered and disposes women, the process must also necessarily include the expansion of women’s access to educational opportunities, facilities for skill acquisition and positions of authority (Win, 2005)<br/>              Stereo Types<br/>These are over simplified but strongly ideas about the characteristics of males and females.<br/>       (Barsow 1986), they help maintain gender roles by shaping ideas about gender equality to which men and women are naturally suited (Barbara lioyd 1985).<br/><br/>\n\nTHE BEIJING CONFERENCE AND ITS INFLUENCE ON GENDER EQUALITY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\"

creating a syst flight by making reservations. As the world is turning into a global village with almost every aspect of human endavour getting computerized, the aviation industries management is looking forward to making available their flight reservations online.<br/>This project research involves the design and implementation of an airline reservations aimed at overcoming the undesirable problem associated with the manual system. Here, we design a computer program that will<br/>__ Replace the existing manual system.<br/> __Enable travelers to make flight reservation<br/>In this project, the implementation of the computerized system will be carried out using Php-Mysql.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/> INTRODUCTION<br/> 1.1            Background of the Study <br/> Throughout commercial airline history, the timely movement of aircraft, passengers and cargo has required the even more timely movement of information. This was never truer than today, where information has become not just an operational tool, but a competitive weapon. To capitalize on this information, the technological revolution and the information society have brought us a dazzling set of capabilities. But, they have also brought us a bewildering array of options for services, costs, methods and products. Many managers find themselves faced with too much of a good thing, too many alternatives. But, airline today means business. Commerce and tourism are the engines of economic development in today's world. In Airline industry, Airlines, airports, and even governments are competing against each other for travel related income. Staying in front means making investments in enhanced customer service tools, improved management awareness, quicker access to operational information, etc.<br/>All of the technology and service options, and the need to make rapid, well informed decisions, means that many organizations are finding it increasingly difficult, and expensive, to find and retain staff to meet the demands. The effective use of Airline Information System can help solve this problem.<br/> Multi-database system for seat reservation and ticketing is a very powerful integrated computer-based system for managing the technical operations activities of an airline, or aircraft fleet operator. The system can be used worldwide by large and small companies operating many types of fixed and rotary-wing aircraft.<br/> The software designed will be used to collect, store, and analyze information about seat reservation and ticketing within the industry.<br/> 1.2            Statement of the Problem <br/> As aviation industry is expanding, a lot of airlines are coming up. The passengers need to book for their flight tickets. The manual method of going to their local offices to book for their flight ticket is becoming obsolete and tasking. Flight schedule information needs to be publicized to passengers. Hence the need for a wide range of publicity and enabling direct information  passage to the centers.<br/>1.3            Aims and Objectives of the Study  <br/>In developing an airline seat reservation system, we will always keep in mind to provide to the users the best usability, flexibility and security. Therefore, we need to make the user interface very flexible and understandable.  Moreover, since the record updates is a database we need to<br/> consider about security issues so that flight reservation information retrieval is not interrupted. The new system is designed to take care of the following:<br/>   Create an online system for customers to view all domestic flights.<br/>   Create an online system for customers to view domestic flight schedule and their flight rate.<br/>  Enable online flight reservations.<br/>  Give online access to passenger’s s operations.<br/>   Showcase flight maintenance information to customers<br/>  Give passengers access to send their complaint about flight operations or services.<br/>  Creates online news publication for flight operators accessible to customers.<br/>  Makes available the number of flights operated by an airline.<br/>   Maintain a robust database for flight information management<br/> 1.4            Purpose of the Study <br/> The main purpose is to design and implement an airline seat reservation system. This system will also include flight schedule system and provides facilities for confirming flight tickets.<br/> 1.5            Significance of the Study <br/> In view of the rapid development of computer technology in virtually all fields of operation and its use in relation to information management, it has become important to look into the development of an seat reservation system to meet up with demands of the present day society. Therefore, the reservation booking helps so that management can obtain data regarding the flight reservations at any time.<br/>The project is aimed at designing, a new and better alternative system to help the organization to: -<br/>(a)              Produce available operational reports when needed.<br/>(b)             Safeguard data and information in the system.<br/>(c)              Reduced workload in the present system.<br/>(d)             Keep accurate record on flight reservations<br/>(e)              Reduce time wasted in data processing.<br/>1.6            Scope of the Study <br/> This project work will cover all aspect of flight reservation, confirmation of tickets, and flight schedule information. The project is a case study of Aero Airlines Nig Ltd.<br/>  1.7              Constraints and Limitations <br/>During the design of this work, much finance was required and owing to the financial melt down globally, the research was limited by finance and hence concentrated on the available materials within the locality.<br/> 1.8            Assumptions <br/>It is assumed that all the information gathered is correct and the design of the software was based on the data available.<br/>1.9            Definition of Terms <br/> FAAN –Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria<br/> IATA –International Air Transport Association<br/> ICAO –International Civil Aviation Organization<br/> Black box –Black box in computer science is a unit whose internal structure is unknown but whose function is documented.<br/>Black box testing - Black box testing is where the tester is presented with the specification of a component to be tested and uses this to derive the test cases.

Based on this therefore, this work was designed toinvestigate the socio-economic and cultural factors militating against rural development in Ideato North Local Government Area. Two hundred respondents were randomly selected and used. Questionnaire was the instrument used for data collection. The data collected were analysed using SPSS and chi-square, tables, charts and percentages were used to present the results. Several findings were made as regards socio-economic and cultural factors militating against rural development in Ideato North LGA. One major factor is that Ideato people are facing total neglect from the government which goes a long way in affecting their development negatively. Secondly, cultural belief system of the people also affects their development. Thirdly, inadequate planning of developmental projects caused by lack of collaborative efforts of the government and the youths also hinder development in Ideato North LGA. Finally it was recommended that government should focus more attention in the development of rural areas in order not to allow them fell neglected and rejected. Rural people should learn to welcome and harness development despite their cultural belief system and there should be a collaborative effort of the government and the people, more especially the youths in planning and implementation of rural development projects.<br/>  TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/> CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION<br/> 1.1      Background of the study<br/> 1.2      Statement of the problem<br/> 1.3      Research Questions<br/> 1.4      Objectives of the study<br/> 1.5      Significance of the study<br/> 1.6      Definition of Terms<br/> CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW<br/> 2.1      Conceptual Issues<br/> 2.2      Review of empirical literature<br/> 2.3      Review of Theories<br/> 2.4      Theoretical Framework<br/> 2.5      Study Hypothesis<br/> CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY<br/> 3.1      Study Design<br/> 3.2      Area of Study<br/> 3.3      Population of the Study <br/>3.4       Sample Size<br/> 3.5      Sample Techniques<br/> 3.6      Instrument for Data Collection<br/> 3.7      Administration of Instruments<br/> 3.8      Methods of Data Analysis<br/> CHAPTER FOUR: DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS<br/> 4.1      Introduction<br/> 4.2      Major issues of the research<br/> 4.3      Test of Hypotheses<br/> 4.4      Discussion of Findings<br/> CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY OF FINDINGD, CONCLUSION AND<br/> RECOMMENDATION<br/> 5.1      Summary of findings<br/> 5.2      Conclusion<br/> 5.3      Recommendation<br/> References  <br/>Appendix <br/>LIST OF TABLES<br/> Table 1:          Demographic characteristic of the respondents<br/> Table 2:          Respondents views on socio economic factors that hinder rural development<br/> Table 3:          Respondents views on socio cultural factors that hinder rural development <br/>Table 4:           Respondents   views   on   people��s----------------reactio<br/> Table 5:          Respondents views on whether rural dwellers help in facilitating rural Development<br/> Table 6:          Table 6: Respondents views on whether the youths have important role to play in rural development.<br/> Table 7:          Distribution of respondents by sex and factors militating against rural Developmen<br/> Table 8:          Distribution of respondents by age and factors militating against rural development<br/>Table 9:           Distribution of respondents by level of education and factors militating against rural Development<br/> Table 10:        Distribution of respondents by level of marital status and factors militating against rural development<br/>Table 11:         Distribution of respondents by level of occupation and factors militating against rural development<br/> Table 12:        Distribution  of  respondents  by  occupation  and  factors  militating  against  rural development<br/> Table 13:        Distribution  of  respondents  by  religion  and  factors  militating  against  rural development<br/> Table 14:        Distribution of respondents by age and factors militating against rural development<br/> Table 15:        Distribution of respondents by sex and factors militating against rural development<br/> Table 16:        Distribution of respondents by level of education and factors militating against rural<br/> development<br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1              Background to the Study <br/> In Nigeria, the rural areas are not progressing in line with urban areas or metropolitan states in term having sustainable development like good road, electricity, good telecommunication, transportation, good water supply, standard market and health centres, improved housing as well as improved agricultural and storage facilities that would help in sustaining the rural masses. McKnight (1995) defined the term rural development as the overall development of rural areas to improve the quality of life of the rural people.<br/> According to Ihumodu (2003), rural development is the process of economic and social progress aimed at eradicating poverty among rural populace through provision of life and satisfying the basic needs of the people. Eradicating poverty among rural people demands appropriate skill. Rural people are endowed with quantum of knowledge and traditional skills, but at their primitive levels, that needs development to fit in properly with the modern trends of thing (Stall &amp; Stoecker, 1998). This can be achieved through capacity building programmes. Capacity building is the process of developing skill, ability and faculties individually and collectively, that is vital in comprehending rural development and its roles in ameliorating rural poverty, ignorance, low human skill and literacy (Castelloe, 2002). All these are done to sustain the development of rural setting. Sustainable development vector (i.e. elements of desirable social objectives or attributes which societies seek to achieve through conserving natural resources (Pearce &amp; Barbier, 1999).<br/>Most rural societies are not able to achieve development because they lack the basic resources that would bring development or they are not able to harness and utilize theexisting resources that would enable them develop their society (Robinovitch, 1994). In Nigeria, this has been serious social issue in recent time.<br/>Socioeconomically, infrastructure and basic amenities like good road, portable water supply, electricity, health centres, markets, transportation, telecommunication, sports centers etc. affect development. This is true because, when all these essential things are lacking, development can hardly come or occur. Other important factors are illiteracy, ignorance and poverty. On the other hand, government neglect can also affect developmental process that will take place in the rural areas.<br/> Culturally, belief system of the rural people bridge development, for example, they find it difficult to release a particularland for development due to the belief that it is on that land sacrifices are being made for the gods of their land, secondly they find it difficult to release a particular land for development to avoid the destruction of their aesthetic values like trees and other things that bring about the beauty of their area. Another cultural factor is on land tenure system (ownership of land). This implies that some land owners in the rural areas do not like releasing or letting go of their land for building of factories, schools, market, churches, health centres etc. by the government or even private individuals who are capable of doing so. By so doing, development is swept under the carpet. Fear of terror and labelling are another vital cultural factor which affect development, for example, an individual who is financially capable can withdraw his intention to develop a particular rural area due to the fear of getting him killed by armed robber and evil men or being labelled a fraudster and also a ritualist.<br/> Rural development is a multidimensional and comprehensive concept; it encompasses the development of agriculture and allied activities, village and cottage industries and crafts, socio-economic infrastructure, community services and facilities and above all, human resources in rural areas. As a phenomenon, rural development is the end result of interactions between various physical, technological, economic, socio-cultural and institutional factors (Isife, 1998). According to Igbokwe (2000), rural development is a strategy designed to improve the economic and social wellbeing of a specific group of people, i.e., the rural poor.<br/> As a discipline, it is multi- disciplinary in nature, representing an intersection of agriculture, social, behavioural, engineering and management sciences (Kata Singh, 1999). Problems of rural areas could come as a result of the already stated factors, most importantly, on the area of deliberate neglect of the rural areas by the government. According to Prelleltensky (2004), rural development problems come as a result of governmental deliberate neglect or inability of the rural community to welcome development due to their cultural belief system etc. According to rural development strategies 2002, through rural development strategies, efforts of the people and that of the government are brought together to improve the economic social and cultural conditions of the rural areas, so as to integrate them into the life of the nation and allow them to enable their people contribute more to national growth. Falcoya, (1984) on the other hand stated that rural development strategies created an avenue for rural people to organize themselves for aplanning actions, define their common individual plans to meet the needs of the community and solve their problems, execute these plans with maximum reliance upon community resources and supplement these resources when necessary with services and materials from government and non-governmental agencies outside their communities.<br/> In addition, the issues concerning rural development should be government involved as well as rural dwellers involved so as to achieve a better solution to rural problems. That is to say that in order to achieve a better rural development in Ideato LGA, government and the rural people should integrate their efforts together. The study therefore tries looking into the socio-economic and cultural factors militating against development in Ideato Local Government Area of Imo State.<br/> 1.2              Statement of the Problem <br/>  The issue of rural development is very challenging, considering that more than 70 percent of the population live in the rural areas, where they cultivate the soil to make a living. Looking at this poverty level it thereforebecomes a social problem thatdemands urgent solution. One major factoraffecting rural development is government neglect or government not showing concern towards rural development. According to Nwankpa (2001), government should play pivotal role to making sure that development occur in the rural setting. Another important factor is on lack of basic infrastructure and basic amenities needed for development such as transportation, good roads, electricity, good school, portable water, health centres, markets, telecommunication, churches, recreational centres etc. When all these infrastructures and basic amenities are not available in a particular rural area, development finds it difficult to occur. Illiteracy, ignorance, and poverty serve as another important factor militating against rural development in Ideato rural community, Illiteracy, poverty and ignorance make or flop the developmental process in the rural areas, so making them to move backward (Edeh, 2003). Rural dispute is another factor militating against rural development. This implies that when dispute comes between two communities due to land, government who has planned bringing development can decide to withdraw it till the dispute or conflict is settled. Land tenure system as well as inability of the rural people to harnessing the available resources contributes to the backwardness of the rural areas, especially rural, Ideato.<br/> Furthermore, cultural beliefs of the people in the rural areas affect the development that will come therein, for example some rural areas always find it difficult to give government land for development due to the fact that the land is where sacrifices are mad for the gods of their land. Another fear they have is the destruction of theiraesthetic values by the government while the development projects are going on. Some individuals due to their selfish interest, find it difficult to dispose their land to the government for them to build structures like hospitals, schools, churches, recreational centres etc. According to Iyiogwe (2005), in his work on economic theory says land is free gift of nature, such as land surface, soil, rivers, mountains, forest, mineral deposits etc. Okorji (2005) restated that land is therefore nature's aid to production. Another cultural factor is the fear of terror and labelling. some private individuals avoid helping people in some developmental structures in the rural area in order not to get them killed or labelled as criminals, fraudsters or as ritualists by the rural people.<br/> More so, the problem of gender segregation is another crucial factor to be considered while discussing on the cultural factor militating against rural development. The reason is that sometimes women in the rural areas are not allowed to contribute in the issues concerning rural or community development. By so doing, the ideas of development becomes one sided which in turn affects the developmental processes. Women should be allowed to contribute in the developmental issues, whether political, economic, social and cultural. (Egbule, 2006)<br/>Based on statistics, 65 per cent of the lands in the rural areas are undeveloped due to total dominance by the owners. According to Ikpeama (2004), land is a free gift of nature, and development of any kind should be done on it, in as much as it will change the living standard of the people. 85 per cent of our rural dwellers are not living in comfortable homes, while 95 per cent of them are poor (Hossian, 2005). According to agricultural organization of the United Nations (2005), 95 per cent of the rural farmers cannot boast of using modern farming implements in theiragriculture. All these hindrances have continued to put the rural communities under a shackle of underdevelopment, in spite of the abundant human talents there in. this unavailability of basic economic infrastructure in the rural communities, hinders their potentials, especially being unable to generate enough for themselves and contribute to the nation's economic growth. Rural dwellers should be encouraged in their agricultural endeavours, which will in turn help in the nation's economic building (Preben Kaarshelin, 1991). When all these socio-economic and cultural factors that affect rural development are put in place, there will be a rapid rural development, especially in Ideato Local Government Area of Imo State.<br/>1.3              Research Questions <br/>The following research questions will guide the study<br/>1.                  What are the socio-economic factors that hinder rural development in Ideato Local Government Area?<br/>2.                  What are the cultural factors that hinder rural development in Ideato LGA?<br/> 3.                  What are the reactions of people to development in Ideato LGA?<br/> 4.                    To what extent have rural dwellers helped in facilitating rural development in Ideato LGA?<br/> 5.                  What are the consequences of improper rural development in Ideato LGA?<br/> 1.4              Objectives of the Study <br/>The main objective of this study is to investigate on the socio-economic and cultural factors militating against rural development in Ideato Local Government Area of Imo State. Its specific objectives are therefore as follows:<br/>1.                  To evaluate the socio-economic factors that hinder rural development in Ideato LGA.<br/> 2.                  To investigates the cultural factors that hinder rural development in Ideato LGA.<br/> 3.                  To ascertain the reactions of people to rural development in Ideato LGA.<br/> 4.                    To examine the extent rural dwellers have helped in facilitating rural development in Ideato LGA.<br/> 5.                  To ascertain the consequences of improper rural development in Ideato LGA.<br/> 1.5              Significance of the Study <br/> The significance of this study tends to treat both the theoretical and practical importance. Theoretically, this study will add to the already existing knowledge of the socio-economic and cultural factors militating against rural development in Ideato LGA. The study was written in order to know the problems of the rural people and at the same time proffer solutions to them. More so, the study will be a guide to future researchers in their research in knowing the socio-economic factors militating against rural development, and look for means of tackling those problems.<br/> Practically, this research work will enable the rural dwellers to know the importance of harnessing the available rich natural resources in their localities in order to bring about development in their areas. This can be done by making sure that the various natural resources in the rural areas are well managed, through their efforts and efforts of the government. This study will also make them to put in agenda the issues concerning rural development, more especially on the areas of infrastructures, such as good roads, electricity, portable water, health centres, and transportation.<br/>1.6              Definition of Terms <br/> For more understanding of this research work, the researcher has decided to define some of the terms which would be frequently used for easy understanding.<br/> Community : Okoh (1989), defined community in line with this study as group of people living in one geographical area and sharing the basic condition of common life. Example, family, a village, town or city, a tribe, among others.<br/> Community development: Thus simply means all the strategies aimed at promoting the socio-economic status of the rural communities. It aimed at motivating the rural dwellers to utilize their full potentials in attempt to embark on the project that will help better their lots. United Nations in line with this study defined community development as including the effort of the government united with that of the people themselves. Thus, the efforts of the people themselves are united with that of the governmental authorities to improve the economic and social well being of people to enable them to contribute fully in national progress.<br/> Development: The definition of development by Walter Rodney (1972) was used in order to explain this term<br/><br/>\n\n SOCIO ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL FACTORS MILITATING AGAINST COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IN IDEATO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF IMO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  SOCIO ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL FACTORS MILITATING AGAINST COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IN IDEATO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF IMO STATE", "id": 221}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE MALEVOLENCE OF NIGERIAN MOVIES IN OUR CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The media is evidently seen as one of the agents of socialization, in the study of the society. This means that the media is capable of influencing the attitude, character, lifestyle and culture of individuals either negatively or positively. Today, the nature of most Nigerian movies have grown or evolved from bad to worse, especially on the part of those that portray sex, pornography and vulgarity. This is evidently malevolent because since members of the audience of Nigerian movies also constitute members of the society, and the media, especially television, is as well, capable of influencing an individual’s behavior, the negative effects of these videos will also indirectly affect the society at large. Therefore, this study seeks to look at the extent of the malevolence of Nigerian movies in our contemporary society, by looking at the nature and content of these movies and why it is still being patronized by audience members despite its malevolent nature. The objectives of this study, aims at finding out the negative effects of Nigerian movies generally, and how it affects the society by posing as malevolent. This can be done by trying to ascertain if there is an over-emphasis of negative themes in Nigerian movies and identifying the negative effects or disadvantages associated with watching these movies as well as to find out how Nigerian movies can affect the society at large. The expected outcome of this study is that the government and parents as well will get to realize the level of negative influence that watching of home videos has on not just people, but on the society at large. Though various methods of data collection suitable for this study include, observation, questionnaire and interview, but the only method of data collection used in the study was that of questionnaire.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1  Background to the Study<br/>Nigerian movies, popularly referred to as Nollywood movies, produced by the Nigerian film industry uses formats such as video cassette, video compact disc (VCD), and more recently the digital video disc (DVD), in producing their movies. These Nigerian movies are also shown on some channels such as “Africa Magic”, “Nollywood”, “Magic Africa”, etc, on DSTV, “Cine Africa”, “MYTV”, as well as other cable networks which people subscribe to and which are viewed by the audience through the television, which is classified under the types of media, among others.<br/>The media is evidently seen as one of the agents of socialization, in the study of the society. This means that the media is capable of influencing the attitude, character, lifestyle and culture of individuals either negatively or positively. Therefore, it is important to know what kind of movies are being produced for viewing, since as a result of technology, more and more people in the society, have access to television.<br/>According to Daramola(2005), “The mass media are very powerful socializing agents. The mass media are mainly newspapers, magazines, radio, television and movies. They are impersonal sources and they reach large, heterogeneous and widely dispersed audiences. Their exact role in socialization is controversial but as disseminators of news and entertainment, they are extremely influential. The mass media therefore, especially the television, have been linked by several studies of having great influence upon socialization of children, adolescents and even adults”.<br/>Consciously or unconsciously, people, most especially children and youth, learn different aggressive and violent acts as they constantly watch these movies and most times they end up exhibiting such acts within their neighborhood, in school and within other social gatherings. As they watch movies with violent themes, they are likely to exhibit various criminal acts like bullying, kicking, raping and other delinquent behaviors. (Oslow, 2003)<br/>The themes of these movies are indeed broad and covering Nigerian, African, and universal issues such as, the evils of polygamy, extra marital affairs, elopement, different forms of rituals, cultism, betrayal, marriage, witchcraft, incest, clash of Western and traditional cultures, landlords and tenants, widowhood, teenage pregnancy, drug trafficking, campus life, tribal conflicts, religious conflicts, organized crime, murder, etc (Akpabio, 2003:138-139).<br/>Some other movies have themes solely based on Christianity and the evils that go on in churches and among pastors, such as those produced by Mount Zion Ministries, for the purpose of spreading the gospel and pointing out the ills that go on even in churches. Some examples include, “Busy but guilty”, “Blood on the altar”, “One careless night”, etc. Many other movies could be educative and portray some Nigerian culture, while others could also be in form of documentaries, showing the history of some Nigerian culture as well as how it has evolved. An example of such documentary movies is “Towards a metaphysics”, produced in 2010. But unfortunately, the most common themes evident in the majority of Nigerian movies includes violence, which umbrellas cultism, murder, rape, aggressive fights, etc, and Romance, which covers sex, nudity and vulgarity or the use of strong language, etc. Another common theme is that of rituals and the use of traditional medicine.<br/>Most of these are evidently negative themes and are therefore malevolent to the development of personality and behavior of its audience members in our contemporary society, especially the youth and children who are still at the primary and secondary stage of their socialization or learning process, and are vulnerable or prone to picking up or adopting attitudes and behaviors from what they observe in the movies.<br/>The portrayal of negative themes has been the base of Nigerian film industry, probably because of the gains gotten from constant patronage from its audience as well as the interest the audience members have in pornography, nudity, violence and the likes. The industry was accused of over-emphasizing negative themes. The National Film and Video Censors Board, (the industry regulatory body), in its guidelines for motion picture producers, called for production to be above board in portrayal of violence, crimes, sex, pornography, vulgarity, obscenity and other sensitive subjects (NFVBC, 2000:107-111).<br/>Today, the nature of most Nigerian movies have grown or evolved from bad to worse, especially on the part of those that portray sex, pornography and vulgarity. From experience, a comparison of older films such as “Outcast 1 &amp; 2” and “Night Out (Girls for sale)” produced between 1999 and 2000 and more recent ones such as “Dirty Secret” and “Men in Love” produced between 2010 and 2011, has proven that the level of the portrayal of nudity, pornography and sex has become worse than before, the actors and actresses are now more comfortable with being nude, while acting.<br/>This is definitely malevolent to some audience members who will develop more interest in pornography and may eventually become addicts. This will not only increase the number of rape reports, but will also give rise to more and more cases of teenage pregnancies, abortion, as well as abandonment of unwanted babies which increases the number of children to be cared for at motherless babies homes.<br/>Another issue is the constant production and distribution of these movies, which goes to show that people actually patronize them by buying the movies for either personal viewing or to rent to people in video shops, in spite of the nature of most of these movies.<br/>Therefore, in trying to find out how home videos can pose as malevolent to our contemporary society, it is also important to find out what the members of the audience think about the nature of some of the themes portrayed in home videos, as well as what their attitudes towards such movies are, since it directly affects them.<br/>1:2 Statement of the Problem<br/>If an investigation or a study is carried out on the category of people that make up the majority of the audience members of Nigerian movies, the result will definitely prove that it is children, adolescents and the youth. The minority will be older people because of the responsibilities of going to work, earning a living and planning a home, which they are faced with. As the youth grow and mature into adulthood, they gradually lose interest in watching movies because they begin to prioritize some things over others and also develop a sense of responsibility (Daramola, 2005).<br/>A study by Liebert and Poulson (1972), cited by Hess at al (1988), reveals that children in Canada begin to watch television before they are three years old. By the age of eighteen, a child will have spent more time in front of the television than anywhere else, including school. In the United States of America, children watch over three hours of television per day.<br/>Schaefer and Lamm (1997) study, also reveal that apart from sleeping, watching television is the most time-consuming activity of young people. The same trend is going on in the Nigerian contemporary society, particularly in the urban cities. It is very common to find children watching movies and videos every day.<br/>Since members of the audience of Nigerian movies also constitute members of the society, and the media, especially television, is also capable of influencing an individual’s behavior, the negative effects of these videos will also indirectly affect the society at large. That is to say that if people adopt some certain behavior as a result of these movies, it could indirectly affect the society by creating social problems such as, increase in rape reports, abortion, over-crowding of motherless babies homes due to unwanted babies, violence, increased crime rates and juvenile delinquencies, e t c.<br/>Therefore, this study seeks to look at the extent of malevolence of Nigerian movies in our contemporary society, by looking at the nature and content of these movies and why it is still being patronized by audience members despite its malevolent nature.<br/>1.3           Research Questions<br/>This study will seek answers to questions such as:<br/>1.)   Is there an over-emphasis of negative themes in Nigerian movies?<br/>2.)   What are the negative effects or disadvantages associated with watching Nigerian movies?<br/>3.)   How can Nigerian movies affect the society indirectly?<br/>4.)   What are the best possible ways to prevent or reduce the negative effects or malevolence caused by Nigerian movies in our contemporary society?<br/>1.4           Objectives of the Study<br/>The major objectives of this study, is to ascertain the impact of Nigerian movies on the general society.<br/>The specific objectives of the study are as follows:-<br/>1.)   To ascertain if there is an over-emphasis of negative themes in Nigerian movies.<br/>2.)   To identify the negative effects or disadvantages associated with watching Nigerian movies.<br/>3.)   To find out how Nigerian movies can affect the society indirectly.<br/>4.)   To suggest ways to prevent or reduce the negative effects or malevolence caused by Nigerian movies in our contemporary society.<br/>1.5           Significance of the Study<br/>The study looks at the malevolence of Nigerian movies in our contemporary society. The study does not dispute the fact that the television which is one aspect of the media, is also very beneficial to learning and development processes, and as a matter of fact, goes a long way in socializing individuals by helping them blend more easily into the society due to the amount of information passed on to the audience through well coordinated motion pictures with various contents and storylines.<br/>As a medium of communication, the home videos are influential media and have the capacity of sending a wrong message or impression to the viewing audience especially young people in their vulnerable stages of growth. Moreover, such impression could spell a big problem to the entire society owing to the fact that the youth learn more easily from what they see or observe than from what they hear.<br/>However, as every research work is expected to add to the existing knowledge, this study should serve as a referencing material to students and other researchers who will be carrying out research on related studies.<br/>Also Nigerian film makers will benefit from the information contained here as a yard stick to measure the level of their weaknesses and compare it with the strengths they have which could serve as a guide to correcting their weak points for a better future of their products and the society at large.<br/>This study’s significance is also justifiable on the grounds that it will contribute largely to the understanding of the negative effects of home videos or the malevolent nature of some home videos towards our contemporary society, which would spur film makers to improve on the quality and the contents of the movies produced.<br/>Parents will also become aware or be exposed to the negative effects of movies and how they can influence their children’s behavior both on the long and short run. This would cause them to seek means of controlling their children’s viewing habits and be conscious of what they watch and the themes embedded in these movies. Resultantly, this would reduce the negative impacts, as well as the level of malevolence caused by movie watching in our contemporary society.<br/>Based on various theories, or rather as a result of these theories, film makers will then try to adhere to National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) laws by differentiating the age ratings for various movies, while the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation will also try to review and censor the movies before they get into circulation. And the parents on the other hand will ensure that children watch only the movies specified for their various ages.<br/>To conclude, this study is significant because it seeks to investigate these issues of negativity in movie themes and its effects on people and the society at large, as well as identify and proffer possible solutions to curb the problem, by finding out the roots of these problems. Although it may be impossible to completely erase them, the study seeks to discover how the problem can be reduced and controlled.<br/>1.6           Definition of Terms<br/>1.)  Malevolence:-<br/>According to ‘Merriam- Webster’s dictionary’, this can be defined as the quality or state of being productive of harm or evil. The Webster’s nu world collgate Dictionary defines it as, “wishing harm or evil, and showing or having ill will”. That is, the state of causing harm or evil.<br/>In this study, it means the harm caused by Nigerian movies. Malevolence here refers to the ability of Nigerian movies to be harmful to our society, or the harm caused by Nigerian movies in our contemporary society.<br/>2.)  Movie:-<br/>This is defined as “the showing of motion pictures or the motion picture medium”, by Merriam Webster’s Dictionary”.<br/>3.)  Nigerian Movie:-<br/>This refers to the Nigerian motion picture medium, or the showing of Nigerian motion-picture<br/>4.)  Contemporary:-<br/> According to the same source, contemporary is marked by characteristics of the present period. It is also seen as, “happening, existing, living or coming into being during the same period of time”.<br/> In this study, contemporary means, “this present day society, which we exist or live in”.<br/>5.)  Delinquency:- <br/>According to the Oxford Advanced learner’s dictionary, delinquency can be defined as bad or criminal behavior, usually of young people.<br/>Therefore delinquency is seen in this study as the criminal or bad behavior of Nigerian movie audience, as a result of watching movies especially the younger audience members.<br/><br/>\n\nTHE MALEVOLENCE OF NIGERIAN MOVIES IN OUR CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE MALEVOLENCE OF NIGERIAN MOVIES IN OUR CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY", "id": 222}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>FACTOR INFLUENCING SEXUAL HARRASSMENT AMONG STUDENTS IN EMMANUELALAYANDECOLLEGE OF EDUCATION, OYO<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Thisstudy investigated the factors influencing sexual harassment among students inEmmanuelAlayandeCollege of Education Oyo, OyoState.

Secondly, there is a need for student and their trainers to be educated on what constitutes sexual harassment. Strongly disciplinary measures, including dismissal must be taken to the lecturers who harass female students and legislation which protect female students from sexual harassment must be introduced as there seems to be unwillingness in the part of society to recognize the problem.<br/> TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1        Background to the Study                              <br/>1.2        Statement of the Problem                            <br/>1.3        Purpose of the Study                                   <br/>1.4      Research Questions                                     <br/>1.5      Significance of the Study                            <br/>1.6        Scope and Limitation of the Study                <br/>1.7        Operational Definition of Terms                     <br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>Review of Related Literature                                     <br/>2.1        Theoretical Background on Sexual Harassment       <br/>2.2        Theories of Adolescence                              <br/>2.3        Empirical Review of Literature on Sexual        <br/> Harassment                                              <br/>2.4        Causes of Sexual Harassment               <br/> 2.5        Effects of Sexual Harassment on the Academic       <br/>Performanceof Higher Institution Students in Schools       <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>3.0        Research Method                                             <br/>3.1        Research Design                                               <br/>3.2        Population of the Study<br/>3.3   Sample and Sampling Techniques<br/>3.4        Research Instrument                                        <br/>3.5        Validity of the Research Instrument<br/>3.6        Reliability of the Research Instrument                 <br/>3.7        Administration of Instrument                             <br/>3.8        Method of Data Analysis                                    <br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/> Analysis of Data and Results                                     <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>Summary, Conclusion and Recommendations               <br/>5.1      Summary                                                        <br/>5.2      Conclusion                                                       <br/>5.3      Recommendations                                            <br/>5.4      Suggestion for further studies                             <br/>References                                                   <br/>Appendix                                                      <br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1 BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>Sexual harassment is bulling or coercion of a sexual nature, or the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favours. In most modern legal contexts, sexual harassment is illegal. (Akinboye, 2009).<br/>As defined by the Adubuola, (1988) \"It is unlawful to harass a person (an applicant or employee) because of that person sex Harassment can include \"sexual harassment\" or unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours, and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature.<br/>The legal definition of sexual harassment differs by Jurisdiction. Sexual harassment is subject to a directive in the European Union. (Omideyi, 1988).<br/>Where laws surrounding sexual harassment exist, they generally do not prohibit simple teasing offhand comments, or mirror isolated incidents. In the workplace harassment may be considered illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it create a hostile or offensive work environment or when it result in an verse employment decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted, or when the victim decides to quit job). (Ojeme, 1994).<br/>The legal and social understanding of sexual harassment, however, varies by nature.<br/>In the context of US employment, the harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, Harjit, (2003)a co-worker or someone who is not an employee of employer, such as a client or customer and harassers or victims can be either male or female.<br/>The concept of sexual harassment, in its modern understanding, is a relatively new one, dating from 1970's onward; although other related concepts have existed prior to this in many cultures.<br/>The term sexual harassment was used in 1973 in \"Saturn's Rings\" a report authored by Mary Rowe to the then president and chancellor of about various forms of gender issues. (Coffey, 2008)<br/>Rowe has stated that she believes she was not the first to use the term, since sexual harassment was being discussed in women's groups in Massachusetts in the early 1970's, but that MIT may have been the first or one of the first large organizations to discuss the topic (in the MIT Academic Council) and to develop relevant policies and procedures. MIT at the time also recognized the injuries caused by racial harassment and the harassment of women of color which may be both racial and sexual (Kohlbery, 2001)<br/>The president of MIT also stated that harassment (and favoritism) are antithetical to the mission of a university as well as intolerable for individuals.<br/>In Nigeria, over the years, secondary education has regarded as the minimum educational qualification required for entering into higher citadel of learning or learning a trade, Awosika, (2002), regards secondary education as and still regarded by a greater percentage of Nigerian as necessary precondition for social mobility.<br/>In the same vein, Nwankwo, (2000), says secondary education is the gateway to higher social status, position and career success.<br/>Therefore, it is not amazing that the Ladeni, (2004) revised edition adopted education as an instrument per excellence for effective national development, it also proposed the objectives of education at all levels.<br/>The objectives of secondary education as stated in the national policy on education in specific terms should:<br/>i.              Provide an increasing number of primary school pupils with the opportunity for education of higher quality, irrespective of sex or social, religious and ethnic background.<br/>ii.            Diversity its curriculum to cater for the differences in talents opportunities and roles possessed by or open to higher institution students;<br/>iii.          Equip higher institution student to love effectively in our modern age of science and technology;<br/>iv.          Develop and protect Nigerian culture, art and language as well as the world cultural heritage.<br/>v.           Raise a generation of people who can think for themselves, respect the views and feeling of others, respect the views and feelings of others, respect the dignity of labour and appreciate those values specific under our broad national aims and level as good citizens;<br/>vi.          Foster Nigerian unity with an emphasis on the communities that unite us in our diversity, and;<br/>vii.        Inspire it higher institution student with a desire for achievement and self-improvement both at school and in later life Osuala, (1993).<br/>        Those objective(s) are worthwhile, however the achievement depend on their implementation Adarelegbe, (2001), while expressing his view on this argues that it is the task of the school to calculate moral and ethical values in learner's along with their learning experiences.<br/>The said task of inculcating moral values which was placed before the school is in line with what Adesina, (2002), described as production of boys and girls who stressed the need to wipe away moral decadence at all levels of education.<br/>The chief role of school is to bring higher institution students up morally to become acceptable adult in the society, moreover, the school is required to provide higher institution students with adequate knowledge for the preparation towards entering into a profession.<br/>Therefore, the educational, social and psychological roles of the school in the loves of the higher institution students are also paramount.<br/>However, drawing its members from diverse homes, the school serves as a meeting place for higher institution students of different socio-economic backgrounds to display worthwhile and vice-versa behaviours. Coffey, (2002).<br/>In the developing country like Nigeria, people tend to look at sexual harassment as a disease that has eaten deep the fabrics of the society, due to the gross misconduct of the sexual harassments.<br/>It's incessant increase nowadays made it look like no effort has been made to diagnose the causes and effects of sexual harassment on schools, not that schools deliberately plan to breed delinquents pupils, but the complexity of the society (Elizabeth, 1992).<br/>According to sexual harassment law (1998), sexual harassment is a person who is under the age of eighteen years, it must be noted that for a sexual harassment to be called a delinquent, his or her conduct must be so deviant and fall so short of the expectation of the society (Adesina, 1999).<br/>Hopkins (2000) defines a sexual harassment as a boy or a girl aged from twelve and eighteen years who fails or neglects to do what duty or laws required.<br/>In encyclopedia of the new universal library (2001); sexual harassment is defined as tendency of individual or group to break the law or moral code of a society.<br/>Pizza, (2002) said that, it represents a form of adolescent adaptive behaviour arising out of a complex of social-economic psychologic and emotional disturbances.<br/>Harjit, (1998) emphasis that harassment literally means indulging in truancy, destruction of properties, disobedience, assault, aggressiveness, fighting to mention but few.<br/>Meanwhile, Akinboye, (2000) stated that \"poor home condition might be responsible for harassment when we heard any establishment of behaviour that can militate against the achievement of set objective organization\".<br/>Therefore, this is the study of the factors influencing sexual harassment among students in Emmanuel Alayande College of Education with a view of recommending useful suggestions towards the possible ways of controlling and eradicating this menace in our society.<br/>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>It has been discovered that these exist prevalence of the sexual harassment in the world today and it seems the bulk of this is in higher institution, through many categorized the prevalence and the causes of the sexual harassment among the society as a result of the youthful exorbitant power testing.<br/>Also these have not been critical effort to examine the causes and prevention of the sexual harassment among higher institution student, especially in our country (Nigeria).<br/>Many researchers refused to understand that youths are the ones that characterized the large population of the society, also there are many ideas of the situation that prompted me to carry out this particular study, because of so many report of sexual harassment among or outside the higher institution in our country and how people that has been harassed whether through hugging, kissing, hanging around a poem, touching an employee's cloth, hair, body or unwanted letters, telephones calls etc. feels.<br/>All this aforementioned among all are what makes the researcher to carry out this study.<br/>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of the study are:<br/>i.  The main purpose of the study is be examine the factors influence  sexual Harassment<br/>ii. To determine the nature and trend of sexual Harassment among students  of Emmanuel Alayande College of Education<br/>iii. To ascertain the causes of sexual Harassment as perceived by students    in Higher Education Institution<br/>iv. To examine the psychological consequences of sexual Harassment on the   victims<br/>v. To recommend possible institutional response to control occurrence of sexual Harassment among students at Emmanuel Alayande Colleges of Education<br/>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>The following research questions are generated to guide the study;<br/>i.       What are the causes sexual harassment?<br/>ii.      What are the factors influencing sexual harassment among the students in Emmanuel Alayande College of Education?<br/>iii.     What are the effects of sexual harassment among the students in Emmanuel Alayande College of Education?<br/>        iv      What are the ways to curb sexual harassment among students in Emmanuel Alayande College of Education?<br/>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>The significance of this study cannot be over emphasized in the sense that, it will provide information on sexual Harassment findings. On this study will contribute immensely to enlightening in the adolescents who contributes majority population of the college and pupils at large to acquire positive attitude towards sexual Harassment students as the main anchor of this research will be made to see the negative effect of sexual Harassment and for the society at large, to see the problems of premature death of our promising young girls, emanating from abortion of unwanted pregnancies will minimized.<br/>Based on this research works, student reader would also gain so much based on the need to utilize the professional knowledge they have acquired while providing vocational, educational and socio-personal counseling to students. The students will also offer solutions to sexual Harassment and problems of premarital sex. The parents, guardians, teachers, social workers, educational administrations and the future researchers who will use the project as a reference point for various undertakings. It will shed more light on factor responsible for who might wish to carry out research in this area.<br/>1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>This study is delimitated to students of Emmanuel Alyande College of Education, the write intends to highlight possible factor responsible for sexual Harassment among students of Emmanuel Alayande College of Education and general survey of effects of sexual Harassment on them.<br/>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>SEXUAL HARASSMENT: Illegal forceful of opposite into sex relationship.<br/>PEER GROUP: playmate or age mate, age group that play together.<br/>TERTIARY: Next level of education after secondary school level.<br/>YOUTHFUL: means having the qualities that are typical of young people.<br/>TRAUMA: Severe emotional shock and pain caused by an extremely upsetting experiencing<br/>SEXUAL: Sex of reproduction occurring by fusion of male and female cell.<br/>SEX: Either of the two main groups \"male and female into which living things are placed according to their reproductive functions.<br/> <br/><br/><br/>\n\nFACTOR INFLUENCING SEXUAL HARRASSMENT AMONG STUDENTS IN EMMANUELALAYANDECOLLEGE OF EDUCATION, OYO<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FACTOR INFLUENCING SEXUAL HARRASSMENT AMONG STUDENTS IN EMMANUELALAYANDECOLLEGE OF EDUCATION, OYO", "id": 223}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>WOMEN AND PROPERTY INHERITANCE IN NIGERIA<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Inheritance rights are one of the central problems that cause conflict among families prevalent to the extent that a house holder (father) has to write his will before he dies. The common practice is that, women have no say in the property sharing as a member of the family.The objective of this study is to examine the definition of property rights in Ankpa community. To determine the positions of women with regards to property inheritance in Ankpa community. To ascertain the extent to which property as defined by Igala customary laws has affected the socio-economic development of women, and to recommend ways of tackling the issue. Data was collected from one source which is the primary through the use of questionnaire: sample for this research was one hundred (100) people, which was gotten through the simple random sampling technique.The findings revealed that females generally under the Igala traditions are properties themselves to be inherited by any man. Recommendations such as the amendment of the Igala customary law in relation to cultural approach to accommodate women’s property inheritance was made. There should also be an attempt on the part of the government to promote gender equality through legislature and other enlightenment programmes.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.1.         Background to the Study<br/>            Property inheritance including the rights of women to property, receives very little degree of attention in different parts of the world.<br/>The girl – child in most traditions of the world according to Ogbuagu in his reviews of gender studies in Nigeria, (2002). Is made to internalize the notion that, the girl is subordinate to male authority and subsequently cannot and should not claim rights with the boy-child. Ogbuagu, further states that, the girl-child is taught to be a good wife and mother in future. In addition the girl child is also perceived and actually made to believe that, she is a tool, an object or a possession to be owned and used to meet the male desires. These discrepancies between the old rules and facts are greater where women are concerned and its most harmful to their interest.<br/>Women’s legal rights to property according to Kenneth (2000) are examined on the background of the law of succession, inheritance and the family its paramount, to point out that no particular attentions has been paid to women in the making of any law in Nigeria (2002). According to her, the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria 1977, promulgated into law by the military force before they handed over power on the 29th of May 1999 to civilian administration has been generating controversies since its inception. The chief argument against the constitution as argued by Comfort is the imposition of these laws on the Nigerian people by the military. That the constitution does not pass the test of legitimacy and acceptability for it is not a process led participatory and open constitution. She further argues that, the way and manner in which the 1999 constitution. She further argues that, the way and manner in which the 1999 constitution was drafted made it possible especially for women to have any impact whatsoever in it.<br/>This customary law system where the women and her children are denied property and financial provision from the property of her husband’s and father’s upon dissolution of marriage either by divorce or death, exposes them to exploitation and abuse, customary norms are no longer always appropriate and their observation may simply serve to entrap women and children (females) in inferior position.<br/>It is upon this background that the researcher seeks to find out the extent to which women in Kogi state particularly in Ankpa local government area have rights to property inheritance.<br/> 1.2.         STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM<br/>Traditional beliefs and practices of especially the Ankpa local government area as conditioned by the customary laws have become such serious obstacles militating against the development of women in this area.<br/>A close look at the Ankpa women generally either single, married or divorce reveals that, they have no rights to property when compared to their male counterparts.<br/>A female heir is as good as a property to be inherited and thus, does not argue over her father’s properties with her brothers, a married woman works and owns everything to the husband, she claims no right in the husband’s house. A widow return empty to her parents especially, if she has no male offsprings. These are serious problems militating against women social, economical, political and psychological development and can be conveniently attributed to the sub-servient positions, women tend to accept in the society. This is because a person who is disenfranchised or lacks the right to property to enhance his or her status generally, be it social, political, economical,, educational and so on, remains dependent and often takes the back seat.<br/>These types of situation in which the Igala women in Ankpa local government area face impedes their development processes and greatly affects their quota of contribution to the overall development of the society.<br/>1.3.         RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>The research has set to investigate into the above stated problems faced by property inheritance and the position of women in Ankpa local government area as regards property rights.<br/>What defined these rules, its implication on women and the way out, to achieve this, the following questions will guide the research.<br/>i.       How are property inheritance defined in Ankpa local government area.<br/>ii.     What is the position of women with regards to property rights in Ankpa.<br/>iii.  What are the factors responsible for this?<br/>iv.  What are the implications of property inheritance or rights as defined by customary laws for social and economic development of women?<br/>v.     What measures are required to maintain women in the development process of Ankpa local government area?<br/>1.4.         OBJECTIVES OF STUDY<br/>The aims of this study are to find out how property inheritance has been shared and why property inheritance has been shared and why women under the Ankpa tradition and customary laws have no rights to property. How these affect women generally and proffer probable suggestion on the way forward.<br/>The following will be the specific objectives of this work.<br/>To examine the definition of property inheritance in Ankpa local government area.<br/>To determine the position of women with regards to property inheritance or rights in Ankpa<br/>To determine the factors responsible for this<br/>To ascertain how property rights as defined by Igala customary law has affected the socio-economic development of women.<br/>To proffer suggestions on how women could be mainstream in development processes.<br/>1.5.         SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>This research is aimed at understanding property inheritance as been defined by the igala customary laws in Ankpa local government area.<br/>The research also aimed at determining the position of women with regards to property inheritance in Ankpa. And to provide solutions to the problems of women with regards to inheritance, right and contribution to national development.<br/>1.6.         DEFINITION OF CONCEPTS<br/>The concepts to the defined in this research include:<br/>•        Property<br/>•        Inheritance<br/>•        Rights<br/>•        Customary laws<br/>Property: Property is anything, objects or rights, which can be owned.

Victims or violence, in the hands of the man they trust and love, suffer physically and psychologically. They are unable to make their own decisions, voice their own opinions or protect themselves and their child for fear of further repercussions. They are denial of their human rights and have their lives stolen from them by the continual presence of threat of violence. Violence or at least the fear of violence is a part of every women life. If she is not a victim at one time or another, she knows someone who has been victimized lately. There has been a greater understanding of the problem, its causes and consequences, and an international consensus has been initiated on the need to deal with the issue. Data analysis shows that women’s economic dependence on men, as a result of marginalization in a 'man’s world’, conventional family structure, and the treatment of domestic violence as a private matter serves to give impetus to the hydra-headed enigma.<br/>However, strategies and interventions, by way of an integrated approach, have been highlighted to combat it. The study area is Ughelli-North Local Government Area of Delta State.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>The family is often equated with sanctuary-a place where individuals seek love, safety security, and shelter. However, this false idea is slowly fading. Evidence shows that it is also a place that imperils and breeds some of the most drastic forms of violence perpetrated against women and girls.<br/>Domestic violence against women and girls continues to be global epidemic that kills, tortures and maims-physically, psychologically, sexually and economically. It is one of the most pervasive of human rights violence, denying women and girl’s equality, security, dignity self-worth, and the right to enjoy fundamental freedoms. Although violence against women is ubiquitous, cutting across boundaries of culture, class, education, income, ethnicity, and age, domestic violence is the most prevalent, yet relatively hidden and ignored form of violence against women and girls.<br/>While reliable statistics are hard to come by, studies estimate that, from country to country, between 20 and 50 percent of women have experienced physical violence such as slapping, beating, arm twisting, stabbing, strangling, burning, kicking, and the like, at the hands of intimate partners of family members.<br/>Violence in the domestic sphere is usually perpetrated by males who are, or who have been in positions of trust, intimacy, and power-husbands, boyfriends, fathers, father-in-law, step fathers, brothers, uncles, sons, or other relatives. The terms domestic violence “as used here in, includes violence against women and  girls by an intimate partners, including a cohabiting partner, and by other family members, whether this violence occurs willing or beyond the confines of the home” (Mehrkhan, in WHO, 1996).<br/>Violence against women is often a cycle of abuse that manifest itself in many forms throughout their lives. Even at the very beginning of her life, a girl may be the target of sex-selective abortion or female infanticide in cultures where son preferences are prevalent. During childhood, violence against girls may include enforced malnutrition, lack of access to medical care and education, incest, female genital mutilation, early marriages and forced prostitution, or bounded labour.<br/>Some go on to suffer throughout their adult lives and old age-battered, raped and even murdered at the hands of intimate partners, as well as being inherited by her in-laws (WHO, 1996).<br/>Most women who leave home as a result of incessant, assault, often return, studies have shown that quite apart from the stress and suffering arising from the violence itself many had experienced a number of problems seeking help the majority had initially turned to relatives and friends who, although they had provided support and sometimes temporary accommodation, often made it clear to the women that they did not want to be involved in the couples domestic problems (Borkowski, et al, 1983).<br/>Due to the patriarchy system that pervades the society, women are seldom guaranteed a place in their family of orientation. Even though most societies proscribe domestic violence against women, the reality is that violations against women’s rights are often sanctioned under the garb of cultural practices and norms, although misinterpretation of religious tenets.<br/>The conventional family structure, which also stems from patriarchy, also determines the tacit acceptance of wife abuse in most cultures. Here married women have few, if any rights. Thus, a man is seen as having the right to beat his wife, his children and other female members of his family (O’connell, 1994). Some cultures still excuse a man who kills his wife if he suspects her of adultery. Even rape in marriage is accepted, at least, tolerated in many family structures. This reflects the idea of the wife as the property of her husband (Kirby, et al, 1997).<br/>When the violation of women’s right takes place within the home, as is often the case, the abuse is effectively condoned by the tacit silence and the passivity displayed by the state and law-enforcing machinery. In a number of cases, the police had been called. They were reported as having often taken the view that since it was a “domestic” matter, little could be done (Borkowshi, et al, 1983). As depicted by Ashley, Jack (in Hansard, 1973), domestic dispute “tends to be parroted as an incantation for inaction”.<br/>When women contact local authority, social services, social workers had discouraged them from leaving their husband in the evident belief that they should try harder to keep the marriage together. Since there were few, it at all, refuges; those women who did attempt to leave had great difficulty finding accommodation where there was no risk of further assault (Borkowski, et al 1983).<br/>In the divorce courts itself, court officials and judges quite often seemed curiously incurred to the violence. Some were skeptical about women’s allegations of violence even though all the cases were undefended and the evidence was not challenged by the respondent (Borkowski et al 1983). Despite the widespread existence of this problem-domestic violence-defendant police officers and court officials either deny the existence, prevalence, and seriousness of violence against married women or they treat as a private privilege of marital discipline, rooted in the view that women are the property of their husbands and that the state should not interfere. The police refuse to arrest violent husbands or give other needed aid and protection to plaintiff victims.<br/>While the family court was enacted to given practical advice to battered wives-who do not have lawyers to assist them-the court personnel infact deny women access to court. Each agency sends women to the other. Neither the policy nor the court enforces the law, plaintiffs are left remediless. The result is increased fear, injury, or even death at the hands of their violent husbands (Hirschm 1981).<br/>Studies have shown that battered wives tend to withdraw their complaints perhaps because there are few alternatives for them to start a new. A Washington, D.C. study indicated that of 7500 wives who tried to bring changes against their abusive husbands, only 200 succeeded (Edmiston 1976). This is due largely to economic reasons. Gelles (1976), found that women with few resources, for example, no job, or little education, is less likely to seek help, and children of very young ages are instrumental in dissuading their mothers to take action. One mother I knew suffered a broken arm, numerous bruises, and other injuries that remained with her assaultive husband until he began to batter their two-year old daughter. At that point, she left him, went home to her own parents only to return to her beloved batterer several months later (Hirsch, 1981).<br/>Observing the conventional family structure in Nigeria, we seem to have more varieties of family types than ever before. We see more people co-habiting, divorcing, re-marrying as well as different types of extended families and a whole range of nuclear families some more isolated than others, (Kirby, et al, 1997). This structural variation has been linked, inter alia, to problems of domestic violence, within families. The Nigeria “patriarchal family characterized by kinship network is gradually being supplanted by an isolated nuclear family” (Ogege in Jike Led, 2002). This alteration in structure according to Ogege, has inevitably striped the institution of its traditional functions of care, concern and the like. Since family members now work away from home, the family and the interactions within it have become less observable. Since social control and observability are positively correlated, what happens within the family unit is private and thus, less subject to accountability to others (Laslett, 1973). This has resulted in the invisibility of battered women whose unseen and often unacknowledged abuse is compounded by low self-esteem where women often blame themselves for their suffering (Kirby, et al, 1997).<br/>For (Cheal 1991), this has its root in the social isolation experienced by many women living in private families. Separation of family life from public life and the role that women are expected to play as ‘blinding agent’ in maintaining family integrity (Liljestron, 1982) both reinforce cultural beliefs that family problems are private troubles and that women have the primary duty of resolving them (Cheal, 1991). Since there is no one to interfere with the violence, there is a great tendency for violence to occur as the negative sanctions of their unavailable. The near passivity of neighbours also reinforces the widespread conception of family as a private institution.<br/>Under the Nigerian common law, a “husband and wife are considered to the legally one person. It was the husband, however, who had the power. At marriage, women were related to civic death since they lost their individual legal and property rights.<br/>It is pertinent to note that under our patriarchal system, it was the man-father “who owned the daughter and who sold her to another man” (Hoebel, 1966). Although bride price did not necessarily give a husband and his kinsmen; a right to do harm to his wife, payment for a woman, and patriarchy in general, became fertile soil for the abuse of women, who were not, of course, given the same privileges (Hirsch, 1981).<br/>Most religious traditions are basically patriarchal in nature and establish the husband as superior and master to his wife (Hirsch, 1981). The Christian faith is a case in point. The patriarchal power is reinforced in the Old Testament. God becomes angry with both Adam and Eve for having eaten of the forbidden fruit but says to Eve:<br/>…your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you (Genesis 3:16).<br/>The Christian church did not relieve wives of the ‘iron fist of their husband. According to Saint Paul:<br/>Wives be subject to your husbands as to the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife (Ephesians 5:22-23) in some societies, a woman was forbidden to strike her husband but her husband had the right to hit her (Hirsch, 1981) San Barnerdin, during the Renaissance, write about the guidelines for beating ones wife:<br/>“And I say unto you, men, never beat your wives, while they are great with child for there in would lay great peril. I say not that you should never beat them; but chose your time (cited in Hirsch 1981).<br/>It is unfortunate that even today, many men beat their wives, especially during pregnancy very often, domestic violence is triggered off by a minor event, such as non satisfaction on the part of the man, with the performance of domestic duties by the wife (Dobash and Dobash, 1980), the wives refusal to wake up at midnight to satisfy the sexual urge of their husband, and the life. Many women are apparently almost literally beaten into submission and share their husband view that they deserve to be punished (Kirby, et al, 1997). Many wives believe that given a certain circumstance the husband should beat his wife (Parnas, 1967). One woman reported being beaten be her husband if she served him soup which he considered too cold.<br/>Many women who are battered loath the battering but find it difficult to leave a terrifying situation. Shame is an important factor according to Owen (1975), the battered wife feels ashamed to let other people know about her situation. One young woman who married at the age of seventeen against her parent’s desire did not tell them of her abuse because “she made her bed and had to lie in it” (Owen, 1975). This goes to show that some women feels that some how, she is responsible for or deserves the beatings as there is something wrong with her.<br/>Why does a man need to resort to in order to maintain his homeostasis?<br/>(Elbow, 1977) in her attempt to describe the common characteristics of wife abusers posited that one of the basic defense mechanism of most abusers is that of projection. The abusers projects unto his wife the cause of the marital discord that is the batterer is unable to accept responsibility.<br/>It is a fairly common myth in our society that women like to be treated roughly by men and that women enjoy being controlled by physical means (White Hurst, 1974).<br/>Snell and his associates (1964) labeled such women as coming from working-class families given to rough living. For them, these sorts of women get perverse excitement from living in a violent, emotionally charged relationship. When such women seek help are seen as the problem, rather than problem being understood as one of victimization (Edmiston, 1976).<br/>Literature abounds on the seriousness of this hydra-headed enigma. Even at that, debate regarding the magnitude of the problem is clouded by the fact that domestic violence is a crime that is under-reported and under-recorded. When women file a report or seek treatment, they may have to contend with police and health care officials who have not been trained to respond adequately or to keep consistent records. On the other hand, shame fear of reprisal, lack of information about legal rights, lack of confidence in, or fear of the legal system and the legal costs. Involved make women reluctant to report incidents of violence (WHO, 1999). Most of the cases reported are mainly done informally, to relatives and friends who do not have formal documentation of the incidence.<br/>Physical Abuse<br/>Most of the data available on violence against women are believed to be not only conservative, but unreliable. This makes it critical in determining the magnitude of the problem and identifying priority areas for intervention. It is however, estimated that today, over 200,000 husbands consistently abuse their spouses (Zullo, et al, 1976). This goes to show the rather dangerous prospects women face in conventional heterosexual partnerships (Kirby, et al, 1997). Domestic violence against women in the family is thus, fact, not fiction (Hirsch, 1981).<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM<br/>The incidence of domestic violence against women in the family is a regularly occurring phenomenon. Violence or at least the fear of violence is a part of every woman’s life. Each woman knows someone who has been the victim of a violent involved at one time or another.<br/>The mystique of the family as the private peaceful cradled of safety and emotional support has influenced the lack of attention given to the violence that does occur, especially to women. And in many societies, paddling a wife for misbehavior by the husband is the norm.<br/>Violence against women in such societies is thus, condoned and has become institutionalized by it. Battering is viewed as a private, family affair, and beating ones wife is considered to be a marital prerogative.<br/>A battered woman finds it difficult to take action against her husband. She often finds herself in a financial blind. Living with a violent husband is thus seen as better than trying to make it alone (Owen, 1975).<br/>Rather than appreciate women for their domestic inputs, unleashing assault has become the norm. My interest in this topic was prompted by two events I witnessed, recently: a severe violence of not water-kitchen alleged late preparation of supper which was treated with levity by state security instruments and the community; and incessant battering my elder sister received at the hands of her husband; friends and relatives, although they provided supports, declined taking action in resolving their domestic problem.<br/>These happened at Emervor in Isoko North Local Government Area of Delta State. The situation is however, not new. These are but a few of the imponderable assault that women face in the privacy of their homes.<br/>In recent years, concerns for the battered women has mushroomed so that legislation and services have grown to deal with the issue. An international consensus has also developed but progress has been slow because attitudes are deeply entrenched and, to some extent because, effective strategies to address violence against women are still being defined. Consequently, women World-Wide continue to suffer.<br/>There is little or no awareness on the part of women folk, that women and children have a right to state protection even within the confines of their family home. Laws enforcement and judicial systems condone or do not recognize domestic violence as a crime. Instead, it is tagged “family matter” which should be settled in house.<br/>The appalling toll on this issue will not be eased until families, government, and institution civic society organizations address the issue directly. “Victims of violence we are; but perhaps continuing to publicly acclaimed our indignation will help to ameliorate an injustice perpetrated against one-half of the human race” – women (Hirsch, 1981). This is the bane of this study.<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/>In this study, the researcher intends to set out the magnitude, dimensions, and factors perpetuating domestic violence against women and girls, as well as its impact on the rights of women and children and its social consequences.<br/>This study will also attempt to stress the need for coordinated and integrated policy responses, enhancing partnership among stakeholders, setting up mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating programmes and policies, implementing existing legislation, ensuring greater transparency and accountability from government in order to eliminate violence against women.<br/>This is because change is not only necessary but also possible.<br/>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS/PROPOSITIONS<br/>1.   The treatment of domestic violence as private matter is responsible for its persistence;<br/>2.   Economic reasons hinder the persecution of men for violence against women.<br/>3.   Conventional family structure serves to rein force domestic violence.<br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>Much has, however being done in the area of domestic violence against women to create awareness. But it is still baffling to note that the problem is not being given the due attention it requires. It is hoped that this study would give fresh impetus to the campaign against violence against women in Isoko North Community, most of the local are illiterate and, or are ill-educated on the rights and protection of women in the constitution of the state. It is hoped that this study would in explicit terms educate and inform the women at risk and other shareholders, of protective measures available in them.<br/>It is also expected that his study would help to inform and educate members of the society and professionals who came in contact with those assaulted to enable them understand gender based violence, appreciate the trauma of those suffering and on the need for attitude change towards the roles and status of men and women.<br/>This study would also, be significant to policy makers and legislators in that it would attempt to spur them into pursuing policies to eliminate discrimination against women, and also to include legislation to modify or abolish existing laws regulations, customs and practices which constitute discrimination against women.<br/>This study would as well draw attention to the real life context of the assault women, her hopelessness, dependency, restricted options and her consequent need for empowerment.<br/>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The population under study comprises females and males in Ughelli North Local Government area of Delta State. The area of interest to the study vis-à-vis violence against women in the family includes dimensions of the problem, the causes and consequences of domestic violence, as well as its socio-economic costs.<br/>While domestic violence against women in the family was the research central concern I emphasized more of marital violence within the context of overtly present domestic violence. I did not attempt to introduce criteria as to the frequency of assault or the degree of injury that might have been sustained. And as far as the world “marital” is concerned, I adopted that couples own perception of themselves as partners, whether or not they were legally united married. This, therefore, includes those who were cohabiting as well as those who were separated or divorced but sill in contact.<br/>1.7    DEFINITION OF BASIC CONCEPTS<br/>As used herein refers to “any behavior which threatens or causes damage physical or psychological to a person. Violence unlike force is considered to be socially non-normative. It is okay to punish a child by slapping him, but not okay to slap him so hard that visible bruises result (Hirsch, 1981, O’Brien, 1971).<br/>Domestic<br/>As used here in, refer to the types of relationships involved rather than the place where the violent act occurs.<br/>Domestic Violence<br/>Includes violence against women and girls by an intimate partner, including cohabiting partner, and by other family members, whether this violence occurs within or beyond the confines violence of the home.<br/>Family<br/>Refers to a social group whose members are united by ties of blood, marriage, or adoption and who live together, cooperate economically, care for the young and create a new culture.<br/>Marital Violence<br/>Refers to threat or actual physical assault by husbands or male partners upon their female counterparts wives.<br/>Wife Battering<br/>Refers to infliction of violent assaults frequently upon a woman to whom one is married to.<br/>Rape<br/>Refers to unlawful sexual intercourse with another person-women-without that person consent.<br/>Sexual Abuse<br/>As used here refers to the subjection of a woman to sexual activity likely to cause physical or psychological harm.<br/>Abuse<br/>Means to take undue advantage of; to maltreat; to violate; and to betray a confidence.<br/>Patriarchy <br/>As defined by Firestone (1970) and as used here, broadly means the rule of men.<br/><br/>\n\nDOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN THE FAMILY: A CASE STUDY OF UGHELLI-NORTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF DELTA STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN THE FAMILY: A CASE STUDY OF UGHELLI-NORTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF DELTA STATE", "id": 225}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL DETERMINANTS OF USE OF FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES IN NKANU AREA OF ENUGU STATE.<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       Background to the study<br/>Family Planning is the purposeful regulation of conception or childbirth or the use of devices, chemicals, abortion or other techniques to prevent or terminate pregnancy or voluntary avoidance or delay of pregnancy (Wikipedia, 2010; Caufield, 1998). Family planning techniques commonly used include sexual education, prevention and management of sexually transmitted infections, pre-conception counseling and management and infertility management (Wikipedia, 2010). These services are defined as “educational, comprehensive medical or social activities which enable couples, individuals including sexually active adolescents and minors, to determine freely the number and spacing of their children, avoid getting pregnant and/or even avoid sexually transmitted diseases, to select the means by which this may be achieved” (Wikipedia, 2010; Plata, 1996). Family planning is sometimes used as a synonym for birth control or child spacing, though it often includes more.<br/>The use of family planning implies that the users make concerted efforts to deal with procreation within the context of a sexual relationship. This covers things as varied as when to get pregnant, the number of children that are wanted, how to deal with fertility issues, how to avoid getting pregnant, whether to consider an abortion if an unwanted pregnancy occurs, or adoption etc. to say nothing of working out parental strategies with one’s partner. Family Planning was listed as one of the twelve pillars of Reproductive Health. Among the objectives of Family Planning is to help women to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancies (FMHN, 2005). In Nigeria, before the introduction of modern family planning by Babangida administration in 1989 there were traditional methods of birth control (Odimegwu, 1999). These traditional methods which still exist and are convenient for users (Encyclopedia Americana, 2001) are natural while the modern types which are new in Nigeria are both natural and artificial. In Nigeria like in most developing countries, the story of family planning services is not successful because of a number of factors, such as culture of the people and low status of women (Coleman, 2004). Other factors include lack of education and understanding about health related issues, the ability of women to command resources and make independent decisions about their fertility, birth control knowledge, (Nwakeze, 2003). Location, religion and social class, lack of cooperation from spouse, cost, perceived difficulty with the method and lack of knowledge about contraceptive methods etc. (World Bank, 2004; IPPF, 1993). Moreover in Nigeria, the provision of health services is more in the urban areas than in the rural areas (Dobie, et al 1998). Where family planning services are located in rural areas, access is low due to lack of proximity, bad road network and the nearest urban center, where such clinic is available, it may not provide adequate care because of lack of proper trained staff and equipment (Wikipedia, 2009; Quedraogo, 2005; NISER, 2001). Other factors include lack of proper family planning function dissemination; inadequate motivation to seek actively, access and regularly use contraceptives (Odimegwu, 1999).<br/>Lack of use of family planning services is enormous as it affects the individual, the family, the community and nation at large. Empirical findings have shown that it leads to increase in maternal illness, such as multiple pregnancies, hemorrhage, etc. (Ikpeze, 2010; Wikipedia, 2009; Wikipedia, 2008). It sometimes leads to social problems in the family and community such as violence, desertion, accusation of infidelity, fear of violence on the part of the woman, mistrust. On the part of the man, it could lead to having multiple sexual partners with its attendant contraction of STIs and HIV/AIDS, affecting sexual and reproductive lives of women (Ezumah, 2003; Pop Report, 1999) and sometimes it leads to maternal death. These have socio- economic consequences on the immediate family as the resources meant for the up- keep of the family are diverted to the health care of the parent(s) as the case may be, time wasted and the future and the life of the children truncated. Family planning services have the function of preventing most maternal illnesses and deaths (Wikipedia, 2008), yet it has been recorded that the rate of maternal morbidity and mortality is high in developing countries compared to developed countries (Ikpeze, 2010; FMHN, 2005). UNICEF (2008) estimate shows that maternal mortality in Nigeria is high about 800/100,000 live births yet attitude of members of the developing countries to family planning services is low and this attitude is attributed to socio-cultural and economic reasons (Engender Health, 2009; Galadanci, 2009; Agujiobi, 2003; Ezumah, 2004; Onyeneho and Okeibunor, 2003; Nwakeze, 2003).With the adverse consequences of non-consent and non-use, and the inappropriate understanding of the importance of family planning services on the reproductive health of women, concerted efforts must be  made economically, socially, politically and otherwise towards  ensuring that the negative consequences of lack of use of family planning services are controlled to the barest minimum. This study therefore will examine the socio-economic and cultural barriers to access and use of family planning services by women of reproductive age in Nkanu area of Enugu State and suggest measures that could enhance effective use of family planning services for both genders in the research area.<br/>1. 2   Statement of the Problem <br/> Although the population of Nigeria is very high due to high marital fertility of about 5.6 children per woman and provision of family planning services limited, worst still is that utilization is low as a result of cultural and social pressures. For example, Child-bearing and rearing defines a woman’s value and status in her community, alongside the number and sex of children (NISER, 2001; Onyeneho and Okeibunor, 2003; Agujiobi, 2003; Nnorom, 2003; Ezumah, 2003); therefore deliberate attempt not to access these services by those women may be made (Engender Health, 2009; Galadanci, 2009), this is because of the importance attached to procreation which is emphasized in the extent a barren woman goes to get a wife for her husband to bear children on her behalf, or a wife goes outside her matrimonial home (with or without the consent of her husband in the case of infertility on the man’s side) to get children in order to maintain the family’s existence and value in the community (Ezumah, 2003).. Even though development has increased attitude to use of family planning services especially among the urban middle class in African societies, Bowman and Kuenyehia (2003) empirical findings, show that in urban areas where there are Family planning services information and enlightenment, the rate of access and usage is low as some women shun the use of western methods because it conflicts with indigenous beliefs and practices.Family Planning Services are aimed at benefiting the health and wellbeing of women and families throughout the world, by the provision of contraceptives which help them avoid unwanted pregnancies and space births; provide protection against sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS; and provide other health benefits, in spite of its’ benefits most Nigerian women do not access to it especially those in the rural areas (Wikipedia, 2008), because in relation to contraception, it is a male prerogative (Okeibunor, 2000; Pop. Report, 1999).<br/> Male control is a major constraint to women’s access and use of family planning services. Also the nature of women’s work in production and reproduction such as household work, (drudge) and child bearing pose great restrictions to accessing and using Family Planning Services, (Barua &amp; Kurz, 2001). Poor financing of health care services (Ikpeze, 2010), lack of focus on curative measures and political will (Quedraogo, 2005) by government serve as barrier to access and use of family planning services in Nigeria (Ikpeze, 2010), disparity in health care services delivery between the remote and non-remote areas (Huang, Yip, Chang and Chou 2006), as in Nigeria, where access and use is limited in rural areas unlike in urban areas (Engender Health 2009). Agujiobi (2003), attributed it to ignorance on the part of the ruralites, and the cause of the ignorance she attributed to lack of presence of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOS) in the rural areas of Nigeria to educate and enlighten them on the presence and importance of Family Planning Services.  Sometimes the available clinics may not provide decent care because of lack of proper staff and equipment (Engender Health 2009; Wikipedia, 2009). The effects of not planning the family cause a large number of women to continue to experience unplanned pregnancies leading to morbidity, mortality and social distress (Caufeild, 1998). Health of women in developing countries, Nigeria inclusive, is precarious because of high fertility rate; it’s been found that women who have been pregnant six times have twice the risk of experiencing maternal death more than women who have been pregnant only three times (Okeibunor, 2003; Odimegwu, 1999). In sub-Saharan Africa, the life time risk of maternal deaths is 1 in 16 and for developed nations only 1 in 2800 (Wikipedia, 2008). Maternal mortality and morbidity are often much higher in rural areas than in urban areas with up to 1000 per 100,000 reported in rural areas of several countries in Africa. Quedraogo, (2005), noted that 13% of maternal deaths in Africa are due to unplanned pregnancy and risky abortions. These reproductive health problems women experience particularly those that are pregnancy related are preventable; yet they constitute major problems, because women of reproductive ages do not use Family Planning Services (UNICEF, 2008; Bowman &amp; Kuenyehia, 2003:233).<br/> In Nkanu area, people’s main source of livelihood is subsistence farming which makes their condition even worse. Social amenities such as quality health care facilities, government presence, etc, are lacking causing increase in high maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. Also prevailing attitude and cultural practices affect women’s knowledge of their reproductive health needs and their willingness/ability to seek appropriate care (Alumanah, 2003). Nkanu area is culture bound and therefore could be described as traditional society even when some of its communities are close to the city. Little or no academic research on family planning has taken place in this study area, even though pregnancy related problems exist here as in other rural communities in Nigeria. If use of family planning services is not encouraged in this study area, it will become not only a great health problem but also continuous social and economic problems to the community and nation at large. Therefore this study will seek to investigate the socio-cultural and economic barriers to access and use of family planning services among the people of the study area.<br/>1. 3      Research Questions<br/>            This study will seek to provide answers to these questions:<br/>1)         What is the level of people’s awareness of and use of family planning services in the study area?<br/>2)         What types of family planning services are available in the study area?<br/>3)         What are specific constraints militating against people’s use of family planning services?<br/>4)         What problem(s) arise(s) as a result of people not accessing any of these services?<br/>5)         Who decides when and how to access or not to access family planning services?<br/>6)         What are peoples’ preferred methods of family planning?<br/>7)         What efforts are in place to encourage peoples’ use of family planning services in Nkanu Area?<br/>8)         What suggestions can be made on how to improve peoples’ access to and use of family planning services in Nkanu area.<br/>1. 4      Objectives of the Study<br/>The main objective of the study is to investigate socio-cultural and economic factors that determine married women’s access to and use of family planning services in Nkanu Area of Enugu State.<br/>The specific objectives of the study are to;<br/>1)      Ascertain married women’s awareness and knowledge of provision and importance of family planning services;<br/>2)      Ascertain  the type of family planning services  available in the study area;<br/>3)      Identify specific constraints that people experience in access to and use of family planning services;<br/>4)      Identify problems that arise as a result of people not accessing family planning services;<br/>5)      Determine who decides when and how to access or not to access family planning services and consequences of such decisions;<br/>6)      Determine the most desired and accessed family planning methods and reason(s) for their acceptance;<br/>7)      Ascertain the efforts in place (especially stake holders) to encourage target groups’ use of family planning services in Nkanu Area;<br/>8)      Make suggestions on how best to enhance (currently in-union) access to and use of family planning services in Nkanu.<br/>1. 5      Significance of the Study<br/>      This study will be theoretically important. Wikipedia, (2008), noted that the essence of family planning services is to benefit the health and wellbeing of women and families throughout the world. Pooda (2005), noting WHO’s estimate stated that one woman dies every minute due to complications of pregnancy and/or childbirth, about 4 million women suffer disabilities, some of which are serious and lifelong. Family planning therefore is expected to serve the purpose of helping couples to plan to have the number of children they desire and also be able to raise their children with full assurance of available resources, maintain good health and save (Wikipedia, 2010), and unmarried women including adolescents and minors to manage their active sexual lives properly without  regret. It is hoped this study will provide additional insight to the existing literature on family planning services, attitudes and perceptions in Nigeria with particular reference to Nkanu area. It is hoped to form a basis for triggering-off follow-up or new studies on the topic.<br/>The practical significance includes the fact that the findings will be of immense benefit for stakeholders in making policies that will empower women in accessing family planning services, and encourage male and female support of use of family planning services and their health in general.<br/>It is expected that this study will: (a) help raise consciousness of not just the target group but all who have attained adolescence and are sexually active especially in the rural and semi-rural areas of the need for access and use of family planning services, (b) help stake holders co-join in making millennium development goal of attaining good health for all by the year 2020 a reality in Nigeria.<br/>1.6       Definition and Operationalization of Concepts<br/>Socio-economic factors: these refer to the level of education, income, occupation of the people under study and how they affect their knowledge, access, and use of family planning services.<br/>Cultural factors: refer to the institutions, language, symbols, practices, values, beliefs, norms, folklores, etc of the people and how these affect knowledge and access to family planning services.  <br/>Postpartum: refers to the period from delivery of a baby to the period when the woman’s body is said to return to normal. This may last up to three to four years; that is when the child is weaned depending on the sex and society.<br/>The woman after postpartum period is compensated by her husband through showering her with gifts of cloths, jewelleries and merry making before normal sexual relation is resumed. <br/>Education: is a social institution, which enables and promotes the acquisition of skills, knowledge and the broadening of personal horizon (Giddens, 2010). It also refers to formal training and instruction that create awareness, knowledge and give empowerment to the educated. For this work levels of formal education will be taken thus: low educational attainment = no formal education, middle educational attainment = elementary one (1) to six (6) and high formal attainment = from class one and above.<br/>Empowerment: Batliwala, (1994) defined empowerment as control over material assets, intellectual resources and ideology. Empowerment is also seen as a process involving not just women, but men, society and the state, and requires a change of attitudes and behaviour of both men and women. It is a process of creating conditions under which women can meet their daily needs and become actively involved in defining and promoting their own social, political and economic projects (IPPFAR 1996). It is the ability to act on knowledge acquired through family planning programmes without restriction, and is encouraged through improvement in literacy level, finance and political policies and programmes, which should insist on family planning services as a basic right.  <br/>Maternal Mortality Ratio: is the rate of the number of maternal deaths per 100,000. Maternal mortality ratio in sub-Saharan Africa rose by 15% from an average of 870/100,000 live births in 1990 to 1000/100,000 live births in 2000 (Pooda, 2005). In Nigeria the ratio is 800 maternal deaths to 100,000 live births.   <br/>Maternal mortality: Also known as maternal death is defined as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and size of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management including incidental causes but not accidental causes (WHO, 2005).                                             <br/>Incidental causes of maternal mortality: include deaths due to violence against women that may be related to the pregnancy and be affected by the socio-economic and cultural environment, such as wife beating, rape, STDs, other harmful traditional practices such as food allocation, widowhood practices, adult circumcision, etc which are legitimized and perpetuated by beliefs, norms and other social institutions.<br/>Polygyny: is the marriage of one man to more than one wife at the same time. This occurs sometimes through outright marriage of more than one wife, widow inheritance, or levirate marriage . Though no more strictly institutionalized in the study area, its effects still linger such as the issue of concubineship which is not really frowned at.<br/>Contraceptives: devices used to prevent fertilization of an egg such as barriers (e.g condom, etc.) hormonal (such as removable implants, etc.), intrauterine devices, chemical barriers (such as spermicides) vaccines, etc.<br/>Population policy: this refers to a programme or a set of programmes of action that seeks to contribute to national development and welfare goals through measures that are directly or indirectly aimed to influence fertility control and well being of women.<br/>Reproductive Health: it is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes (IPPF, 1996). The reproductive health status of the study area will help explain the health status of Enugu state especially its rural areas and inform current decision making and planning strategies for the health sector.<br/>Reproductive Health Care: a group of methods, techniques, and services that contribute to solving reproductive health problems. It also includes sexual health, the purpose of which is the enhancement of life and personal relations and not merely counseling and care related to reproductive and sexually transmitted diseases (IPPF, 1996). <br/>Sexuality Communication: refers to the discussions on sex issues such as on menstruation, free period, child spacing, initiating sex, number of children to have, use of contraception such as condom, sterilization, etc infections, etc by couples. Sexuality communication is high when partners discuss freely on sex, sexual activities, etc, it is middle when one of the partners can freely initiate the discussion and the other will not feel offended but finds it difficult to contribute to the discussion, while it is low when it is not allowed at all.<br/>Suppository: also known as spermicidal vaginal tablets, is a small dissolvable medicated solid: a medicated mass that melts at body temperature, designed to be inserted into the rectum, vagina or urethra 10 to 15 minutes before intercourse in order to melt and disperse the spermicide (Birth Control, Microsoft 2009).<br/>Life time risk: it is the rate at which a female dies as a result of unintended pregnancy, unsafe abortion, complications from childbirth.

R.(1982): Social welfare services are required for the improvement in the society effort to attain the objectives of higher levels of social justices, social security, freedom and better quality of life as right of  each individual social welfare services could therefore be define as the services designed to improved a lot of individual family ,groups and local communities to enable them cope effectively with the social problems affecting the constantly or rapidly changing society .the above definition was published by the ministry of home affairs and information in 1971.<br/>HISTORICAL FACTS<br/>Social welfare services were popularized by the British (colonial masters) immediately after the Second World War they could not finance any developmental projects where there was global economic recession vany longer.<br/>            According to Darie B C (1988): stated that in many loses, the causes of broken home are linked to unnecessary family interference, the set of children (female or male) mostly were male children are particularly preferred because of emphasis on succession. Where female children dominate in marriage, less attention are given to those children are sending them to school or paying of school fees and provision of material or school requirement are problem.<br/>            According to Paul J II (1996) says that another factors that can lead to broken home is polygamy where the man marries more than one which lead to having many children. The first wife to be neglected  due to unhealthy rivary from other women and lack of love from their spouse ,pack out of such homes undermining the consequences on their children.<br/>            In broken homes, children hardly related well with their parents, this can affect them emotionally and psychologically. Broken homes or pre-mature separation if allowed to persist for a long time it can lead girls to grow up anxious and neurotic, while boys can be bullies and delinquent. This is why social welfare services are needed so as to ease family relations problems and such family problem like broken home.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>            In the society today, issue of broken homes have becomes controversial and this constitute a social problem. My strong emphasis is on Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>            Majority of the people are mainly illiterates, this situation constitute a problem that harbor some element of superstitions. Some men believe that once their wives or wife can not give birth to male child, the next thing is to look for another wife not knowing that the fact is the male that determines the sex of a child and not the female.<br/>            Also in a family where we have polygamy in operation, the husband tend to show more love to one wife not minding what the reaction of the other wife or wives would be, this action brings separation among family and can cause broken home.<br/>            Some people are suspicious of the services rendered by the social welfare agents and they see no reason why such people should interfere in their family problems.<br/>            Some are not willing to co-operate at all because they felt that social welfare services are a mere waste ones time.<br/>            In course of this study we shall consider the role of social welfare services on broken homes.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This study was conducted to educate the people on the roles of social welfare services on broken home<br/>In Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State little has been done on the role social welfare services on broken homes, it is important therefore that more of such studies be carried out, this will enable the people to see how broken homes can be restored back.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            This Study is limited to one (100) staff made up of 50 junior and 50 senior staff in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>ASSUMPTION<br/>            It is assumed that the questionnaires are set properly and answered correctly and that the students responded positively.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>I will like to use this opportunity to define the following word in order to avoid any misunderstanding and for clarity.<br/>1.

These explanations have cut across various aspects ranging from motivation, productivity, rewards, expectation and job satisfaction. More often than not, employees are seen as disposable asset or tools that can be used to maximize the interest or profit of the employers, (Akinmayowa 1999), Under such a situation or relationship, the employees has no stake other than the compensatory benefit which in the Marxian perspective is always grossly inadequate (Barry, 1980).<br/>With   the emergence of such school of thought like the Human relations school, it is stressed that the employee’s place in the organization should not be seen as tools or instrument for wealth creation for the employers or the industrialist alone, rather it should be treated with utmost dignity because the employees are the most valuable assets of the organisation. Which ever belief is held by the various schools, there are typically two types of explanations made by Barry (1980) for the generally high level of job satisfaction or its absence in the organisation. <br/>First is the dispositional, following the Durkheime explanation of social theory, second is the situational which follows the Marxist views based on work and its alienating tendencies.<br/>Nevertheless, there is no singular explanation that can exhaustively or adequately explain the condition that guarantees employees satisfaction in the work environment, but a combination of factors, against this backdrop, this study seeks to examine the place of employees participation in the decision making in some organisation specifically the workers of Guinness Nigeria PLC and Bendel Brewery Benin City, Thus this study would among other things, find out what form of contribution in terms of advisory role apart from the daily routine of work schedule performed by the workers all this would be related to the level of satisfaction derivable from such activities against other forms of reward.<br/>1.1 Statement of the Problem<br/>The human   in the economic sense, has generally been regarded as an economic man, this means that man or worker, as the case may be, only respond to economic incentives as a form of Motivation This assumption is popular among the classical economic schools of thought. They equate satisfaction only to economic values, such as monetary inducement as the only benefit that workers respond to. In otherwords, the only condition that may get a worker motivated or satisfied can only be measured in financial or monetary terms.<br/>To ascertain if any association exists between schedule of duty and job satisfaction.<br/>To ascertain how the work environment affect level of job satisfaction.<br/>To determine if area of specialization and actual work doing have an effect on level of job satisfaction?<br/>To observe if employee participation through acceptance of initiative or suggestion affects level of job satisfaction.<br/>To ascertain the extent job security and stability determine the level of job satisfaction<br/>To find out the level and extent environment in the office affects level of job satisfaction.<br/>Several other theories or schools of thought like the motivational school led by Frederick Hertzberg, have proved  the economic school of thought to be wrong or not very relevant, rather than considering man as being only economic rational man, these other theory have come to the realization that there are several other factors that make a worker more satisfied, rather than economic or monetary inducement alone. Satisfaction, self-esteem, as well as self actualization can only be possible by giving the employee or worker tasks that are challenging (Akinmayowa, 1999:108).  <br/>             Most employers of labour have tend to rely heavily on the economic rationality assumption of workers. There are also evidence that, in most  of such organisations, employers despite the seemingly huge economic incentives attached to their work still feel grossly dissatisfied or using the Marxian explanation or terminology “alienated” or what Blauner (1964) characterized as self estranging work. Self estranged workers according to Blauner, (1964) are dissatisfied only when they have developed needs for control, initiative and meaning in work. He explained further that the average manual worker and many white collar employers may be dissatisfied with fairly steady jobs which are largely instrumental and non-involving. Barry, (1980) explains further on Max’s explanation of alienation stressing that labour as being “external to the worker” violates the uniquely human capacity for self-realization through active participation in the creation of the social and material environment of human life. According to him, its consequences is an objective condition, alienation, consisting of a subordination of human creativity to subsistence needs and an associated attitudinal stance which treats conventionally established social arrangements as an immutable part of nature (Barry, 1980:252). Stating further he pointed out that Marx’s position clearly suggests that all humans need expressly rewarding work, that this need is a distinguishing characteristic of the species, and that attempts to compensate for non-rewarding productive experiences in family or leisure pursuits are ultimately futile because  they violate fundamental human powers and capacities.<br/>            The above position or explanation clearly reveals the inadequacies inherent in the compensatory strategies of those that see man or the worker only in economic sense. In the light of the above this study is poised to providing answers to the following questions.<br/>What constitute satisfaction of worker in an organisation?<br/>Does an employee have any need for participation in decision making in the organisation?<br/>Does employees participation have any correlation with job satisfaction?<br/>Does the level of employees academic qualification, age, sex and religion influence his or her participation in the organization?<br/>Answers shall be provided to the above questions in the course of this study.<br/>1.3 Objective of Study<br/>(i)        To ascertain if any association exists between schedule of duty and <br/>job satisfaction.<br/>(ii)       To ascertain how the work environment affect level of job satisfaction.<br/>(iii)     To determine if area of specialization and actual work doing have an effect on level of job satisfaction?<br/>(iv)      To observe if employee participation through acceptance of initiative or suggestion affects level of job satisfaction.<br/>(v)       To ascertain the extent job security and stability determine the level of job satisfaction<br/>(vi)      To find out the level and extent environment in the office affects level of job satisfaction.<br/>1.4 Significance /Rationale of Study<br/>            The findings of this study will shed more light on the aspect of labour relations, workers characteristics as well as satisfaction of workers within the framework of the organisation and to highlight some of the factors that brings about dissatisfaction.<br/>            As would be realized lack of progressive atmosphere for the use of initiative in the workplace may result in low level of performance. Thus, this work on completion could be used to explain the performance of workers when allowed to take part in decision making process of the organisation. It could be useful to general management, employers of labour and other researchers in designing job incentive plans for worker in order to increase their level of job satisfaction.<br/>            Furthermore, it could be useful in the resolution of industrial conflict, through collective bargaining, employee involved management and industrial democracy.<br/>            This study is relevant because it will generate data on employee participation and job satisfaction in a company that would be useful to the following;<br/>i.                    The managers of the company,<br/>ii.                 Human resources department, <br/>iii.               The industrial relations manager,<br/>iv.                Union members and leaders,<br/>v.                  The staff of the company,<br/>vi.                Public at large.<br/> 1.5 Scope of Study  <br/>            The study is centered on employee participation and job satisfaction in organisation using Guinness Nigeria PLC and Bendel Brewery staff as a case study.<br/>            The study is aimed at measuring the satisfaction of the employees against their level of participation in the organisation. In other terms, the study will focus attention on whether the employees take part in decision making process of the organisation and where in affirmative, if such invariably makes the employee have any sense of satisfaction.<br/>            The study does not intend to look at the management style of organization, neither does it intend to look at the organizational structure but rather the area of emphasis is limited in scope to that stated above.<br/> <br/>\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION AND JOB SATISFACTION IN SOME COMPANIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION AND JOB SATISFACTION IN SOME COMPANIES", "id": 228}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>INCIDENT OF URBAN DRIFT IN ENUGU STATE<br/>CASE STUDY OF AWGU TOWN.<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>Charles Darwin (1959) the history of  man from animals wandering in the wilderness which have no fixed home but moved from one tree to another, from on district to another till he attained the states of homo-sapiens like Darwin all historians of  early man like Lamarck (1809). Saw man as a wonder. Thus Karl-Marx (1948) began his easy on man  in his famous book “ the communist manifesto” which goes  thus “in the beginning was man the wonder who went out to gather fruits of the earth, some  gather more than  they needed thereby making it impossible fro others to gather what will be enough for themselves. Thereby leading to the origin of the famous slogan which is the situation of Haves and have not’s.<br/>Other historian maintained that man has always been a mover. According to Marine (1990) it is increasingly known that man especially in large numbers move from their homes, villages cities, countries of origin to national boundaries often move to return. Many do so in search of economic opportunities not available at their homes of origin. Others primarily to escape oppressions striate or natural disaster. These extensive population flows are not peculiar to the contemporary world. Maboyuje (1970) noted  that Migration in the early fifties also involves movement from rapidly growing to relatively stagnant areas of the economy. Throughout recorded history, such movements have national population, the disparities between rich and poor nations, the conflict between ethics and national groups the conflict between rich and poor nations and the impact of national disasters, we expect these flows to continue.<br/>        Man being itinerant, according to Rouch (1954) and Harrison (1967), more for various reasons man move from land of security into place of freedom, which is why we have refuges from somalin, sudanm riveands, Burunadi, Mozamabique etc. into area where they will feel safe. Amn also moves around for academic residing in Awgu town will move to study in places of his choice. Some even move to Europe, America or other places oversees. That mobility in man makes him to come back again to his country of origin for employment opportunities. On the other hand, the socio-economic development of Nigeria since the end of the commercial manufacturing and exporting crops development leading to massive migration which was disrupted during the civil was continued unbaked after the war.<br/>        It is from the above noted that research work on the incidence of rural-urban drift in Awgu town settlers will be analyzed.<br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS<br/>Rural urban drift is a common phenomenon in Nigeria because the rate of which people drift from rural areas to urban areas is alarmingly high and thereby not encouraging. It posses some problems on the urban area thereby making it difficult for the out migrate to stele down comfortably.<br/>        Rural urban drift is a problem especially on the urban settlers because first and foremost, when the urban drift leaves the rural area as a result of the “pull” factors which are mainly seen in the urban area for instance, the attraction of  higher wages in the city, good rods and transport system electricity (power supply) according to Forts (1970) labour enterprises and skills are now marketable in their own right anywhere in the country, “good and sound” education and a host of many “pull” factors which attract people to the city.<br/>On the urban drift arrival in the city, the reception is sometime hostile especially where the urban drift does not know anyone in the receiving society he is going to and does not have enough funds on him. On the contrary, the reception time is worn when the urban drift has relatives Kinsmen, he will put up with till he secures in job is able to earn a living.                       <br/>As the urban drift moves to the urban areas from the rural area. It leads to dividing numbers of villages and poor agricultural production. The urban areas offer a large variety of activities and these are clubs and organization associated with almost every activity from acting and bicycling to rock-hounding and going to amusement parks. Some companies sponsor clubs and sports teams, despite these  heart plans, these are those who find themselves in trouble  as contingency planning which is appropriate before moving to the urban is not considered (Dough and Vargh 1998).<br/>It is possible that those who drift into Awgu town will encounter problems. According to Ayles Worth and Bloom (1976), they saw an urban drift as having a lower surviving rate as a result of factors, such as the urban drift low socio-economic  origin and greater difficulty in procuring financial and which increased the possibility of attention through an interview. The urban drift also reveled/mentioned problems which reflected high level of stress and alienation problems of feeling with the urban area (town) size and impersonality finding other residents who were cultural similar end or friendly.<br/>Many people moving from a rural to urban environment to have title concept of the associated cost and may therefore be in severe financial difficulties within a short time at the arrival. If a realistic budget which is an important aspect of adjusting to an urban life is not considered, Lawrence (1984) so having indentified the  effects of rural urban drift on the rural settler.<br/>Over the years calls have been made from consigned quarters varying the government (both the military and civil authorities) to hasten the pace of development in rural areas pointing out the effect of rural-urban drift as a serious threat to national socio-economic development every indication, the clarion call seem to have fallen into deaf ears of our leaders. Thereby  forcing the massive surge of the jobless dropouts semi-skilled, able-bodied men and women to abandon the rural area with its poor, unattractive, unprogressive, suppressible environment, roaming the urban areas looking for any menial jobs for mere substance.<br/>The effect of population increases serves also as a clear factor instigating the drift to the urban. One may be motivated  therefore to ask has the government been able to contain or decisively address the problems of rural urban drift. With its attendant problem? What are the reasons for the abject neglect of the rural areas? In spite of the huge allocation of fund from the federal coffer for both capital and recurrent expenditure to develop the rural areas, so as to stem down the rural-urban drift, there is no visible impact to justify the colossal sum being ear-marked yearly for the development of the rural areas in this country especially in Awgu LGA. It must be noted that most of  people living in Awgu LGA are peasant farmers and petty traders, semi-skilled artisans and dropouts. Who can not afford decent means of livelihood coupled with the land tenure system prevailing in Igbo land. So, youths and able-bodied from the case study area (Awgu town) therefore have no other choice than to leave the rural environment abounding the very elderly ones in search of means of sustenance.<br/>Having  established industries in Awgu de-emphasizing rural-urban migration by  providing  social amenities in the rural areas like good roads, electricity, pipe borne water. Since most of these facilities do not exist in the rural area, it makes the rural dwellers  to seek for improved or better, life in the urban cities so as to feel belonged formulation policy measures that might remedy or control the effects of rural  urban drift  and others. These solution shall be sought and recommended it hoped that such  suggested solution should help if followed properly, but if not solved completely. More and more people will continue to migrate to urban conters to avoid feeling of inferiority to their counterparts in the urban centers.<br/>1.3 RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>The following research questions are formulated to guide the study.<br/>1.   To what extent is the incidence of rural urban drift common among the people of Awgu town, Awgu LGA?<br/>2.   What factors are responsible for the incidence of rural-urban drift among the people of Awgu town, Awgu LGA?<br/>3.   What are the effects of our migration on the economy of  Awgu town, Awgu LGA?<br/>4.   What are the solutions to the problems of rural-urban drift among the people of Awgu town, Awgu LGA?<br/>1.4 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>        The objectives of this study is to<br/>1.   To ascertain the extent is the incidence of rural urban drift common among the people of Awgu town, Awgu LGA?<br/>2.   To identify the factors are responsible for the incidence of rural-urban drift among the people of Awgu town, Awgu LGA?<br/>3.   To find out the effects of our migration on the economy of  Awgu town, Awgu LGA?<br/>4.   To proffer solutions to the problems of rural-urban drift among the people of Awgu town, Awgu LGA?<br/>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/>        The study is significant in two ways.<br/>        It will add to the existing body of knowledge on rural depopulation. <br/>        Practically, the study is significant in that it will create awareness among the people of Awgu town on the evil effects of out-migration. <br/>1.6    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>1.     Rurality or rural dwellers:     Are these people that lives in the village and their main occupation are farming<br/>2.     urban dwellers:   They are those people that live in the town or city.<br/>3.     rural-urban drift: It is the movement of the people from the rural to urban areas in search of greener pasture<br/>4.     Urbanism:  Denotes the distinct quality of human community which is a special mode of existing or way of life which is characteristics of the city.

The need for the study arises because of the alarming rate of increase of human trafficking among the youth in the area study on Edo. From the analysis, it was found that human trafficking brings about total moral breakdown and breakdown peaceful marriage or homes. Human trafficking brings about loss of lives and property; human trafficking terminates academic careers and also brings poor national image or poor reputation in the state. the objective of this study is to alleviate human trafficking or abolish human trafficking from the entire members of the state. The researcher therefore, recommend that there should be the awareness of sex education in all schools, the use of mass media for proper enlightenment to parents and youths. Teaching of moral or religious training in schools should be mandatory in the school curriculum, as these can help in solving the problems. Government and non government agents should educated the entire members of the state on the dangers of human trafficking include it into the school curriculum. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE      <br/>Background of the study<br/>Statement of problem<br/>Research questions<br/>Significance of study<br/>Research objectives<br/>Scope of study<br/>CHAPTER TWO     <br/>Literature review<br/>CHAPTER THREE <br/>Research methodology<br/>The population and sample<br/>Content validity<br/>Reliability of instrument<br/>Research instrument<br/>Administration of questionnaire<br/>Collection of data<br/>Data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR    <br/>Analysis<br/>CHAPTER FIVE     <br/>Summary, conclusion and recommendations<br/>Conclusion<br/>Recommendation<br/>REFERENCES        <br/>QUESTIONNAIRE  <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY<br/>            Human trafficking is an ugly fact of our society that is prevalent even today. Human trafficking is a world-wide problematic issue. Over the years, it has metamorphose into frig teeming growth rate, having reached its peak and without showing sign of reduction in parts of Africa, Eastern, Europe, the Caribbean’s and Latin American countries. It is crucial to note that the increase on the cases of human trafficking in Nigeria is due to the undaunted efforts of the operators and profiteers of the business who are quick to cite unprecedented poverty and the near absence of the basic necessities of life as their driving force. <br/>            Human trafficking has brought poor reputation in the state. our main economic problem is human trafficking., since we began on the path of nationhood or society. The main obstacle for striding bodily on this path has been the human trafficking problem because of unemployment. As a result of this, there has been for the past few years steady drift away of young men into other countries. This has the chain result of our society being left under populated or underdeveloped. <br/>            Secondly, Nigeria has been bedeviled by myriad of problem most of the problems can be attributed to the pervasiveness of some of the ills that hamper the attainment of the development of the society. As a result of ills that currently hampers the development of the country, human trafficking has become widespread and now occupied a preeminent position among the ills that pervade the Nigeria society. While, it may appear that the problem seem endemic in Edo State especially Oredo Local Government, there are indications that no parts of the country is immune from this social malaise that has ravaged many communities. There are an estimated 80 million by 2015. The international labour organization (ILO) recently estimated that over 12 million Nigerian children especially in Edo State are engaged in child labour. The survey also estimated that over 10, 000 Nigerian are engaged in prostitution in Italy which constitutes in the Italian sex market. Most of these women and girls are initially trafficked victims many people especially women and children are lured with the promise of good jobs and salaries and then sold into prostitution or bonded labour. <br/>            Human trafficking is considered to be modern day slavery where many children and women are force fully or fraudulently recruited, transported and harbored for sexual or labour exploitation. The victims of human trafficking are usually made to provide sex under threat and without consent. However, they are also used as labors to work in field and fisheries, sweep shops or as domestic helps. Thirdly, human trafficking is the fastest growing criminal industry in the world with the total annual revenue for trafficking in persons, not less than two hundred and fifty thousand persons, mostly female (i.e. 60% persons ranging from 12 years-18 years, while 40% persons above 18 years are trafficked across the Nigerian borders yearly especially in Oredo, Edo State and other part of Edo State. the business of trafficking in human beings is today organized by groups that are also involved in weapons and narcotics colluding with government officials in dozen countries. There is very little doubt that it is in curative business and maybe one of the most difficult to combat. They are less visible than those caused by gun running and trafficking. Exploiting the poverty and low status of women in the developing world, middle men are able to bring together the supply and demand for cheap labour and sex in ways that linkable not long ago. Though, the fact of human trafficking is not difficult to understand on its own, its dimension and categorization continue to multiply by the day. The educational curriculum might have over sighted this problem, therefore no room was created for this social ills the subjects that deals on moral that is Christian religious knowledge and the Islamic religious knowledge are gradually phasing out as teacher that staunched these courses are not being employed by some employers social studies which exposes our children to the vices and virtues in the society is only studied in the junior secondary classes. So students cannot but cope with the make believe life of affluence, flamboyances, greed which has made people especially the female trafficking a huge success in our society.           <br/>            Human trafficking is the illegal commerce and trade of people.

The socialization process and its related out within the social safely net of the community. However, with increasing unemployment, a weak institutional frame work and a breakdown of the extended family system, millions of children have been forced into new types of labour that are exploitative, hazardous and prejudicial to their welfare and development, middle men have now emerged who exploit the desperation and ignorance of parents particularly those in the rural area to produce children and exploitative labour this as become known as child trafficking. As child labour and trafficking in the African region began increasing media attention studies for a conducted to confirm the extend of the problem UNICEF constructed a pilot study in 1998 on the solution in the southern Nigeria border town of Calabar Ugo Owerri port-headcount and Lagos and found that 40% of Nigeria girls living on trafficking for prostitution activities.  In addition, regional conferences in continuo in 1998 and in Libreville in 2000, sties more light on the problem.

Dozens of federal, state and local government partners contributed and continue to reduce the problem and effect of child trafficking. There are also NGOS addressing the problem, many of whom are noted active organizations. An example of an innovative practice in the war against child trafficking is the establishment of a skill acquisition center by India renaissance in Edo State.

He meant that all of geographically owing to choice, employment, political or economic conditions. But this conditions are given willingly and the victim perhaps unconscious of the occurrence. But there is however, a difference in kind, when we consider the imprisonment enforced by the sentence of court upon citizens of law. The place of captivity, especially a bucking to which persons are committed while awaiting trails or for punishment.<br/>Social welfare service according to Chorodhry (1979) are those services designed for the weaker and vulnerable section of the community who due to some handicap, socio-economic, physical and mental disabilities are unable to make use of traditionally denied the use of those services. There are also those who are physically whole but are equally deprived for reasons e.g. there are religions practices that tend to confined women to an everlasting life of privacy Purdah.<br/>The second definition is that offered by the United Nations Economic Council for Africa (UNECA) that body defined social welfare for the promotion of social well being through helping people to help themselves in meeting the needs in such areas as family and child health social adjustment, leisure of time, standard of living and socio-relationship. It may also be defined as a science provided by the state whose objective is the improvement of the welfare of the individual. It is no wonder than why it is necessary that such department be established in institution like prison. It has been the recognized right of societ5ies to punish offenders. Today, nearly the way most societies deal with persons who commit an offence is to confine them to persons. Some staying there for rest of their lives while a few may be sentenced t death depending on the nature of their offence. The prisoners at times wonder how they get to such situation bringing the past into memory and possibly locating their errors and mistakes. There are some prisoners that could become hardened offenders if they are left to the treatment of warden and they will not come about the outcome of any offence or act of theirs. If there is no section of the prison to advise these people on their present situation and thereafter discharge, their lives will be miserable and the society will be in further danger. The unfortunate condition or state of a prisoner in our community is said deplorable and that this situation could make people fed up about life and convinced in themselves that they cannot do better again in life. The society is at a distance from them and all former friends and relations desert them. By this, discharged prisoners become rejected in the societies. They are usually left with people who have suffered the same spell of life by accidental or by merit. The result of such reaction by the society to the criminal minded discharged prisoners is that they become hardened offenders, they are more fervent in their criminal ways and subsequently they become outcasts in the community. But with the efficient working of the social welfare services department of the prison, the life thinking and general horizon of these prisons could be improved and made better. Prison welfare services aim at enabling the prisoners to obtain adequate corrective training in the process of their imprisonment and to attain a satisfactory social and economic adjustment when discharged from prison.          <br/>1.2              STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>The welfare of prisoners is linked up with many others social problems which are the roots cause of their imprisonment. Since the role of social welfare officer of the prison is to assist the prisoners make a satisfactory adjustment, reinforcement, rehabilitation and reintegration into community life when he is eventually discharged. Following the confinement of offenders as prisoners are a chain of related problem never thought of, nor dreamt of by the prisoners. They have complex problem, the totality of which makes things worse for them. For this reasons one sees the need to cool them down and reassure them your lawful cooperation. This will give them some hope of confidence and a feeling of belonging to the community in this regard, they could realize that, it is not too late to adjust and become once more a lawful abiding and legitimate member of the community to which they belong.     <br/>1.3              PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>The objectives of the study were as follows:<br/>1.                  To examine the level of availability of welfare service in Oko Prison<br/>2.                  To determine whether the inmates are able to obtain adequate corrective training in the process of their imprisonment due to the provision of the welfare services.<br/>3.                  To identify the problems facing the provision of welfare services in the Nigeria prison.<br/>4.                  To find out the type of adult education programmes being organized for the prisoners.<br/>5.                  To see if the welfare service help in the reformations, rehabilitation and reintegration of the inmates back into the society.  <br/>1.4              RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>Based on the problems raised above and the purpose generated, the following research questions were raised.<br/>1.                  What are the problems facing provision of welfare services in the Nigerian prison?<br/>2.                  How do the welfare services help in the reformation, rehabilitation and reintegration of inmates back in the society?<br/>3.                  What are the types of adult education programme organized for prisoners?<br/>4.                  What are the levels of welfare services available in Oko Prison?<br/>5.                  Are the inmates able to obtain adequate corrective training in the process of their imprisonment due to the provision of the welfare services? <br/>1.5              SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>This study of the opinion to make correction and serve as a corrective measure. It is the prisoners or inmates to adjust to the normal norms and values of the society that is keeping to the laws and regulations of the land. It gives clear report of what the prisons look like and what is their operation rather than a mere false impression created as before. The researcher is out to enlighten the people on these, not to see member of the prison as a constraint to the society but to give necessary assistance. It is of the opinion to let people aware that the prisoners have undergone various training to enable them to be self reliant economically or being absorbed to any enterprise. The aims and objectives is to maintain laws and order in the society. as a result, it helps governments to reduce criminal act in the society. it reduces the labour market due to the rehabilitation programme they have undergone in the prison through the government effort.  <br/>1.6              SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>A service that is as wide as social welfare would equally cover a wide variety of programmes or services. It has been noted by authors in the literature that any social welfare should have a scope which covers:<br/>1.                  Support programmes for deprived children<br/>2.                  Support programmes for the physical children<br/>3.                  Support for the [physical disabled<br/>4.                  Services for the mentally disordered.<br/>5.                  Services for the medically handicapped prison that is those suffering from chronic illness like cancer heart disease kidney failure, HIV/AIDS etc.<br/>6.                  Social services for the backward or educationally disadvantaged people and<br/>7.                  Other community welfare services to ease family relations problems, delinquency, poverty housing and other social problems. <br/>1.7              DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>The proper understanding of their piece of work will be highly appreciated if the terminology used in this study is explained in a clear and understanding languages.
