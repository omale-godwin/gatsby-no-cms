Following previous methodology, per capita income was used to proxy economic growth in Nigeria. Based on the empirical analysis, the results show that agricultural output in itself does not stimulate per capita income in Nigeria. This is perhaps due to the weak productivity in the sector that has led to low yield output from small inefficient farms; agricultural exports have a significant positive impact on economic growth in Nigeria Again, while physical investment has a significant stimulating effect on agricultural output in Nigeria,human capital investment does not have a direct positive impact on economic growth in Nigeria.<br/>    The study recommends among others thatthe government should expedite means of increasing fund availability to farmers in the country. The various financing schemes/initiatives of successive Nigerian administrations designed to improve access to credit for the rural poor have been largely inefficient and ineffective. Also,investment in infrastructure should be boosted in the country. <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/>            Per capita income is a measure of the amount of money that is being earned per person in a certain area. It can apply to the average per-person income for a city, region or country and is used as a means of evaluating the living conditions and quality of life in different areas. It is usually calculated for a given country by dividing the country's national income by its population.<br/>    The place of agricultural production in enhancing the well being of the people can not be over emphasized. This is true because, it is the only sector providing stable food for the timid population. The Nigerian agricultural sector has suffered from extreme low productivity, reflecting reliance on antiquated methods. Although overall agricultural production rose by 28% during the 1990s, per capita output rose by only 8.5% during the same decade. Agriculture has failed to keep pace with Nigeria's rapid population growth, so that the country, which once exported food, now relies on imports to sustain itself (The World Bank Group, 2011).<br/>In Sub-Saharan Africa, Nigeria accounts for the largest population of about150 million people in 2006 national population census. It has a complex social and political history that has, for the most part, impacted adversely on the population and has worsened income distribution over time. The main constraint to the growth of the agricultural sector is the fact that the structure and method of production have remained the same since independence more than four decades ago (Ukeje, 2005) The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization rates the productivity of Nigeria’s farmland as low to medium— but with medium to good productivity if properly managed (Nigerian National planning Commission, 2004).  To be effective, and attain higher level of productivity and growth in the agricultural sector, that will inadvertently spur up the per capita income of the people, there is a need to identify the major factors determining agricultural production and income per capita of the people overtime.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM  <br/>    In the literature, it is an obvious fact that agriculture plays an important role in economic growth and development  and  poverty  reduction. Agriculture contributes  to  economic  growth  in different ways such as provision of food and employment (Johnston &amp; Mellor 1961; Ranis et al. 1990; Irz et al. 2001; Timmer 2002; World Bank 2008). Together with the trend of trade liberalization, agricultural export can bring important sources of income for countries, especially the developing ones. A large proportion of the poor are often agriculture-based, and agricultural growth can be a key to pro-poor growth and poverty alleviation (Andersen and Lorch 1995; UNDP 1997; Irz et al. 2001; World Bank 2008). The negative relationship between agricultural growth and poverty is evidence in many empirical studies like Rangarajan (1982), Coxhead and Warr (1991), Datt and Ravallion (1996), Thorbecke and Jung, (1996), and Irz et al.(2001). However, agriculture is not always a panacea for poverty reduction. Agriculture is always associated with economic and natural risks. The poor farmers, especially in developing countries are most vulnerable to these risks. For example, a country which relies on agricultural export can be adversely affected by global economic shocks (Winters et al. 2004; Easterly and Kraay 2000). A sudden decrease in prices of agricultural outputs can quickly push the poor households who are in tradable agriculture into losses and poverty. Natural risks such as calamity and diseases can result in heavy loss for agricultural households. In addition, the industrial and service sectors tend to grow more quickly than the agricultural sector in the long run. The shrinking of agriculture relative to industry and service has been observed in both developed and developing countries. The non-farm employment and business have been proved to be an effective way to increase household income and reduce poverty (Lanjouw and Lanjouw,1995; Lanjouw, 1997; Van de Walle, 1994; Ruben and Van den Berg, 2001).  <br/>    According to the Federal Republic of Nigeria (2000) on Obasanjo’s Economic Direction 1995-2003, the contribution of agriculture to the Nigerian economic growth is very low compared to what it used to be in the past. Nigerian agriculture to a large extent still possesses the characteristics of a peasant economy that was prominent in the pre-independence period (Adewumi  andOmotesho, 2002).  However, Lawal and Atte (2006), citing Jeter (2004), Chigbu (2005) and Nigerian National planning Commission (2004) assert that in spite of the presence of two major rivers, the Niger and the Benue, the agricultural sector is still predominantly rain fed and its productivity has seriously declined over the past two decades and as a result, rural poverty is rampant.  The world bank data showed that more than 70% of Nigerians live below the poverty line (which is less than a dollar per day) meaning that there has been an astronomical growth in the levels of poverty of Nigerians, most of whom are engaged in agriculture from independence till date. Farming population comprises predominantly resource-poor peasants, cultivating an average of about two hectares of land usually on scattered holdings with low and declining productivity.<br/>    In view of the foregoing therefore, it seems obvious that there is no general consensus on the impact of agricultural output on per capita income as well as the growth of the economy at large. While some argued that agriculture is less productive than the non-agriculture sectors in terms of value creation. In other words, most countries that have larger non agriculture sector in relative terms are richer than those whose economies are dominated by agriculture. Others simply argued that growth in agriculture is a precondition for industrialization and that the spectacular industrial revolution would not have been possible without the agricultural revolution that preceded it (Nurkse, 1953 and Rostow, 1960). <br/>    Therefore, this study is an attempt to empirically examine the impact of agricultural productivity on the long-run per capita income in Nigeria, and to see if there is any agricultural led per capita income growth over time.  <br/>1.3    RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>   I.        What is the impact of agricultural output on per capita income as a proxy for economic development in Nigeria?<br/>II.    Does agricultural exports have any effect on per capita income in     Nigeria?<br/>1.4        OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>       The main objective of the study is to examine the relationship between agricultural production or output and per capita income as a proxy for economic development in Nigeria. <br/>The specific objectives are: <br/>I.    to examine the impact of agricultural output on per capita income<br/>II.    to determine the effects of agricultural exports on per capita income in Nigeria.<br/>1.5    HYPOTHESES OF THE STUDY<br/>The following are the hypotheses of the study:<br/>I.    Agricultural output does not affect per capita income in Nigeria<br/>II.    Agricultural exports have no significant impact on per capita income in Nigeria.<br/>1.6    SIGNIFICANCE  OF STUDY<br/>    The study will be very relevant to the government and policy makers in Nigeria, as it will provide them useful information on agricultural output and per capita income in formulating appropriate policies and programmes on the agricultural sector of the economy that will in turn enhance income per capita of the people and the growth of the economy at large. <br/>Secondly, the study will also be very useful to academia, researchers, students of agricultural sciences, finance, economics and all allied disciplines, as it will provide them strong data base to carry out further studies in the same area, if they so wish.<br/>1.7    SCOPE OF STUDY <br/>    It is a Nigeria specific study, designed to cover a period of 30 years (1981 to 2010). Relevant data will be sourced from the Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin and the Federal Office of Statistics. <br/>1.8        LIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>    The accuracy and reliability of the source of data might affect the overall result of the study. However, effort will be made to reduce the error to the barest minimum and ensure that the results are accurate.<br/>    Secondly, the time frame for a study of this nature was not sufficient, as the researcher has to carry out the study simultaneously with normal academic work. This of course was a major limitation of the study.<br/><br/>\n\nIMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT ON PER CAPITA INCOME IN NIGERIA 1980 TO 2010<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT ON PER CAPITA INCOME IN NIGERIA 1980 TO 2010", "id": 1}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>STATE POLICY AND FOOD SECURITY IN NIGERIA: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES IN EDO STATE<br/>CHAPTER ONE</b><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Background of the Study<br/>Food security has become an issue of global concern in recent times. Nigeria with her huge endowed natural and human resources is not spared. In Nigeria, food accounts for a larger and increasing share of family budgets for majority of rural and urban families. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO, 2008), an agency of the United Nations once raised alarm that Nigeria food situation was in dire straits.<br/>State involvement in agriculture in Nigeria dates back to the colonial era, which marked the beginning of direct government involvement in agriculture development. The agricultural policy of the colonial government was primarily focused on encouraging only export crops like cocoa, rubber, palm, cotton and groundnut to support the Agro-industries in Europe. This started within the establishment of research stations in Samuru (1921), Umudike (1923) and Moor plantation (1924).<br/>The government's priority at that time was to boost domestic production, particularly of the cash crops. This strong intervention pushed Nigeria to the position of the world's top producer of rubber, groundnut and palm oil, and the world's second largest cocoa producer at Independence (Onuwalaetal., 2004).<br/>The Nigeria government was able to execute investment projects through earnings from export of agricultural products. In the 1940s and 1950s, Nigeria agricultural export commodities contributed over 75 per cent of the total annual merchandise exports (Ekpo and Egwaikhide, 1994; cited in Oni, 2012). Up to late <br/>1960s agricultural products dominated Nigeria's non-oil export trade accounting for nearly 70 percent of the value of non-oil exports.<br/>However, the introduction of petroleum into the nation's export trade had changed the composition and structure of the export trade. The oil sector which initially contributed modestly to the economy in the 1960s, became more important in the 1970s and it is now overwhelmingly important to the point of the economy becoming dependent on it, providing about 95 per cent of foreign exchange earnings as well as 65 percent of budgetary revenue (CBN, 2010) cited in (Oni, 2012).<br/>Prior to the 1970s, there was no clear food consumption crisis in Nigeria (Aromolaran and Aromolaran, 1999). The food crisis became obvious when the contribution of agriculture to the economy began to decline in the early 1970s coupled with the outbreak of the civil war between 1967 and 1970 where food was used as a weapon of war. Nigerian government truncated food supply to the war-torn area which led to malnutrition. One of the major signs of malnutrition was kwashiorkor, a protein deficiency disease which was widespread during the period. Starvation in Nigeria/Biafra attracted international attention. Through the relief activities of international bodies different types of European foods were brought into the country and became available to a large number of people. Such foods included rice, milk, wheat flour, assorted kinds of canned foods and beverages. Gradually, many people developed a taste for these foods, which before the war, were only available and demanded by the elites.<br/>In desperation to addressing this food crisis, Gen. Yakubu Gowon's military regime embarked on large scale importation of rice in the early 1970s to stave off hunger. But the Nigeria ports did not have the facilities to handle the huge importation of what came to be called the rice 'Amada.' The ports were choked by rice and a decongestion committee had to be set up (Ekpu, 2009).<br/>The importation of rice could not tackle the long term problem of food security. This food crisis led to the drafting of the Second National Development Plan (1970 -1974). The development plan spelt out a more defined approach towards food production as the main nexus of the plan. The National Accelerated Food Production Project (NAFPP) was launched in 1972.<br/>In 1976, General Obasanjo government initiated an agriculture programme called Operation Feed the Nation (OFN). This was intended to be some kind of agricultural revolution in which everyone was asked to be involved. The regime also established River Basins and Rural Development Authorities across the country saddled with the task of providing irrigation services to farmers. This was followed by the \"Green Revolution\" (1980-1983) launched by the civilian government of President Shehu Shagari. These programmes focused on strengthening agricultural production, providing subsidized inputs, community development and access to credit (Osakue, et.al. 1986). However, all these were implemented without a transparent framework to structure action and the successive government at the head of the country lacked continuity.<br/>In 1999, at the return of democracy, the Obasanjo civilian administration publicly restates government commitment to combat hunger. A series of special programs was launched. They include:<br/>(a)    Special Programme for Food Security (SPFS)<br/>(b)    Root and Tuber Expansion Programme (RTEP)<br/>(c)    Fadama Development Project (FDP) (Bello, 2004).<br/>Musa Ya' Adua's administration on assumption of office in 2007 listed food security as a core element of his seven-point agenda for the nation. While the Jonathan Goodluck\"s administration developed a blue print on food sufficiency tagged Agricultural Transformation Agenda. The policy thrust was on food crop chain development.<br/>However, in spite of these laudable objectives by previous administrations in addressing food shortage, a reasonable percentage of Nigerians still lack access to food to meet their dietary needs. The small holder farmers who constitute over 95 per cent of the labour force in the agricultural sector were not most beneficiaries of these government agricultural programmes.<br/>Statement of the Research Problem<br/>Nigeria faces huge food security challenges. About 70 percent of the population lives on less than N200 (US $0.70) per day, suffering hunger and poverty. Despite its reputation as petroleum resources dependent, Nigeria remains an agrarian economy. The sector provides over 40% of gross domestic product (GDP) with between 60% and 70% of the population productively engaged in farming.<br/>Nigeria has about 79 million hectares of arable land, of which 32 million hectares are cultivated. Over 90 per cent of agricultural production is rain-fed. Small holders, mostly subsistence producers, account for 80 per cent of all farm holdings. Both crop and livestock production remains below potentials. Inadequate access to and low uptake of high quality seeds, low fertilizer uses and inefficient production system led to the shortfall (Nwajiuba, 2012; cited in FAO, 2012).<br/>The agricultural sector in Nigeria had witnessed several problems ranging from farmer’s usage of crude and primitive implements for farming, inadequate capital, low level of education, inadequate infrastructural and storage facilities, weak agricultural policies, over-reliance on oil production by the government, land tenure system, poverty, ageing farming population, climate change, insurgency and Fulani-herdsmen menace across the country. Other issues militating against food sufficiency in Nigeria is appetite for food items not produced in the country. A former Minister in Nigeria, under the Jonathan administration, Akinwunmi (2012), once noted that Nigeria was the only country in the world that did not produce wheat but ate 100 per cent wheat bread.<br/>Farmers in Nigeria also have limited access to credit facilities, for only one (1) per cent of total lending in banking sector goes to agricultural sector that accounts for 70 percent of employment opportunities. Also, the global economy is knowledge-driven and food system efficiency is dependent heavily and directly on agricultural technological innovations and innovations in relevant sectors. The low rate of educated rural farmers affects the application of new innovations to modern farming.<br/>The crisis of insurgency in the North has forced some of the crop farmers and pastoralists to abandon their lands and relocate to the neighbouring countries of Chad, Niger and Cameroun. In addition, corruption in the administration of agricultural programmes has hinder the development of the sector. For instance, whereas the Obasanjo administration awarded contract to about 65 companies for the supply of fertilizers, the regime that succeeded it limited the number of contractors to three. Subsequently, the companies were linked to the late President Umaru Yar'Adua's family (Manuako, 2010).<br/>Flowing from the above, climate change, corruption, low funding, insecurity, over dependence on the oil sector, structural imbalance in the economy and technological advancement can be attributed as the major causes of food insecurity in Nigeria.<br/>Hence, this study attempts to evaluate the role of government policies in ensuring food sufficiency vis-a-vis its role in the advancement of modern farming techniques to boost food production in Nigeria.<br/>Objectives of the Study<br/>The aim of the study is to examine the Federal Government's policy on agriculture and challenges of achieving food security in Nigeria. The specific objectives are:<br/>    To identify the impact of state policy on agricultural productivity in the local government area of study. <br/>    To establish that agricultural development in Nigeria will help maximize economic self-reliance in sample area of study. <br/>    To identify the major challenges confronting agricultural productivity and hence food security in Nigeria.  <br/>    To establish that state policy and food security can provide answers to food insufficiency for the teaming population in sample area of study.<br/>Research Questions<br/>    What is the impact of state policy on agricultural productivity in the local government areas of study?<br/>    Will the establishment of agricultural development policy in Nigeria help to maximize economic self-reliance in sample area of study?<br/>    What are the major challenges confronting agricultural productivity and hence food security in Nigeria?<br/>    Can state policy on food security provide answers to food insufficiency for the teaming population in sample area of study?<br/>Research Propositions<br/>For the purpose of this study, the following propositions will be tested.<br/>•    State policy tends to promote agricultural productivity in the local government areas of study.<br/>•    The agricultural policy of the government encourages economic self-reliance in the sampled area of study.<br/>•    The agricultural policy of the state promotes food security in the local government areas of study.<br/>Scope of the Study<br/>This research study is primarily concerned with the issue of food security in Nigeria; Government commitment to food security and agricultural development in Nigeria. Also, views on agricultural practices, prospects, challenges and gap in the country's quest for food sufficiency will be examined.<br/>Significance of the Study<br/>This study will be of immense importance to the Federal and State Governments, agricultural development institutions, rural farmers as well as the general populace on the need to enact and formulate the right policies and programmes that would help boost agricultural productivity and therefore food security in the country. It will also provide an in-depth knowledge of the role of state policies in ensuring food sufficiency, examine various agricultural practices and the prospect in the agricultural sector in Nigeria. Finally, the research will contribute to knowledge and existing literature in public policy formulation and implementation.<br/>Operational Definition of Terms<br/>It is pertinent at this point to define or explain some key concepts. This is to ensure good understanding or appreciation of what the study is all about<br/>State:<br/>There is no academic consensus on the most appropriate definition of the state the term \"state\" refers to a set of different but interrelated and often overlapping theories about a certain range of political phenomena. The word state ultimately is derived from the Latin word \"status reipublicae,\" the \"condition of public matters.\" The early 16th century works of Machiavelli (the Prince) played a central role in popularizing the use of the word \"state\" in something similar to its modern sense. In political science, scholars have postulated different meanings to what the term \"state\" means or represent. For Engels (1880) in his work \"The Communist Manifesto,\" claimed that the state is nothing more than \"a committee for managing the common affairs of the bourgeoisie.\"<br/>Dahl (1973) posited that the state is a neutral arena for contending interests or its agencies as simply another set of interest groups. It asserts that all groups have an opportunity to pressure the state. Ella (1988) identified the state and political power as the \"Beast in the book of Revelation Chapter 13 (Christian Holy Bible).<br/>However, the most commonly used definition is that of Weber (1919), in his work: 'Politics as a Vocation,\" he posited that the state is an entity that successfully claims a monopoly of use of physical force within a given territory.<br/>Policy<br/>Nnamdi (2014) posited that policy means a plan of action agreed or chosen by government, a business organization. It provides a framework which guide decision or within which decisions are made in a particular problem area.<br/>Robert (1987) he opined that it is a statement of intent and it is implemented as a procedure or protocol.<br/>Food Security:<br/>According to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, 1996) food security obtains when all people at all times have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. Maxwell (in Nana-Sinkam, 1995) opined that a country and its people are food secured when their food system operates in such a way as to remove the fear that there will not be enough to eat. He further stressed that food security requires that the poor and vulnerable have secure access to the food they want.<br/>Furthermore, the World Bank (1991) cited in Attah, (2012) identified three pillars underpinning food security. These are food availability, food accessibility, and food utilization. This means that a nation whose food production level is unable to satisfy those three criteria is said to be food insecure. The major goal of food security therefore, is for individuals to be able to obtain adequate food needed at all times, and to be able to utilize the food to meet the body's needs.<br/>The World Food Summit Plan of Action (1996) states that food insecurity occurs when:<br/>    People experience a large reduction in their sources of food and are unable to make up the difference through new strategies;<br/>    The prevalence of malnutrition is abnormally high for most time of the year and this cannot be accounted for by either health or care factors;<br/>    A large proportion of the population of group is using marginal or unsuitable strategies; and<br/>    People are using \"coping\" strategies that are damaging to their livelihoods in the longer terms or incur some other unacceptable cost, such as acting illegally or immorally.<br/>Flowing from the above assertions of what food security denotes, the Nigeria food security situation can be said to be precarious and pernicious as a significant percentage of the Nigeria population is left with only the bilious taste of poverty.<br/>Agricultural Practices<br/>The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO, 2000) opined that agricultural practices are a collection of principles which apply to on-farm production and post-production processes resulting in safe and healthy food and non¬food agricultural products while taking account of economic, social and environmental sustainability. In addition, Ogunleye-Adetona (2012) posited that agricultural practice which is broadly classified into subsistence and commercial farming is a process of farming in which farmers choose a particular type of farming practices.<br/>In Agricultural Science scholarship there is a distinction between cropping system and livestock farming. Cropping system is a farming method where only crops is considered as the value chains while livestock farming deals with poultry, diary and animal husbandry. However, a farming system under agricultural practices is a combination of crops system and livestock production.<br/><br/>\n\nSTATE POLICY AND FOOD SECURITY IN NIGERIA: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES IN EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " STATE POLICY AND FOOD SECURITY IN NIGERIA: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES IN EDO STATE", "id": 2}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Agriculture is a key part of DFID’s efforts to reduce global poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals. It extends into many other areas of development policy and complements our work on issues such as fisheries, forestry, food security, social protection, governance and trade. Building on our understanding of livelihoods (DFID, 2002), this paper shows why we believe agriculture should be placed at the heart of efforts to reduce poverty. It proposes principles and priorities to guide our work, and to help decision-makers to weigh up the potential growth and poverty impact of agriculture compared with other competing demands on resources. Our approach to agriculture is based on the premise that agriculture’s importance to poverty reduction goes far beyond its direct impact on farmers’ incomes. There is a mass of evidence that increasing agricultural productivity has benefited millions through higher incomes, more plentiful and cheaper food, and by generating patterns of development that are employment-intensive and benefit both rural and urban areas. More importantly, it has provided the spur to economic development outside agriculture where growth and job creation are faster and wages higher.</p>\n\nGROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION: THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION: THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE", "id": 3}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Lack of access to credit has negatively affected poor farmers and rural dwellers for many years. Rural people need credit to allow investment in their farms and small businesses, to smooth consumption and to reduce their vulnerability to weather and economic shocks. Because they have little access to formal financing institutions, poor rural people follow sub optimal risk management and consumption strategies and rely on costly informal credit sources (FAO, 2010). To this end, Eluhaiwe (2008) noted that microfinance banks were established in Nigeria in 2005 for the purpose of providing economically active poor and low income earners financial services, to help them engage in income generating activities or expand their businesses. By definition, microfinance refers to the provision of financial services to the poor or low income clients including consumers and the self employed ledgerwood (2010). According to Robert(2009), microfinance refers to movements that envisions a world in which as many poor or near poor households as possible have permanent. Access to an appropriate range of high quality financial services including not just credit but also savings, insurance and fund transfers. In addition, Eluhaiwe (2008) stated that microfinance is about providing financial services to the poor who are traditionally not served by the conventional financial institution.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF MICROFINANCE BANKS SERVICES ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION OF MEMBERS OF COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF MICROFINANCE BANKS SERVICES ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION OF MEMBERS OF COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES ", "id": 4}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>FARMERS ADOPTION OF IMPROVED TECHNOLOGY IN CASSAVA PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING IN PERI-URBAN AREAS OF EDO STATE: A CASE STUDY OF IKPOBA OKHA AND OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS</strong><br/><br/></p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/><br/>Title page--------ii<br/><br/>Certification--------iii<br/><br/>Dedication--------iv<br/><br/>Acknowledgement-------v<br/><br/>Table of Content-------vi<br/><br/>List of Tables--------vii<br/><br/>Abstract--------x<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>Introduction-------1<br/><br/>Background to the Study-----1<br/><br/>Statement of the Problem-----3<br/><br/>Objectives of the Study-----4<br/><br/>Hypothesis------5<br/><br/>Justification------5<br/><br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/><br/>Literature Review-----7<br/><br/>Cassava Production in Nigeria----7<br/><br/>Peri-Urban Definition And Classification--8<br/><br/>Peri-Urban Agriculture And Its Importance--11<br/><br/>Technology, Technology Adoption, Stages of Adoption and <br/><br/>Adopter Characteristics-----11<br/><br/>Factors affecting Technology Adoption--14<br/><br/>Socio Economic Characteristics of Cassava Farmers<br/><br/>In Nigeria------15<br/><br/>Constraints to Cassava Production in Nigeria--16<br/><br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/><br/>3.0 Methodology------19<br/><br/>3.1Area of the Study-----19<br/><br/>3.1.1Scope of the Study-----19<br/><br/>3.2Sampling Techniques and Sample Size--20<br/><br/>3.3Sources of Data-----20<br/><br/>3.4Measurement of Variables----21<br/><br/>3.5Method of Data Analysis----22<br/><br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/><br/>4.0Result Discussion-----23<br/><br/>4.1Socio-Economic Characteristics of the Respondents-23<br/><br/>4.2Awareness of Improved Production and processing <br/><br/>Technologies------27<br/><br/>4.3Level of Adoption of Improved Production and <br/><br/>Processing Technologies----29<br/><br/>4.4Factors Affecting the Adoption of Improved Cassava <br/><br/>Production and Processing Technologies--30<br/><br/>4.5Sources of Information on Improved Cassava Production<br/><br/>And Processing Technologies---34<br/><br/>4.6Problems Encountered by Cassava farmers --35<br/><br/>4.7Testing of Hypothesis----38<br/><br/>4.7.1Hypothesis I------38<br/><br/>4.7.2Hypothesis II------39<br/><br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/><br/>5.0Summary, Conclusion and Recommendation--41<br/><br/>5.1Summary------41<br/><br/>5.2Conclusion------42<br/><br/>5.3Recommendation-----43<br/><br/>Reference------45<br/><br/>Appendix------49<br/><br/>LIST OF TABLES<br/><br/>Table 1:Frequency Distribution of the Socio- Economic <br/><br/>Characteristics of Respondents------26<br/><br/>Table 2.1: Awareness of Improved Cassava Production <br/><br/>Technologies among Respondents----28<br/><br/>Table 2.2: Length of Time Respondents Heard About the <br/><br/>Improved Technologies------28<br/><br/>Table 3: Level of Adoption of Improved Cassava <br/><br/>Production and Processing Technologies among <br/><br/>Respondents-------30<br/><br/>Table 4: Factors Affecting Adoption of Technology----33<br/><br/>Table 5: Sources of information on improved Cassava <br/><br/>Production Technologies------34<br/><br/>Table 6.1: Problems Affecting Cassava Farmers----36<br/><br/>Table 6.2: Problems Brought Under Control by Farmers---37<br/><br/>Table 6.3: Source of Information Most Helpful in Tackling Problems--37<br/><br/>Table 6.4: The Three Most Important Problems Affecting <br/><br/>Cassava Farmers-------38<br/><br/>Table 7: Relationship between Respondent’s Socio-Economic -<br/><br/>Characteristics and Adoption of Improved Technologies--39<br/><br/>Table 8: Relationship between Cassava Farmers’ Sources of <br/><br/>Information on Improved Production Technology and<br/><br/>Their Adoption of these Technologies----40<br/><br/><br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>This study was aimed at determining farmer’s adoption of improved technology in cassava production and processing in peri-urban areas of Edo state using Ikpoba Okha and Ovia North East local government areas as case studies. Purposive sampling was used to select 6 wards from which simple random sampling was used to select each of 148 cassava farmers from the 6 wards. The data was analysed using frequency counts, percentages and Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to test the hypothesis. It was found that majority of the farmers are male (65.54%), married (74.32%) above 41-50 years of age (33.11%); low youth participation (10.81%) in cassava production and processing, having above 6-10 years farming experience (27.70%). The farmers were found to be aware of improved technologies; use of fertilizers had the highest awareness level at 98%, they adopted planting time in April (2.72), Tms 30527 (2.53), Optimum spacing of 1m by 1m (2.53), Tms 4(2)1425 (2.37), Use of herbicides (2.26), use of NPK fertilizer (2.24), Motorised grater (2.08) and their major problems were related to inadequate funds. Membership of cooperatives was found to affect adoption of technology significantly. It was recommended that youths should be encouraged to participate in cassava production by providing them with production inputs, land, credit and encouraging them to join cooperatives to enable them participate fully in cassava production.<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>1.1 Background to the Study<br/><br/>Technology can also be defined as a general term for the processes by which human beings fashion tools and machines to increase their control and understanding of the material environment (Merritt, 2008). Technology is the most important factor that can contribute to growth in agricultural productivity. The use of technology in agriculture involves the application of technological innovations into production, storage and processing of agricultural products to improve the efficiency. These improvements include the use of mechanisation in farming, the use of chemicals to control diseases and pests, the use of fertilizers, new tillage practices, introduction of improved plant and animal species and so on. The major contributions of agricultural technology are an increase in farm productivity resulting in increased income and poverty reduction, food security and others (Department for International Development United Kingdom-DFID, 2004). The availability of these innovations or technology for agricultural production is one step in the process of improved agricultural production, the next and most important step is the adoption of these improved production technologies by the farmers.<br/><br/>The adoption of new technology is described as an innovation decision process through which an individual passes through the time of first knowledge of the innovation to a decision stage of either adoption or rejection and confirm the decision (Ekong, 2003). It is the stage in which an individual (in this case the farmer) decides to use a new technology. The adoption of any technology is dependent on the profitability of the technology, the risk and uncertainty associated with it, the initial capital requirement, socio-economic characteristics of the farmers and cultural/traditional belief systems. The increase in productivity associated with improved technologies can only be reaped if the farmers adopt the technology.<br/><br/>Peri-urban areas are those areas around urban areas; they are the fringes of urban cities and are intermediary between urban areas and rural areas bearing some characteristics of both. A Peri-urban area as described by Thünen (1966) is based on the following components when compared with urban areas; <br/><br/>Peri-urban is, in some fashion, connected to being urban<br/><br/>Demographic components; this is based on the population size of the area. The peri-urban area has a population density markedly less than urban areas but not as small as rural areas.<br/><br/>Geographic component; peri-urban areas are in close proximity to urban areas.<br/><br/>Temporal component; this describes peri-urban areas as relatively temporary due mainly to the growth of urban areas and advancements in transportation systems.<br/><br/>Another description of peri-urban is given by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 1979): The impacts of economic growth and physical expansion of the urban area are not confined within urban boundaries; they reach into much wider areas surrounding urban centres, creating so-called \"rurban areas\", \"urban fringe areas\", or \"peri-urban areas\". While the peri-urban area retains the characteristics of the rural area, these are subject to major modifications: changes take place with respect to physical configuration, economic activities, social relationships and so forth.<br/><br/>Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a perennial woody shrub which grows to a height of about 1-3m and is cultivated mainly for its roots (and to a lesser extent its leaves. Cassava roots are utilized for human consumption, as a constituent of animal feed, in the production of industrial starch and as a source of bio-fuel. Cassava excels under suboptimal conditions such as low soil fertility and drought, offering the possibility of using marginal land to increase total agricultural production (Cock, 1982). Cassava has a high rate of converting available sunlight to carbohydrates and according to Burrell (2003) contributing to the importance of cassava in most tropical countries. It grows and is cultivated in the tropical and subtropical areas of the world as a food and cash crop. Africa produced about 54% of the cassava in the world with Nigerian cassava production being the largest in the world with approximately 34 million tonnes in 2001; a third more than production in Brazil and almost double the production of Indonesia and Thailand (FAO, 2004). <br/><br/>1.2Statement of the Problem <br/><br/>Nigeria is the largest producer of cassava in the world with 34 million tonnes of cassava produced in 2001 and an average yield of 10.6 tonnes per hectare in 1999 (FAO, 2004). In spite of this, Nigeria’s potential for cassava production has not been reached. Former president Gen Olusegun Obasanjo’s cassava production initiative envisaged that US$5 billion a year would be attained from cassava production in 2007, it was determined that 150 million tonnes of cassava would be needed by the end of 2006 to achieve the Presidential Cassava Initiative (PCI Subcommittee, 2002) and as at 2006 about 45 million tonnes of cassava was produced (United States Agency for International Development-USAID, 2008). This clearly shows that there is a large gap between current production levels and this target.<br/><br/>Cassava production in peri urban areas can contribute to the achievement of this target through an increase in current levels of production in these areas. However for an increase in production to occur there has to be an increase in adoption of improved production technologies (Doss, 2006). Knowledge of the current level of adoption of improved cassava production technologies in peri urban areas will aid in the formulation of appropriate policies to increase productivity and aid in achieving the cassava production potentials of Nigeria.<br/><br/>This is where this study comes in; it is aimed at discovering farmer’s adoption of improved cassava production technology and the constraints to technology adoption peri-urban areas. It also would answer the following questions:<br/><br/>what are the socio-economic characteristics of cassava farmers in peri-urban areas?<br/><br/>are the cassava farmers in peri-urban areas aware of improved technologies?<br/><br/>what are the sources of information about new technologies available to cassava farmers in peri-urban areas?<br/><br/>what is the level of adoption of improved technologies by cassava farmers in peri-urban areas?<br/><br/>what are the factors affecting the adoption of new technologies by cassava farmers in peri-urban areas?<br/><br/>what are the problems encountered by cassava farmers in adopting new technologies in peri urban areas?<br/><br/>1.3 Objectives of the Study<br/><br/>The general objective is to determine farmer’s adoption of improved cassava production technologies in peri-urban areas of Ikpoba Okha and Ovia North East local government areas of Edo state.<br/><br/>The specific objectives of the study were to;<br/><br/>Determine the socio-economic characteristics of peri-urban cassava farmers in the study area<br/><br/>Assess cassava farmer’s awareness of improved production technologies in the study area<br/><br/>Ascertain the level of adoption of improved production technologies by cassava farmers in the study area<br/><br/>Identify the factors affecting technology adoption in of improved production technologies in the study area. <br/><br/>Identify the sources of information on new technologies in the study area<br/><br/>Determine the problems encountered by farmers in adopting new technologies in the study area<br/><br/>1.4 Hypothesis of the Study<br/><br/>There is no significant relationship between the socio-economic characteristics of cassava farmers in peri-urban areas and their adoption level of improved production technology.<br/><br/>There is no significant relationship between cassava farmers’ sources of information on improved production technology and their adoption of these technologies.<br/><br/>1.5Justification<br/><br/>Increasing cassava production through the adoption of improved production technologies in peri urban areas will not just help to attain a potential or reach a target, it will improve the lives of people who live in the peri urban areas through increased food production, higher incomes as well as those in the surrounding urban areas by increasing the availability of cassava products for consumption and as an industrial raw material, reduction in the price of cassava products; this will be due to reduced transport costs due to proximity as compared with those cassava products that are transported from the rural areas. All these sum up to a reduction in poverty and increasing levels of food security.<br/><br/>This study will provide insight into the production processes of cassava farmers in peri-urban areas, showing their level of adoption of improved technologies from land clearing and tillage to harvesting, storage and processing of cassava with the aim of determining their level of adoption, factors and problems affecting their adoption of improved cassava production technologies.<br/><br/>Knowledge of this would help Local, State and Federal extension authorities, Agricultural development projects (ADPs), Federal and State ministry’s of Agriculture, communities and cooperatives develop policies that would aid in resolving identified problems affecting cassava farmer’s adoption, provide conducive conditions that encourage increased adoption levels of improved cassava technologies in peri-urban areas and in the long run increase cassava production in Nigeria.</p>\n\nFARMERS ADOPTION OF IMPROVED TECHNOLOGY IN CASSAVA PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING IN PERI-URBAN AREAS OF EDO STATE: A CASE STUDY OF IKPOBA OKHA AND OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " FARMERS ADOPTION OF IMPROVED TECHNOLOGY IN CASSAVA PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING IN PERI-URBAN AREAS OF EDO STATE: A CASE STUDY OF IKPOBA OKHA AND OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS", "id": 5}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ANALYSIS OF FOOD SAFETY AMONG DRIED FISH SELLERS IN AKURE, ONDO STATE</strong><br/><br/></p> <p>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/><br/>Page<br/><br/>Title page--------ii<br/><br/>Certification--------iii<br/><br/>Dedication--------iv<br/><br/>Acknowledgement-------v<br/><br/>Table of contents-------vi<br/><br/>List of Tables-------viii<br/><br/>Abstract --------ix<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>Introduction------1<br/><br/>Unsafe food marketing and its economic implication in<br/><br/>Nigeria------1<br/><br/>1.2Statement of Problem-----3<br/><br/>1.3Objectives of the Study----4<br/><br/>1.4Justification of the study----5<br/><br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/><br/>2.0Literature Review-----6<br/><br/>2.1Concept of food marketing in agriculture--6<br/><br/>2.2Fish Production in Nigeria----6<br/><br/>2.3Chemical composition of fish----8<br/><br/>2.3.1Importance of fish consumption---9<br/><br/>2.4Fish handling and preservation during marketing-10<br/><br/>2.4.1Acceptable safety practices during fish marketing-12<br/><br/>2.5Brining, pickling and dry-salting ---17<br/><br/>2.6Preservation and processing of fish---24<br/><br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/><br/>3.0Methodology------34<br/><br/>3.1Scope of Study-----34<br/><br/>3.2Sampling technique-----35<br/><br/>3.3Data collection-----35<br/><br/>3.4Data Analysis------35<br/><br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/><br/>4.0Results and discussion----37<br/><br/>4.1.0Socio economic characteristics of respondents-37<br/><br/>4.1.1Gender of respondents----37<br/><br/>4.1.2 Age of respondents-----38<br/><br/>4.1.3Marital status of respondents----39<br/><br/>4.1.4Educational status of respondents---40<br/><br/>4.1.5Experience of respondents----41<br/><br/>4.1.6Size of sampled market----42<br/><br/>4.1.7Gross margin analysis of the markets surveyed-43<br/><br/>4.1.8Safety practices of dried fish sellers---46<br/><br/>4.1.9Analysis of cost of food safety per day among the <br/><br/>dried fish sellers -----47<br/><br/>4.2.0Identified problems facing dried fish sellers--48<br/><br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/><br/>5.0Summary, Conclusion and Recommendation---50<br/><br/>5.1Summary-------50<br/><br/>5.2Conclusion-------51<br/><br/>5.3Recommendation------51<br/><br/><br/><br/>References -------52<br/><br/>Appendix<br/><br/>LIST OF TABLES<br/><br/>Table 1: Gender of dried fish sellers-----38<br/><br/>Table 2: Age of dried fish sellers-----39<br/><br/>Table 3: Marital status of dried fish marketers---40<br/><br/>Table 4: Educational level of dried fish marketers---41<br/><br/>Table 5: Experience in dried fish marketing----42<br/><br/>Table 6: Size of sampled market-----43<br/><br/>Table 7: Gross margin analysis of the markets surveyed--45<br/><br/>Table 8: Safety practices of dried fish sellers----46<br/><br/>Table 9: Analysis of cost of food safety per day---47<br/><br/>Table 10: Constraints facing dried fish sellers---49<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>The study dealt with analysis of food safety among dried fish sellers in Akure North and South Local Government Areas of Ondo State. The study was conducted to identify the safety practices of dried fish sellers, estimate the cost of food safety and the problem of dried fish marketing in the study area. Data were collected through the use of questionnaire supplemented with oral interview and personal observations in the market. Five markets were randomly selected in each local government area and twelve dried fish marketers were sampled from each market giving a total sample size of a hundred and twenty respondents for the study. Descriptive and budgetary tools were used to analyze data collected. Sales point was not sterilized but a minimal consciousness of consumer safety was observed among sellers. <br/><br/>Occasionally, product was sundried while heat from charcoal was applied in some cases. Identified food safety problems were poor drying creating mould and presence of flies crowding around the dried fish in every sales points where products were not sealed. It was established in the study that two naira fifty kobo were derivable from each naira invested in dried fish marketing. Dried fish price per unit was increased by 9.68%. This indicates that consumers must be willing to pay higher in order to access wholesome products. It was observed that none of the marketers had safety canter nor sealed up the packaging materials. <br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION <br/><br/>1.1Unsafe Food Marketing and its Economic Implication in Nigeria <br/><br/>Agriculture and the food industry have remained strategic sectors of the economy of many nations. Agriculture plays a vital role in human development, growth and survival of nations. The issues of food production in terms of availability, accessibility, wholesomeness and nutrient quality has been the concern of many developing nations. “Food” is any substance or material eaten to provide nutritional support for the body and usually consists of plant or animal origin that contains essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins or minerals. Foods are product derived from plants or animals that can be taken into the body to yield energy and nutrients for the maintenance of life and the growth and repair of tissues (Whitney and Rolfes, 2005). <br/><br/>Food is a commodity which contain nutrients and is thus nutritive, susceptible of satisfying appetite, thus palatable and accepted as food in the society being considered thus customary. Safety is defined as setting standards for toxicological and microbiological hazards, and instituting procedures and practices to ensure that the standards are achieved (FAO/WHO, 1991). <br/><br/>Food safety therefore describes the handling, preparation and storage of food in ways that prevent food borne illness and it is also the assurance that food will not cause harm to the consumer when it is prepared and/or eaten according to its intended use. This include a number of routines that should be followed to avoid potentially severe health hazards (FAO/WHO, 1992). <br/><br/>Food is a necessity and accounts for significant expenditure in households all over the world. It features prominently in both national and international commerce. Food affect our biological life as well as our material interest. The task of keeping our food supply steady and safe is therefore, an important issue concerning all. Food safety is a complex and diversified subject, involving the cooperation of scientists, industrialists, agriculturalists, businessmen, administrators and consumers (FAO/WHO, 1980). <br/><br/>At the heart of all food control activities is the establishment of safety, quality and labeling standards. These should be established on the broadest possible scale, in the recognition that food production and marketing is truly a global industry. A food is said to have quality if it provides sensory characteristics such as the taste, aroma, palatability and appearance.<br/><br/>Food quality is the multi-component measure of the extent to which the units of a food product which a seller is willing and able to offer at a price, consistently meet the requirements and expectations of consumers willing and able to buy the food product at that price. Quality of a given product may be looked at as its conformity to a given level of excellence which represent particular standards or specifications with minimum cost to the producer and is believed to be satisfactory with the consumer in general. <br/><br/>Contamination of food and feeds makes them both to be unsafe for consumption and is a very serious issue everywhere. In many developing countries where the need to eat may outweigh concerns about food safety, it is a particularly serious problem with increase globalization. <br/><br/>The problem with food is that although man harvests or hunts food for his own personal consumption, there are many other living organisms that try to use this food for their own use. This includes organism that range from large animals through small forms of life such as insects, down to microscopic forms of life such as bacteria. Food contamination creates an enormous social and economic burden on communities and their health systems. <br/><br/>1.2Statement of Problem<br/><br/>Dried fish easily absorbs moisture during handling and storage especially when the relative humidity is high. This occurs when the dried fish absorbs moisture from its immediate environment, thereby resulting in increase water activity which causes mould growth and spoilage. <br/><br/>There is the incidence of insect and rodent attacks on dried fish during handling which causes further contamination by micro organism. This necessitates the application of insecticides to preserve dried fish during marketing. Application of insecticide or pesticide has safety implications on the side of consumers because of possible food poisoning arising from residual action of insecticides. <br/><br/>The economic impact of contaminated foods is devastating. Developing countries with limited resources lose foreign exchange as a result of rejected food exports to developed countries (FAO/WHO 1992). The economy of a nation can suffer greatly from loss of confidence from trading partners. Furthermore, victims of food borne illnesses suffer from physical and emotional distress and the cost of treatment and loss of wages are a burden to the nation. <br/><br/>Effective food safety control system in developing countries can make a major contribution by reducing food losses through insect attack and contamination. The study will address the following research questions:<br/><br/>What are the factors militating against food safety among dried fish sellers in the study area?<br/><br/>What is the cost implication of food safety among dried fish marketers?<br/><br/>What are the possible ways of improving safety practices of dried fish?<br/><br/>What are the causes of dried fish poisoning in the study area?<br/><br/>Is dried fish marketing profitable?<br/><br/>1.3Objectives of the Study <br/><br/>The main objective is to carry out analysis of food safety among dried fish sellers in Akure, Ondo State. The specific objectives are to:<br/><br/>examine the socioeconomic characteristics of dried fish sellers. <br/><br/>identify the safety practices of dried fish sellers.<br/><br/>estimate the cost of food safety among dried fish marketers. <br/><br/>identify the problems of dried fish marketing among the sellers.<br/><br/>1.4Justification of the Study <br/><br/>Agriculture and food security provide the springboard for health via adequacy as in quantity available with emphasis on quality depicted by nutrition and food safety.<br/><br/>Unsafe food causes many acute and life-long diseases, ranging from diarrhoeal diseases to various forms of cancer. WHO estimates that food borne and water borne diarrhoeal diseases taken together kill about 2.2 million people annually, 1.9 million of them children most of whom are in developing countries. <br/><br/>In order to enhance food safety, the amount of resources used and the efficiency of production are contingent upon use of appropriate technologies, infrastructure, storage, processing, marketing and transportation.<br/><br/>At the end of this research, it is believed that the result of this research will not only provide useful information for participating and intending sellers and consumers of dried fish but will also provide information for future researchers, extension agents and policy makers in finding long lasting solutions to the various problems of food safety among the dried fish sellers. </p>\n\nANALYSIS OF FOOD SAFETY AMONG DRIED FISH SELLERS IN AKURE, ONDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANALYSIS OF FOOD SAFETY AMONG DRIED FISH SELLERS IN AKURE, ONDO STATE", "id": 6}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Despite the existence of relevant information to increase Agricultural Productivity, many farmers are yet to receive such information due to the limited number of extension workers, particularly in developing nations like Nigeria. Hence, this study was carried out to assess extension workers and practice of extension principles in Edo and Delta States.<br/><br/>A multistage sampling techniques was adopted in randomly selecting 80 and 120 respondents from Four Local Government Areas each with high concentration of extension workers in Edo and Delta States respectively. Data was analyzed using frequency count, percentage and mean, while hypotheses were tested using Pearson Correlation Coefficient, T-test and Chi-square test.<br/><br/>Result showed that majority (46.3%) and 42.5%) were over 49-50 years and above, (52.5%) and (87.5%) were males, (83.8%) and (51.7%) were married, with (62.5%) and (35.0%) were literate, (57.5%) and (56.7%) have 10-15 years working experience. Extension workers get information on their job through farm visit (x=3.81) and (x=3.69), home visit (x=3.71) and (x=2.86) in Edo and Delta States. Some of the constraints the respondents faced (x=2.50) were financial problems, farmers culture, lack of motivation, transportation problem, leadership problem in mostly Edo and fairly in Delta States. But the total pooled analyzed result showed that respondents source of information and in the discharge of their job, respondent were not too faced with problems. <br/><br/><br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>1.0INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>Information and Communication have always mattered in Agricultural. Communication may be defined as giving or exchanging information, option and idea by writing, speech or visual means (Ganguly, 2006). Even since people have grown crops, raised livestock, and caught fish, they have sought information from, one another. What is the most effective planting strategy on steep scope? Where can I acquire a land title? Who is paying the highest price at the market? How can I participate in the government credit program? Producers rarely find it easy to obtain answers to such questions (Ganguly 2006). Up dated information allow the farmer to cope with and even benefit from these changes of weather patterns and soil conditions and epidemics of pest and diseases, but providing such information can be challenging because of the highly localize nature of agriculture.<br/><br/>Agriculture is the most vital sector for information and communication technology intervention most especially that majority of the population around the world rely on agriculture to live sustainably (Alexander 2009). Information and communication technology for development, agriculture provides our most basic human needs that are food clothing and shelter. Even since people have this natural way of thing on how thing can survive and make a living by harvesting crops used for food and fibres make a living by harvesting crops used for food and poultry that produce animal product like wool, dairy and eggs, catfish or any edible marine life for food or for sale, forestry and logging to grow and harvest timber to build shelter with agriculture, people learned and acquire knowledge through sharing information with each but of course this is not enough as there are also changes and developments in agriculture. Farmers should be able to take hold of updated information like price, production techniques, services, storage, processing and the like. Evidently, update information with the change and developments in agriculture can be addressed by the effective use of information communication and technology. (Edward Elgar 2004).<br/><br/>There is increasing evidence that infrastructure such as telecommunications helps to reduce poverty and provide opportunities to people in developing countries (Bertolini, 2005).making information readily ad cheaply available can enhance production, increase bargaining power and incomes, and ultimately lead to poverty reduction and economic development. Furthermore, making information readily and cheaply available can enhance production by enabling farmers to plant and harvest at appropriate times (weather information), improve the functioning of credit markets (by facilitating social capital as through increased communications farmers develop and gain trust and reputations), facilitate access to more efficient technologies (through finances obtained through increased credit ratings/worthiness), and in the long run, transform production processes through more rapid and diffuse spread of technological innovations amongst a broader range of interacting agents – consumers (with different tastes and preferences leading to product differentiation or new product development), sellers (of inputs products and services) , traders and processors (Eggleston et al., 2002).<br/><br/>Poor families in the rural areas have limited or no access at all to information and communication technology. However, these people also needs access to information communication and technology, since this technology would help lessen their expenses on their resources like time, labor, energy and physical resources, thus, would have a greater position impact on their livelihoods and income, the lives of the rural poor could be alleviated through the application of information and communication technology by supplying information to inform the policies, institutions, and processes that affect their livelihood options. In the advent of ICT, it offers new opportunities to support development of the rural livelihoods. It strengthened the production and increased market coordination which is the main processes that can contribute to the future opportunities of the sector and create income for the people that depend on it. (Songan, 2004).<br/><br/>Farmers who have better access to information and communication have access to price information, access to agriculture information, access to agriculture information, access to national and international market, increasing production efficiency, creating conducive policy environment through an informed extension agent or worker who have a broader experience. Agriculture is facing new and severe challenges in its right with rising food prices that have push over 40 million into poverty since 2010 (World Bank 2011). The growing global population, expected to hit a billion by 2050, has heighted the demand for food and place pressure on already fragile resources, feeding the population will require a 70% increases in Food production (F.AO. 2009). Most importantly, the democratization of information and science facilitated by ICT is also contributing to agriculture and rural development more broadly, using conventional information and communication tools. Majority of extension workers have attained adulthood, a stage that is very critical, at which human beings should be controlled, applying basic skills and knowledge.<br/><br/>Agricultural extension is a professional field of information system aimed at educating people in their own context and life situation and acquires knowledge and skills on how to effectively deal with such problems so as to improve their living condition. (Ashimolowo 2002). Adopted agricultural extension system is the training and visit (T and V) agricultural extension system. It was developed for the World Bank by (Benor 2002) and aid at improving the rural farmer’s productivities through efficient agricultural extension service delivery in the developing countries. The system was introduced into the Nigeria Agricultural system in the mid-70s when it was tried in three encloses of Gasau, Funtua and Gombe, the recorded success from the trial led to state wide implementation of the extension system, Agricultural this is not enough as there are also changes and developments in agricultural development programme (ADP), to reach out to all the rural farmers across the country, each state is structure into zones, blocks and cells. The extension personnel are as grouped as zonal manager, block extension supervisor/argent and the subject matter specialists. The extension agents are expected to cover between 8 and 10 cells where they relate directly with the farmers, reaching out to them with extension services at interval of two research institution base for the extension workers is the research institution where innovation and technical information to serve the farmers are generated, in Nigeria there are eighteen research institutes with each of them having specific research mandate (Lawal Adebowale 2002).<br/><br/>One of the basic functions of agricultural extension remains the dissemination of useful agricultural information from research to the end-users. The mass media have been greatly used in delivering this information. But the information boom of this century requires that worthwhile strategies of communication be developed and utilized. In order to meet up with the information explosion trend, agricultural extension needs to intensify efforts to acquire the necessary information and communication technology facilities that are available. The categories of persons who should have access to information technologies for proper direction are the extension managers and supervisors. They know enough to influence decisions in their organizations. Waldron et al., (1997) stated that an extension programme manager is the person that vested with formal authority over an organization or one of its sub units. He or she has status that leads t various inter-personal relations and from this comes access to information. Information enables the manager to devise strategies, make decisions and implement action. VITA (1995) pointed out that modern communication techniques and facilities, which ensure uninterrupted access to large amount of agricultural information, have become necessary in hiding the distinction between urban and rural dwellers. These modern communication techniques are generally referred to as Information technology (IT) facilities. Moll (1982) cited in Madu and Adeniran (2000) classified IT into two groups viz high and low. The low technology includes equipment and machines like typewriters, offset printing machines, microform readers, projectors, stapler, paper cutter, perforators, catalogue, radio, telephone, television sets.<br/><br/>The high information technology, on the other hand, consists of the various means of obtaining or transferring information using computer, telecommunications and microelectronics. Nzeakor (1991) declared that information technology could help rural communities to leapfrog from peasant farming to modern agriculture. <br/><br/>Agricultural extension has a major role to play in the area of information and communication technology. This is because, as an educational outlet that is dynamic in its dissemination delivery system, a more cosmopolitan outlook is needed. This explains why the modern technology gadgets are inevitable. Considering the fact that we are in the information technology age, extension needs to be in tune with the application of information technology to access and utilize the international network system. Ekemode (2000) observed that agriculture has moved through the various phases of development as society transforms into modernity. He therefore noted that the Information technology era, involves the application of satellite technology for obtaining agricultural information through the internet. <br/><br/>Agricultural extension workers are trained personnel who are responsible for transfer of information and technology to both rural and urban farmers’, they play other roles like helping farmer, develop practical application of research knowledge to farmer’s farm and families. But in the course of doing all these operations, agricultural extension principles must be appropriately applied. Agricultural extension principle are laws and rules discoursed by extension workers or researcher and proven by years of experience that now serve as guide law for extension workers as stated by (Ashimilowo 2002), the principle focuses on the workers with a view to empowering themselves to be able to solve and meet the needs of respondent. <br/><br/>The principles are:<br/><br/>The extension work must be based on the needs and interest of the people.<br/><br/>Extension work should be based on the knowledge, skills, belief and value of the people.<br/><br/>Extension encourages people to take action and work out their own solution to their problem, rather than receiving ready-made solution.<br/><br/>An extension programme should be flexible so that necessary changes can be made whenever needed, to meet the varying conditions and need of the people. <br/><br/>Extension work should base on full utilization of local leadership.<br/><br/>Extension should be a co-operative action involving participating activity in which people co-operate to pursue a common cause.<br/><br/>Extension should be base on constraint evaluation, the effectiveness of the work is measure in terms of the changes brought in knowledge, skills and attitude and the adoption of change behavior of the people. <br/><br/>In conclusion, communication bridge the gap between extension agent and agriculture, thereby making it easier for assessing agricultural technology, and also a gap between extension agent/workers and basic information needed. <br/><br/>Problem Statement <br/><br/>Throughout the developing world, it is a known fact, that farmers already have a lot of knowledge about their environment and their farming system (Ahmed 1974). Extension can bring them other knowledge and information which they do not have example. Cause of damage to particular crops, general principles of pest control, or the way manure and compost are broken down to provide plant nutrient (Ahmed 1974). The application of such knowledge often means that the farmer has to acquire new skills of various kind, the transfer of this knowledge and skill to farmer and their families is an important extension activities and the extension agents must prepare himself thoroughly (Foster 1962). He must find out which skill or areas of knowledge are lacking among the farmers in his areas.<br/><br/>This study sought to examine extension workers personnel characteristics, channel frequently use in sourcing and disseminating agricultural extension principles, and possible strategies for practicing extension principles.<br/><br/>It also cut across the level of application of extension principles and examines the level of motivation on the use of extension principles by respondent. In addition accessing the major constraint in the use of agricultural extension principles. <br/><br/>This research tends to provide answers to the below:<br/><br/>The questions now are: <br/><br/>What are the personnel characteristics of extension workers in Edo and Delta State? <br/><br/>What are the channels, respondent frequently use sourcing and disseminating agricultural extension principles on their job?<br/><br/>What are the respondent perceives important and improvement strategies for practice of agricultural extension principles?<br/><br/>What are the motivational factors for the uses of agricultural extension principles by the respondent?<br/><br/>To what extent do extension workers apply extension principles in their daily operation?<br/><br/>What are the constraints in the use of agricultural extension principles by respondent?<br/><br/>1.2 Objectives of the Study<br/><br/>The broad objective of this study is to assess extension workers’ sources and practice of agricultural extension principles in Edo and Delta States, Nigeria. <br/><br/>The Specific Objectives were to:<br/><br/>examine the personnel characteristics of extension workers in Edo and Delta State;<br/><br/>identify channel, respondents frequently use in sourcing and application of agricultural extension principles on their job;<br/><br/>ascertain respondent perceived important and improvement strategies for practices of agricultural extension principles;<br/><br/>access the extent to which extension workers apply extension principles in their daily operations in the study area;<br/><br/>identify motivational factors for respondents use of agricultural extension principle; and<br/><br/>identify constraint in the use of agricultural extension principles by respondent.<br/><br/>1.3 Hypothesis of the Study<br/><br/>There is no significant relationship between extension workers personal characteristics and channel frequently used in sourcing and disseminating agricultural extension principles.<br/><br/>There is no significant relationship between extension workers personal characteristics and perceived improvement strategies for practice of agricultural extension principles.<br/><br/>There is no significant relationship between personal characteristics of extension workers and the extent to which extension workers apply extension principles in their daily operation.<br/><br/>There is no significant relationship between the extent to which extension workers apply extension principles and channel respondent frequently use in sourcing and disseminating agricultural extension principles. <br/><br/>There is a significant relationship between constraints in the use of agricultural extension principles and the channel respondent frequently use in sourcing and disseminating agricultural extension principles.<br/><br/>There is no significant relationship between constraint in the use of extension principles and the characteristics of extension workers (personal)<br/><br/>There is no significant relationship between motivational factors for use of agricultural extension principles and the constraints in the use of agricultural extension principles.<br/><br/>There is no significant relationship between improvement strategies for practice of extension principles and motivational factors for use of agricultural extension principles. <br/><br/>1.4 Justification of the Study <br/><br/>Over the years various studies have shown that there is an existing gap between available knowledge of improved technology and the actual practice (Odefadehan 205). The extension workers are responsible for the dissemination of information about these improved technology to farmers in order to bridge the gap, therefore, their role is very essential, about the improved technology before they disseminate those information to the farmers, in order to find ways to bridge this existing gap in improved technology and the actual practice, this study sought to investigate the information needs of the extension workers, identify the present and intended sources of information, determine the social economic characteristic of the respondent, determine the effectiveness of these information sources presently used and the constraints encountered by the respondent in the practice of extension principles.<br/><br/>This study is of present day relevance to encourage extension workers and identify little lapses in the sources of improved technology and practice of extension principles, because useful information bring-forth increases productivity in agriculture. Essentially, this study will hopefully add to the available literature, useful for academic research, and this would be very relevant to researchers in related topics. </p>\n\nASSESSMENT OF EXTENSION WORKERS AND PRACTICE OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PRINCIPLES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ASSESSMENT OF EXTENSION WORKERS AND PRACTICE OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PRINCIPLES", "id": 7}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT’<br/><br/>This research was designed to access the Profitability and Technical Efficiency Analysis of Rice Production in Esan Central and North East Local Government Areas of Edo State with a specific objective of examine the socio-economic characteristics of the farmers, determine the profitability of rice in the stud area.<br/><br/>The study used information gathered from One hundred and eighty (180) copies of a structured questionnaires were administered to rice farmers in the study area. Data so collected were analyzed using descriptive statistical instruments like means. The result gave a gross margin of n46, 445.03 per ha. Return on investment (ROI) of 1.03.<br/><br/>This implies that rice production is a profitability and viable enterprise. It is therefore recommended that inputs such as fertilizers, herbicide, pesticides (used to control birds and rodents) be subsidized to rice farmers to help boost indigenous rice production. Some factors of production that were identified are: tractors, cutlasses, hoes, planting materials, cost of land preparation etc. While the major problems were inadequate finance, birds and rodents attack, insufficient rainfall, inadequate storage facility etc.<br/><br/><br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION <br/><br/>Rice is a staple food for more than 60 percent of the world’s population (Richardson and Stubbs, 1978). Rice has become a staple food crop of considerable strategic importance in many rapidly growing African countries where consumption among the urban poor household has increased substantially (WARDA, 1993).<br/><br/>Cultivated rice is designated as either oryza sativa or oryza glabberima, oryza sativa is the predominant species. “Oryza glabbenma is grown only in Africa” on a limited scale.<br/><br/>The rapid rise in rice production in the years, following world was 11, mainly in Asia, stemmed from expanded irrigation areas, the increased use of fertilizers, effective control of pests, double rice cropping, and the widespread adoption of improved genetic materials. The combined use of nitrogen fertilizers and use of high-yielding varieties has made possible the expression of high yield in irrigated areas. Varieties of short growth duration which are insensitive to the photoperiod have allowed year round planting and multiple cropping.<br/><br/>The adoption of semi-dwaft high yield varieties triggered the beginning in 1967: Chinese farmers also turned to the utilization of the semi-dwaft varieties. The development of hybrid rice in China since the 1970s has set off a second “Green Revolution” in that area.<br/><br/>New genetic information and genetic diversity provide the foundation for more efficient breeding programs for rice production. It remained for the simply inherited recessive gene (Sdi) in the Chinese semi-dwaft rice to provide rice breeders with the impetus to achieve further progress in rice breeding.<br/><br/><br/><br/>1.1RICE GRAIN QUALITY INDICATORS <br/><br/>The most important factors that plant breeders consider in developing new rice varieties are grain quality and yield. The term “grain quality” has many meanings and is perceived differently defending on end use, field of interest, specialization and ethnic importance as a quality characteristic, rice millers emphasize processing quality: and consumers demand a widely divergent array of cooking and eating qualities.<br/><br/>Quality in rice may be categorized into four broad areas: <br/><br/>Milling quality <br/><br/>Cooking and processing quality <br/><br/>Nutritive quality <br/><br/>Specific standards for cleanliness, soundness and purity.<br/><br/>All four (4) categories are important in judging the suitability of rice for a specific use. The quality characteristics desired vary considerably, being ultimately related to final consumer acceptance of each rice product.<br/><br/>Characteristics that influence rice quality include those under genetic control and those independent of genetic control, such as purity and cleanliness. These latter characteristics are primarily a function of handling and storage and as such are described thoroughly in United States standards for rice and in the rice inspection handbook.<br/><br/>A major factor influencing rice quality is the environment in which the plants are grown. Once a new variety is released for commercial production, it spreads to wherever it can be produced advantageously compared to currently grown varieties. Consequently, before released, new varieties are tested agronomical and for quality over their likely production area.<br/><br/>Tests are carried out in rice performance nurseries in each rice producing state. These trials permit evaluating quality characteristics of new varieties over wide ranges of environmental influence such as soil, climate and cultural practices.<br/><br/>Characteristics Influencing Qualities in Rice Include:<br/><br/>Hull and pericarp colour <br/><br/>Grain-shape, weight, uniformity, and general appearance <br/><br/>Milling cut turn.<br/><br/>Kernel, chalkiness, translucency and colour and cooking, eating and processing characteristics.<br/><br/>1.2ORIGIN OF RICE<br/><br/>Rice has been cultivated for such countless ages that it’s base their evidence must always be a matter for conjecture. Botanists base their evidence of the origin of rice largely on the habitats the wild species. It is presumed that the cultivated species have developed from certain of the wild rice.<br/><br/>The genus oryza comprises twenty five species distributed through tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, Central and South American and Australia. Both diploid (2n=24) and tetraploid species occur, he diploids being more numerous. <br/><br/>There are only two cultivated species, oryza glabberima and oryza sativa linn. Oryza glabbermma is conformed to West Africa where it is an upland crop but is being replaced by oryza sativa. Morphological there are only small differences between these species, mainly in ugule size and glume pubescence, but oryza glabberima always has a red pericarp and hybrids between oryza glaberrima and oryza sativa are sterile. Oryza glaberrima is not confirmed to West Africa.<br/><br/>According to Chaudraratna (1964), the center of origin of oryza sativa linn in Southeast Asia, particularly India and Indo-China, where richest diversity of cultivated forms has been recorded. It spread northwards in Asia before the later movement, it also spread south and East through the Maby Archipelago with the flow of human culture.<br/><br/>1.3INTRODUCTION OF RICE INTO AFRICAOryza stapfil Rosecher, and oryza glaberrima steud are presumed to have been cultivated on the margins of the Neolithic Sahara. The historian Ibu Batouta (AD 1350) mentions the existence of rice in Nigeria, which certainly is oryza glaberrima. Oryza glaberrima was introduced into Northern Nigeria in the 16th Century.<br/><br/>The cultivation of oryza sativa linn in Nigeria was about 1890 when upland varieties were introduced to the high forest zone in Western Nigeria. Shallow swamp varieties from Guyana and srilanka were established in the smaller tributaries of several rivers where they rapidly replaced the swamp varieties of red rice (oryza glaberrima), their most extensively grown. Oryza glaberrima is now mostly confirmed to the fat North of Nigeria and to Sierra Leone.<br/><br/>Red rice (oryza glabberrima) which probably originated in the middle Niger Delta some 3,500 years ago is gradually being replaced in Africa by oryza sativa. The date and mode of introduction of oryza sativa to West Africa is unknown. It has been suggested that it was introduced by Portuguese traders who visited the coastal regions, but is equally possible that it came across African by the caravan desert routes; it may have been already in cultivation in West Africa when the first Portuguese arrived (Jordan, 1965).<br/><br/>The significance of rice is shown in it’s widespread use as a staple food by more than\\half of the world’s population. Millions of people in Asia subsist almost entirely on rice. Most countries rely mostly entirely on domestic production to feed their populations with only about 4% of the world’s rice production reaching the international market. More than 90%of World rice is produced in Asia (FAO, 1989).<br/><br/>Rice is widely consumed in Nigeria today and there is hardly any where in the world here it is not utilized in one form or other. In Nigeria, rice is the one of the few food items whose consumption has no cultural, religions, ethnic or geographical boundary (Udoh, 2003). But fortunately, the cultivation and production of this highly consumed priced and very important food crop is not encouraging, this may be due to the fact that production of rice in the country is carried out by small scale farmers, who can barely meet the demand for it. The problem, of low level of production amounting small farmers, who can barely meet the demand for it. The problem of low level of production amounting small scale farmers can be attributed to the poor use of locative and economic efficiencies.<br/><br/>There is need therefore, to look into the various ways to increase production, cost efficiency, to meet the overwhelming demand for rice in the country since an increase in agricultural production of rice is invariable linked to farm profits. <br/><br/>1.4STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/><br/>In Nigeria, rice has become a major staple food crop in most homes today and unfortunately the domestic production of the product has not been met with the demand for it. Which has expressed itself in the food shortages experienced in the country recently? (CBN, 2003).<br/><br/>Esan Central and North East Local Government Area of Edo State is one of the areas where rice is grown in Edo State, Nigeria. The area is blessed with natural requirements (in terms of soil, rainfall and other factors) for rice production which when properly tapped can lead to an increase in rice production and source of employment to the unemployed.<br/><br/>The problem of socio-economic changes such as population explosion, industrialization and urbanization call for a sufficient and wholesome food supply and where possible in convenient forms. Infact this is a challenge to Nigeria farmers, researchers and members of the public.<br/><br/>Rice farmers in Esan Central and North East are mainly peasant farmers who depend entirely on traditional farming techniques for the production and their standard of living not present as through the enterprise is viable.<br/><br/>This study will provide answer to the following questions:<br/><br/>What are the socio-economic characteristics of respondent in the study area?<br/><br/>Are the farmers able to efficiently hand their input costs?<br/><br/>What are the factors that determine the cost efficiency of production of the farmers in the study area?<br/><br/>What is the farmers cost efficiency level in the study area?<br/><br/>What are the socio-economic factors affecting the cost efficiency of farmers in the study area <br/><br/>1.5OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>The broad objective of the study is to estimate the portability and cost efficiency of rice production in Esan Central and North East Local Government Areas of Edo State. The specific objectives are to:<br/><br/>Examine the socio-economic characteristics of respondent in the study area.<br/><br/>Determine the profitability of rice in the study area<br/><br/>Estimate the cost efficiency of rice farmers in the study area. <br/><br/>Ascertain if there is any socio-economic factor that affects the technical inefficiency of farmers.<br/><br/>Determine any other constraints the farmers are experiencing.<br/><br/>1.6JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>Food and agricultural organization (FAO, 1996) record has it that the world population is increasing an alarming rate, and it is expected to increase in the next decade by 88 million per annum with this record so far it’s estimated that more than 60 millions of this population will be absorbed in cities and towns, globally there will be an increase in demand for major food crops and rice. This overwhelming increase in demand for major food crops and rice. This overwhelming increase in demand will definitely lead to an overwhelming increase in price of rice.<br/><br/>There is need therefore the need to look into the cost efficiency and profitability of rice production by farmer in the study area.<br/><br/>The empirical evidence from this study will add to the already wide stock of knowledge about rice production and also help policy marker in policy formulation concerning rice production and also potential investors on how to go about investing in rice productions. </p>\n\nPROFITABILITY AND TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS OF RICE PRODUCTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PROFITABILITY AND TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS OF RICE PRODUCTION", "id": 8}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>A nations’ capacity for industrialization and employment depends on her improvement in level of production enhanced by available information. This is necessary for promoting entrepreneurship in agricultural transformation agenda for food security and poverty alleviation in Nigeria. This study assessed the value chain information sources in pig production in Edo and Delta states, Nigeria. The specific objectives were to: determine the socio-economic characteristics of the pig farmers; ascertain respondent’s access, availability and preference about information sources about value chain; identify respondent’s sources and available farm inputs, determine the farmer’s level of knowledge, awareness and adoption of the value chain addition practices. <br/><br/>A Multi-stage sampling procedure was used to solicit response from 120 and 160 respondents from Delta state and Edo states respectively with the aid of a well structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using frequency counts, percentages and mean while the hypothesis was tested using chi-square analysis. Result showed that majority (75.0%) and (75.6%) of the pig farmers in Delta and Edo states respectively were males, with majority (80.8%) and (73.1%) of the respondents in Delta and Edo states respectively been married. The result further showed that pig farmers preferred extension agent and fellow farmers as part of their available sources of value chain information sources which lead to the increase in the level of awareness about value chain addition practices. But the adoption of these practices was low when compared with their awareness; this was due to the constraints in sourcing the value chain addition technologies’. Respondents were mostly knowledgeable in value chain addition principle of improved market quality of product (M=3.22), and they participated most in the production (M=2.73) stage. There was a significant relationship between the respondents’ level of knowledge about the value chain and their educational attainments, stock size, pig farming experience, farmers’ membership of association and contact with extension agents.<br/><br/>It was further recommended that extension agents should focus on dissemination of value chain technologies/practices on areas of slaughtering, processing, storage and marketing which are not receiving adequate participation and utilization by pig farmers in view of job creation opportunities and enhanced industrialization.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>1.1BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/><br/>Value chain seems to be the keyword in recent agricultural debate often in conjunction with rural economic development and agric-business production (Entwicklung and Raum, 5/2005). According to Hoeffler, (2008) Value chain (V.C) can be described as a sequence of productive process from the provision of specific inputs for a particular product to primary production, transportation, processing, marketing and trading to the final consumer. It can also be seen as a sequence of activities that goods passes through, with value being added in each stage and actors are connected along these chains of producing, transforming, processing and bringing these goods and services to the end consumers (Fries et al, 2004). In agricultural production, value chain (V.C) is a very important concept or tool if productivity is to be maximized (Webber and Labaste, 2010) and these apply for both crop and livestock production in agriculture it also treats enterprises not as a singular entity, but as part of an integrated chain of economic functions and linkages across geographical boundaries. The concept of value chain through it analysis (value chain analysis V.C.A) also emphasizes on diverse interrelationship among market opportunities, constraints and directives at various level of the supply chain and at different levels of influence from which specific value addition takes place. <br/><br/>Contemporary events around the world have shown increasing concerns for the 75 percent or more people inhabiting the rural areas, this is justified by the high correlation that exists between rural living and poverty with this situation particularly aggravated in developing countries (World Bank, 1994). Nigeria as an example, is a country which agriculture is usually in the hands of many rural dwellers, and these concepts of value chain is lagging behind, this was credited in the works of (Ehinomen and Oladipo, 2012), which the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) in a survey carried out as part of its membership operational audit in January 2010, it recorded that of the 2780 registered members, a total of 839 (30.2%) manufacturing firms closed their factories in 2009, this was due to their inability to cope with the challenges posted by the harsh operating environment in Nigeria.<br/><br/>According to Eurostat, (2012) it was stated in value terms, that the EU-27’s crop output grew by 9.1 percent in 2011 to EUR 203,330 million and animal output increased by 9.9  percent to EUR 154,057 million  and recently there has been a remarkable interest in livestock production. The intake of protein in Nigeria stands at 3.5g per caput per day (Ironkwe and Amefule, 2008) and this is far less than the 35g per caput per day recommended by the World Health Organization (W.H.O), this shortage of animal protein consumption is partly due to the high cost of conventional meat sources like cattle, goat, sheep (Tewe, 1999), it is therefore necessary to search for a cheaper alternative source of meat to meet the ever increasing demand for animal protein.<br/><br/>Pig (Sus scrofa), for instance is an animal which most livestock farmers are interested in producing in many part of the Nigeria Livestock industry, pigs have been recommended as a good alternative source of cheap, high quality animal protein that suits escalating human population like Nigeria, this makes the pig industry in Nigeria a very important arm of the livestock sub-sector in the overall agricultural sector in the economy. The interest in porcine production is based on the fact that pigs have relatively low cost of production and their growth rate is fast (Osaro, 1995), they also have short generation interval, high production potential, high prolificacy and high carcass yield, they adapt easily to environmental condition (ILCA, 1992), they are good converter of food waste to valuable products, their annual growth rate (3.8%) is higher than that of the human population (2.30-2.80%) (Ironkwe and Amefule, 2008), they also require relatively small space requirement (Babatunde and Fetuga 1990). They also elaborated that pigs are also being used for many purpose which include meat production, Cooking fat and in the production of bristle e.t.c. Pig production in Nigeria can be classified into 3 major categories based on the system of production these categories include extensive, semi-intensive and intensive system of production (Ikani and Dafwang). In the extensive system of pig production, the pigs are reared in the backyard of the farmers were they are allowed to fend for themselves, feeding on garbage and kitchen wastes. While in the semi-intensive system the farmers are interested in making economic gains and then more input are applied to add value to the products. Under this system the pigs are kept in pens and are fed both on kitchen wastes and concentrates, drugs and other things necessary for the development of the pigs are also taken into consideration. The intensive system which is not very common in Nigeria requires strict monitoring of every parameters in the production process, it is highly capital intensive, the farmers also relies fully on artificial feed (concentrate)given in their right proportion, vaccines, drugs, and every other things needed without depending on nature for any of these. This system is also called the CLOSED system of production (Devandra and Fuller, 1989).<br/><br/>In Nigeria today, the most common of this system production is the semi-intensive system, because of the medium capital outlay needed to start the venture (Ajala and Osuhor,2004,). It has been observed that some farmers producing pigs at the semi-intensive level, dispose (sell) their pigs when they are young (as piglet) to serve as new stocks in other farms, replace their stock or to start-up a new farm, most farmers also sell live pigs and only few sell slaughtered pig (pork meat) (ILRI 10,2011). But for profit to be maximized in pig production in Nigeria today there is still the urgent need for more value addition in pig production (Webber and Labaste, 2010). These value can be added to the final product in the production sequence as follow:- young piglets been sold or reared to maturity, slaughtered, sorted, then processed into various product (like bacon, sausages e.t.c were necessary), packaged, preserved to be sold later for future use (Bettina et al, 2006).The value of the final products that passes through this sequence will always be more than the initial value of the product (pig) itself, these will of course produce greater gain in the enterprise and greater employment of labour (Kula et al 2006).We can see from here that this will have an overall effect in the Nigeria economy, those who do not like the pig need to be educated on the advantages of pig production for local and international market in order to enhance its contribution to the Nigeria economy (Seye, 2012).<br/><br/>Information and communication are essential ingredients needed for effective transfer of technologies that are designed to boost agricultural production. For farmers to benefit from such technologies they must first have access to them and learn how to effectively utilize them in their farming systems and practices (Ariyo et al, 2013).This should be the function of agricultural extension agencies all over the world. These extension agencies make use of different approaches, means and media in transferring improved agricultural technologies to the end users (farmers). Mass media methods in agricultural information dissemination generally, are useful in reaching a wide audience at a very fast rate. They are useful sources of agricultural information to farmers and as well constitute methods of notifying farmers of new developments and emergencies. They could equally be important in stimulating farmers’ interest in new ideas and practices (Ani et. al. 1997). Common sources of agricultural information sources that have been used are the extension services, radio, television, magazines, newspapers and face-to-face communication. According to Statrasts, (2004) this information sources is seen as an institution or individuals that create or bring about message and the characteristics of a good information source are relevance, timelessness, accuracy, cost effectiveness reliability, usability exhaustiveness and aggregation level. Lately research institutions have embraced the modern sources of information such as Internet especially online database, journals and articles that have made information more readily accessible, accurate and timely. These modern sources have been used within research institutions and extension service units but their effectiveness in availing information to farmers have been criticized. It is thought that the modern sources of information have social, education, economic, cultural and technical constraints which limit their effectiveness in disseminating agricultural information to farmers (Bashir, 2008). It is important to disseminate agricultural information to ensure farmers have adequate knowledge and skills to address their needs and sustain production. Research institutions have a responsibility of ensuring that the information they disseminate is packaged in a way that makes it easy for the end-users to understand and to use appropriate dissemination channels that would make the information accessible to the end-users (Ghobrial and Musa, 2006). <br/><br/>Hence, the information supply from extension, research, education and others sources has become managed by agricultural organizations, and especially disseminated to farmers so that they can make better decisions to take advantage of market opportunities and to manage continuous changes in their production systems (Demiryurek,2010). This value chain addition sequence in pig production is either lagging behind in pig production in Nigeria or it is not put into practice maximally (UNIDO, CBN, 2010), this could be as a result of lack of proper orientation of these information sources on value chain addition in pig production.<br/><br/>1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT<br/><br/>There is growing realization that farmers can increase their income substantially, if they process and add value to their produce and information technology sources has become critical in improving the operational efficiency of the business activities to gain competitive advantage and many companies have used these information technologies (IT) as a means to achieve this objective (Lin and Shao 2006).Agriculture, which is production oriented is a field that is always in need of right information and at the right time (Dileepkumar, 2013), this means that both crop and livestock farmers should always be linked to the right information needed in the production process by adequate information sources. Agricultural information can also be seen as an important factor which interacts with the other production factors such as land, labour, capital and managerial ability, the productivity of these other factors can arguably be improved by the relevant, reliable and useful information and knowledge (Demiryurek, 2010).<br/><br/>Proper information needs is the life wire in every business venture in the world, which has been identified as an important and crucial variable in the developmental process (Banmeke and Ajayi, 2006). The right to information for success when not supplied can lead to the failure of any venture and these can be ascertain according to the findings of (Maningas et al, 2000), that information within the hands of the farmers means empowerment through control over their resources and decision-making processes. There is also the need to increase the level of communication between all stakeholders who have a role to play in enhancing agricultural production. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can help farmers improve decision-making, help agricultural planners with their work and support extension officers to help farmers better. However, current sources of information are limited, inaccurate and untimely (Horne and Stür, 2005).<br/><br/>The performance of Nigerian agriculture so far indicates that the farmers have neither used nor absorbed most of the technologies being introduced to them (Akande, 1999). This appears to be the case considering the findings of Yayock and Misari (1990) which showed that there existed a wide gap between farmers’ improved technology yields and farmers’ traditional technology yields. The achievement of high agricultural productivity depends on the availability and access to appropriate agricultural information.<br/><br/>The problem to lack of or minimal value chain addition observed in pig production in Nigeria could be linked to information technologies and information sources (information revolution) affecting competiveness (Porter and Miller, 1985). Part of the reason why farmers do not engage in value addition is that, historically the extension services has been focused on improving production and productivity (Gebremedhi et al, 2006) and abandoned the farmers after the harvest. This is why various stakeholders of agriculture need to critically analyze the information sources that are available and accessible to pig farmers and how effective they are in influencing the overall production is the direction of value addition to the final product, also the information needs of the farmers, the structure of the organizations involved in these activities are issues that need to be explored generally (Demiryurek et al, 2008) in pig production specifically. <br/><br/>The problem of value chain addition is a great one and emphasis on it cannot be too much at this time in the economy of this nation. This study here will provide answers to some of the questions that borders on value chain information sources in pig production in Edo and Delta states, Nigeria.<br/><br/>Some of the specific questions this research is poised to answer are:-<br/><br/>What are the socio-economic characteristics of pig farmers in the study area?<br/><br/>What are the information sources about value chain addition that are available and preferred by the farmers’?<br/><br/>How frequent do these farmers’ have access to the information sources?<br/><br/>What are the farm inputs used by the farmers’ and how are they sourced?<br/><br/>Are the farmers aware of value chain technologies, if so, are these technologies been adopted at the different value chain stages from production, processing to the marketing stage of the pigs?<br/><br/>What are the farmers’ perception of value chain and the level of participation of this value chain in the various stages?<br/><br/>What is the level of knowledge about value chain about the pig farmers’?<br/><br/>What constraints farmers’ to the adoption of value chain technologies?<br/><br/>What are farmers’ limiting factors to the access of value chain technologies sources?<br/><br/>What are the constraints farmers’ faces in pig production?<br/><br/>1.3OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>The general objective of this study is the assessment of value chain information sources in pig production in Edo State and Delta states, Nigeria. To achieve this, the following specific objectives were considered: <br/><br/>examine the socio-economic characteristics of the pig farmers in the study area;<br/><br/>ascertain respondent’s available and preferred information sources about value chain;<br/><br/>ascertain respondent’s access to the information source;<br/><br/>identify the farm inputs available to respondents and how they are been sourced;<br/><br/>ascertain respondent level of awareness and adoption of value chain practice;<br/><br/>ascertain the farmer’s level of participation and the level of perception in which V.C. is practiced more<br/><br/>identify respondent’s level of knowledge about value chain (V.C.);<br/><br/>determine the constraints in sourcing value chain technologies.<br/><br/>identify the challenges to the adoption of value chain principles/ technologies.<br/><br/>identify the constraints in pig production.<br/><br/>1.4HYPOTHESIS OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>The hypothesis of the study was stated in the null form and the following hypotheses were tested.<br/><br/>H0: There is no significant relationship between the socio-economic characteristics of the respondents and the respondents’ level of knowledge about the value chain (V.C.).<br/><br/>H0: There is no significant relationship between the constraints to the adoption of the V.C. principles and the V.C. practices that these pig farmers have adopted.<br/><br/>1.5 JUSTIFICATION/SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>This study is necessitated by the urgent need to reduce food wastage in the country in dire need of food for her populace through value chain addition (V.C.A), in agricultural production generally and in livestock production specifically.<br/><br/>The study is directed to review the role of value chain addition in the socio-economic development of pig farmers in Edo state and Delta state respectively. In a developing country like Nigeria were much effort is needed to smuggle or rescue her citizens beyond the poverty border line, the significance of the study research cannot be over emphasized.<br/><br/>It is expected that the findings that would be gotten form the study will be beneficial to the entire socio-economic profile of pig farmers in the study area and it will be helpful to policy makers, extension agencies, extension workers and various governmental and non-governmental organization (N.G.O).<br/><br/>This study is also of present day relevance to encourage the efficient use of available information sources and other forms of information communication technologies (ICTs) to diffuse important knowledge in value chain addition of products, to improve the socio-economic status of the pig farmers in Edo and Delta states. Essentially, this study will hopefully add to the available liter atures useful for academic research and other related research topics.</p>\n\nANALYSIS OF FOOD SAFETY AMONG DRIED FISH SELLERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANALYSIS OF FOOD SAFETY AMONG DRIED FISH SELLERS", "id": 9}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>The study examined the effect of flood disaster on the socio-economic characteristics or cassava farmers in Etsako East Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/><br/>Simple random sampling procedure was used to select 100 respondent from four communities.

They displace and disrupt thousands of families, and having more traumatic effect in the poorest of nations, crippling what are often already woefully inadequate economic development efforts, and destroying infrastructure (Delaney et al, 2004). Natural disasters are happening more often and having an ever more dramatic effect on the world in terms of both their agricultural, human and economic costs. Floods are dangerous to peoples’ lives and their aftermath results to death, destruction, misery and trauma. One of the major repercussions that flood disasters have is on agriculture especially food crops like cassava production. <br/><br/>Unlike other investment activities, cassava is exposed to a large variety of risks and uncertainties from the vagaries of nature such as bad weather conditions, pests and diseases, flood, erosion and fire outbreaks. According to Jafia (1988) examples of such risks and uncertainties that have occurred in Nigeria include, the Cassava Bacteria Blight (CBB) of 1973)/74 cropping season which caused the loss of about 162.500 tons of cassava tubers in the east, and frequent flooding and drought problems. Also the serious drought years of 1982-1984 seasons and even the poor rainfall situations in 1987/88 seasons affected agricultural productivity as well. According to Taylor (1977), he identified crop losses in Nigeria as due to pest and diseases Okoye (1987) showed among others a pre-harvest loss of 10% on cassava partly due to pest and diseases..<br/><br/>Also after experiencing a devastating flood that resulted in displacing several hundred of thousands of people in 1998 the Kumadugu Yobe Ualley (northern Nigeria) was flooded again in 2001, Madiodio et al. (2004). <br/><br/>A substantial part of the population depends on agriculture for its livelihood. These substantial parts of the population are the rural farmers causing a vicious circle of poverty and adding to the risk, damage and stress of disasters. These rural farmers are exposed to natural disasters because they tend to live in marginal areas and depend on high-risk, low return livelihood systems such as rain-fed agriculture and face many sources of vulnerability including little physical infrastructure. <br/><br/>Today, Nigeria is suffering from low agricultural output and this could be due to t he effect of natural disasters on the rural farmers. The rural farmers have suffered seriously during the occurrence of these disasters in the past and present. Not only do these disasters destroy crops and disrupt food supplies, they also affect land quality and production potentials (Stephenson 1994). Farmlands and houses have been washed off by erosion in the northern and southern parts of the country and these rural farmers have more or less been rendered jobless too because of the effects of these natural disasters causing rural-urban migration (Nyong, 2005). Pest and diseases migrate in response to climatic variation and will potentially pose a threat to livestock when they move to areas where there is flood to areas of drier regions. It can also lead to aberration in the animal mating habits. <br/><br/>The purpose of this study is to identify the effect of the 2012 flood disaster on the socio-economic characteristics of cassava farmers in Etsako East Local Government area of Edo State. According to Saldana-Zorrilla (2003) economic vulnerability makes presence through decrease in the income of rural farmers. The study will analyse the level of change of the rural farmers income caused by the flood and how this will affect the rural farmers and cassava production. <br/><br/>Statement of the Problem <br/><br/>Natural disasters, such as the occurrence of flood, cause much misery, especially in developing countries where low-income earners undergo great stress. Losses due to floods reduce the asset base of households, communities and societies through the destruction of standing crops, dwellings, infrastructure, machinery and buildings in addition to tragic loss of life. <br/><br/>Occurrence of flood have led to crop failure, famine, loss of property, mass migration and negative economic growth and this in turn affects the household income of the rural farmers that depend on agriculture as their means of livelihood (Adedipe et al, 1997). The occurrence of flood disasters are becoming destructive to the rural farmers as they drive these rural farmers out of business and possibly increase the migration from rural areas (Chukuezi 2008). Because of this, the need for re-orienting resulting in agricultural decision making and insulation of the rural farmers from adverse impacts of flood disasters has become more pressing. <br/><br/>Thus the catastrophic result of the extreme global flood has greatly deteriorated the lands and production of cassava. This has therefore resulted to low productivity and high cost of purchasing the produce and it calls for a careful study for the rescue of cassava production. All these may not be ruled out in the areas affected by the 2012 flood disasters especially in Etsako Local Government Area. The questions therefore are as follows<br/><br/>What are the levels of effects of these natural disasters on the income of the rural farmers in Etsako East? <br/><br/>To what extent does the flood affect the farmers? <br/><br/>What is the present state of the farmers? <br/><br/>What are the implications of the flood on the farmers? <br/><br/>Objectives of the Study<br/><br/>The broad objective is to study the effect of flood disaster on socio-economic characteristics of cassava farmers in Etsako East Local Government area of Edo State.<br/><br/>Specific objectives<br/><br/>To determine the socio-economic characteristics of cassava farmers<br/><br/>To determine the effect of flood on their income generation <br/><br/>To determine the effect of flood on their environment. <br/><br/>1.4Hypothesis of Study <br/><br/>The following null hypothesis were tested. <br/><br/>1. The income of the farmers is not significantly influenced by the flood. <br/><br/>The Need for the Study<br/><br/>The purpose of this study is to examine how the 2012 flood affected the agricultural livelihood and the implications of flood upon the rural farmers in cassava production. Being that the flood occurred recently not much has been done to examine its effects especially on cassava farmers in the study area. <br/><br/>The results from this study will assist the government in policy making especially in the agricultural sector which will help increase farmers productivity. This has been found to be critically linked to long-term economic growth, food security and environmental renewal. Similarly, it will make case for cassava production and development relief, which can serve to meet the immediate relief needs of the affected community. It also shows how new agricultural and environmental technologies will play a key role in the promotion of long-term development strategies that continue to reduce the vulnerability of poor, rural populations and marginalized groups to the menace of natural disasters. </p>\n\nEFFECT OF 2012 FLOOD DISASTER ON THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF CASSAVA FARMERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF 2012 FLOOD DISASTER ON THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF CASSAVA FARMERS", "id": 10}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>The study focused on poverty alleviation among plantain and banana farmers in Ovia South North East Local Government Area of Edo State. It answered the following questions (i) what is the socio-economic characteristics of plantain and banana,(ii) what is the perception of farmers on the profitability of plantain and banana production in their area, (iii) what is the constraint faced by plantain and banana farmers (iv) what is the value addition of plantain and banana among respondents<br/><br/>The data were collected using well structured questionnaire descriptive statistics was used to estimate the socio-economic characteristic as well as the constraints of the farmers inferential statistics was used for the hypothesis<br/><br/>The result of the analysis indicated that majority of the respondents were male (62.5%), formally educated (70.8%) married (79.2%), with a farm size of 1-3ha (51.7%). Also the farmers had a mean household size of size persons and a mean age of approximately 44years. They also had a mean farming experience of 11years. Majority (81.7%) of the respondents combined both plantain and banana farming. Also, it was discovered that majority of the respondents (82.5%) needed training in processing high quality plantain flour. Under the poverty structured, plantain and banana farmers had high proportion of people classed as non poor (79.6%) with a mean income of (37,948.31) majority of the respondents (mean = 2.99) agreed that a combination of plantain and banana farms alleviated poverty as they were able to enroll their children. Also, transportation was a major constraint faced by plantain and banana farmers with a mean of 4.66. it was also shown from the analysis that there is a significant association between the farming type practiced by the farmers and their poverty status. Income of the respondents who engaged in plantain/banana production (839,68.60) in plantain only (131,250). Finally, sex, education and family experience had significant relationship with constraints faced by the respondents. In conclusion, a combination of plantain/banana farms was found to be more profitable and hence alleviated poverty more, compared to individual planting of these crops.<br/><br/><br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>1.0INTRFRFTRODUCTION <br/><br/>One of the most challenging problems comforting the Nigeria nation today is how to significantly address the problem of a widespread and rising incidence of poverty among the populace. Available statistics shows that as much as 70.8% of the populace lived on less than us &amp; I a day and are thus classified as extremely poor. This is an increase from 15% in 1970, 46.3% in 1985 and 65.6% in 1996 (Fos, 1996). Apart from death due to starvation and other health hazards that these poor people are rarely faced with, poverty induced hunger and malnutrition are known to impair mental (intelligent quotient) development in children and could lead to a large loss in quality of life, productivity and economic growth in developing countries(Von,2005). Empirical evidence on the level of poverty in Nigeria is that the poor are predominantly the rural households that depend primarily on agricultural income. (Philip et al., 2009).<br/><br/>Poverty is a multi dimensional phenomenon that affect many aspect of human conditions ranging from the physical, moral to the psychological (Agbi, 2013). It is defined as the state of being poor or deficient in money or means of subsistence. The concept of basic subsistence is a measured by the availability of infrastructural services such as safe water, sanitation, solid water collection, health care, schools and security. (Agbi, 2013)<br/><br/>Poverty can also be defined based on the concept of access to opportunities and resources, concern for human rights and environmental challenges. Other factors include exposure to violence, injustice, powerlessness and uncertainty in the face of unexpected situations like sickness, accidents and natural disasters. Poverty in Nigeria is characterized by hunger, homelessness, disease, malnutrition, high child mortality rate, family disintegration, unemployment, human trafficking, child labour, kidnapping, killing, sexual assault, drug abuse, prostitution and high mortality rate (Agbi, 2013).<br/><br/>Poverty alleviation involves the improving of the lives of poor people (Shringal, 2000). Poverty alleviation is the result of overall economic growth and result from an increase in human and physical capita (Krugman et al., 2009). According to Bharati (2005), the process usually followed in poverty alleviation programs is as follows<br/><br/>Find the main activity of the target group<br/><br/>Turn the activity in an economic activity capable of generating income<br/><br/>Involve as many members of the target group a possible in the economic activity.<br/><br/>Educate the target group on personal finance to enable them use the generated income to improve their lives<br/><br/>This process is expected to diffuse through the community.<br/><br/>In a bid to overcome poverty of Nigeria, government has initiated different policies and structural programmes between 1997 till date. These programmes includes: Directorial of food, Road and Rural Infrastructure (DFFRI), Better Life Programme (BLP), National Directorate of Employment (NDE), People’s Bank of Nigeria (PBN), Community Bank (CB), Family Support Program (FSP), Family Economic Advanced Programme (FEAP), Poverty Eradication Programme (PEP), National Poverty Eradication Program (NAPEP) and National Economic Empowerment Development Strategy (NEEDS). Their aims are to ameliorate the suffering of the people by providing them employment opportunities and access to credit facilities to enable them establish their own business. (Adebisi, 2011).<br/><br/>Plantain and banana are staple food for rural and urban consumers as they provide an important source of rural income, particularly for small holders who produce them in compound or home gardens (Nweke et al., 1988).<br/><br/>Banana is the world’s second (2nd) most important fruit crop after oil palm. It is grown in 130 countries worldwide. World production stands at 71 million metric tonnes while plantain is grown in 52 countries with world production of 33million metric tonnes (FAO, 2004). However, no African country is ranking among the top 10 countries for banana production in the world wide eight (8) African countries are among the top world producers of plantain with Nigeria ranking as the fifth highest producers of the crop (FAO, 2004). Presently, plantains are of less importance than banana in terms of world trade in the genus but in West and central Africa about 70 million people are estimated to derive more than one quarter of their food energy requirement from plantain (Robbison, 1996).<br/><br/>Acceptable to Nigerians, plantain and banana is a versatile food in the kitchen as well as raw materials for many popular delicacies and snacks. This reason plus the growing population of Nigeria leads to an enormous increase in demand for the crop in the consumers market. Among plantain products are plantain flower, chips, beer and ethanol. The ripe ones are sliced and fried in oil as “dodo”. Over ripe ones are both compacted and fried in oil as “dodo ikire” or mixed with plantain flour to make “ekuru”, a delicious local dish. In some parts of Nigeria, selling of roasted plantain “boli” and fried whole fruits “ogene” are both thriving business that provide job opportunities for thousand young girls and women. Ogazi (1996)<br/><br/>The unripe ones can be fried in vegetable oil to obtain plantain chips known as “pekere” in Nigeria. Plantain chips are the most popular plantain products in Nigeria. These are sold on the streets or by small and medium scale companies which deliver them to super markets. The peels of plantain are used as animal feed for livestock, manure and mulching materials. The peels constitute valuable fodder for goats and sheep. Ogazi(1996)<br/><br/>Banana can be eaten when ripe, it is used to make banana juice. Some people eat the fruits with groundnut, rice or to drink garri. Apart from being useful as staple food for human being, it can be used in preparation of various products as juice, jam, soft drink etc. it contains carbohydrate, calcium, iron, fat, phosphourus, vitamin A, B1, B2, and C (Ngeze and Gathumbi, 2004, Anochilli and Tindall, 1986). All these attributes of the product offer it a high demand in the market. It can thus be seen that there is a large market for the products of plantain and banana farmers. <br/><br/>Agriculture is considered the core to the anti poverty effort (World Bank, 2005), so it is only natural to expect that engagement in a productive business like plantain and banana farming will yield income and thus further the goal of poverty alleviation for the farmers.<br/><br/>1.1STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/><br/>Nigeria is one of the most resource endowed nations in the world. But socio-economically, Nigerians are also among the poorest in the world (Etim et al., 2009). The poverty situation in Nigeria is quite disturbing considering the vast human and physical resources that the country is endowed with (Okunmadema et al., 2005). Many initiatives and projects have been under taken in order to reduce poverty; the reduction of poverty is difficult challenge facing most developing countries where the average majority of the population is considered poor. According to Ogwumike (1998), evidence in Nigeria shows that the number of those in poverty has continued to increase from 29% in 1980, to 46% in 1985, it declined slightly to 42% in 1992, and increased very sharply to 67% in 1996. By 1996, estimates had it that more than 70% of Nigerians live in poverty.<br/><br/>NBS (2007) revealed that about 69 million people were living in poverty in 2004 which represent 54.4% of the Nigerian population. Sectorial disaggregation show urban poverty rate of 43.1% and rural poverty rate 63.8% in the same year (Adeyonu et al., 2002). Incidentally, the rural sector is the predominant sector in Nigeria economy. Evidences abound that among the rural poor people, the farming households are poor. For instance Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) (1999), Olaniyan and Bankole (2005) reveals that in 1980, 1985, 1992, 1996 and 2004, the incidence of poverty were 32.1, 43.1, 38.7, 72.3 and 64.4 percent respectively for Nigerian farming households and 16.3, 37.2, 36.0 58.0 and 59.2 percent for their non farming counterparts respectively. This shows that poor families are more in farming households than non farming households in Nigeria.<br/><br/>While a plethora of poverty reduction programmes have been put by various governments in Nigeria, poverty enabated calling to question the effectiveness of these efforts (Philip et al., 2009) hence the need to identify and examine alternative strategies or solutions of these group out of poverty.<br/><br/>Plantain and banana have been crops of extra ordinary significance to the rural poor household and the human societies. Cultivations of both crops is mainly a medium gestation agricultural investments as against long gestation agricultural investment such as cash crops and livestock production (Philip et al., 2009). In the absence of functioning capital, credits coupled with failure of government to put in place safety nets for the rural poor household, it is difficult, if not possible for a resource poor farm household to invest in long gestation farm projects. It is against this background that plantain and banana production will be focused on as a means of boosting rural household income. A number of questions then arise:<br/><br/>What is the socio economic characteristics of plantain and banana farmers in Ovia South West and Ovia North East Local Government Area<br/><br/>What is the perception of farmers on the profitability of plantain and banana production in the area.<br/><br/>What is the value addition of plantain and banana among respondents<br/><br/>What is the poverty level of plantain and banana farmers in the area. <br/><br/>What is the contribution of plantain and banana farming enterprise to poverty alleviation among the farmers <br/><br/>What are the constraints faced by plantain and banana farmers in the area<br/><br/>1.2OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/><br/>examine the socio economic characteristics of plantain and banana farmers in Ovia South West and Ovia North East Local Government Area<br/><br/>assess the perception of farmers on the profitability of plantain and banana production in the area.<br/><br/>identify the value addition of plantain and banana among respondents<br/><br/>examine the poverty level of plantain and banana farmers in the area. <br/><br/>assess the contribution of plantain and banana farming enterprise to poverty alleviation among the farmers <br/><br/>identify the constraints faced by plantain and banana farmers in the area<br/><br/>1.3HYPOTHESIS <br/><br/>H1 there is no significant association between the farming type and farmers poverty status <br/><br/>H2 There is no significant difference in income from the different plantain/banana enterprise.</p>\n\nPOVERTY ALLEVIATION ON PLANTAIN AND BANANA FARMERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " POVERTY ALLEVIATION ON PLANTAIN AND BANANA FARMERS", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>The study examined economics of post harvest food losses involving three (3) varieties of leafy vegetables namely: Telfaria(Ugu leaf), Amaranthus(Green leaf ) and Pterocarpus(Oha leaf) in Idemili South Local Government Area of Anambra State. A random sampling technique was used to collect data on vegetable marketers’ socio-economic characteristics, types of post harvest losses, physical and monetary losses and the marketing margin accrued from the losses. Data were analysed with the aid of descriptive statistics (mean, percentage etc) and simple margin analysis. The result showed that women predominated in vegetable trading and most of the respondents have been in business for 6-10 years. The major causes of post harvest losses include physiological factors, mechanical damage and pest and diseases. Telfaria suffered greater incidence of post harvest loses (5.37%) while the losses in Amaranthus and Pterocarpus were 4.84% and 5.14% respectively. Based on the losses in the marketing margin, there was greater reduction in marketing margin of Telfaria (38%) than Amaranthus (35%) and Pterocarpus (11%) at the retailing level. Provision of improved mode of transportation, lower levies, and proper market sanitation is thereby recommended to minimize these losses. <br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/><br/>Introduction<br/><br/>1.1 Background to Study<br/><br/>Estimate of production losses in developing countries are usually very hard to come by. Post harvest losses in vegetable in African countries have been estimated to about 50% of the total production (FAO, 2008). This implies that half of the total production are lost during storage handling and transportation of there produce. Therefore, minimizing these losses to a barest minimum between harvest and consumption, of already produced food is more sustainable than increasing production (Kader and Rolle, 2004).<br/><br/>Post harvest losses are measurable quantitative and qualitative losses of a given produce at any moment along post harvest chain (Delucia and Assemato, 1994). Vegetables are highly perishable except under intensive care during harvesting, handling and transportation. These losses have been estimated to be much more painful and costlier than pre-harvest losses both in terms of money and man-hours. (Dasgupta and Mandal, 1989). Farmers are forced to sell their products at give away prices due to absence of adequate storage and marketing facilities. In some cases, the expected income goes to the dustbin.<br/><br/>Post harvest losses are caused by mechanical injuries, inadequate storage, unsuitable handling, faulty system of transport and delayed transportation in retail market (CEAGESP, 2002). <br/><br/>Green vegetables refer to all leafy vegetables predominantly green in colour which can be eaten boiled or in soups. They have achieved tremendous popularity over the last century among local traders. Besides being tasty, they (green vegetables) promote healthy nutritional balance as they are good sources of vitamin A and C, are low in calories and fats, high in protein per calorie, dietary,<br/><br/>fibre, iron and calcium. They have a very short shell life of about 1-2 days. They have high economic value and high consequence of post harvest losses.<br/><br/>1.2 Problem Statement<br/><br/>A very little is known about the production and consumption pattern of African leafy vegetables. The Joint FAO/WHO consultation on Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases (2003) recommended a minimum daily intake of 400g of fruits and vegetables for proper body functioning. However, Oguntona (1998) reported a mean intake of 65g per day in Western Nigeria. This is against the 150,000 tonnes of leafy vegetable production as recorded in 1992. Emphasis should therefore be laid, not only on increased production of vegetables, but also on ways to minimize these post harvest losses so as to bridge the gap existing in the recommended requirement.<br/><br/>In order to ensure good quality vegetable with high economic and marketable potentials, certain questions must be addressed:<br/><br/>What are the factors responsible for post harvest losses in green vegetables?<br/><br/>What are the economic implications of these losses?<br/><br/>Which varieties are more susceptible?<br/><br/>What are the ways of reducing these losses?<br/><br/>1.3 Objective of the Study<br/><br/>The general objective of the study is to estimate the physical losses and corresponding financial value of post harvest losses in green vegetables in Idemili South Local Government Area of Anambra State.<br/><br/>The specific objectives of the study are to;<br/><br/>examine the socio-economic characteristics of green vegetable marketers in the study area.<br/><br/>estimate the physical losses of green vegetable during marketing.<br/><br/>determine the financial value of these losses.<br/><br/>identify the causes of the losses during marketing.<br/><br/>1.4 Justification<br/><br/>The study is of paramount importance as it seeks to ensure reduction in post harvest losses in vegetable which will in turn make sufficient food, both in quantity and quality, available for human consumption.<br/><br/>Marketers will also benefit as handling costs is minimized and profit margin increased during agricultural marketing. This study can also serve as a base ground for further research works. Lastly, government and policy makers can as well use the result of this analysis in efficient policy formulation to enhance food sufficiency, sustainability and self reliance. </p>\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF POST HARVEST LOSSES AMONG LEAFY VEGETABLE MARKETERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF POST HARVEST LOSSES AMONG LEAFY VEGETABLE MARKETERS", "id": 12}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>This study examined the profitability and efficiency of catfish production in Kuje Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, Nigeria.

Studies have showed that there is a limit to world’s natural stocks of fish and shell fish, though renewable, have finite production limits, which cannot be exceeded even under the best management regimes. Hence, the maximum sustainable fishing limit in natural waters has been exceeded (FAO, 2000). Therefore, fish production will depend on aquaculture to bridge the demand-supply gap of fish.</div> <div>According to (FAO 2006) production in capture fisheries is stagnating and aquaculture output is expanding faster than any other animal-based food sector worldwide, particularly in developing countries. It contributes nearly a third of the world’s supply of fish products and</div> <div>China and other Asian countries are by far the largest producers. Unlike terrestrial farming, where the bulk of the production is based on a limited number of species, aquaculture produces more than 220 species; of these species, catfish, carps, tilapia and related fish form the largest group in terms of quantity while other groups include aquatic plants and mollusc (FAO 2006).</div> <p>Out of 35 grams of animal protein per day per person recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), less than 7 grams is consumed on the average. Many Nigerians suffer from protein deficiency due to low animal protein uptake (Emmanuel and Omotoriogun, 2010). According to Ojo (2008), a small amount of fish is an important dietary supplement for people who cannot easily afford other sources of animal protein. </p>\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF CATFISH PRODUCTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF CATFISH PRODUCTION", "id": 13}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>The study examined the impact of the adoption of early maize technology on productivity and food security status of farmers in Gwagwalada and Kuje area council of FCT Abuja.

The result showed that DMR-ESR Y CIF2, AC 90 POOL 16DT STR, TZE-W DT STR C4, ACR 95 TZE COMP4 C3, TZE-WDT STR QPM C0 and ACR 90POOL 16 DT STR were the early maize varieties planted in the study area. DMR-ESR Y CIF2 was identified as the variety adopted by a larger proportion (21%). The major drivers of adoption in the study area were found to be farming experience, education, marital status, membership of cooperative societies, household income and extension contact. 11% of the farming household that adopted early maize varieties fall within the highest annual income range of above N599,000 with 18% for non adopters. 10% of the adopters are within the lowest income range of less than N100,000. The mean annual income of adopters was N412,720 and that of non-adopters wasN276,844 which implies that adopters of early maize varieties realized higher income than the non-adopters of the varieties. 79% of adopters with an average daily per capita household calorie consumption of 3606.30kcal were food secure while 44% of non-adopters were food secured. Adequate policy measures should be put in place to fast track seed multiplication and distribution and on-farm trials through effective extension service delivery so as to intensify and sustain the adoption of early maize varieties.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1              </strong><strong>Background to the study</strong></div> <div>Agriculture in Nigeria is increasingly recognized to be central to sustained growth and improved economic development. Agriculture plays a significant role in food security, poverty alleviation and human development (Amaza and Maurice, 2005). Food security became a catch-phrase in the mid 1990s (Okezie and Okorie, 2009). The concept of food security has evolved, developed, multiplied and diversified since the World Food Conference in the 70s (Maxwell and Smith, 1992; Maxwell, 1996). Its main focus has shifted from global and national to household and individual food security and from food availability to food accessibility. It can be defined as the success of the local livelihood to guarantee access to sufficient food at the household level (Devereaux and Maxwell, 2001).</div> <div>The failure of early solutions to food insecurity in the 1970s and 1980s was largely attributed to their technological bias, stressing production rather than equitable distribution, access, affordability and utilization of improved varieties of crops. Since then, it has become clear that food security revolves around complex issues that encompass a wide range of interrelated environmental, economic, social and political factors. An approach encompassing improve varieties of seed is required in addressing food security and lack of which pose serious challenge to many regions in their ability to address food security adequately (Vogel and Smith, 2002: Clover, 2003). Individuals have sufficient access to food when they have adequate incomes or other resources to purchase or barter to obtain levels of appropriate foods needed to maintain consumption of an adequate diet/nutrition level (United States Agency for International Development.</div>\n\nANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF EARLY MAIZE TECHNOLOGY ON PRODUCTIVITY AND FOOD SECURITY STATUS OF THE FARMERS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF EARLY MAIZE TECHNOLOGY ON PRODUCTIVITY AND FOOD SECURITY STATUS OF THE FARMERS", "id": 14}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<div><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></div> <div>Estimation of rainfall for a desired return period is one of the pre-requisites for any design purpose at a particular site, which can be achieved by probabilistic approach. This study is aimed at using the statistical parameters of long-term observed rainfall data to generate monthly rainfall depth and estimate rainfall values at different return periods for hydrological and agricultural planning purposes. The daily rainfall data of 60 years from 1953 to 2012 were collected from the meteorological station situated at the Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR), Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria. In this work, the expected number of observations was 720.However, a sample size of 431 being the months with rainfall amounts was used for the study. Three probability distributions functions viz: normal, log normal and exponential distribution were used for rainfall generation. The data was processed to estimate the statistical parameters of the distributions for Probability Density Functions (PDFs) selected. The two types of parameters estimated using the methods of maximum likelihood via the statistical package called EasyFitXL5.6 are the scale and location parameters. The parameters‟ estimates were further used in various PDFs equations to generate new sets of rainfall amounts. Five statistical goodness of fit test were used in order to select the best fit probability distribution and are; Anderson-Darling, Chi-square and Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ANOVA and Student t test. From the analysis of the data, it was discovered that the normal PDF predicts correctly the monthly amount of rainfall and specific return periods rainfall values followed by the log-normal and exponential PDF, the least predictor. After carefully observing and testing the three PDFs, it was discovered that the normal PDF estimated closely the monthly amounts of rainfall compared with the log-normal and exponential PDFs when considered generally for monthly and return periods rainfall values estimation. Nevertheless, the normal PDFs have been found to predict well the daily rainfall amounts in Samaru. This work should be made available to local and immediate environments to Samaru through local and regional experts on climatic information dissemination for use in planning and management of specific rainfed crop(s) production.</div> <p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p> <div><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></div> <div><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></div> <div><strong>1.1.</strong>                                                                <strong>Background of the Study</strong></div> <div>Synthetically generated daily or monthly rainfall data are frequently necessary in data scarce environments as input into the planning and design of water resources and soil conservation projects; simulation studies of crop growth and yield; farming systems and field farm operations scheduling ( Jamaludin and Jemain 2007). Rainfall is the principal phenomenon driving many hydrological extremes such as floods, droughts, landslides, debris and mud-flows; its analysis and modelling are typical problems in applied hydrometeorology. Rainfall exhibits a strong variability in time and space. Hence, its stochastic modeling is not an easy task (De Michele and Bernardara, 2005).</div> <div>A good understanding of the pattern and distribution of rainfall is important for water resource management of an area. Knowledge of rainfall characteristics, its temporal and spatial distribution play a major role in the design and operation of agricultural systems, telecommunications, runoff control, erosion control, as well as water quality systems.

The African oil palm is native to tropical Africa, from Sierra Leone in the West through the Democratic Republic of Congo in the East, it was domesticated in its native range, probably in Nigeria, and moved throughout tropical Africa by humans who practiced shifting agriculture at least 5,000 years ago (Hartley, 1988).  European explorers discovered the palm in the late 1400’s, and distributed it throughout the world during the slave trade period (Corner, 1966).  In the early 1800’s, the slave trade ended but British began trading with West Africans in Ivory, lumber and palm oil. The oil palm was introduced to the Americans hundred years ago, where it became naturalized and associated with slave plantations, but did not become an industry of its own until the 1960s (Lereka, 1998).  The first plantations were established on Sumatra in 1911, and in 1917 in Malaysia (Raymond, 1961).  <br/>Oil plantations were established in tropical America and West Africa about this time, and in 2003, palm oil production equaled that of soybean, which had been the number one oil crop for many years. <em>Elaeis guineeasis</em> is characterized by its vertical trunk and feathery nature of its leaves every year 20 – 25 new leaves called “frond” develop in continuous whorle at the apex of the trunk (Devendra, 1984).  The fruit bunches develop between the trunk and the base on the new fronds and the plant can reach 60 – 80ft in height in nature, but is rarely more than 20 or 30ft in cultivation.  Although new plantation starts to bear fruit at 3 years, generally, the first commercial crop require between five and six years and continuous to produce for 25 – 30 years, or until the palm grow too high to be harvested.  Once a plantation reaches full production, a new inflorescence is produced every 15 days.  It weights between 15 and 20kg and can conking up to 1500 individual palm fruit of between 8 and 10 grams each (Chavaliar, 1937).  The individual fruits consist of the following four parts, a pericarp, a thin outer skin which upon ripening changes from brown to red or orange, a mesocarp, a large of fibrous material which surrounds the nut, an endocarp or hard inner shell (nut) to protect the seed or kernel and the seed (kernel) (Aighologa, 1995).  The female inflorescence contains 200 – 300 fruits, and fruit set is 50 – 70% fruit riped about 5 – 6 months after pollination (Ergo, 1977). Vegetable and edible oil producer of Nigeria (VEOPAN) claims that, it provided job opportunities for not less than 1.8 million farmer family involved in this production of oil seeds and related crops.  Nigeria with a National 1.3 million tones of palm oil and a population.  Of over 140 million that means each family produces less than 700kg per year, i.e. an average of less than 2kg/day (Eshalomi, 2008). Last year, the vegetable oil sub-sector of Manufacturers Association of Nigeria reported that the market has been very unstable because of high cost of input, excessive smuggling of vegetable oil and faking.  Recently, the group lamented the shortage of palm oil plantation production which is the major raw material for vegetable oil production because it condemned the Federal Government of Nigeria for signing a contract to supply palm oil to Ghana, whose local demand has not been met (Eshlomi, 2008). In Edo State, effort has been made to encourage the establishment of oil palm plantation.  These has yielded some positive result such as establishment of multinational oil palm plantation companies, whose production has follow Presco Industry Limited 22,000 tonnes/year and an indigenous oil palm farm Nosakeri Farm (Vanguard, 2007). <br/>1.2            STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>The production of oil palm seedling is currently the only source of planting materials for oil palm production in Edo State senatorial district.  The entire seedling produced in the world is of the tenera type obtained from fertilizing dura tree with pollen form pisifera tree (Griseb, 2007). The oil palm seedling production is handled directly by organizations such as the Ministry of Agriculture and NIFOR (Wikipedia, 2008). However, it is observe that a number of business oriented persons are not investing in oil palm seedlings production.  What would be responsible for this? The equation therefore is whether investment in oil palm seedling production is not profitable or there are some other problems that are preventing investment in oil palm seedling production. It is necessary to carry out an economic analysis to determine the profitability and viability of oil palm seedling production in Edo South Senatorial district.<br/>1.3     OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY           <br/>The broad objective of the study is the economic analysis of oil palm seedlings production in Edo South senatorial district. The specific objectives are: <br/>i.   To examine the soicio-economic characteristics of the producers of oil palm seedlings in the study area. <br/>ii.   To identify the methods adopted in raising the oil palm seedlings in the study area. <br/>iii.   To estimate the cost and returns in oil palm seedlings production and access its profitability and viability. <br/>iv.   To identify the factors affecting the level of income generated in the production of oil palm seedlings in the study area.

However, the type is limited to few crops and production is concentrated to some pocket areas. In spite of this, the production of vegetables varies from cultivating a few plants in the backyards for home consumption up to a large-scale production for domestic and export markets (Dawitet. al., 2004). Recently, despite the ups and downs observed, the demand for vegetables especially for export is increasing (Tsegay, 2010). In fact, vegetables can generate high income for the farmers because of high market value and profitability. They also have high nutritive value compared to cereals (EARO, 2000) Vegetables are an important feature of Nigerian’s diet that a traditional meal without it is assumed to be incomplete. In developing countries, the consumption of vegetables is generally lower than the FAO recommendation of 75kg per year in habitant (206g per day per capita) (Badmus and Yekini, 2011). In Nigeria, vegetable production has been on-going for decades, providing employment and income for the increasing population especially during the long dry season. However production is constrained by inadequate infrastructure, agronomic and socio-economic variables (Sabo and Zira, 2008). It has been widely demonstrated that rural women, as well as men, throughout the world are engaged in a range of productive activities essential to household welfare, agricultural productivity, and economic growth. Vegetable crops are grown in many parts of the world contributing significantly to income security and the nutritive diet of many households. According to (Mofekeet al.2003) Vegetable crops constitute 30 to 50 percent of iron and vitamin A in resource poor diet. Vegetable crops such as tomatoes, okra, pepper, cabbage etc. are widely cultivated in most part of the Sub-Sahara Africa, particularly by small scale farmers in most states of Nigeria (Adeolu and Taiwo 2009; Giroh et al., 2010). Global production of fruits and vegetables tripled from 396 million MT in 1961 to 1.34 billion MT in 2003(International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, 2005) and Nigeria ranked 16th on the global tomato production scale, accounting for 10.79 percent of Africa’s and 1.2 percent of total world production of tomatoes (Weinberger and Lumpkin, 2007) Protective cultivation has been widely applied due to adverse climatic conditions unfavourable to warm season vegetable production. In many parts of the world, nets or screens are commonly used in crop production for reducing excessive solar radiation, weather effects on produce, and to keep away insects and birds. Vegetable production under protective structures such as netting reduces yield losses from insects, diseases, heavy rains and sunburn which results in higher productivity and returns per unit area (Ramasamy,2011). Protective structures provide protection to vegetable crops against biotic and abiotic stresses (Palada, 2011). Mangmang in 2002, reported that the total fruit yield and high returns of tomato crop was significantly enhanced by the plastic net covers. The net shade greatly reduced insect population by 80% and marketable yields were 1.5 to 2 times greater under than in the open field (Palada and Ali, 2007). Growing cabbage under nets reduced insect incidence by 38-72 percent and resulted in significantly higher returns (Neaveet al, 2011). Green house, the latest word in agriculture is one of such means, where the plants are grown under controlled or partially controlled environment resulting in higher yields than those that are under open conditions (Navale et al. 2003). Net houses and its variants have been used in some European, South American and Southeast Asian countries for producing egg plants (Kaur et al., 2004), leafy greens (Talekar et al., 2003) and cabbage (Martin et al., 2006). In Africa, mobile net houses made of mosquito nets (25- mesh) were effective as physical barrier against the diamondback moths, cut-worms and loopers providing 66- 97 percent control of moths, birds and caterpillars (Martin et al., 2006). Netting is frequently used to protect agricultural crops from excessive solar radiation (shade-nets), improving the thermal climate (Kittas et al., 2009), sheltering from wind and hail and exclusion of bird and insect-transmitted virus diseases (Teitelet al., 2008). The shading of crops results in number of changes on both local microclimate and consequently crop growth and development (Kittaset al., 2009). (Takteet al. 2003) reported that shade nets were used for protection of valuable crops against excess sunlight, cold, frost, wind and insect/birds. They experimented on the effects of shading on crop growth and development, it was found that shading increased leaf area index and total marketable yield production, reduced the appearance of tomato cracking about 50% and accordingly, the marketable tomato production was about 50% higher under shading conditions than under non-shading conditions. (Smith et al. 1984) observed that under shading nets the air temperature was lower than that of the ambient air, depending on the shading intensity. Shade netting not only decreases light quantity but also alters light quality to a varying extent and might also change other environmental conditions. The shade netting determines the commercial value of crop, including yield, product quality, and rate of maturation (Shahaket al., 2004). Poor head formation, leaf twisting, early bolting, and reduced yields occurred when leafy vegetables were grown under hot, high-sunlight conditions without shade net (Sajjapongse and Roan, 1983). Water stress caused by high evapo-transpirative demand, and high air and soil temperatures, appear to be the main causes of poor crop productivity of leafy crops in low-latitude regions (Wolff and Coltman, 1990). In Nigeria, small scale irrigation systems have gone a long way to support dry season farming of crops all over the country. Irrigation farming is relatively low in Nigeria and Africa as a whole, with irrigated area estimated at only 6 percent of total cultivated area, compared with 37 percent of Asia and 14 percent for Latin America (FAOSTAT 2009). Svendsen and Sangi (2009) observed that more than two-third of existing irrigated area is concentrated in five countries namely Egypt, Madagascar, Morocco, South Africa, and Sudan. Giving that irrigated crops yields are more than double of rain fed yields in Africa (Liangzhiet al., 2010), it is important to invest on irrigation developments with particular focus on locations and technologies with greatest potential for irrigation. The effort of the Federal Government of Nigeria, with the support of World Bank and the African Development Fund to develop irrigation systems in the country started with the approval of the implementation of the National FADAMA Development Project (2008- 2016). Dry season production of vegetables is common along the river banks that cut across villages, towns, and cities in Nigeria. Therefore in Yewa North Local Government where the research will be carried out, one of the major activities to be conducted will be to determine the profitability of vegetable production as well as the factors militating against vegetable production among others. <br/>1.2 Statement of the Problem <br/>Nigeria as a country is unable to meet its domestic requirements for vegetables, fruits, floriculture, herbs and spices, dried nuts and pulses. Between 2009 and 2010, Nigeria imported a total of 105,000 metric tonnes of tomato paste valued at over 16 billion naira to bridge the deficit gap between supply and demand in the country (Food and Agricultural Organization, 2006).   Kalu in 2013, attributed this situation to socio-economic constraint surrounding the key actors in the tomato value chain, institutional weaknesses and declining agricultural research. Vegetables are also highly perishable as they start to lose their quality right after harvest and continued throughout the process until it is consumed (Kohl and Uhl, 1985). Hence, vegetable productions are risky investment activities. Riskiness of vegetable production may be attributed to several factors that are beyond the control of producers. Biological processes of plant growth and climatic conditions inherent in agricultural production cause random production shocks (Goodwin and Mishra, 2000; Holt and Chavas, 2002) such as harvest failure as a result of drought, frost, floods and other adverse climatic events; policy shocks (Dercon, 2002). Due to perishable nature and biological nature of production process there is a difficulty of scheduling the supply of vegetables to market demand. The crops are subjected to high price and quantity risks with changing consumer demands and production conditions. Unusual production or harvesting weather or a major crop disease can influence badly the marketing system. While food-marketing system demands stable price and supply, a number of marketing arrangements like contract farming provide stability (Kohl and Uhl, 1985). Hence, knowledge of small-scale crop producers perception towards risk is important in designing strategies and formulating policies for agricultural development (Ayindeet al., 2008). On the other hand, lack of market infrastructure is one of the limiting factors causing low returns in vegetable cultivation. Profitability is not only determined by the use of input resources but it is also dependent on the availability of proper logistic for transporting the farm produce from farm gate to the market. Vegetable production is also influenced by the location of the farms due to the fact that the farms near to input market are in a better position to purchase different inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, etc. at the appropriate time. In Yewa North Local Government, some of the major problems faced by vegetable farmers include the following; lack of capital, lack of storage facilities, climatic conditions, pest and diseases. Another problem that I perceive farmers are facing in the study area and in Nigeria as a whole is, the lack of standard measure for vegetables/pricing. The questions of interest in this study are: ·        What are the socio-economic characteristics of the vegetable farmers in the study area? ·        What is the level of profit generated from vegetable production in the study area? ·        What are the determinants of income generated from vegetable production in the study area? ·        What are the constraints militating against vegetable production in the study area? <br/>1.3 Objective of the Study <br/>The broad objective of the study is to determine the profitability of vegetable production among the rural household farmers. The specific objectives are to:<br/>1. Describe the socio-economic characteristics of the vegetable farmers in the study area; ·        <br/>2. Examine the level of profit generated from vegetable production in the study area; ·        <br/>3.   Analyse the determinants of income generated from vegetable production in the study area; and <br/>4.   Describe the constraints militating against vegetable production in the study area. <br/>1.4 Justification of the Study <br/>The agricultural sector is one of the main stay for many households in Nigeria. On its diversity, the Nigerian agriculture features tree and food crops, forestry, livestock and fishery. In 1993 and 1984, constant factor cost, crops (the major source of food) accounted for about 30 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), livestock about 5 percent, forestry and wildlife about 1.3 percent and fisheries are accounted for same as vegetables and fruit. Therefore, the study is aimed at the following: 1) To the stakeholders, especially the policy makers to make the well managed decisions about the formulation of future strategies for the development of the livelihood of vegetable growers. 2) To the public, to know the profitability level of vegetable production and also the cost of production in other to live standard. <br/>1.5 Plan of the Study <br/>This research was divided into five chapters, chapter one consists of introduction, research problem, objective and justification. While chapter two consists of literature review and conceptual framework, chapter three consists of research methodology, sampling techniques, method of data collection and method of data analysis. On the other hand, chapter four consists of result and discussion and chapter five was summary, conclusion and recommendation.</p>\n\nECONOMICS OF VEGETABLE PRODUCTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ECONOMICS OF VEGETABLE PRODUCTION", "id": 17}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE <br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1  BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>Cashew, known as <em>Anacardium occidental </em>is a native of Brazil and was introduced to Mozambique and then India in the sixteenth century by the Portuguese, as a means of controlling coastal erosion. It was spread within these countries with the aid of elephants that ate the bright cashew fruits along with the attached nut. The nut was too hard to digest and was later expelled with the droppings. It was not until the nineteenth century that plantations were developed and the tree then spread to a number of other countries in africa, Asia and Latin America.(Herringtton and coulter,2004). Cashew processing using manual techniques, was started in India in the first half of the twentieth century. It was exported from there to the wealthy western markets, particularly the United States. In the 1960s some of the producing countries in East Africa began to process nuts domestically rather than sending them to India for processing. This allowed them to benefit from the sale of both processed nuts and the extracted cashew nut shell liquid. Cashew kernels are ranked as  either the second or third most expensive nut trade in the United States. The four main producing regions in the world are India, Nigeria, Brazil and Tanzania. World production of cashew nut grew rapidly during 1950s and 1960s, reaching a peak of 624000 tonnes of raw nuts in 1973. Three countries India, Mozambique and Tanzania accounted for the majority of this production while smaller industries have developed in Brazil, Kenya and several other African countries. There was a total decline in world production, which continued till 1980s (The clipper, 2004). The reason for the decline is due to the decreased production in Mozambique and Tanzanian, since production in Mozambique during the late 1980s and 1990s, production picked up and continued to increase gradually.(Jaffee and Morton,2006). In 2000, to be precise, world cashew production exceeds 1.2 million tones. Asia and Africa countries produced 0.6 million and 0.4 million tones respectively (Herrington and Coulter 2004). Africans overall production steadily increased during the 1950s and 1960s until mid 1970s when it was the prime producer of cashew nuts. Then, in 1975, the production started to decline throughout the continent due to combination of some factors based on biological, political and agronomic basis(Andrighetti et al,1998). <br/>1.2   PROBLEM STATEMENT <br/>Recent study found that cashews are well-known, popular and widely consumed by urban populations in Nigeria and West Africa at large. Though perhaps not everyday food, cashew kernels are a mature product in urban West African Markets associated with quality and luxury and widely available in urban settings. Indeed cashews may be consumed in certain upper-class segments of African society with greater frequency than in Europe or America due to a lack of wide range of substitution with similar associations. The semi – industrial faculties supplying the local market have relatively high fixed cost (in terms of building and equipment) and little consistency in their level of operational use. Because the facilities are mostly run at reduced or seasonal production capacity and staff do not have sufficient training or systems to optimize productivity, the cost of operation are higher relative to export oriented faculties. The larger facilities often (but not always) have better access to financial and usually have acquired their working capital at better interest rates. As this study pointed out, most processors and/or roasters/salters distribute their products themselves. Given the small size of the factories and limited number of staff, distribution and marketing is not specialized or approached in a strategic or full-time manner. Limited availability of packaging equipment and materials in the study area and relatively high prices drive up final product prices for ready to eat cashews. Prices are also high due to the low prices paid for broken nuts (if they are sold at all), which forces processors to charge higher prices for whole nuts. Broken nuts comprise 20 – 40% of production for most cashew processors. Cashew has many uses ranging from fruits known as apple to its nuts which is the kernel to the liquid known as cashew Nut shell liquid {CNSL}. The extraction of the nuts, notwithstanding, to the collection of the liquid from the apple and the extraction of the liquid from the CNSL makes for the full economic utilization of the products. Cashew processing and marketing in the study area have these major problems. These includes the following The cashew apples are sold in the local markets resulting in under valuation of the products in monetary terms. And also cashew kernels are normally extracted by roasting which causes breakages during the cracking and thereby reduces the quantity when grading the cashew nut shell liquid {CNSL} is also wasted away in the process of roasting cashew production is seasonal and its produces only once in a year. Therefore, how can cashew products be properly utilized to reduce wastage and increase the economic value of all its products ranging from the nuts to the apple and also the liquid from the CNSL. How can one attain commercial ways of processing and marketing which will increase mass production for continental and global consumption. How can one acquire cashew processing equipment at affordable price. <br/>1.3  OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>The broad objective of this study is to analyze through research in the production, processing and marketing of cashew products in the study area. The specific objectives are to: <br/>i)                   Identify the cashew products; <br/>ii)                Ascertain the techniques used in cashew products processing;<br/>iii)              Access the channels in which the product  are marketed;<br/>iv)              Identify the problems of processing and marketing of cashew products and; <br/>v)                Make recommendation based on the findings. <br/>1.4   SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>This research finding was chosen for Udenu Local Government area of Enugu State as a result of the abundance of cashew producers, processors and marketers in the study area. Cashew has diverse uses and its importance  can not be over emphasized. Cashew nut is a popular snack, and its rich flavour means that it is often eaten on its own, highly salted or sugared. Trees are used in the control of coastal erosion. Cashew apple is eaten fresh which is high in vitamin. Dried cashew trees can also serve as fuel for cooking food. In addition, cashew nutshell liquid (CNSL), a by product of processing cashew, is mostly composed of anacardic acids. These acids have been used effectively against tooth absceses due to their lethality to bacteria. These products need to be fully utilized for maximum production and minimize waste. Also this study will help to access the techniques used in the processing of cashew products and the grading system used in the standardization of products. The study also helps to know the products being processed and marketed in the study area. The marketing system available to them and also the economic value attached to the sales. Therefore, I hope that the study if carefully examined shall help in the utilization of cashew products as studied and analyzed through this research work. <br/>1.5    LIMITATION OF THE STUDY <br/>This study or researches were limited by many factors: firstly, the time allowed for this study was short compared to the volume of work requirement to bring out a comprehensive research work. Secondly, finance was one of the major factors to reach the respondents in their various locations in one way or the other requires some costs. Language barrier is another limitation. Many of the respondents were illiterate who could not read out the questions from the questionnaire. Some of the respondents were also griped with fear and doubt about the genuineness of the research. The system of their measurement lacked appropriateness. For example, the products marketed or processed could not be accurately measured. All these really made the research face a lot of inconsistence in obtaining data. In spite of all these limitations, the work or result of this analysis is reliable, accurate and valid.</p>\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF PROCESSING AND MARKETING OF CASHEW PRODUCTS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF PROCESSING AND MARKETING OF CASHEW PRODUCTS", "id": 18}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>CHAPTER ONE <br/>INTRODUCTION <br/>1.1. BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>In Nigeria, agriculture has remained the largest sector of the economy. It generates employment for about 70% of the population and contributes about 40% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) with crop accounting for 80%, livestock 13%, forestry 3% and fishery 4%. Agriculture accounts for over 70% of the non-oil export and provides over 80% of the food needs of the country (Adegboye,2004). Nigeria has a total land area of 98.3milion hectares, but at present, only about 34 million hectares or 48% are under cultivation. Agriculture in Nigeria is practiced at subsistent level and is characterized by numerous farmers operating several scattered small and fragmented plots of land using traditional methods such as land rotation, bush burning with the use of crude implements like hoes and cutlasses.   According to Olawepo (2010), the majority of the rural populace in Nigeria either depends entirely on farming and farming activities for survival and generation of income, or depends on other non-farming activities to supplement their main source of income. Over 90% of the country’s local food production comes from small-scale farms. About 60% of the population earnstheir living from these small farms which are usually of the size of about 0.10-5.99 hectares (Olawepo,2010). It could then be seen that most farmers have limited resources, a factor that limits their productivity, income, savings and investment. In the midst of all these, farmers have resulted to a number of means to enhance their production and also to improve their well-being socio-economically. These options includes pooling their resources and working together as members of cooperative societies, through the use of loan and other services from microfinance or community banks; making daily, weekly or monthly contributions through the formation of small savings and thrift groups like Ajo-dida and Esusu or employing the method of risk diversification by engaging in the trading of other non-agricultural goods or in processing or value addition of agricultural produceinto finished goods with longer shelf-life as agro-processors – those into the process of producing or sourcing for agricultural produce and converting them into finished goods for consumption.   In Nigeria, where rural farmers account for over 80% of the farmers in the country and produce 95% of the domestic food production in the country (Olashore,1998; Yusuf,2000), majority of rural households are small-scale farmers and as such, a significant part of their non-farm income comes from small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Rural entrepreneurs are characterized by poor access to credit, poor savings rate, risk and uncertainty, poor weather condition, focusing of information on technology and not on pricing. The inability of rural entrepreneurs to access credit has restricted their potential to expand their enterprises especially in diversifying into non-farm activities and end up with low income and hence, poor savings (Albu and Scott,2001). This has led to low standard of living and inability to break the vicious cycle of poverty for the rural dwellers.   Savings is normally considered in economics as disposable income minus personal consumption expenditure. It could also be regarded as income that is not consumedimmediately by the purchase of goods and services. According to Azhar (1995),savings may be made in kind such as jewelry, land, livestock or dowry. It may still be in the form of currency notes deposited in banks or more often be hoarded. Savings are very imperative for supporting and developing rural industries. They provide several benefits for households. Directly, saving could be used for investment. Indirectly, saving indicates repayment ability, also increase credit rating and as collateral in the credit market (Brata,1999). Savings is both a risk management strategy and determinant of magnitude of investment but its determinants and mobilization strategy are controversial issues in literature (Mkpado and Arene,2010). Ayanwale and Bamire (2000) claimed that saving behaviours of farmers in developing countries is less dependent on the absolute level of aggregate income, but more dependent on other factors on the relationship between current and expected income, the nature of business, household size, wealth and demographic factors like age. Adeyemo and Akala(1992),for instance, showed that there is a high degree of responsiveness of savings to change among fishermen in the riverine areas of Nigeria. On the other hand, investment could be considered as an act of laying out money in return for a future financial reward or the sacrifice of something now for the prospect of later benefits (Ajayi,1998). According to Olofin (2001), investment is any form of producer durable that is capable of contributing to the production of goods and services. Investment spending or expenditure to him would be any form of outlay, either by individuals or corporate units as firms or institutions such as government, for the purchase of such durables. Therefore, investment in their context refers to the purchase of real tangible assets such as machines, factories or stock of goods and services for further use as opposed to present consumption. Investment is a process of exchanging income for assets or converting forms into productive economic unit based for higher return or higher rate of economic value in future period for the purpose of gaining income. Odoemenem(1991),however, was of the view that small scale farmers invested their savings in two major areas; the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. Investment in the agricultural sector or farm activity includes the purchase of fertilizer and chemicals hired labour and buying more land for farming while non-agricultural sector are mainly centered on education, trade expansion, building houses, dowry obligation and purchase of durable assets. In line with the above concepts, savings and investment in the rural economy appear to be in monetized and non-monetized forms. This could be attributed to the subsistent nature of the economy. This further implies that for any meaningful investment to be obtained, a sound saving mobilization has to be pursued. Although, when the increments and funds are spent on household expenditure, farming economy and economy growth tend to be jeopardized,adequate integration of savings and investment programmes into development strategies are capable of improving resource allocation, promoting equitable distribution of income and reducing credit delivery and recovering cost. The government, armed with the awareness of the contribution of savings and investment strategies among farmer cooperatives, agro-processors and SMEs to the economy, have been encouraged to establish programmes involved in loan schemes such as Family Economic Advancement Programme (FEAP), Cooperative Federation of Nigeria (CFN), Nigerian Agricultural Cooperative and Rural Development Bank (NACRDB) amongst others.<br/>1.2. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>There are several problems that affect the level of savings and investment strategies of agro-processors. While acknowledging that socio-economic characteristics of the agro-processors may vary from one occupation to another, recent studies like Adeyemo and Bamire (2005) suggest that socio-economic characteristics such as age, sex, farming experience, household size…etc, affect the level of savings and investment strategies among agro-processors.  One of the problems confronting the development of the agricultural sector in Nigeria could be attributed to inadequate savings and investment by the small scale farmers (and agro-processors). Despite this problem, policy makers have not really drawn up adequate and comprehensive rural savings scheme that will ginger the farmers to invest their capital productively (Ogwanighie,1997). Many farmers (andagro-processors) in Nigeria have not been able to finance their businesses due to poor access to credit, poor savings rate, risk and uncertainty, poor weather condition among other difficulties, thereby resulting to other means of mobilizing savings and funds for investment such as cooperatives and other informal financial institutions. Odoemenem, et al. (2005) observed that farmers make use of informal financial sectors to mobilize savings to develop their rural communities. They further observed that rural farmers make use of informal financial institutions because they give them access to loans they cannot get from formal financial institutions due to lack of collateral. Though, this sector has its own prevalent problems such as inadequate capital base for operation, poor record keeping, crude accounting system, gross mismanagement; farmers still prefer them to banks. Recently, there has been an upsurge of interest among development economists, governments and international donor organizations to increase financial savings in developing countries, particularly in rural areas and among poor households. However, a large number of developing countries are unable to mobilize the potential savings of the non-corporate sector because the structure of their financial institutions, financial instruments and financial policies are not sound (Reardon,2000). In view of this, with major focus on cassava processors (those into fufu production), the questions of interest in this study are; ·        What are the socio-economic characteristics of the cassava processors in the study area? ·        What is the investment pattern of the cassava processors in the study area? ·        What are the existing income levels of the cassava processors in the study area? ·        What is the savings rate of the cassava processors in the study area? ·        What are the determinants of savings and investment among the cassava processors in the study area? This study attempts to provide answers to the questions identified.    <br/>1.3. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>The broad objective of this study is to analyze or assess the savings and investment strategies of cassava processors using Yewa North Local Government Area as a study case. The specific objectives are to; ·        describe the socio-economic characteristics of the cassava processors in the study area. ·        describe the investment pattern of the cassava processors. ·        estimate the income level of the cassava processors. ·        determine the savings rate among the respondents. ·        estimate the determinants of savings and investment strategies among the respondents. <br/>1.4. JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY <br/>The justification of this study is centered on the importance of savings and investment and also the essence of savings and investment strategies as it concerns the cassava processors’ businesses. In developing countries, especially Nigeria, investments in agricultural production and its related activities have not been given expected priority, even among the farmers who come together as a group to assist each other, either through cooperatives or other informal means; and this can be attributed to some factors. Ayanwale and Bamire (2000) claimed that the saving behavior of cooperative farmers (cassava processors inclusive) in developing countries is less dependent on the absolute level of aggregate income and more dependent on the relationship between current and expected income, the nature of the business, household size, wealth and demographic variables among other related factors. However, Adeyemo and Bamire (2005) examined the pattern of savings and investment among cooperative farmers (or cassava processors in this case) in Southwestern Nigeria and reported that income, loan repayment and amount of money borrowed are significant variables that influenced saving pattern. This research study is set to help clear the air on savings and investment among farmers as well as cassava processors and also the determinants of the savings and investment strategies with regards to the available infrastructure on the study.   Information from this research study on the analysis of savings and investment strategies among cassava processors could help policy makers and credit agencies for effective and efficient credit services delivery of loan schemes that could increase the production of agricultural produce and value-added finished goods as well as the general well-being of the cassava processors. <br/>1.5. PLAN OF THE STUDY <br/>This research study was divided into five chapters, with each chapter for a definite purpose.

It provides over 80% of the food needs of the country. About 70% of Nigerians live in rural area, and 90% of these are engaged in agriculture. This implies that agriculture is a key sector that stands to affect majority of Nigerians positively (Okolo, 2004). Despite its high contribution to the overall economy, this sector has been seriously facing challenges of many factors of which climate-related disasters such as drought and floods are the major ones (Deressa, 2008). According to Udofia (2001), the frightening effects of climate variability on the entire environment has reached a global dimension. Although its effects and the ecological and economic consequences are well perceived, they appear not to have been given the serious attention they deserve.</p> <p>Climate is defined as the statistical description interms of mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30yrs as defined by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO, 1992).These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. The difference between climate and weather is that climate is what you expect while weather is what you get. The term climate variability denotes the natural characteristics of climate that manifests itself within the changes of climate with regards to time. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2001) defines climate variability as “variations in the mean state and other statistics (such as standard deviations, the occurrence of extremes, etc.) of the climate on all temporal and spatial scales beyond that ofindividual weather events”. This definition allows the consideration of climate change as a low frequency component of climate variability that can be managed using the same quantitative tools and research approaches (Mertz and Stone, 2003). Climate variation can enhance or diminish a local area’s comparative advantage in agriculture.</p> <p>Changes in soil water availability, the increased occurrence of climate fluctuation, climate extremes and crop diseases, could lead to an overall reduction in crop yield and serious food shortage. Projections suggest that by the end of the 21stcentury, climate variability would have had substantial impact on crop production (Slater et al 2007). Humanity cannot accurately predict what the next season will bring but farmers, input suppliers, marketers and government would all like to know because it is critical to decision making. Climate variability has created uncertainties in temperature, rainfall and wind patterns. As a result, rural people in countries like Nigeria whose main occupation or economic activity is agriculture, are faced with so many challenges in decision making with respect to their agricultural activities ( Barnwal and Kotani, 2010).</p> <p>Climate variability adaptation methods according to Nyong, Adesina and Osman-Elasha (2007) are those strategies that enable the individual or the community to cope with or adjust to the impacts of the change in climate. Although, Zeirvogel et al (2008) had noted that the world has been undergoing series of adaptation in response to climate variability; the current climate change is expected to present heightened risk, new combinations of risks and potentially grave consequences. As such, adaptation has been identified as a policy option to mitigate the adverse effects of climate variability on farm productivity.  In agriculture, adaptation helps farmers achieve their food, income and livelihood security objectives in the face of changing climatic and socio-economic conditions including climatic variability, extreme weather conditions such as droughts, floods and volatile short term changes in local and large scale markets (Kandlinkar and Risbey, 2000).</p> <p>Agricultural adaptation has been described as one of the policy tools to ameliorate the ravaging effects of climate variability ( Kurukulasuriya and Mendelsohn, 2008). Mendelsohn and Dinar reported in 1999 that from farm level analysis, large reductions in adverse impacts from climate variability are possible when adaptation is fully implemented (FAO, 2007). Some adaptation strategies for crop production among farmers include adoption of efficient environmental resources management practices such as the planting of early maturing crops, mulching, small scale irrigation, adoption of hardy varieties of crops, tree planting and staking to avoid heat burns (Nyong, et al, 2007). There are lots of challenges facing agricultural adaptation in Nigeria. According to Nzeh and Eboh (2011) lack of awareness and knowledge on climate variability is perhaps the biggest obstacle to effective agricultural adaptation. Onyeneke and Madukwe (2010) also opined other barriers to include lack of information on appropriate adaptation option, poor access to market and shortage of farm labour.</p> <p>Apata et al (2010) reported that capital, land and labour serve as important factors for coping with adaptation, stressing that the lack of these factors as well as choice of suitable adaptive measures constitute severe challenge to agricultural adaptation. This is consistent with Deressa et al (2008) report that adaptation to climate variability is costly, and the need for intensive labour use exacerbate this cost. This therefore calls for development of various adaptation strategies in order to cope with the variability in climate. Such strategies focus on managing risks, reducing vulnerability, enhancing agricultural productivity, protecting the environment and ensuring sustainable development under the changing climate.</p> <p>1.2   Statement of the Problem</p> <p>Recent studies confirm that Africa is one of the most vulnerable continents to climate variability and change and low adaptive capacity. Some adaptation to current climate variability has been taking place; however, this may be insufficient for future changes in climate (IPCC, 2007).  The uncertainty associated with climate variability is a disincentive to investment and adoption of agricultural technologies and market opportunities, prompting the risk-averse farmer to favour precautionary strategies that buffer against climatic change, particularly as a result of increased variability and extreme over activities that are more profitable on average (Barrett et al, 2007). It has been predicted that many farmers in Africa are likely to experience net revenue losses as a result of climate change, particularly as a result of increased variability and extreme events (TerrAfrica, 2009).</p> <p>The adverse consequences of climate variability includes damage on arable lands, livelihoods and biodiversity will take an irreplaceable toll on food production in developing countries like Nigeria which have a low capacity to cope and adapt to these challenges (Sha, Fischer van Velthuizen, 2009). Given the foregoing challenges a study of this nature will be a timely intervention. Many studies have been carried out in addressing the effects of climate variability on agriculture in Nigeria. However, not many of these studies have fully addressed the issues of adaptation strategies.  Enete and Amusa (2011) discussed the challenges of agricultural adaptation to climate change in Nigeria, but the study was based on review of relevant literature thus leaving a gap for more empirical approach to the study of this issue.Enete and Amusa (2011) in another paper made further attempts to investigate the most cost-effective and sustainable indigenous climate change adaptation practices in South East Nigeria but studies covering wider area such as Nigerian agro-climatic zones and several arable crops simultaneously appear not to have been documented yet.</p> <p>Umoh and Eketekpe (2010) attempted to study climate change adaptation measures by wetland farmers in Niger Delta region of Nigeria but did not study any other State beyond Bayelsa out of the nine States in the Niger Delta. The study focused only on a single Local Government Area. The study of Emaziye (2013) was based on perceptions of climate change among rural farming households in the Niger Delta area of Nigeria in other todetermine the direction of change of the climate change indicators thus leaving a gap for empirical studies on adaptation especially in Delta State where little or no work on adaptation strategies has been done.  Previous studies showed that the dimensions of use of these measures have not been effectively explored particularly in Delta State. This is considered important, considering the fact that farmers least able to adapt to climate variability will suffer most severely.</p> <p>In the light of this, this study has addressed the following research questions:</p> <p>What are the socio-economic characteristics of crop farmers?</p> <p>What is the perception of crop farmer’s about climate variability?</p> <p>What are the adaptation strategies adopted by farmers to mitigate the effects of climate variability?</p> <p>What socioeconomic and environmental factors influence farmers’ choice of adaptation strategies?</p> <p>What factors constrain farmers in adapting to the effects of climate variability?</p> <p>1.3              Objectives of the Study</p> <p>The main objective of the study was to determine the Adaptation strategies to climate variability by arable crop farmers in Delta State. The specific objectives were to:</p> <p>i)describe the socio-economic characteristics of arable crop farmers in the study area.</p> <p>(ii)ascertain farmers’ perception about climate variability on crop production.</p> <p>(iii)examine adaptation practices adopted by arable crop farmers in the study area.</p> <p>(iv).ascertain the factors that influence farmers’ choice of adaptation strategies.</p> <p>(v). determine the cost and return of adaptation strategies among arable farmers.</p> <p>(vi)identify constraints to adoption of adaptation strategies by arable crop farmers .</p>                                                         \n\n ADAPTATION STRATEGIES TO CLIMATE VARIABILITY USED BY FARMING HOUSEHOLDS<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": "  ADAPTATION STRATEGIES TO CLIMATE VARIABILITY USED BY FARMING HOUSEHOLDS", "id": 21}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p> <strong>ANALYSIS OF LABOR USE AND FOOD SECURITY AMONG RURAL MAIZE FARMERS IN ODEDE LGA, OGUN STATE.</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The study examined the Analysis of labor use and food security among rural maize farmers in odede lga, ogun state.</p> <p>More specifically, the study sought to assess the labor use and food security among farmers.</p> <p>The study consist of all farmers in Odeda Local government area, Ogun state, a two -Stage sampling procedure was employed in the selection of the respondents’ maize crop farmers within the study area, twenty-five maize farmers was randomly selected from each of the villages which one hundred and twenty (120) maize crop farmers gave complete information that was used for the final analysis.</p> <p>A well- developed questionnaire was designed to elicit information from the respondents, the data collected were analyzed using the descriptive statistics, food security index and the probit regression model. </p> <p>Result from the study indicated that maize farmers in Odeda Local Government Area of Ogun State make use of hired and family labour in varied proportion.

For food security to exist at the national, regional and local levels, food must be available accessible and properly utilized. It is a basic necessity of life. Food is regarded as the basic means of sustenance, and an adequate food intake in terms of quantity and quality, is a key, for healthy and productive life (FAO, 2005). It is perhaps the most important commodity linking rural producers and urban consumers (Rengasamy et al. 2003). Food accounts for a substantial part of the typical Nigerian household budget. Various foods serve as important vehicles for taking nutrients into the body and bringing about a healthy state, hence the need for taken, there classes, of essential nutrients, which must be combined in appropriate proportion to ensure an adequate food intake. These include: carbohydrates, proteins, fats and oil, vitamins and minerals (Omonona, Agoi and Adetokunbo, 2007). The need for food is topmost in the hierarchy of needs as it is essential for healthy living. Thus, achievement of food security is important in any given country.</p> <p>Africa with its vast land area covering 3 billion ha has 1.3 billion ha of agricultural land out of which only 252 million ha (19.36%) is arable (FAO, 2011). Africa is the center of origin and also a major producer of several cereals like sorghum, pearl millet, finger millet, teff, African rice and maize. Maize has overtaken these traditional cereals. In Africa, it is grown over an area of 34.08 million ha producing 70.08 million tons (FAO, 2015). Maize is a major staple crop in diverse agro-ecological zones and farming systems, and consumed by people with varying food preferences and socio-economic backgrounds. Of the 22 countries in the world where maize forms the highest percentage of calorie intake in the national diet, are in Africa. Maize accounts for almost </p> <p>The final report of the 1996 World Food Summit states that food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active healthy life.It is a condition related to the supply of food, and individuals’ access to it.A farming household is therefore, adjudged food secure when the trio of food availability, food accessibility and food affordability is guaranteed in the required quantity and quality (World Bank, 2001). At the 1974 World Food Conference the term “food security” was defined with emphasis on supply. Food security, they said, is the “availability at times of adequate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuations in production and prices”.  It is also a situation that exists when all the people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary food preferences for an active and healthy life (UNFAO, 2001). </p> <p>The WHO states that there are three pillars that determine food security: food availability, food access, and food use. The FAO adds a fourth pillar: the stability of the first three dimension of food security over time. In 2009, the world summit on Food Security stated that the “four pillars of food security are availability, access, utilization and stability.</p> <p>Food availability means that enough safe and nutritious food either domestically produced or imported from the international market. Food availability does not ensure food accessibility. For food to be accessible individuals or families must have sufficient purchasing power or ability to acquire quality food at all times the utilization demands sufficient quality and quantity intake (Omonona et. al, 2007). These elements availability, accessibility and utilization in a larger context, embraces the supply, demand and adequacy of food at all times. </p> <p>Food insecurity, is a situation of \"limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways\", according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Mohammed (2003) noted that food insecurity exists when there is physical unavailability of food, lack of social and economic access to adequate food/or inadequate food utilization. Food insecure households are households whose food intake falls below their minimum calorie (energy) requirements, and those who exhibit physical symptoms caused by nutrient deficiencies resulting from inadequate diets. The dimensions of food security make it clear that the concept of food problem is a complex one with many dimensions. At one level, the concern is with national food security, which is the ability of countries to produce or increase sufficient food all the year to meet their requirement for both private and public distribution. At another level, the concern is more with the problem of malnutrition which could also affect labor.</p> <p>Agriculture is an important tool and vehicle for reducing the effect of household food insecurity, unemployment and poverty which are major in Nigeria (Moore, 2000). Agricultural productivity is linked to food security as higher agricultural productivity would translate to larger food supplies, lower food prices, higher farm income and higher purchasing power for other basic necessities for the attainment of household food security (Wunderlich and Norwood, 2006). To have sustainable development in agriculture there is need to make efficient use of basic production factors, which include land, labor and capital (Bervidova, 2001). Labor is one of the most important inputs in agricultural production. </p> <p>Labor is a service (person-years per year) and includes all human time-using activities, including what is sometimes labeled separately as labor and management. Labor services are perishable and hence cannot be moved to another period in time for use; workers, on the other hand, are durable, potentially working for many years as well as being geographically mobile. Labor plays a central and crucial role in agricultural production, particularly under small scale peasant production system. Human labor activates other production factors and transforms other farm inputs into the required outputs. It is about the only source of labor available to small-holder farmers in Nigeria. The smallholder farmers contribute the largest proportion (about 85%) of total domestic agricultural output in their area. Thus, the hope of continuing supply of food need of ever growing population anchors very auspiciously on human labor. How it is measured and valued is critical for establishing the cost of producing agricultural commodities and accurately portraying labor's relative share of the total cost of production. Farm labor includes all hired labor/contract which may be subdivided into; seasonal labor and task-contracted casual labor, exchange, and unpaid or family labor used in agricultural production. However, .the contribution of exchange labor to family’s overall labor input is low (less than 10%). Some studies (Echebiri &amp; Mbanasor, 2003; King 1972) confirm that farm labor supplied by humans on the farm is not homogenous and job content differ. These studies found that in general, men performed heavy farm operations such as land preparation, staking and harvesting with women and children performing lighter operations such as planting, fertilizer application and weeding. Ajibefun <em>et. al.,</em> (2000) noted that hired labor contributes 88.0% [1] of the total use on farms thus emphasizing its importance in agricultural activities. Other types of labor that could be found employed are family labor and exchange labor. Researchers on farm labor supply have observed the total supply of labor depends on factors such as the size of the population, its age composition and certain institutional factors (Hardwick, 1994).</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa with an estimate of 150 million people (Nigerian Population Census, 2006). Approximately 68% 0f this population consists of women and children with over 70% residing and securing their lively in the rural areas (Maziya-Dixon et al., 2004). Agriculture in Nigeria is of notable relevance in the country’s economic development and growth. It contributes more than 48% of the total annual GDP, employs about 68% of the labor force, account for the over 70% of the non-oil exports and provided over 80% the food need of the country (Adegboye, 2004). Despite these notable roles, food insecurity RANKS top most among the developmental challenges facing Nigeria (Babatunde et al 2007). Food insecurity has been on the increase in most rural areas in Nigeria (Oni et al., 2011). In Nigeria food insecurity has risen from about 18% in 1986 to about 41% in 2004 (Sanusi et al 2006). In fact, food security is considered a measure of poverty in many societies since it reduces access to food (World Bank, 1991; Nord et al., 2000; Adeniyi and Ojo, 2013). Therefore, food security of households will improve if poverty is reduced (Philip et al., 2009; Aewuyi and Hayatu, 2011).</p> <p>The recent increase of food prices call for serious attention, due to challenges and crises facing the globe is worsening food and other Agricultural products crisis period unheard of in the last 30 years and the potential of leading to scarcity. That is why this vital issue has taken the most attention among world leaders, thereby increasing and agitating the concern for the world’s ability to feed its 6.8 billion people, to prevent world-wide instability as reported in most countries like Nigeria (Food and Agricultural Organization, 2013). As a result, various international organizations and individual countries embarked on aggressive food security movement to find a concrete solution to the situation in order to make food affordable to all.</p> <p>The Food Security assessment in 2005 proves that about 750 million people were food unsecured in almost 70 low-income countries. Furthermore, Asia and other Commonwealth States experienced a 30% decline in the number of those that are hungry. In Latin American and Caribbean countries has varied a little over time, but there has been a noticeable trend across the area as a wholly. In spite of the strong growth in food production, Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region where hunger has increase in the last ten years. The challenge today is that high food prices has led to the increase in food insecurity and widespread food crisis in many developing countries in which Nigeria is not excluded. However, poor people in developing countries spend about 50-80% of their monthly income on food meet consumers need. Any increase in food prices will reduce food consumption and increase hunger. In Nigeria however, the prices of rice, corn and wheat recorded a high roof-tops recently (FAO, 2013).</p> <p>Generally, this overall food crisis has been attributed to a number of factors including climate change, population growth, poor storage facilities, increased demand for bio-fuels, failure to improve crop yield, high oil prices resulting to increased input loss for producers and traders. The structural problems like under-investment in agriculture and dominance in supply chain of food and agricultural policies sky rocket prices of food. However, Studies have revealed that agricultural-based livelihood in rural Nigeria has a higher level of poverty than other occupational groups.Rural agriculture is limited to local variations in weather conditions, and thus expected variations in income levels and thus access to food respectively (Omonona, 2009). Additionally, Hired and Use labor is not only applicable where family labor is insufficient. The much desired transition from small-scale farming to commercial level production by expansion of production resources definitely requires outsourcing for additional labor. Blanc et- al. (2008) opines that the proportion of use labor in total farm labor use in many developing countries has continued to increase over time which makes this present study relevant.</p> <p>Achieving food security is still a challenge due to the global approach being employed instead of formulating and applying solutions based on specific locations with an understanding of the social system and livelihood system (FAO, 2003). Hence the study intends to assess labor use and food security among rural farming household in Oyo state, Nigeria. </p> <p><strong>In essence, the study attempts to provide answers to the following questions:</strong></p> <p>· What are the socioeconomic characteristics of maize farmers in the study area?</p> <p>· What are different labor sources available to respondent in the study area?</p> <p>· How do maize farmers use the available labor?</p> <p>· What is the food security status of the respondent?</p> <p>· What are the determinants of household food security of the respondent?</p> <p>1.3 <strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The general objective of this study is to assess labor use and food security in the study area.</p> <p>The specific objectives are to:</p> <p>· discuss the socioeconomic characteristics of the maize farmers in the study area,</p> <p>· identify the  different labor sources available to respondents in the study area,</p> <p>· examine labor allocation among the maize farmers,</p> <p>· know the food security status of the respondent,</p> <p>· determine the factors influencing household`s food security of the farmers.</p> <p>1.4 <strong>ANALYSIS OF OBJECTIVES</strong></p> <p>The table 1.1 below presents the analysis of each of the objectives in terms of data requirement, sources of data, method of data collection and method of data analysis.</p> <p><strong>TABLE 1.1 MATRIX FOR ANALYSIS OF OBJECTIVES</strong></p><p> </p> <p><strong>OBJECTIVES</strong></p><p> </p> <p><strong>SOURCE OF DATA</strong></p><p> </p> <p><strong>METHOD OF DATA COLLECTION</strong></p><p> </p> <p><strong>DATA REQUIREMENT </strong></p><p> </p> <p><strong>TOOL(S) FOR ANALYSIS </strong></p><p> </p> <p>Discuss the socioeconomic characteristics of the maize farmers in the study area</p><p> </p> <p>Primary data</p><p> </p> <p>The use of a well-structured questionnaire</p><p> </p> <p>Household size, age of the household head, marital status,  level of education, etc.</p><p> </p> <p>Descriptive data (frequency, percentage, mean mode)</p><p> </p> <p>Identify the  different labor sources available to respondents  in the study area</p><p> </p> <p>Primary data</p><p> </p> <p>The use of a well-structured questionnaire</p><p> </p> <p>Type of labor used by the respondent </p><p> </p> <p>Descriptive data (frequency, percentage, mean mode)</p><p> </p> <p>Examine labor allocation among the maize farmers</p><p> </p> <p>Primary data</p><p> </p> <p>The use of a well-structured questionnaire</p><p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Know the food security status of the respondent</p><p> </p> <p>Primary data</p><p> </p> <p>The use of a well-structured questionnaire</p><p> </p> <p>Household per capita food expenditure, educational status, average monthly income, household size, age, etc</p><p> </p> <p>Regression analysis (probit model)</p><p> </p> <p>Determine the factors influencing household`s food security of the farmers</p><p> </p> <p>Primary data</p><p> </p> <p>The use of a well-structured questionnaire</p><p> </p> <p>Socio-economic characteristics’ such as educational status of household head, marital status of household head, age of the household head, household size, etc.</p><p> </p> <p>Regression analysis (probit model)</p><p> </p> <p>1.5 <strong>JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Today, maize ranks highly as a major staple food particularly for the low income earners and resource poor farm households in developing economies of sub-Saharan Africa (FAO, 2009). Maize serves over 200 million Africans; its comparative production advantage over other staples serves to encourage its cultivation even by resource that there obsolete (Bamidele <em>et al., </em>2008; FAO, 2000). However, it is an important source of carbohydrate, protein, iron, vitamin B, and minerals. Furthermore, Green maize (fresh on the cob) is eaten parched, baked, roasted or boiled; playing an important role in filling the hunger gap after the dry season and serving as a staple diet for 200 million people (Directorate Agricultural Information Services in cooperation with ARC-Grain Crop Institute, 2003), while in developed countries, maize is consumed as second-cycle produce in the form of meat, eggs and dairy products. The importance of maize cannot be overemphasized, with Nigeria producing 43% of maize grown in West Africa. Maize is the most important staple food in Nigeria. It accounts for about 43% of calorie intake (Nweke et al., 1983; NARP, 1994). Maize has consumption quantity of 53.20 g/capital/day (FAOSTAT, 2007). Furthermore, the average annual per capita maize output for 2005-2014 is 105kg (NBS, 2015), while the per capita maize consumption is 175kg (FAO STAT, 2015). As a result, maize has received substantial research and extension attention. This generally also calls for the need to intensify effort on adoption of improved agricultural technologies for improved productivity and ensure food security. Even though several adoption studies explored technology adoption decision in developing countries like Nigeria (Feder et al., 1985; Rauniya and Goode, 1992; Ouma et al., 2006; Ojaiko et al., 2007; Idrisa, 2009), the studies fall short of addressing the effect of adoption of improved seed technology on food security status of farming households.</p> <p>World Food Program (WFP) (2013) reported that about 842 million people (one in every eight) across the world suffer chronic hunger. Almost all the hungry people live in the rural areas of developing countries, and belong to mostly farming families and represent about 15% of the population of such countries (Hunger Notes, 2013). Fakiyesi (2001) reported that 66% of Nigerians live below poverty line when judged by level of food security. Also, over 40% of the Nigerian population was found to be food insecure in 2005 (Sanusi et. al., 2006). </p> <p>Agricultural production in Nigeria though the mainstay of the economy, still rests largely on the shoulders of small-scale, resources-poor farmers who inhabit the rural areas of the country. It is heavily labor intensive with farmers relying on households for labor and supply. Gocowski and Oduwole (2003) confirmed labor as a major constraint to peasant agricultural production in Nigeria especially during planting, weeding and harvesting. </p> <p>Human labor is about the only form of farm labor available to small holder farmers in Southwest of Nigeria. This form of labor accounts for up to 80% of total farm power and constitute between 80 and 90% of the cost of production in many farming systems (Awoyemi, 1981; Dvorak, 1996).</p> <p>Generally, the scarcity of farm labor has be found to have negative impact on planting precision, better weed control, timely harvesting and crop processing (Oluyole et. al., 2011). However, noted that labor is a major constraint in peasant production especially during planting, weeding and harvesting. Also, observed that rapid growth in population which increases farm labor supply exerts so much pressure on land and reduces farm size per hectare. Empirical evidence have shown that available farm labor forces comprised mostly of old people (to the exclusion of young men and women within the active working age) therefore having negative effect on agricultural productivity (Oluyole &amp; Lawal, 2010). The increasing absence of young people in framing could attribute to farm drudgery, poor farm income, rural-urban migration, food insecurity as well as generally lowlife expectancy in rural areas (Gill, 1991).</p> <p>Labor supply from family level has been dwindling considerably over the past years due to a number of factors, some of which are related. The achievement of international labor organization in child labor prevention coupled with the increasing awareness of importance of education even in the rural areas has increased the proportion of children in schools hence reducing time available to work on the farm (Diallo et. al., 2013). Rural-urban migration leaving mainly the aged and less mobile farmers to work on the farms as stated by (Oluyole et. al., 2013), low income, hunger and poor nutrition has also negatively affected the availability of labor on the farm. Also, vulnerable households such as women headed or orphaned households are usually unduly disadvantaged on labor availability and productivity (Babatunde et. al., 2008).</p> <p>The general notion and idea of food security will continue to be a recalling one, as it affects the wellbeing of the world population. Rural farmers in particular will consistently feature, as their involvement in food availability is on the increasing side. Accordingly, the information contained in this study is expected to provide some vital information regarding the specific ways rural farmers contribute to household food security in Egbeda, Oyo state. Moreover, the government and its agents, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), welfare planners, fellow researchers, and the general public will find this work as an invaluable source of reference.</p> <p>There is a possibility therefore that agricultural productivity in Nigeria may be limited as a result of poor use of labor which affects food security. It is therefore important to examine the relationship between labor, agricultural productivity and food security.</p> <p><strong>1.6 PLAN OF THE REPORT</strong></p> <p>This study is divided into five chapters.

The problems are accessioned by high rate of population growth which has arisen the failure of food production to cope with national demand. Agricultural sector has a unique role to play in the quest of putting the Nigeria economy on the production of balanced self reliant and non inflationary growth. The study of economic history provides us with sample evidence that an agricultural evolution is a fundament production for economic development. The agricultural sector has a potential to be the industrial and economic spring boards more often than not agricultural activities are usually concentrated in the less developed rural areas where there is a crucial need for transformation, re- distribution, poverty alleviation and social economic development.</p> <p>Agricultural activities comprises of crop and animal production, there have been growing concerns in the recent years at the low level of protein intake, especially of animal origin in spite of various agricultural development strategies adopted in Nigeria, daily per-capita, animal protein intake estimated as less than log or remains as far cry from the food and agricultural organization (FAO) recommendation minimal requirement of 35g (Usman 2003) in order to bridge this gap, it has been suggested that there is the need to explore of or source animal protein in addition to the conventional source such as ruminants and poultry (Olayide and Heady 1981) one of the important alternative source of animal protein, which has received relatively scanty attention in Nigeria as the snail.</p> <p>The problem of animal protein intake in Nigeria has encouraged researcher to look for source of protein from animal which are reared with little or no capital. Micro livestock such as snail, glasscutter and rabbit have been domesticated and a lot of work is going on aimed to increase their availability at a reduced price, Snail farm environmental friendly and can be done with little skills (Alkinusi 1988 NCR 1991).</p> <p>In Africa countries snail production is also relevant and according to some researcher, snail in Africa is known as Achatina Fulica and other achatinal species, giant Africa snails. They can grow up to 326mm (1ft ¾ inch) in length. Their native range is south of the Sahara in East Africa. This snail was purposely introduced into India in 1847. There was an unsuccessful attempt to establish it in Japan in 1925. It has been purposely and accidentally transported to other pacific locations and was inadventenly released in California after World War II, in Hawaii, and later in North maimi Florida in the 1970s. In many places, it is a serious agricultural pest that causes considerable crop damage. Also, due to its large size, its slime and fecal material create a nuisance as does the odour that occurs when something like poison bait causes large numbers to die (Wikipedia, 19 may 2015).</p> <p>1.    <strong>STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>Roasted snail shells have been found in Archaeological excavations and indication that snails have been eaten since prehistoric times. Roman snail, was an ancient method of snail farming or horticulture in the region about tanquinia. This snail farming method was described by folvius lippinus (49BC) and mentioned by marcuc Terentis varro in De Re Rustica III, 12.</p> <p>There was an unsuccessful attempt to establish it in Japan in 1925. It has been purposely and accidentally transported to other pacific locations and was inadvently released in California after world war II, in Hawaii, and later in north maimi florida in the 1970s. also, due to its large size, its slime and fecal material create a nuisance as does the odour that occurs when something like poison bait causes large numbers to die. The U.S has made considerable effort to eradicate Achatina. The U.S. department of Agriculture (USDA) has banned the importation and possession of live giant Africa snails. However, they are still sought after as pets due to the vibrant “tiger stripes on their shells.</p> <p>Many who are into snail farming in Nigeria are also unwilling to let others know about the farming methodology. The techniques are often shrouded in secrecy. Nigeria economic recovery and programmes have necessitated a radical shift from total dependent on government for jobs to self employment in snail rearing. It is a great money-spinning business that can provide a substantial source of protein to complement Nigerian carbohydrate meals.</p> <p>Snail is an important source of protein, snail also plays an important role in folk medicine irrespective of snail considerable high potentials, local snails production has failed to meet the country demand is for higher than the supply (kehinde 2004).</p> <p>Considering the high prospect in the industry the provision of protein through snails availability and creating employment for the producers and marketers, people are therefore advised and encourage to go into snail farming. Hence the question seemed to arise.</p> <p>How profitable is the snail production as a snail and medium scale enterprise. What are the factors or constraints is removed so that snail farmers livelihood can be improved which will turn as an improvement on agricultural production of the nation.</p> <p>1.    <strong>OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Snail farming is not a new concept. From the pre-historic age, human has been consuming snail meat because of its high rate of protein, iron, low fat and including almost all the amino acid which is needed for human body. Snail farming has many kinds of benefits in the recent years. Snail farming increasing day to day and turns into a large scale small voltage industry because of its real economic value, for the purpose of this research work the following are the objectives of the study:</p> <p>1.    Examine the socio-economic characteristic of snail producers in Uhunmwode L. G. A  in Edo state/Nigeria</p> <p>2.    Identify the production system adopted by snail farmers in Uhunmwode L.G.A in Edo state, Nigeria.</p> <p>3.    To develop a resilient programme that links agriculture with industry and commerce.</p> <p>4.     Examine the determinant of revenue accruing to snail production in the area.</p> <p>5.    Determine the cost and returns to snails production and determine it viability.</p> <p>6.    To develop human capacities for the empowerment of individuals and groups.</p> <p>7.    Identify the constraints of snail production in the study area.</p> <p>8.    <strong>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>SCOPE</strong></p> <p>In an attempt to carry out this research work on the economic analysis of snail production in Uhunmwode local Government Area in Edo State, I have decided to know the extent at which snail production or snail farming will undertake or undergo in the economic aspect of Uhunmwode community.</p> <p>Uhunmwode is a Local Government Area of Edo State, Nigeria. Its heads quarter is in the town of Ehor.</p> <p>It has an area of 2,033;Km2 and a population of 120,813 at the 2006 census (NIPOST, 2009).</p> <p>With her population the community can be said to account t for a significant quantity of farm produce that come out of Uhunmwode Local Government Area.</p> <p>Snail farming in Uhunmwode community have not yet be taking edge in the production processes but with my research work carried out concerning snail production in Uhunmwode community can pick up the snail business and use  it in developing their community internally,</p> <p>Snail is hermaphrodite animal and snail is a good healthy proteinous food compare to other meats. Snail is very easy to rear compare to other animals, it does not bite, kick, sting or harm and they don’t mess up the environment.</p> <p>The reproductive organ in snail are in both the male and female, although two snail have to mate in order to fertilize their eggs, so this has show that the Uhunmwode community need not much revenue to start up the business of snail farming in the community.</p> <p>As much, I the researcher hope to gather information that will be useful for this research topic and the above zone would represent the whole Edo State in Nigeria.</p> <p>1.    <strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS/ TERMINOLOGY </strong></p> <p>2.    ECONOMIC: Economics is the social science that seeks to describe the factors which determine the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services.</p> <p>3.    ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: this measures the social and economic outcomes of an initiative.</p> <p>4.    WHAT IS SNAIL: Snail is a hermaphrodites or a creeping animal.</p> <p>5.    PRODUCTION: it is the transformation of raw materials into finished goods and the provision and distribution of goods and services in order to satisfy the final consumer.</p> <p>6.    SNAIL PRODUCTION: This is the process of farming or raising snails.

class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0      INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Environmental degradation has become important global issues since the 1970s, when the world countries and international community became aware of the negative consequences of over-exploitation of the human environment. Environmental degradation in most rural areas in Nigeria has increased over the years and both human activities and natural disasters have contributed to this problem (Titiola 1998; Girigiri 2000).</p> <p>Prominent environmental degradation found in most rural communities include - deforestation, loss of biodiversity, loss of soil fertility, leaching of the soil, land degradation, land and water pollution, desertification, flood, drought, and erosions. The oil companies have been blamed as the perpetrators of environmental degradation in this region due to overexploitation of the crude oil deposits and gas flaring. Be it as it may, complete evaluation of environmental degradation should consider the part other factors such as poverty and inefficient resource use in agriculture have played in limiting achievement of effective environmental protection and management in poverty prone communities.</p> <p>The environment affects our health in a variety of ways. The interaction between human health and the environment has been extensively studied and environmental risks have been proven to significantly impact human health, either directly by exposing people to harmful agents, or indirectly, by disrupting life-sustaining ecosystems (Remoundou and Koundouri, 2009).</p> <p>Environmental degradation is the deterioration of the environment through depletion of natural resources such as air, water and soil; the destruction of ecosystems and the extinction of wildlife. It is any change or disturbance to the environment perceived to be deleterious or undesirable. Environmental degradation is one of the Ten Threats officially cautioned by the High Level Threat Panel of the United Nations. The United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reductiondefines environmental degradation as “The reduction of the capacity of the environment to meet social and ecological objectives, and needs”.</p> <p>The primary cause of environmental degradation is human disturbance. The degree of the environmental impact varies with the cause, the habitat, and the plants and animals that inhabit it. Humans and their activities are a major source of environmental degradation. Worldwide the greatest effects on the health of individuals and populations result from environmental degradation and social injustice. The two operate in consort.</p> <p>(Martin Donohoe, 2003). Causes include overpopulation, air and water pollution, deforestation, global warming, unsustainable agricultural and fishing practices, overconsumption (affluenza) misdistribution of wealth, the rise of the corporation, the Third World debt crisis, and militarization and wars.</p> <p>Mining is also a destructive development activity where ecology suffers at the altar of economy. Scientific mining operations accompanied by ecological restoration and regeneration of mined wastelands and judicious use of geological resources, with search for eco-friendly substitutes and alternatives must provide sensational revelation to the impact of mining on human ecosystem (Singh and Chauhan, 2010).</p> <p><strong>1.2   STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>         Environmental degradation is the gradual depletion of the environment that is capable of damaging a whole lot of things including animals and farmland and farm produce. The problem of environmental degradation on agricultural productivity could be that the knowledge or idea on how to go about the control of this natural disaster that tends to destroy agricultural produce. Finally, several researches have been carried out on the environmental degradation but not even a single research has been carried out on the effect of environmental degradation on agricultural productivity in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.3   AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>         The main aim of the study is to determine the effect of environmental degradation on agricultural productivity in Nigeria. Other specific objectives of the study include:</p> <p>1.          to determine the extent to which environmental degradation affects agricultural productivity in Nigeria.</p> <p>2.          to determine the factors affecting environmental degradation.</p> <p>3.          to determine the economic importance of environmental degradation on agricultural produce.</p> <p>4.          to proffer possible solutions to the problems.</p> <p><strong>1.4   RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>1.          What is the extent to which environmental degradation affects agricultural productivity in Nigeria?</p> <p>2.          What are the factors affecting environmental degradation?</p> <p>3.          What is the economic importance of environmental degradation on agricultural produce?</p> <p>4.          What are the possible solutions to the problems?</p> <p><strong>1.5   STATEMENT OF RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p>H0:    Environmental degradation has no significant effect on agricultural productivity in Nigeria.</p> <p>H1:        Environmental degradation has a significant effect on agricultural productivity in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6   SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study on the effect of environmental degradation on agricultural production will be of immense benefit to the entire farmers in Nigeria in the sense that it will enable private individuals and the government to take preventive measures to the havoc environmental degradation might bring to the farm produce. Finally, the study will contribute to the body of existing literature and knowledge to this field of studies and basis for further research.</p> <p><strong>1.7   SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>         The study on the effect of environmental degradation on agricultural productivity is limited to subsistence and commercial faming in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.8   LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p><strong>Financial constraint</strong>- Insufficient fund tends to impede the efficiency of the researcher in sourcing for the relevant materials, literature or information and in the process of data collection (internet, questionnaire and interview).</p> <p><strong>Time constraint</strong>- The researcher will simultaneously engage in this study with other academic work. This consequently will cut down on the time devoted for the research work.</p> <p><strong>1.9   DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Effect</strong>a change which is a result or consequence of an action or other cause.</p> <p><strong>Environmental Degradation</strong>This is the deterioration of the environment through depletion of resources such as air, water and soil; the destruction of ecosystems; habitat destruction; the extinction of wildlife; and pollution.</p> <p><strong>Agricultural Productivity</strong> is measured as the ratio of <em>agricultural</em> outputs to <em>agricultural</em> inputs.</p>                                                         \n\nEFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY IN NIGERIA", "id": 27}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT </p> <p>Modern form of Co-operative leaves their origin in the tension and opportunities created by industrialization and urbanization in the nineteenth Century in Europe. Much of the early interested in co-operative structure seemed from deep regards to the social consequence of industrial capitalism, critics of the new order not simply a framework for business organisation but also as a vehicle for the reutilization of radical social and political goals. However, much concepts of c-operative have been erased the claims of earlier social prophets, a residual belief remains that co-operators are motivated by group interest as well as self interest, and that non-economic as well as economic  objectives may be pursued.  Other of these propositions present difficulties through not inseparable one’s in terms of applying economic analysis to the study of applying economic analysis to the study of Co-operatives, it is pertinently imperative and a restrictive device of immense capacity that co-operative organizations have paid the way for the new economic and social order not only for those, ‘depressed’ in the economy who (mostly of less privileged) are at the receiving end, the logical and social justice, which they embody, but in our ability to translate them concretely and realistically from social theory into social fact and to make them effective in our daily live. We must always remember that co-operative are organizations of by and for members therefore they are designed to respond to the needs of members. Agricultural Co-operative has created for the economic charge, for increasing in food produce, for building a better or a more just and equitable society.  They serve to give individuals through voluntary co-operation and mutual assistance, control or bit of their destiny to make people in some way asters of their own fate, subjects and not objects of their history.  Co-operatives are of course pragmatic institution noted in reality of concerts goals.</p><p> TABLE OF CONTENTS <strong>CHAPTER   ONE</strong> </p> <p>1.0   Introduction</p> <p>1.1    Background of the Study</p> <p>1.2    Statement of the Problems</p> <p>1.3    Objectives of the Study</p> <p>1.4    Research Questions</p> <p>1.5    Significance of the Study</p> <p>1.6    Limitations of the study</p> <p>1.7    Definition of Terms</p><p> <strong>CHAPTER   TWO</strong> </p> <p>2.1    The role of Agricultural Co-operative Organization</p> <p>2.2    Farming Systems/Agricultural System</p> <p>2.3    The Importance of Agricultural Co-operative</p> <p>2.4    Problems of Agricultural Co-operative</p> <p>2.5    Market of Produce</p> <p>2.6    Brief History of Destiny Broilers</p><p> <strong>CHAPTER   THREE</strong> </p> <p>3.0    Research Design and Methodology</p> <p>3.1    Area of Study</p> <p>3.2    Population and Sample</p> <p>3.3    Source of Data</p> <p>3.4    Instrument for Data Collection</p> <p>3.5    Data Collection Procedure</p> <p>3.6    Method of Data Analysis</p><p> <strong>CHAPTER   FOUR</strong> </p> <p>4.0    Presentation, Analysis and Interpretation of Data</p> <p>4.1    Presentations of Data</p><p> <strong>CHAPTER   FIVE</strong> </p> <p>5.0    Summary of Findings, Recommendation and Conclusion</p> <p>5.1    Summary of Findings</p> <p>5.2    Recommendations</p> <p>5.2    Conclusions</p> <p>Bibliography</p> <p>Questionnaire</p> <p>Appendix</p><p> CHAPTER   ONE </p> <p>1.0    <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1    <strong>BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>Agriculture, from the beginning of time, the first concern of man has been food clothing and shelter in that order.  Agriculture being one of the oldest industries, its origin can be traced to the earliest human societies.  The existence of man from the prehistoric era up to the era ancient civilization depended on the ability of the individual to hunt and gather food for consumption.  Food was, however the basic source of life which provided him energy in his wondering and constant struggle for survival.  However, with the realization that food was basic need for survival, efforts were made by early man to cultivate crops.</p> <p>In spite of the limitations which agriculture is facing, it still remained the most important sector of the world economy.</p> <p>Agriculture is a basic industry that supports all industries and all aspects of needs can justify from its role and contributions to nation building.   Between 75 – 80% of working population in rural areas engage in agriculture production (farming).  Some are provide jobs in the industries e.g. textile industry, Breweries and shoe industry. Agriculture aids in rural development, with the location of industries that utilize agricultural produce in an area other investors go to rural areas to set up factories trade and operate business centers people are employed and paid to earn their living. Agricultural provides industrial raw material, textile mills required cotton, and plastic industries use rubber/latex.</p> <p>Agricultural involves operational clearing of the land and the breaking-up of surface soil, the sowing for seeds, the removal of the weeds from the farm, the harvesting and storage of crops which are disposed of by marketing and the breeding and rearing of animals.  All these Co-operatives can do in a number of different, which involve amounts of labour, time, expense and productivity.  Agricultural education is an area in agriculture that a concern with helping people to develop a desire to learn and teach agriculture.  This is a change of behaviour towards agricultural practices.</p> <p>1.2    <strong>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Agricultural co-operatives are greatly involved in food production so as to improve the social and economic life of the members and the country as a whole.</p> <p>In spite of these, agricultural co-operative are still experience low food production owning to some distributing factors.</p> <p>1.     High financial commitment in the formation of the agricultural co-operative of different size and types.</p> <p>2.     Members neglecting their obligations, participating in-group farm work in the farmland weeding, planting, harvesting and marketing of farm produce.</p> <p>3.     Procurement of farm inputs like high yielding seeds, stem and seeding, agro-chemical disinfectants and fertilizer.</p> <p>4.     Problems of marketing of produce and efficiently distribution and returns to inputs utilized.</p> <p>1.3    <strong>OBJECTIVE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>In food production the study is aimed all examining the role of Agriculture Co-operative food production so as to benefit members and the society at large .  The purposes of this study are:</p> <p>i.      To identify the factor that can cause low food production in agriculture co-operative in (Enugu) south.</p> <p>ii.      To investigate whether problem identified are associated with the agriculture co-operative society.</p> <p>iii.     To investigate the farms of supports and incentives provided by the government to the agriculture co-operatives if there are any.</p> <p>iv.     To find out the ways and methods that can be used in solving the problems of low food productivity.</p> <p>1.4    <strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>To achieve the purpose or objectives of this study the following research questions were formulated.</p> <p>i.      What are the causes of the low food production among agriculture co-operative in Enugu South Local Government Area?</p> <p>ii.      To what extent are the problem identified applied or associated with the agriculture co-operative societies being studied?</p> <p>iii.     Do agricultural co-operative receive incentives from the government?</p> <p>iv.     What form does the incentives from government take?</p> <p>v.     What are the ways/methods that can afford possible solutions to the problems of low food production?</p> <p>1.5    <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The findings of this research work will enable the society to know what to do in order to improve or enhance the economic activities of the society.  This research work will equally help the Federal government whose set objective is to use co-operative in rural development and increasing the production capacity of the country.</p> <p>The producer of agricultural products will also benefit because their effective production will be assured through the effective and efficient management of the agricultural co-operatives in food production and there will be an increase in food supply and production in the country thereby leading to a fall in price of goods.  When this is achieved, the consumers and the general public will benefit.</p> <p><strong>1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>1.     <strong>ENTERPRISE</strong></p> <p>This is institution of businesses that perform

Hence, the well known slogan “self help through mutual help” by cooperators.</p> <p>However, cooperatives in Onitsha north are yet to make the desired impact on the communities, there is then the need for an effective management  system that will help direct the activities of the cooperatives towards achieving their objectives, thereby endeavour to examine the extent to which poor management system retards the growth of the farmers cooperative societies in Onitsha north.</p> <p>The viability of any cooperative society depends on the finance, educational competence and managerial skills of executives and cooperation of all the cooperatives. Therefore poor management have being the brain behind the low productivity and poor generation of revenue of some of the societies in Onitsha north local government area.</p> <p>The importance of good management of farmers cooperative societies cannot be over emphasized, a good management capitalizes on the economic and social needs satisfaction of its members since when individual joins an organization, they often hope to achieve a personal goal but this cannot be possible without achieving organizational goals. Unfortunately, there is bifurcation i.e division of interest among members and executives. They lack effective management skill and most of them have never had the opportunity to attend seminars, workshop and symposium on management cooperatives societies.</p> <p>Furthermore, farmers cooperatives society in Onitsha north lack good organizational structure. The principle of democracy in cooperative organization has rendered it playing toy and it has become perpetually unproductive as members with less investment in the cooperative often close their eyes to the risk of poor management strategies in a competitive economy like ours.</p> <p>It is worthy to point that the researcher’s attempt to formulae strategies geared towards the successful implementation of the cooperative goals and objectives.</p> <p><strong>1.2    OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY              </strong></p> <p>The general objectives of this study is to scientifically and critically highlight managerial problems which affects the efficient functions of farmers cooperative society.</p> <p>Specifically the objectives of the study includes</p> <p>i.     analyzing how these management problems abort the well being of members of the cooperative.</p> <p>ii.    How best these problems could be successfully eliminated.</p> <p>iii.  The objectives is also o analyze how members react to these problems.</p> <p>iv.  Finally, this project is aimed at identifying how lack of education contributes negatively on the managerial problems of farmers cooperative society.</p> <p><strong>1.3    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>The study is intended to investigate the major management problems and solutions of farmers cooperative societies in Onitsha north local government area of Anambra state.</p> <p>It is interesting observed that cooperative societies have laudable objectives which they set for themselves but these objectives are never achieved because of the management problems facing them, such as inadequate funding by members, poor and ineffective management of the societies and not having enough members.</p> <p><strong>1.4    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY     </strong></p> <p>The research work is mainly for academic purpose, the reliability of many cooperative societies and the liquidation of some of them suggests that something is wrong, perhaps with their management system.</p> <p>Therefore, it is the objectives of the researcher to find out some of the causes of these problems and suggest ways to bring about  a lasting improvement to farmers cooperative societies.</p> <p>The researcher would look into the problems militating against the effective management of farmers cooperative societies in Onitsha north.</p> <p><strong>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTION   </strong></p> <p>The following research question will be aimed at finding answer to this study.</p> <p>1.   Do unavailability of finance constitute a problem to the effective management of farmers cooperative society?</p> <p>2.   Do lack of committees in decision making constitute a problem of the effective management of farmers cooperative society?</p> <p>3.   Do lack of trained staff constitute a problem to the effective management of farmers cooperative society?</p> <p><strong>1.6    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY          </strong></p> <p>This study is meant to aid cooperators gain more knowledge of what is expected of them for the success of the cooperative enterprise by:</p> <p>1.   Determine some of the basic management flaws that are encountered by farmers cooperative societies in Onitshan north local government area.</p> <p>2.   Determine the extent to which their problems constitute a hindrance to the efficiency of the societies.</p> <p>3.   Seeking avenues through which such problems can be minimized.</p> <p>4.   Finally based on the findings of the study, recommendations shows that the inefficiency of management should be rectified for the realization of the societies objectives.</p> <p>This study also wants to ameliorate the bottleneck preventing farmers in cooperative from realizing the benefits of large scale production, marketing and credit facilities. Other benefits of the study includes:</p> <p>1.   The enlightenment of cooperators on the need to be properly committed to the cooperative movement. This will help to make cooperators understand what is expected of them in cooperation and how to cooperate for effectiveness.</p> <p>2.   It is envisaged that cooperative organizers will gain more insight on how to organize and manage the farmers cooperative societies more profitable after going through their report.</p> <p>The government will come to see the need to have well trained cooperative leaders to champion the affairs of farmers cooperative societies. They will also be more willing to remove the administrative bottlenecks that militate loan disbursement to farmers cooperative societies. This will come about when the suggestion of this research is implemented</p> <p><strong>1.8    DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>1.     <strong>Cooperative Society</strong>: This is an association of persons who join together either formally or informally adhoc or permanent basis for legal or illegal or socially accepted or unaccepted actions to fulfill certain aims (Obodoechi, 2011).</p> <p>2.     <strong>Farmers Cooperative Societies</strong>: It is a cooperative society that is made up of only farmers to cater for the need of its members.</p> <p>3.     <strong>Farmers Multi-purpose Cooperative Society</strong>: This is cooperative society that performs more than one function e.g food production and marketing.</p> <p>4.     <strong>Identification</strong>: In relation to this research it shows certain phenomenon that are detrimental to the management of cooperative.</p> <p>5.     <strong>Management</strong>: It is act of planning, organizing, staffing, directing, controlling and budgeting in a farmers cooperative society so as to realize its objectives.</p> <p>6.     <strong>Problems</strong>: This refers to those objectives and concerns that affect the performance of the management of the society.</p> <p>7.     <strong>Trained Staff</strong>: This refers to anybody who has undergone professional training in any cooperative institution.</p>                                                           \n\nIDENTIFICATION AND SOLUTION OF MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS OF FARMERS MULTI-PURPOSE COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IDENTIFICATION AND SOLUTION OF MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS OF FARMERS MULTI-PURPOSE COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES", "id": 29}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background to the study</strong></p> <p>Cassava was introduced into Central Africa from South America in the 16th century by the early Portuguese Explorers (Ohadike, 2007). It was probably the incapacitated slaves who introduced the cassava crop into southern Nigeria as they returned to the country from South America. Cassava however, did not gain importance in the country until the end of the nineteenth century when processing techniques were introduced as many slaves returned home (Odoemenem and Otanwa, 2011). In Nigeria, cassava is grown in all the ecologicalzones; the crop is planted all year round depending on the availability of moisture (Odoemenem and Otanwa, 2011).</p> <p>Cassava is an important staple food in several tropical African countries, especially in Nigeria where it plays a principal role in the food economy (Agwu and Anyaeche, 2009). Cassava has the ability to grow on marginal lands, especially in drought-prone conditions and in low-fertility acid soils, where cereals and other crops do not thrive (Gobeze et al., 2005 as cited in Obayelu, <em>et al., </em>2013). Cassava roots can also be stored in the ground (while still intact on the growing plant) for up to 24 months or more, so harvest may be delayed until market, processing or other conditions are favourable (International Institute for Tropical Agriculture, 2009). This comparative advantage over other staples serves to encourage its cultivation especially by resource-poor farmers. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization Statistics (FAOSTAT, 2011), Nigeria is the world’s largest producer of cassava with about 37 million metric tonnes and it ranks second after yam in extent of production among the root and tuber crops of economic value in Nigeria.</p> <p>Benue State is a leading producer of cassava in Nigeria (Benue State Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, 2003). Apart from the ecological support for cassava growth and production, Benue State has mounted deliberate strategies such as distribution of improved cassava varieties to sustain its leading role in cassava production in the country (BMANR, 2003). Cassava is a very versatile crop with numerous uses and by-products. Each component of the plant can be valuable to its cultivator. The leaves may be consumed as a vegetable, or cooked as a soup ingredient or dried and fed to livestock as a protein feed supplement. The stem is used for plant propagation andgrafting. The roots are typically processed for human and industrial consumption. Cassava is traditionally consumed by processing the fresh roots into <em>garri, fufu, </em>and <em>flour </em>(Adebayo <em>et al</em>., 2003a; Adebayo <em>et al.</em>, 2003b). Data from the Collaborative Study of Cassava in Africa (COSCA) show that 80% of Nigerians in rural areas eat a cassava meal at least once weekly (Nweke <em>et al</em>., 2002).</p> <p><strong>1.2 Problem Statement</strong></p> <p>The problem of declining crop productivity in Nigeria is important (FACU, 1992; FDA, 1993 and 1995, as cited in Ukoha <em>et al., </em>2010). The agricultural problem in Nigeria relates to the inefficiency with which farmers use resources on the farms (Bamidele <em>et al., </em>2008). It also borders on how the various factors that explain farm efficiency could be determined through research so as to improve cassava production in the country (Bamidele <em>et al., </em>2008). Farmers’ output must therefore be expanded with existing levels of conventional inputs and technology to meet the increasing demand for cassava.</p> <p>Cassava farmers in Nigeria are small-holders characterized by very low level of productivity (Bamidele <em>et al., </em>2008). These smallholder and traditional farmers who use rudimentary production techniques, with resultant low yields, cultivate most of this land. They are also constrained by many problems including poor access to markets, land and environmental degradation and inadequate research and extension services (Manyong <em>et al., </em>2005).</p> <p>Simonyan <em>et al</em>. (2010), as cited in Nandi <em>et al. </em>(2011) stated that Nigerians are poor and hungry despite efforts made by various governments in improving agricultural productivity and efficiency of the rural farmers who are the major stakeholders of agricultural production. Given the various government programmes such as the National Accelerated Food Production Programme (NAFPP), Operation Feed the Nation (OFN), the Agricultural Development Projects (ADPs), Cassava Multiplication Programme (CMP), and Root and Tuber Crop Expansion Program (RTEP), implemented over the years to raise farmers’ efficiency and productivity in cassava farming, productivity for cassava is still low. For example, the actual yield of cassava ranges between 8 and 15 tonnes per hectare, compared to a potential yield of 30 tonnes per hectare – a yield gap of 275 and 100 percent respectively (FAO, 2011 as cited in IITA, 2015). And also, given the increasing interest of more nations in buying cassava products from Nigeria, the prospects for enhanced foreign exchange is becoming high (Ogisi and Alimeke, 2013). It then becomes necessary to economically analyze the profitability and resource-use efficiency of cassava farmers. This study seeks to find answers to the following research questions:</p> <p>i. What are the socio-economic characteristics of cassava farmers in the study area?</p> <p>ii. What are the costs and returns for cassava farming in the study area?</p> <p>iii. What is the technical relationship between inputs and output in cassava farming in the study area?</p> <p>iv. How efficiently are resources used by cassava farmers in the study area?</p> <p>v. What is the relationship between cassava farmers’ socio-economic characteristics and their output?</p> <p>vi. What are the elasticities of production and returns to scale for cassava farming in the study area?</p> <p>vii. What are the major constraints faced by cassava farmers in the study area? </p>                                                         \n\nANALYSIS OF PROFITABILITY AND RESOURCE USE EFFICIENCY IN CASSAVA FARMING<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ANALYSIS OF PROFITABILITY AND RESOURCE USE EFFICIENCY IN CASSAVA FARMING", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong></p> <p>Nigeria has substantial economic potential in its‟ agricultural sector. However, despite the importance of agriculture in terms of employment creation, its potential for contributing to economic growth is far from being fully exploited (USAID, 2005). The agricultural sector has been the mainstay of Nigeria‟s economy employing 70% of the active labour force and contributes significantly to the country‟s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and foreign earnings. In 1960, 1970, and 1980, it contributed 55.2%, 40.7% and 18% to GDP respectively, while its contribution to GDP in 1996, 1997, and 1999 stood at 39.0%, 39.4% and 40.4% respectively (NPC and UNDP, 1999). In 2010 agricultural contribution to GDP stood at 30.0%, while currently as at first quarter of 2012, it is contributing 34.4% to the GDP (NBS, 2012). However, there have been recorded decline in agricultural contribution to the national economic growth for over three decades now since emergence of the oil sector. This decline could be associated with the gross neglect of the agricultural sector and over dependence on the oil sector (Ugwu and Kanu, 2012).</p> <p>The agricultural sector had been constrained with factors such as poor rural infrastructure, poor fertilizer distributions and high cost of farm inputs that could have enhance its production capacity and contribution to the national economy. The oil-boom era had lead to importation of food items in massive scale at the expense of locally produced ones because the rural farmers do not have the technological resources to compete in international market. This discourages the farmers from producing much because they no longer realized the needed profit from their effort (Ogunwole, 2004). The goal of increasing food production and reducing food import has elicited many programmes and policies at the various levels of government (Kudi <em>et al</em>., 2008). In order to revamp the agricultural sector, the Federal Government of Nigeria had embarked on and implemented several agricultural policies and programmes some of which are defunct or abandoned, and some restructured, while others are still in place. Presidential initiatives on cassava production and a number of new programme interventionsare currently implemented to increase area of cassava production, processing and marketing across the country.</p> <p>Cassava is one of the most widely cultivated crops in the country. It is generally cultivated on small-holdings in association with crops such as maize, groundnut, cowpea, plantation (such as coffee, coconut and oil palm), vegetables and cocoyam depending on the agro-ecological zone and relies on residual soil nutrients when intercropped with maize which has been fertilized or as following crop in rotation with legumes (IITA, 2004; Chukwuji, 2008). Cassava is grown mainly on impoverished soils with no soil amendments such as fertilizers. Continuous cropping of cassava particularly the high yielding varieties without adequate maintenance of soil fertility could lead to soil and environmental degradation (IITA, 2004). Nigeria is the largest producer of cassava in the World. Its production is currently put at about thirty-four (34) million metric tonnes a year (FAO, 2002).</p> <p>Nigeria‟s cassava production was targeted at forty (40) million tonnes in 2005 and sixty (60) million tonnes by 2020 (IITA, 2002). The presidential Initiative on Cassava Production and Export has increased the awareness amongst Nigerians of the industrial crop, popularly referred to as the „new black gold‟. According to Nweke <em>et al. </em>(2002)cassava performs five main roles namely: famine reserve crop, rural food staple, cash crop, industrial raw material and earning of foreign exchange. Uses of cassava products are enormous. Virtually, the whole plant from the leaves, stem and the roots has one use or the other. Daneji (2011) posited that, cassava is one of the most staple food crops in many households in Nigeria. The fresh peeled cassava roots are eaten raw, boiled or roasted. They can also be boiled and pounded to obtain \"pounded fufu\". This is most popular in the Eastern part of Nigeria. The processed cassava, either in the form of flour, wet pulp or “<em>garri</em>” is cooked or eaten in three main food forms: \"<em>fufu</em>\", \"<em>eba</em>\" and \"<em>chickwangue</em>\" (Adebile, 2012). Cassava leaves are rich in protein, calcium, iron and vitamins, comparing favourably with other green vegetables generally regarded as good protein sources. Cassava can be processed into several other products like chips, flour, pellets, adhesives, alcohol, starch, etc which are raw materials in livestock feed, alcohol/ethanol, textiles, confectionery, wood, food and soft drink industries (Iheke, 2008).</p> <p>In a similar vein, Adebayo (2009) stated that processing the bulky, perishable crop is an obstacle to its full commercialization in sub-Saharan Africa. To motivate farmers, especially women who are the main processors of food in the village, to grow and process their cassava, we need to provide them with labour-saving implements such as graters, peelers, and crushers. There is also need to link them to markets. Cassava roots are bulky and with about 70.0% moisture content, are very perishable. It is therefore, expensive to transport cassava especially along poor access roads. Therefore, a well-developed market access infrastructure is crucial for cassava marketing (Adeniji <em>et al</em>., 2006). However, focus should not be on the exportation of cassava but to develop the enormous local and regional markets for cassava that exist in the country, West African sub-region and Africa as a whole rather than start exporting the industrial raw material to Europe. According to Food and Agriculture Organization Statistics (2008) Nigeria‟s cassava export in 2005, was 2,100 tonnes compared to the leading exporter, Thailand, with 4,384,350 tonnes. The performance evaluation of marketing component of cassava initiative include, establishment of cassava processing centers in each Local Government Area(LGA) of the cassava producing States (Yisa, 2009). In this regard, rural people are encouraged to add value to cassava products by processing it for industrial application and human consumption. Processing of cassava into various shelf-stable and semi-stable products is a widespread activity in Nigeria carried out by traditional cassava processors and small-scale commercial processing units (Henk <em>et al</em>., 2007).</p> <p><strong>1.2 Problem Statement</strong></p> <p>Nigeria has a huge agricultural resource endowment and yet the population is facing hunger and poverty. The agricultural sector is facing the problem of sustaining food production to meet up the need of increasing population in the country (Okolo, 2004; Ironkwe, 2005). Various governments in Nigeria have consistently declared policies aiming at self-sufficiency in food. The means toward achieving this objective has always been an expansion in cultivated area and improvement on the yield. Cassava is one of the major staple crops grown in Kogi State particularly in the study area. Government intervention programmes and policies, and the efforts of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in support of production, processing and marketing of cassava date back to the 1970s (Adeniji <em>et al</em>., 2006).</p> <p>Some of the Government agricultural intervention programmes and policies aimed at increasing agricultural production especially cassava production include the Farm Settlement Scheme, National Accelerated Food Production Programme (NAFPP), Agricultural Development Projects (ADPs), River Basin Development Authorities (RBDAs), National Seed Service (NSS), National Centre for Agricultural 5</p> <p>Mechanization (NCAM), Agricultural and Rural Management Training Institute (ARMTI) and Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund (ACGSF). Others were the Nigerian Agricultural Cooperative and Rural Development Bank (NACRDB), Agricultural Banks, Operation Feed the Nation (OFN), Green Revolution (GR), Directorate of Foods, Roads and Rural Infrastructure (DFFRI), Nigerian Agricultural Insurance Company (NAIC), National Agricultural Land Development Authority (NALDA) and Specialized Universities for Agriculture.</p> <p>Agricultural Development Projects (ADPs) is an integrated approach which came into being as a result of the failure of special crop programmes to achieve rural development and food security objectives of government in Nigeria. As intervention strategies, these programmes have been designed to increase productivity in cassava sub-sector, as well as enhancing farmers‟ income from agriculture (Yisa, 2009). The NGOs efforts include Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development Project (SARDP), Rural Poverty Eradication Project (RPEP), Cassava Enterprise Development Project (CEDP) and others. All these programmes and policies due to one reason or the other have failed to meet the objective of self-sufficiency in food production.</p> <p>A number of new initiatives are also currently being implemented to increase area of cultivation, yields, processing and marketing of cassava products in the country. These include the presidential initiatives on cassava production, the National Special Programme for Food Security (NSPFS), Root and Tuber Expansion Programme (RTEP) and Rural Banking Scheme (Ugwu and Kanu, 2012). The Root and Tuber Expansion Programme (RTEP) was formulated between 1995 and 1997 to consolidate the gains made under the Cassava Multiplication Project (CMP) of ADP in order to enhance national food self-sufficiency and improve rural household food security and income of poor farmers within the southern and middle belt States of the country.</p> <p>At the expiration of the Root and Tuber Expansion Programme time-frame in 2007, the Kogi State Agricultural Development Projects (KADP) formulated an intervention programme in Okehi LGA termed Survival Farming Intervention Programme (SFIP) with the aim of enhancing cassava production, adding value to cassava products through processing and creating markets for the processed products especially “<em>garri</em>” which are packaged into various categories for sales, though, other finish products of cassava such as starch, flour, pellet and chips are also still under consideration. The programme was in later years expanded to include other LGAs.</p> <p>The SFIP was formulated in October, 2007 with the major objective centered on improving cassava production through the provision of planting materials and other inputs, processing and packaging, and marketing along the value-chain approach to improve the production capacity of the cassava stakeholders and their level of living. The main thrust of the survival farming intervention programme is on the development of cassava processing industry that converts fresh cassava root tubers into primary cassava-based commodities that are tradable in domestic and international markets. The long-term objective is to commercialize cassava production in order to improve the income, food security and living conditions of small-holder households in Kogi State. So far, huge amount of money and human resources have been expended on the programme.</p> <p>However, since the inception of the programme, no studies have been conducted to assess its impact on the target population. This constitutes a gap in knowledge that need to be filled making this study very imperative. Moreover, according to Delta State Ministry of Agriculture (2004) research findings show that one of the reasons for failure of past government sponsored agricultural development programmes was lack of data base for policy formulation, programme implementation, monitoring and impact evaluation. The study further states that without adequate evaluation, one cannot be sure whether the objectives of a programme have been achieved or not. It was against the backdrop of the aforementioned reasons that this study was conceived to assess the impact of the Kogi Agricultural Development Project Survival Farming Intervention Programme in Adavi, Okehi and Okene Local Government Areas of Kogi State. The study, therefore, provides answer to the following research questions:</p> <p>i. What are the socio-economic characteristics of the programme participants and non-participants in the study area?</p> <p>ii. What is the level of awareness of survival farming intervention programme components?</p> <p>iii. What are the factors influencing participation of respondents in survival farming intervention programme on cassava production in the study area?</p> <p>iv. What is the impact of survival farming intervention programme on cassava production of the participants and non-participants in the study area?</p> <p>v. What is the impact of survival farming intervention programme on income and level of living of the participants and non-participants in the study area?</p> <p>vi. What are the constraints to effective implementation of survival farming intervention programme in the study area?</p>                                                         \n\nIMPACT OF SURVIVAL FARMING INTERVENTION PROGRAMME ON CASSAVA PRODUCTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " IMPACT OF SURVIVAL FARMING INTERVENTION PROGRAMME ON CASSAVA PRODUCTION", "id": 31}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Broiler production is carried out under different production systems and different production systems imply variations in cost of inputs and</p> <p>returns.

GDP was used as a proxy to economic growth, while interest rate, and government re-current and capital expenditure on agriculture were used as indicators of agricultural policies. From the findings; Re-current expenditure on agriculture and GDP are positively related, government capital expenditure on agriculture and interest rate and GDP was negatively related. It was found that a negative relationship exist between agricultural policies and the economic growth in Nigeria. The findings also revealed that the sector still encounter some problems like poor formulation and implementation of policies. Therefore, the study recommends that it is imperative for the country to develop its agricultural sector through sufficient government spending in order to set-up its economic growth. It emphasizes the need to enlighten farmers, improve and provide infrastructures, accord a priority to the sector in budget allocation, enthrone adequate and appropriate extension services, among other measures laid by the government.</p> <p>                                                TABLE OF CONTENTS</p> <p>CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION</p> <p>1.1 Background of Study…………………………………………………………………..1</p> <p>1.2 Statement of Problem…………………………………………………………………..3</p> <p>1.3 Objectives of Study…………………………………………………………………….5</p> <p>1.4 Research Questions…………………………………………………………………….6</p> <p>1.5 Justification of Study…………………………………………………………………..6</p> <p>1.6 Scope of Study………………………………………………………………………....7</p> <p>1.7 Organization of Study………………………………………………………………….7</p> <p>CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE AND THEORETICAL REVIEW </p> <p>2.0       Introduction……………………………………………………………………………8</p> <p>2.1​Conceptual Framework………………………………………………………………..9</p> <p>2.1.1​Agriculture and Economic Growth…………………………………………………..10</p> <p>2.1.2​Agricultural Policies and Programmes in Nigeria……………………………………14</p> <p>2.1.3​Structural Adjustment Program………………………………………………………16</p> <p>2.1.4​The National Agricultural Policy…………………………………………………….19</p> <p>2.1.5​National Economic and Empowerment Development Strategy……………………...19</p> <p>2.1.6​Challenges of Agricultural Policies and Programmes in Nigeria…………………….20</p> <p>2.2​Theoretical Review…………………………………………………………………...22</p> <p>2.3​Empirical Studies…………………………………………………………………….23</p> <p>CHAPTER 3: RESEARCH METHOLOGY</p> <p>3.0​Introduction…………………………………………………………………………..28</p> <p>3.1​Sources and Methods of Data Collection…………………………………………….28</p> <p>3.2​Theoretical Framework ……………………………………………………………...28</p> <p>3.3​Model Specification………………………………………………………………….31</p> <p>3.3.1​Definition of Variables……………………………………………………………….32</p>                                                           \n\nAGRICULTURAL POLICIES AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " AGRICULTURAL POLICIES AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA", "id": 33}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>The study was conducted at Bahi District to assess contribution of paddy production toward annual household income among smallholder paddy producer. The study had three specific objectives, to determine level of paddy production at Bahi district, to determine household income earned from paddy and other sources and to analyse factors affecting paddy production among smallholder producers. Data were collected through interview, observation, focus group discussion and documentary review. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were adopted during data analysis.  Finding from the study showed that average land used in paddy production by smallholder paddy producers is 2.75 acres with an average production of 934.75 Kg of rice per acre in 2014 season. The average annual income earned from paddy production was Tsh 1,980,885 and contributed 34% to annual household income among smallholder paddy producers. Extension services, credit accessibility and use of agricultural inputs were major factors observed to affect paddy production. However, smallholder paddy producers in Bahi have not yet utilized agricultural inputs effectively. Extension services provided were insufficient and paddy production in Bahi depends on rainfall from river Bubu catchment areas to facilitate availability of water for irrigation. Therefore smallholder paddy producers should be empowered to adopt modern production techniques include use of agricultural inputs. Government should hire more extension officers to extend extension services for efficient transfer of production technologies. River Bubu catchment areas and banks should be protected by the government and environmental conservation partners to ensure availability of enough water for irrigations in Bahi.</p>                                                         \n\nPADDY PRODUCTION AS SOURCE OF HOUSEHOLD INCOME<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PADDY PRODUCTION AS SOURCE OF HOUSEHOLD INCOME", "id": 34}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>Climatic change is one of the greatest environmental issues of our time. There is a general consensus among scientists, economists and policy makers that the entire globe is facing a real and serious long term threat from climatic change (Obioha, 2009; Hanseur, Baethgeri, Osgood, Ceceato, et al, 2007).</p> <p>According to Goni et al, (2011), projections by experts suggests that by the end of the 21st century climatic change would have had substantial impact on agricultural production and hence, on the scope for reducing poverty.</p> <p>The inter-governmental panel on climatic change (IGPC, 2007) defined climatic change as statistically significant variations in climate that persist for an extended period, typically decades or longer. It includes shift in the frequency and magnitude of sporadic weather even as well as the slow continuous rise in global mean surface temperature. The main causes are the increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (FAO, 2008).</p> <p>Climatic change is a change in climate that is attributable directly and indirectly to human conditions. It affects atmospheric condition of the earth thereby leading to global warming. According to Raymond and Victoria (2008), climatic change has the potential to affect all natural systems thereby becoming a threat to human development and survival socially, politically and economically. A comprehensive summary by the inter-governmental panel on climatic change in 2007 stated that human actions are very likely the cause of global warming; meaning a 90% or greater probability is attributable to man. Various activities carried out by man have varying contribution to change in climate system. The burning of coal, oil and various agricultural and industrial practices, are altering the composition of the atmosphere and are contributing to climatic change. This human activity leads to increased atmospheric concentration of the number of greenhouse gases which in turn produce greenhouse effect.</p> <p>Climatic change is a major challenge to agricultural development in Africa and the world at large. Africa is more vulnerable because agriculture is predominantly rain fed and hence fundamentally depends on vagaries of weather (Watson, Zintower and Moses, 1987) climatic change affect agriculture in several ways, one of which is its direct impact on food production. Ozor, et al. (2010) stated that almost all sectors in agriculture crop, livestock, pastoralism and fishery depend on weather and climate whose vulnerability have mean that rural farmers who implement their regular annual farm business plans risk total failure due to climatic change implication.</p> <p>The poultry site (2009) reported that poultry production is particularly vulnerable to climatic change because birds can only tolerate narrow temperature ranges. Some of the potential disadvantages of climatic change on poultry include- heat stress in both house and outdoor flocks, reduced egg production and growth rate at higher temperature, higher mortality rate, increase persistence of some endo and ecto parasite, increase in appetite of birds, etc.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Poultry production is becoming the first priority of supply of animals’ protein sources and is an income generating activity. FAO (2010) reported that nowadays, poultry meat represent about 33% of the total global meat production.</p> <p>However, poultry flocks are particularly more vulnerable to climatic change because birds can only tolerate narrow temperature ranges. Studies have shown that the level of performance of birds depends on environmental conditions; which includes temperature, relative humidity, sunshine prevailing at a given time, housing system and ventilation. High temperature and humidity for example have some active effect on poultry. Increase of body temperature, decreases feed consumption and feed efficiency, reduction in life weight, high mortality and decrease in productivity and quality of egg (Ozbey and Oscellic, 2004).</p> <p>Climatic change poses the challenges of both loss of productivity and increase in cost of production. The question at this juncture is are poultry farmers aware and knowledgeable in climatic change threat?</p> <p>This study is designed to provide answers to these question and others, relating to climatic change implication on poultry production in Delta State.</p> <p><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong></p> <p>The broad objective of the study is to investigate climatic change implication on poultry production in Delta State. The specific objectives are to:</p> <p>i.                        Examine the demographic characteristics of poultry farmers in Delta State.</p> <p>    ii.            Assess the level of awareness of the farmers on implication of climatic change</p> <p> iii.            Examine the sources of information on climatic change</p> <p> iv.            Ascertain the implication of climatic change on poultry production</p> <p>    v.            Examine measure adopted by poultry farmers to control the implication on climatic change</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis</strong></p> <p>The following hypotheses were formulated to guide the study:</p> <p>i.                        There is no significant relationship between demographic characteristic and measure taken to control climatic change implications</p> <p>    ii.            Demographic characteristics of poultry farmers have no significant relationship with awareness about climatic change implication</p> <p><strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The poultry sub-sector of the livestock sector is seen as viable sector to boost deficiencies in Nigeria.</p> <p>However, the sector faces some constraints for future development especially the trends from climatic change. This investigation on the implication of climatic change on poultry production will therefore be useful as the findings will be useful tools in enhancing production as guides for policy makers. The result of the findings will assist poultry farmers identify indigenous technologies that could help in adapting to climatic change threats.</p> <p><strong>Limitation of the Study</strong></p> <p>During the course of this research work, I was confronted with some problems which militated against a thorough investigation. Finance was a major constraint as the research mandated my travelling from my location to the study location, also, the procurement of materials for the study was another constraint put forward by lack of finance.</p> <p>Again as an undergraduate student, the work load do not leave much time for a wider research. Finally, there was difficulty in locating materials for the research.</p>                                                         \n\nCLIMATIC CHANGE: IMPLICATION ON POULTRY PRODUCTION<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CLIMATIC CHANGE: IMPLICATION ON POULTRY PRODUCTION", "id": 35}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>Background of study</strong></p> <p>Agriculture is the main stay of the economy of most countries the world over – providing food, employment, income, revenue, improving the countries’ balance of payment etc (Baffour-Awuah, 1987). In 1987, the World Commission on Environment and Development (<strong>WCED</strong>) drew attention to the immersed problems and challenges facing the world’s agriculture, if present and future food needs are to be met for new approach to agriculture development. In the remaining years of this century about 1.3 billion people will be added to the human population. The global food system must be managed to increase food production by 3% to 4% yearly (WCED, 1987).</p> <p>Global food security depends not only on increasing global production but on decreasing distortion in the structure of the world’s food market and on shifting the focus of food production to food deficit countries, regions and households. This shift in agriculture production will be sustainable, enhanced and where it has been diminished/destroyed, restored according to WCED (1987) pg 128-130.</p> <p>By this, agriculture has been placed on a high agenda of governments of Ghana. One of the priorities of the present and past governments is to make Ghana self-sufficient in food production (Addo-Quaye et.al, 1995).</p> <p>Example, the National Redemption Council, NRC, in 1972 introduced the Operation Feed Yourself Policy in order to increase food production (Baffour-Awuah, 1987). Schools were therefore made to establish mess farms to feed the students.</p> <p>However, most agriculture production in the country is subsistence and small scaled with low yields. Even medium and large scale farmers use the common tools like hoe, axe, cutlass etc since most farmers cannot afford mechanization aside the over reliance on rainfall instead of irrigation.</p> <p>In 1987, the government of Ghana initiated a reform in the education programme with wide ranging objectives. Wheeler (1980) commented about reform in education – if a curriculum remains static in a dynamic society especially in a period of rapid social change, it is likely that the education which is meant to induct the young into the society and to promote an intelligent understanding of it will cater only for the needs and values which no longer exist.</p> <p>           According to Awuku et.al (1991), one major means by which Ghana’s agriculture can move from the subsistence to commercial is by intensifying Agricultural Education. Dotse (1994) also said introduction of agriculture into the educational institution are essential components of the curriculum and indicates strongly that policy makers have realized that the problem confronting Ghana Agriculture can partially or if not completely, solved through agriculture education.</p> <p>The study of agricultural science in the Senior High Schools is divided into General Agriculture, Crop Husbandry and Horticulture, Animal Husbandry, Fishery and Forestry. This means that the teacher who teaches the students should prepare the students adequately for the task of positively influencing the student’s attitude, perspectives and habits of mind especially as they affect the theory and practice of agricultural science. The teacher’s approach to the subject can stimulate his students to develop in and subsequently results in good performance.</p> <p>According to Awuku et.al (1991), the performance of the students in agricultural science should match student’s interest and practice of the subject. He further stated that lack of textbooks, poor management, poor funding etc as some of the many factors among others that influence the outcome of the teaching –learning process. It is therefore imperative for all stakeholders in the educational system to ensure that practical agriculture is encouraged in schools to help the nation achieve its goal in food security.</p> <p><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>Though Agricultural Education has been a priority of the government, the teaching and learning of Practical Agriculture at pre-tertiary levels leaves much to be desired. According to Baffour-Awuah (1987), Agriculture Education in Ghana at the pre-tertiary level is faced with much problems hindering achievement of its goals.</p> <p>There is low interest in both teachers and students (Akinmade, 2002). This low interest could be attributed to the usual approach to teaching this practical oriented subject which is no longer enticing enough to boost the required interest.</p> <p>The best way the youth in school can be taught agriculture is by “doing” (Awuku et al, 1991) but the common sense is that most of the youth who completed SHS and were not able to pursue further studies in Agriculture show disinterest in agriculture and rather drift to urban centres to find jobs. There</p> <p>Awuku et al (1991) indicated that one objective for Agriculture education in the school curriculum is to make teacher and student a supplementary extension officer to local farmers. But most students learn Agriculture in the school mainly because it is one of the examination requirements (Baffour-Awuah, 1996). Therefore what is the future of Ghana’s Agriculture? It is therefore imperative for such issue to be addressed.</p> <p><strong>Purpose of Study</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is:</p> <p>1.   to assesses factors affecting the teaching and learning of agriculture in Senior High Schools in Mfantsiman Municipality.</p> <p>Agricultural Education at the SHS level is very crucial as it is the basis of continuing to higher levels.

The data used were collected from the statistical bulletin of the Central Bank of Nigeria and World Bank’s development indicators, and covered the period of 33 years ranging from 1981 to 2014. Multiple regression was used to analyze the data. The result showed that agriculture has significant impact o    n economic growth in Nigeria. It was also showed that agriculture has significant impact on poverty reduction in Nigeria. The other variable included in the model which is non-agriculture output did not have significant impact on poverty reduction. The study therefore recommends among others that government provides more funding for agriculture universities in Nigeria to carry out researchers on all area of agriculture production; this will lead to more exports and improvement in the competitiveness of Nigeria agriculture reproduction in international markets. The Central Bank of Nigeria should also come up with a stable policy for loan disbursement to farmers at a reasonable interest payback. </p> <p><strong>Background of the Study</strong></p> <p>The role of agriculture in economic growth and poverty reduction has become an issueof great concern in developed and developing countries. Nnadi (2005) stated that agriculture is indispensable in addressing economic growth and poverty reduction, which are the most difficult challenges facing many countries in the world especially developing countries where on the average, majority of the population are considered poor. Evidences in Nigeria show that the number of those in poverty has continued to increase. The author stressed further that the rising profile of poverty in Nigeria is assuming a worrisome dimension as empirical studies have shown. In consonant with this, Ojo (2008) opined that, Nigeria, a sub-Saharan African country, has at least half of its population living in abject poverty. The UN Human Poverty Index in 1999, credited Nigeria with 41.6%, captured the phenomenon more succinctly as the figure placed the nation as amongst the 25 poorest nations in the world. As at 2004, the HPI (Human Poverty Index) value for Nigeria, 40.6, ranks 76th among 102 developing countries for which the index has been calculated. The country has increasing rate of poverty both at the regions and at the national level, high unemployment rate, high income inequality, low quality human capital, high percentage of population on welfare and high out migration in the face of high economic growth.</p> <p>Agriculture is the production of food, feed, fibre and other goods by the systematic growing and harvesting of plants and animals (Akinboyo, 2008). According to, Brandt (2011), agriculture is the cultivation of land, raising and rearing of animals for the purpose of production of food for man, animals and industries.</p>                                                         \n\nROLE OF AGRICULTURE IN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION IN NIGERIA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ROLE OF AGRICULTURE IN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION IN NIGERIA", "id": 37}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IN NIGERIA 2010-2017</strong></p> <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>Over the years, Agriculture has proved to be the strongest means of livelihood all over the world. The produce from agriculture has been immense and the growth has been steadily upward in the developed countries. Developed countries has given adept attention to agriculture as the population of its citizens ride on geometric progression. In Nigeria, we have witnessed an upward and downward syndrome in the movement of Agricultural production. One major way to boost this movement and increase significant production is through the government expenditure. Government expenditure in this case are the resources (financial and material) that is injected into the Agricultural sector. This study was therefore undertaken to examine the probably the relationship that exists between government expenditure and agricultural production in Nigeria. Is the level of Agricultural production in the country dependent on the pace of government expenditure? To find out this, the study adopted the Ordinary Least Square method to run this regression with data from 2010-2017. The study found out there is a positive relationship between both variables, as the level of Agricultural production is to a great extent dependent on the amount of resources injected into the sector.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENT </strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>1.1    Background of the study</p> <p>1.2    Problem statement</p> <p>1.3    Purpose of the study</p> <p>1.4    Significance of the study</p> <p>1.5    Study hypotheses</p> <p>1.6    Scope and Limitations of the Study</p> <p>1.7    Organization of Study</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO:</strong></p> <p><strong>REVIEW OF RELATED AND RELEVANT LITERATURE</strong></p> <p>2.1    Introduction </p> <p>2.2    Conceptual Review</p> <p>2.3    Theoretical Framework</p> <p>2.4    Empirical Studies</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></p> <p>3.1    Research Design</p> <p>3.2    Sources of Data</p> <p>3.3    Population and Sample Size</p> <p>3.4    Model specification</p> <p>3.5    Unit Root test</p> <p>3.6    Cointegration Test</p> <p>3.7    Apriori expectation</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR: DATA PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION</strong></p> <p>4.1    Introduction</p> <p>4.2    Data Presentation</p> <p>4.3    F – test</p> <p>4.3    Unit Root Test</p> <p>4.4    Co-Integration Test</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE: CONCLUSION, SUMMARY, RECOMMENDATION </strong></p> <p>5.1    Introduction</p> <p>5.2    Conclusion and Findings</p> <p>5.3    Summary of the Study</p> <p>5.4    Recommendation</p> <p><strong>Bibliography</strong></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1   Background of the study</strong></p> <p>Agriculture as a sector is an instrumental factor for the development of the economy, as it sustains the livelihood of about 75 percent of the population, and according to World Bank estimates, increased at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in 1990-98 (Opportunities in Nigeria’s Agricultural Sector, 2005). The importance of the agricultural sector in any developing economy is generally well known. This is because it is expected to satisfy the bulk, if not the entire food requirement of the country, supply most of the agricultural raw materials needed by the manufacturing sector, provide adequate employment and income to farmers as well as earn substantial foreign exchange, for the execution of capital projects for developmental purposes. Over the years, inadequacy of agricultural infrastructure has hindered progress in agricultural development. While the use of such devices such as modern diggers, ploughs (instead of hand hoes), and non-harmful chemicals for containment of weed, fertilizers, etc. are unaffordable by most of the smallscale farmers. The importance of the agricultural sector in any developing economy is generally well known. This is because it is expected to satisfy the bulk, if not the entire food requirement of the country, supply most of the agricultural raw materials needed by the manufacturing sector, provide adequate employment and income to farmers as well as earn substantial foreign exchange, for the execution of capital projects for developmental purposes. As such, government expenditure, which is a public sector investment, in agriculture is crucial for the transformation of the sector and realization of development policy objectives. Therefore public expenditure can be described to mean the cost or expenses the government incurs for its own maintenance and for the society, with expanding state activities. Therefore, government expenditure on agriculture especially in the area of development of infrastructure, such as irrigation, input distribution, construction of feeder roads, research and extension, are important. These investments have been left to the government, not just because of limited number of private investor willing to take part in the investment in the sector but due to the strong believer of the government that the availability of such infrastructure and improved technology will contribute immensely to the realization of the expected gains in productivity and output growth in the sector. Despite these, the performance of the sector has generally been considered unsatisfactory especially following the 1971-73 droughts and 1975 Rosette virus epidemic (Ukpong, 1993). The expected significant contribution was made towards the attainment of several national economic and social goals. The resultant effect is the huge importation of food, made possible by the enhanced crude oil export earnings, but which served as a disincentive to serious domestic farming. In line with the anticipated contribution agriculture makes to the overall development of the Nigerian economy, several measures were designed in the years preceding the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) to stimulate the growth and development of the sector. Such measures included subsidized/low interest rate policies of the 1970s and early 1980’s, establishment of specialized institutions to lend solely to the sector, funding agricultural production directly through budgetary allocation and by 3 establishing agricultural oriented institutions and progammes such as Nigerian Agricultural Credit Bank (NACB), Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund (ACGSF), Agricultural Development Programmes (ADPS), River Basin Development Scheme (RBDS) and Operation Feed the Nation(OFN). Following the adoption of SAP in 1986, Commodity Boards were abolished in order to provide productive incentives to the farmers through increased producer prices. Also, in the period 1970-82 annual production of major export crops such as cocoa, rubber, cotton and groundnuts fell by 43, 29, 65, and 64 percent respectively (Olomola, 1998). While, the average growth rate is the value of agricultural exports increased astronomically in 1986 to 1990 sub-period by 70.5 percent due to initial impact of SAP. It remained a little lower but still high in the 1991/95 sub-periods by 68.5 percent, again due to the effect of SAP but became relatively low in the 1996/2000 at 18.2 percent as the effect of SAP wore off (Manyong, 2003). Despite decade of public sector contribution to agriculture, there were evidences of unstable or fluctuating trends. In this research, efforts has been made to find out what is responsible for the downward trend in the contribution of agriculture to food supply, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), foreign exchange earnings and raw materials. Also, why there has been mixed result from the financing policies and programmes of government for agriculture in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2   Problem statement</strong></p> <p>The importance of agriculture to the economic development of Nigeria is enormous owing to the fact that agriculture was the main source of food and employment for a sizeable number of the people. Public expenditure, which serves as the bed rock of financing for the sector has consistently fallen short of the public expectation. For instance, a collaborative study carried out by the International Food Policy and Research Institute (IFPRI) and the World Bank in 2008, revealed that Nigeria’s Public expenditure on agriculture is less than 2% of total federal annual budget expenditure. This is significantly low compared to other developing countries like Kenya (6%), Brazil (18%) and 10% goal set by African leaders’ forum, under the comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP). In spite of poor investment, agriculture has on the average contributed 32% of the country’s GDP from 1996-2000 and 42% between 2001 and 2009 (CBN, 2010). According to CBN Governor in 2011, agriculture accounted for 40% of the nation’s GDP, yet it received only 1% of the total commercial Bank Loans (People’s Daily, 2011). Inadequacy of government funding of agricultural projects and programmes has been observed by researchers because lack of strong evidence of growth promotion externalities by deepening food insecurity, social inequality, rural poverty and hunger, are issues of funding (Ogiri, 2004; Ogbonna and Osondu, 2015). This study therefore is set to determine the contribution of government funding in terms of expenditure to agricultural production in Nigeria between 2010-2017 and compare with some other factors on which agricultural output depends. This will guide policy making for increased agricultural productivity in the nation.</p> <p><strong>1.3   Purpose of the study</strong></p> <p>The objective of this study is to examine the impact of government expenditure on agricultural production. Specifically, we aim at:</p> <p>·      Determining the relationship between government expenditure and agricultural output.</p> <p>·      Ascertaining the impact of government expenditure on agricultural production. </p> <p>·      Highlighting the challenges of Agricultural production.</p> <p><strong>1.4   Significance of the study</strong></p> <p>The agricultural sector has the potential to provide employment opportunities, it has the potential to eliminate hunger, and provide alternative foreign exchange for the Nigerian economy. This study is necessitated by an attempt to analyze the effect of government agricultural expenditure on agricultural output, to aid policy makers in making policies that will enhance agricultural productivity in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.5   Study hypotheses</strong></p> <p>The study developed and formulated for testing the following hypothesis:</p> <p><strong>H0:</strong> There is no relationship between government spending and agricultural production in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>Ha:</strong> There is a relationship between government spending and agricultural production in Nigeria. </p> <p><strong>H0:</strong> There is no significant impact of government expenditure on Agricultural production in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>Ha:</strong> There is a significant impact of government expenditure on Agricultural production in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.6   Scope and Limitations of the Study</strong></p> <p>The scope of this study is necessarily limited to the period 2010-2017; within this period, some new policies on agriculture has been made following the past administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan and the Buhari-led administration in 2015. It should therefore be acknowledged that the data used are derived from the Statistical Bulletin, National Office of Statistic, Journals, etc, and they are used to portray the significance or importance of government expenditure on agricultural output in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.7   Organization of Study</strong></p> <p>The study is divided into five chapters. Chapter one deals with the study’s introduction and gives a background to the study. Chapter two reviews related and relevant literature. The chapter three gives the research methodology while the chapter four gives the study’s analysis and interpretation of data. The study concludes with chapter five which deals on the summary, conclusion and recommendation.</p>                                                         \n\nGOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IN NIGERIA 2010-2017<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IN NIGERIA 2010-2017", "id": 38}]
