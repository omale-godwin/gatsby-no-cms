Leaves for this work were washed, room dried ground to powder. The ground leave for both sample were soaked in four different solvent; Ethanol, n-Hexane, Ethyl acetate and water for 24 hours. After the contact elapsed the solvent were filtered to recover the extract. Qualitative analysis was carried out on the extract; the result showed moringa oliefera to contain saponin, flavonoid, tannin, phenol, steroid and glycoside. Azadrichta indica contains; saponin, flavonoid, tannin, Alkaloid, steroid and glycoside. Quantitative anaylsis were jalso carried on the extract and the result showed moringa oliefera and Azadrichta indica to contain in percentage flavonoid (21.8 : 23.80), Alkaloids (5.00 : 8.20), saponin ( 0.70 : 1.10 ), phenol ( 0.76 : 1.49 ), Tannin ( 0.08 : 0.57 ) and Glycoside ( 0.005 : 0.0062 ) respectively for moringa oliefera and Azadrichta indica. In the qualitative analysis water was the best solvent for extraction and quantitative analysis; flavonoid, alkaloid, tannin, saponin, phenol and glycoside have higher percentage in Azadrichta indica than moringa oleifera.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n1.1 BACKGROUND OF STUDY\nFrom time immemorial, man depended on plants as medicine. From a historical perspective, it is evident that the fascination for plants is as old as mankind itself. The plant kingdom represent a rich store house of organic compounds, many of which have been used for medicinal purposes and could serve as lead for the development of novel agents having good efficacy in various pathological disorders in the coming years.Plants are the richest source of drugs for traditional medicine, modern medicines, nutraceuticals food supplements, folk medicine, pharmaceutical intermediates and chemical entities for synthetic drugs (Hammer et al., 1999). The use of plant product as medicines could be traced as far back as the beginning of human civilization. The earliest mentioned medicinal used plant in Hindu culture is found in “Rigveda”, which is said to have been written between 4500-1600 B.C. and is supposed to be the oldest repository human knowledge. The active principle isolated, have provided leads in the development of several life saving drugs, which are in use today (Rastogi and Mehrotra, 2002).\nThe isolated active compounds of the plants are secondary metabolites chemical compound that occur naturally in plant with no nutritional value to human life. These active compounds are generally called\n16\nphytochemical. These phytochemicals play protective roles in plants, each chemical labeled phytochemical works in different ways, not all are the same for human, and not all come from the same plants. Some have shown more promise than others in fighting disease and illness in humans. There are some basic types of these active compounds that are found in different fruits and vegetables. We have some of them like antioxidants, they are present in onions and some other fruits and tea, they act as preventive measure for premature cell death and some forms of cancer and aging. Isoflavones or plant estrogen; they are found in soy and soy products; they are helpful in the year just before and after menopause. Capsaicin is found in hot pepper and it has been shown to significantly reduce prostate tumors in size, at least in mice. Taking capsaicin on a regular basis by eating spicy foods with hot peppers may prove an excellent preventative agent to prostate cancer and benign growth of prostate (Ahmedabad 382- 481). This experiment was carried out on moringaoleifera and Azadirachtaindica leaves.\nMoringaoleifera, or the horseradish tree, is a small or medium-sized about 10 m high perennial softwood tree with timber of low quality pantropical specie plant that is known by such regional name as benzolive, drumstick tree, kelor, marango, mlonge, mulangay, nebeday, saijhan and sajan. Over the past two decades, many reports have appeared in the mainstream scientific journals describing its nutritional\n17\nand medicinal properties (Akerele, 1993).Moringaoleifera is the most widely cultivated species of a monogenetic family, the moringaceae that is native to the sub-Himalayan tracts of India, Pakistan Bangladesh and Afghanistan, it also now naturalizes in West Africa and Nigeria as a whole.\nAzadirachtaindicaon the other hand is a very useful traditional medicinal plant in the sub-continent and each part of the tree has some medicinal properties. The plant is native to Asia, but has now naturalized in West Africa and is widely cultivated in Nigeria as an ornamental as well as medicinal plant.\n1.2 Phytochemicals\nPhytochemicals are non-nutritive plant chemicals which occur naturally in plants that have protective or disease preventive properties. They are nonessential nutrients, meaning that they are not required by the human body for sustaining life. It is well-known that plant produces these chemicals to protect them but recent research demonstrates that they can also protect humans against diseases. There are more than thousand known phytochemicals. Some of the well-known phytochemicals are lycopene in tomatoes, isoflavonesin soy and flavanoids in fruits.Alkaloids (examples are Caffeine, Theobromine,\n18\nTheophylline).Organosulfides(examples are Allicin,Glutathione,Indole-3-Carbinol,Isothiocyanates).Tannins, steroids, Glycosides etc.\n1.2.1 Activity of phytochemicals\nAntioxidant – Most phytochemicals have antioxidant activity and protect our cells against oxidative damage and reduce the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Phytochemicals with antioxidant activity includes:allyl sulfides (onions, leeks, and garlic), carotenoids (fruits, carrots), flavonoids (fruits, vegetables), polyphenols (tea, grapes).\nHormonal action – Isoflavones, found in soy, imitate human estrogens and help to reduce menopausal symptoms and osteoporosis.Stimulation of enzymes – Indoles, which are found in cabbages, stimulate enzymes that make the estrogen less effective and thus couldreduce the risk for breast cancer. Other phytochemicals, which interfere with enzymes, are protease inhibitors (soy and beans), terpenes (citrus fruits and cherries).\nInterference with DNA replication – Saponins found in beans interfere with the replication of DNA cell, thereby preventing themultiplication of cancer cells. Capsaicin, found in hot peppers, protects DNA from carcinogens.\n19\nPhysical action – Some phytochemicals bind physically to cell walls thereby preventing the adhesion of pathogens to human cell walls. Proanthocyanidins are responsible for the anti-adhesion properties of cranberry. Consumption of cranberries will reduce the risk of urinary tract infections and will improve dental health.\nPhytochemicals are naturally present in many foods but it is expected that through bioengineering new plants will be developed, which will ontain higher levels. This would make it easier to incorporate enough phytochemicals with our food.\n1.3 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\nMoringaoleifera and Azadirachtaindica are plants(leave) are claimed to have a lot of economic value such as medicinal, nutritional and pesticidal values. These claims have not been clearly justified.This research and experiment is therefore centered on investigating, analyzing and justifying the claims made on these plants (leave). And also to know the chemical composition responsible for the Medicinal value of these plant (leave).\n20\n1.4 AIM/OBJECTIVE OF PHYTOCHEMICAL\ni.

Many natural and man-made materials have been used to make perfume to apply to the skin and clothing, to put in cleaners and cosmetics, or to scent the air. Because of differences in body chemistry, temperature, and body odors, no perfume will smell exactly the same on any two people.\nPerfume comes from the Latin “per” meaning “through” and “fume,” or “smoke.” Many ancient perfumes were made by extracting natural oils from plants through pressing and steaming. The oil was then burned to scent the air. Today, most perfume is used to scent bar soaps. Some products are even perfumed with industrial odorants to mask unpleasant smells or to appear “unscented.”\nWhile fragrant liquids used for the body are often considered perfume, true perfumes are defined as extracts or essences and contain a percentage of oil distilled in alcohol.\nA perfume is composed of three notes. The base note is what a fragrance will smell like after it has dried. The smell that develops after the perfume has mixed with unique body chemistry is referred to as the middle note. And the top note is\n13\nthe first smell experienced in an aroma. Each perfumery has a preferred perfume manufacturing process, but there are some basic steps. The notes unfold over time, with the immediate impression of the top note leading to the deeper middle notes, and the base notes gradually appearing as the final stage. These notes are created carefully with knowledge of the evaporation process of the perfume. The top note consists of small light molecules that evaporate quickly. The middle note forms the heart of main body of a perfume and act to mask the often unpleasant initial impression of base notes.\nTraditionally perfumes were made from plant and animal substances and prepared in the form of waters, oils, unguents, powders, and incense. This last method of fragrance gives us our word ‘perfume’ which means ‘to smoke through’. Most modern perfumes are alcohol-based and contain synthetic scents. While the term ‘perfume’ usually refers to fragrances in general, in the more technical language of the perfumer, a perfume must contain over 15% of fragrance oils in alcohol. The preferred fragrances for perfumes are by no means universal, but differ according to cultural dictates and fashions. In the sixteenth century, for example, pungent animal scents such as musk and civet were very popular. In the nineteenth century, by contrast, such animal scents were generally considered too crude, and light floral fragrances were favored. Perfumes were held in high esteem and widely employed in the ancient world. The wealthy would perfume not only the body, but their furnishings and their favorite horses and dogs. On ancient altars perfumes were offered to the gods, while in the\n14\nkitchens of antiquity the same scents — Saffron, Cinnamon, Rose, Myrrh — might be used to flavor food and wine.\nTechniques involved in perfume extraction from plants include; solvent extraction, distillation and effleurage method. These methods to a certain extent, distort the odor of the aromatic compounds that are obtained from the raw materials.\nImportant thing in relation to perfume making is that there are three key ingredients you will need to produce perfume:\n1. Essential Oils (these have been extracted from various plants (organic or nonorganic) and when combined give the smell of the perfume you are trying to produce.\n2. Pure Grain Oil\n3. Water\n1.2 LEMONGRASS\nFamily: Poaceae (Gramineae), Cymbopogon species\nThe genus has about 55 species, most of which are native to South Asia, Southeast Asia and Australia. Two major types have considerable relevance for commercial use: East Indian lemongrass (Cymbopogon flexuosus ) is native to India, Sri Lanka, Burma and Thailand, whereas West Indian lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus) is assumed to originate in Malaysia. The plants grow in dense clumps up to 2 meters in diameter and have leaves up to 1 meter long. Further Cymbopogon martini (Roxb.) J.F. Watson var. martini, which is native to India and cultivated in Java is\n15\nworth mentioning as it also grows in Bhutan and is extracted for palmarosa oil. Another species with commercial relevance is citronella grass (Cymbopogon winterianus Jowitt) which also stems from India, but is today grown throughout the tropics.\nThe reported life zone for lemongrass is 18 to 29 degrees centigrade with an annual precipitation of 0.7 to 4.1 meters with a soil pH of 5.0 to 5.8 (East Indian) or 4.3 to 8.4 (West Indian). The plants need a warm, humid climate in full sun. They grow well in sandy soils with adequate drainage. Since the plants rarely flower or set seed, propagation is by root or plant division. The plants are harvested mechanically or by hand about four times each year with the productive populations lasting between four and eight years Extensive breeding programs have developed many varieties of lemongrass.\nThe quality of lemongrass oil is generally determined by the content of citral, the aldehyde responsible for the lemon odor. Some other constituents of the essential oils are -terpineol, myrcene, citronellol, methyl heptenone, dipentene, geraniol, limonene, nerol, and farnesol .West Indian oil differs from East Indian oil in that it is less soluble in 70 percent alcohol and has a slightly lower citral content.\nLemongrass is used in herbal teas and other nonalcoholic beverages in baked goods, and in confections. Oil from lemongrass is widely used as a fragrance in perfumes and cosmetics, such as soaps and creams. Citral, extracted from the oil, is used in flavoring soft drinks in scenting soaps and detergents, as a fragrance in perfumes and cosmetics, and as a mask for disagreeable odors in several industrial products. Citral is also used in the synthesis of ionones used in perfumes and cosmetics.\n16\nAs a medicinal plant, lemongrass has been considered a carminative and insect repellent. West Indian lemongrass is reported to have antimicrobial activity .Oil of West Indian lemongrass acts as a central nervous system depressant .Oil of East Indian lemongrass has antifungal activity .The volatile oils may also have some pesticide and mutagenic activities .Cymbopogon nardus is a source of citronella oil. Cymbopogon martinii is reportedly toxic to fungi.\n1.3 STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS\nThe problem of perfume extraction process is the distortion of the odor of the aromatic compounds obtained from the raw materials. This is due to heat, harsh solvents and also through the exposure to oxygen which will denature the aromatic compounds. These will either change their odor, character or render them odorless.\nThe problem of formulation of perfume involves knowing the proportion in which essential oil, and other materials to be mixed to avoid skin irritation and increase the intensity and longevity of the perfume.\nMost imported perfumes are synthetic odorant which are not pure chemical substance but are mixture of organic compounds that are harmful when applied.\nThere are limited perfume plants, from which perfume can be made; this can lead to importation of perfume thereby causing the decline of foreign reserves and unemployment.\n17\n1.4 OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT\nThe main objective of this project is to extract and formulate perfume from Lemon grass (CYMBOPOGON FLEXUOSUS).\n1.5 JUSTIFICATION/SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nThis project focuses on the production of perfumes from natural/plant sources as against synthetic chemicals thereby will reduce any side effect resulting from synthetic chemicals.\nThe success of this work will stimulate the development of the perfume industry locally because of available, cheap raw materials.\nMore jobs will be created by those that will be engaged in planting/cultivating of the plant as well as establishing small scale extraction plants.\nThere will be reduction on the resources spent on importation of lemon grass fragrance by end users.\n1.6 SCOPE OF THE WORK\nThis project work is on how perfumes are extracted and formulated from lemongrass. It further entails;\no The synthetic and aromatic sources of perfumes.\no The composition of perfumes and its concentration\no The extraction methods and formulation process involved\no The economic importance of lemongrass and the uses of lemongrass oil in perfume production process.\nEXTRACTION AND FORMULATION OF PERFUME FROM LEMONGRASS LEAVES",

        "content": " EXTRACTION AND FORMULATION OF PERFUME FROM PLANT\n(Chemical Engineering Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n1. 1 INTRODUCTION\nThe word perfume derives from the latin ―per fumum‖ meaning through smoke, is fragrant liquid that is sprayed or rubbed on the skin or clothes to give a pleasant smell. Extraction of perfume from various plants resources is of ancient origin. Infact the natives from different tropical regions of the globe have long been extracting oil from numerous oil bearing plants. Human since the ancient time have known how to extract oil from their natural resources. Vegetable oils are naturally occurring esters of higher fatty acids and glycerol. They are widely distributed in nature and were first consumed as food. Later oils were discovered to be used as renewable raw materials for variety of non food production, for instance perfumes, disinfectants, inks to mention but a few. 1.2 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\nSeveral thousands of plants distributed throughtout the world contain a group of odiferous, fragrance, oily products that are highly volatile organic substances collectively known as essential oils. ―Essential‖ does not mean ―most necessary‖ but rather the concentrated characteristics or quintessence of a natural flavor or fragrance raw material (Coulson et al,\n2\n2003). Therefore, perfume may be from essential oils of vegetables or plant origin. It is a complex mixture of aldehydes, ketones, hydrocarbons, alcoholic acid and short chain esters. The existence of perfume on certain plants has been known for thousands of years. They can be found in leaves, flowers, stems, barks, and roots. Ancient Egytians extracted essential oils from plants tissues by steam distillation (Ogbu,2005). Other methods of isolating essential oils includes solvent extraction, expression, cold plate or enfleurage. Some of these methods have been adopted by essential oil extracting industries. Information on perfume when the essential oils have been extracted from plants are of different type of oils and these will ultimately influence the smell of perfume over time namely:\n1. The base oil (Base notes)- this will produce the scent that stays longest on the skin and for this reason it is usually added to the mixture e.g vanilla, ginnamon, sandalwood, mosses etc.\n2. The middle oil (middle notes)- this also influences the smell of the perfume for quite sometime but not as long as the base note does e.g lemon grass, Yalang Ylang etc.\n3. Top oil (top notes)- this is added to the mixture after the middle notes and may then be followed by some other substances which will help to\n3\nbridge the scents together e.g orchard, rose, bergamount, lemon,orchid etc.\nA formulation or recipe that rightly blend with the oil or fragrance is used and the reason perfume differs is due to the formulation or recipe that will give pleasant odour. It is necessary to choose a good recipe of formulation. Alcohol is added to the fragrance or essential oils as a primary solvent to reduce the strays of the oils. Fixatives are also used with the other ingredients like water, essential oils and alcohol to lower the rate of evaporation of the fragrance of essential oils. The reason why a perfume losses its fragrance faster than normal is because only a little amount of fixative was used when preparing the perfume. 1.3 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM There is a high demand of essential oils for various purposes such as medicinal, perfumery, soap making, insecticides to mention but a few have opened up wide opportunities for global warming.\nImported essential oils are very expensive to meet the demand of our local consumer industries, therefore it becomes necessary to source and extract these oils from local source. In particular perfumes that are usually imported can be produced locally from a vast variety of oil\n4\nbearing plants yet to be explored. It has also been observed that high concentration of perfumes in the epidermal tissues can cause skin irritation or peeling due to poor formulation. This problem will be explored on this project. Solvent extraction is the safest method for extracting high quality oil because some herbs and spices cannot be extracted from enfleurage method but it has the disadvantage of having residual solvents in the essential oils. The research is conducted in order to use hydrodistillation as one of the applicable methods to extract essential oils. Hydrodistillation has the advantage of no solvent residues as an alternative to conventional extraction techniques. This research will reveal the difference in yields by the methods. 1.4 JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY\nIt is hoped that from this research work, optimum extraction parameters like solvent type, solvent ratio, contact time and particle size and the quality of perfume would be established. The result obtained would add to the data bank that could help potential industrialist who intends to go into perfume production from plants. Consequently, more processing industries would lead to a higher production both for domestic consumption and export. Major consumers of essential oils are the perfumery, cosmetics, food and beverages and pharmaceutical industries.\n5\nMost of these industries in Nigeria depend on imported essential oils for their production and this makes their products very expensive. Interestling, some of these source of essential oils are common in Nigeria such as lemon grass, ginger, flowers, eucalyptus to mention but a few. There is a high potential in this area and it becomes necessary to seek means to explore and exploit area with the aim of providing our local industries with these essential oils. There are great biodiversity in the ecosystem when it is tapped into the economy of Nigeria will be improved upon. It can also create numerous job opportunities for the youth as both industries and farmers will be employers of labour. 1.5 OBJECTIVE OF THE RESEARCH The main objective of this research is to extract essential oil from lemon grass (cymbopogon citrasus) using solvent extraction, enfleurage, and hydrodistillation and formulating the perfume. 1.6 SCOPE OF THE RESEARCH I. Investigate the effect of solvent nature on extraction in terms of yield and formulation of the extracted essential oil. Three methods will be used; solvent extraction, enfleurage and hydrodistillation. Attempt will be made to formulate the essential oil into perfume. Ii To Formulate perfume using appropriate materials Iii The composition of perfume and its concentration.\nEXTRACTION AND FORMULATION OF PERFUME FROM PLANT",

Gas flaring is one of the most challenging energy and environmental problems facing the world today whether regionally or globally. It is a multi-billion dollar waste, a local environmental catastrophe and a global energy and environmental problem which had persisted for decades. The World Bank has estimated that the annual volume of associated gas being flared and vented is about 110 billion cubic meters, which is enough fuel to providing the combined annual natural gas consumption of Germany and France.  Flaring in Africa is about thirty seven billion cubic meters in the year 2000, which could produce 200 Terawatt hours (Twh) of electricity. And which is also about 50% of the cement power consumption of the African continent and more than twice the level of power consumption in sub-Saharan African with the exception of the republic of south African.             Gas flaring is a common practice  in the oil and gas production processes  globally, Libya for instance flares about  21% of its natural gas, while  said Arabia, Canada and Algeria flare 20%, 8% and 50% respectively. This implies that Nigeria has one of the work rates of gas flaring in the world. In 2003, Nigeria flared about 76% of its natural gas. Gas flaring is thus occur during petroleum refining and chemical processing for safe disposal of waste gases during  process upsets, plant  start-up or shut down and as well as process emergencies. Flaring is a high- temperature oxidation process used to burn combustible components mostly hydrocarbons, of waste gases from industrial operation Gas flaring is the combustion of associated gas produced with crude oil or form gas fields.\n\nThe option to release gas to the atmosphere by flaring and venting is an essential practice in oil and gas production, primary for safety reasons. Flaring is the controlled burning of natural gas produced in association with oil in the course of routine oil and gas production operations. Venting is the controlled release of gas into the atmosphere in the course of oil and gas production operation. Solving the problem of this “nuisance” called venting while ensuring safe operation and to minimize undesirable venting, led to the introduction of flaring. Gas flaring is choice disposal option for handling waste hydrocarbon gases because of their ability to burn efficiently.\n\n       However, one of the problems associated with crude oil exploration and exploration in Akwa Ibom state of Nigeria is linked to gas flaring where as at 2005, crude oil is brought to the surface from several kilometers below, the gas associated with such oil extraction usually comes to the surface as well. If the oil is produced in those  areas  of the world  that lacks gas infrastructure  or a nearby gas market, a significant portion  of the related gas may be released into  the atmosphere either uninvited (vent) or ignited (flared).\n\nGas flaring contributes to climate change which has serious implications for both Nigeria and the rest of the world. Nigeria is one of the highest emitter of green house gases in African and among the highest carbon (IV) oxides emitters in the world. The burning  of fossil fuel, mainly coal, oil  and gas led to the warming  up the environment through the emissions of carbon  dioxide  (co2) as the main green house gas, particulate  matter, hydrocarbons and ash, photochemical oxidants and hydrogen supplied (H2S). The flares also contributes to acid rain, which apart from corroding corrugated aluminum roofs, acidify the soil, thereby causing soil fertility  loss and damaging crops\nGAS FLARING AND IT'S EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT",

The mesocarp from edible African pear “DacryodesEdulis” were evaluated for their oil yield. The pulp from this pear were oven dried at 100oC-105oC to a moisture content level of 29%.The mesocarp was subjected to proximate analysis to determine the percentage of the moisture, ash, fat, crude fibre, crude protein and carbohydrate content which resulted to the values of 29%, 2%, 19.6%, 25.5%, 11.9%, and 12% respectively. Then the dried sample was pulverized by using hammer mill and the oil was extracted by solvent extraction using n-hexane. The oil extracted were analyzed for the chemical properties i.e. (Acid value, saponification value, peroxide value, iodine value) etc. the values obtained are respectively 8.41gm/KOH/gm, 185.1gm/KOH/gm, 2.8gm/KOH/gm 3.96gm/iodine/gm and Physical properties i.e. (Refractive index, Ph value, specific gravity) which the values obtained are 1.469brix, 5.7 and 0.92. and the The percentage oil yield content is 51.57%. This physio-chemical characteristic and fatty acid composition of this oil show that they have industrial potentials.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\nIn the major world, one major source of protein and vegetable oil is from oil seeds /fruits (Williams M. A. 1996). Oil constitutes a well defined class of naturally occurring substance. It is greasy, being soluble in organic solvents but insoluble in polar solvents such as water. Oil is a liquid at room temperature. Commercially, oil as well as fats is sourced from certain plant groups mostly seeds and nuts and some parts of animal within which they occur in relatively large quantity in an easily available form (McGraw-Hill, 1997). The existence of oil in certain plants has been known for century of years (Ogbu 2005).Oil can be grouped into edible and non-edible oil depending on the amount of unsaponified matters and impurities contained therein. Edible oil extracted from African pear, bread fruits, cashew nut, peanut etc. are examples of vegetable oil which are naturally occurring esters of higher fatty acids and glycerol, and are predominantly triglycerides with traces of mono and diglycerides, sterples, anti-oxidants, vitamins, saturated and unsaturated free fatty acids and other minor constituents. They are widely distributed in nature and were first consumed as food. Later, oils were discovered to be used as renewable raw materials for variety of non-food production. For instance; soaps, creams, disinfectants, paints, enamels, inks etc.\n2\nDue to the oil boom in the early 70‟s, agriculture was abandoned for petroleum and its product, but recently, things are taking a new turn in Nigeria over dependence on petroleum for virtually everything has not really helped matters. The economic situation in the country is bad and the general standard of living is getting poorer with each passing day, Hence, the need for a restructure of the economic system with an agricultural bias.\nMost agriculture products such as these oils extracted from local seeds and nut, if properly monitored and harvested can be very useful for us down here and even exported for foreign exchange, hence the need for this project which deals on the extraction and analysis of African pear oil.\nExtraction of oil from various vegetable resources is of ancient origin. In fact, the natives from different tropical regions of the globe have long been extracting oil from numerous oil-bearing plants. Humans, since the ancient times have known how to extract fats and oil from their natural resources. Historically, oils had been extracted by wrapping nuts in clothes and then using devices operated by stones and levers to exert pressure on them. But now, an improved form of mechanical device, which allowed considerably more pressure to be exerted, is now in use in form of hydraulic operated ram. This type of press is developed into a motorized hydraulic pump system that pressed the nut bag and then released a pressed cake. The next improvement in extracting oil is the screw press or expeller which is been driven by electric\n3\nmotor.Because most press or expeller processes leads to over-heating of the meal and leave too- much of the high value oil in cakes, better methods of extracting the oil with solvent was developed. Bush pear was processed by solvent methods alone in this project. This process can be accomplished by a variety of ways but as might be expected, its efficiency depends to a great extent on attaining intimate contact between the liquid solvent and the solid containing the solute. The type of solvent available for this process include n-hexane, petroleum ether, benzene, n-heptanes, acetone etc.\n1.1 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\nThe generic name “Dacryodes” was derived from the Greek word “Dakruon” meaning [tear] referring to resin droplets on the bank surface of its member while “Edulis” means edible emphasizing the importance of nutrients fruits in the plants cultivation .The plant belongs to the family Burseraceae whose members are characterized by an ovary of 2to 5 cells, prominent as inducts in the bark, wood, and intrasteminal disk (Chunduff, 1984). The genus Dacryodes consist of about 10 species (Verheji, 2002). However (Rehn, 1984) indicated 80 species to encompass sub species of varieties, form and cultivars. Two varieties are recognized; Var-parvicarpa and Var-edulis whose conical fruit is smaller with the pulp. Var-edulis exhibit verticulate or sub-verticulate branching while\n4\nthe branching is slender and opposite or bifurcate in var-parvicarpa (Okafor et.al 1983).\nDacryodesedulis is an indigenous fruit in the Gulf of Guinea and central African countries(Troupin, 1950), but due to the popularity of the nutritious fruit for consumption, the plant is widely cultivated, extend its area of distribution to Sierra-Leone, Uganda, Angola, Zimbabwe and Nigeria. It rarely grows wild, thus the natural area of distribution is obscure (verheji,2002). Lam gave four synonyms viz to the Dacryodesedulis :CarnaruimedulieHook.f, CarnaruimsaphuEngl, Pachylobusedulis (G.don) Hook. F. and PachylobussaphuEngl (Burkill ,1985,National research council,1996).\nHowever, these synonyms have long been considered as the most unambiguous synonyms (Boutelje,1980).The common names are in English, African pear, African pear tree, Bush butter, Bush butter tree, Bush fruit tree, Eben tree, Native pear (Kapseu and Tchiegang, 1996) and in French, Safoutier (Burkill, 1985). The oil of fruits of DacryodesEdulis is a rich source of amino acids and triglycerides. The fatty acid composition of fruit pulp oil of two cultivars of bush pear [cultivar1 and cultivar2] grown in Nigeria were determined. The oil is found in the pulp which is made up of 48% of oil and a plantation can produce 7.8 tons of oil per hectare. It is also rich in vitamins and a rich source of amino acids triglycerides (Derbyshire.et al 1976).\n5\nBush pear oil is one of the most important rated versatile vegetable oil. This is due to its uses in various spheres of life, most especially as a very healthy food ingredient.\n1.2 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\nThis project is aimed at the analysis of bush pear and its oil.The main objective of this study is to carry out proximate analysis and physio-chemical properties of African pear oil extracted by solvent methods. This physio-chemical properties determined are specific gravity, refractive index, ph value, boiling point, acid value, iodine value, peroxide value, and saponification value. To achieve the objectives of this project, it is important to:-\na) Select the best suited solvent for optimum yield.\nb) Characterize the extracted oil for compositions and properties.\nc) Test the suitability of the oil.\n6\n1.3 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\nThis research work involves the analysis of African pear and its oil though the food crop African pear potential is rated one of the highest oil producing fruit crop yet it begs the question of its potential.\nFurthermore, this project will answer the following questions;\ni) Solvent extraction by solvent method\nii) What is the optimum yield of the particle size using n- hexane?\niii) Is there significant difference in the characterization of the extracted oil as compared to theoretical value in terms of;\n1) Chemical properties (Acid value, iodine value, saponification value and peroxide value).\n2) Physical properties (specific gravity, density, viscosity, refractive index).\n3) Chemical composition (protein crude, fibre, carbohydrate and moisture.\n1.4 SIGNIFICANCE/ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY\nCharacterizing the potentials of African pear/African pear oil for many purposes has several implications. Communities in the West African countries are significantly dependent on financial gain from agrarian enterprise.\n7\nIt is hope that from the project, optimum extraction parameters which are quality of the oil would be established, the result would add to the data bank that could help potential industrialist who intends to go into vegetable table oil production from African pear. A crop that experiences a post harvest loss in excess of 40% in areas where malnutrition is prevalent is a problem for potentials to reclaim the lost percentage of either food or other purposes is advantageous for producers and consumers alike.\nFurthermore, the development of crops with indigenous appeal can strengthen the agricultural and energy sectors of struggling economics, identifying the oils fuels quantities, whether favorable or not, will help to inform future crop and industry development.\n1.5 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\nIn this project work, we intend to analyze and extract completely African pear and its oil. Many research work has been done in giving a detailed composition found in African pear. But this research account on the optimum route to:\ni) Extraction of vegetable oil from bush pear.\nii) Separation of pure oil from the solvent.\niii) Characterization of the African pear.\n8\niv) Characterization of the oil extracted.\nDue to the low yield of the above method (mechanical method) of extraction, soxhlet and cold method of extraction are used i.e. solvent\nANALYSIS OF BUSH PEAR AND IT'S OIL\n",

        "content": " ALTERNATIVE RAW MATERIAL SOURCES FOR CEMENT PRODUCTION\n(Chemical Engineering Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIt is generally known that cement id produced from limestone, mar/clay and gypsum by the following three basic process- wet semi- wet aid dry process.\n\nThe cost of exploiting the limestone: the major raw material constitute about 50% of the production cost which results in the high cost of cement.  It therefore becomes imperative to bring down the cost of cement by investigating into alternative source of raw material for cement production and hence this project.\n\nFrom literature, rice husk ash, Ukpo day,& Nsu day contain the basic mineral constituents which limestone has.  Rice husk was burnt temperatures of 5000c,   6000c,   7000c, and 8000c.  The best ash was obtained at a temperature of 7000c,.  the above material were also analyzed to determine their mineral constituents.  The result shown that rice husk contains little aluminum (Al203) and no lime (Ca0).  To make up for these mineral constituents, Upo day which is rich in aluming was blended with lime(Ca0)-a bye product from gas plant and the three minerals were blended using the method of lime saturation factor.  A blending ratio of 70% lime 20% PHA and 10% Alumina mixture (Ukpo day)  was used.  The mixture was mixed dry by dry process and burnt in a furnace at a temperature of 12000c.  the resulting mass known as dinker  was ground  with 5% gypsum.  The cement obtained gave a comprehensive strength of 2N/mr2.\n\n  DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nOPC    -           Ordinary Portland cement\n\nLSF     -           Lime saturation factor\n\nQuicklime        -           Calcium oxide Ca0\n\nRaw meal        -           Secondary raw material that is fed into the kiln for burning\n\nRaw mill          -           A tube like machinery where the grinding of raw material\n\ntakes place.\n\nASTM -           American society for testing materials.\n\nHydraulic modulus     -           The ration of lime (Ca0) to silica, Alumina and ferric\n\n oxides.\n\nClinker            -           Intermediate raw material and the product from the kiln.\n\nC3S      -           Tricalcimn silicate\n\nC2S      -           Dicalcium silicate\n\nC3A     -           Tricalcium Aluminate\n\nC4AF   -           Tetra calcium Alumiroferite\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nCement is a complete mixture of mineral substances that gradually harden when mixed with water.  It is the product of the reaction of lime with the oxides of silica alumina and iron.  It is used in the construction of industry as a blending material.  Some builders regard it as the key engineering material for construction purposes.  many allied construction materials such as asbestos, culverts concrete seals, concrete poles, cement blocks etc are derived from cement and they also play very important roles in the construction industry. \n\nFor the average Nigeria, a major life ambition is to own a living house cement, a key raw material has ruined to ‘Gold’ as has become a topical issue.  Just like iron, steel and petrochemical, cement is equally a major spring board for industrialization.  This quest for industrialization has resulted to increase in demand with the consequent increase in the cost of cement.\n\nOne of the reasons adduced for the exorbitant cost of cement is the scarcity of raw material.  This situation arises as  a result of its fast depletion which is not replaced.\n\nAnother reason adduced for the exorbitant cost of cement is the high cost of the exploration and exploitation of the raw material.  To mine the chief raw material for the manufacture of cement- limestone requires a lot of machines, plants and explosives.  A lot of money is also paid as compensation to the communities that own the land.  All these expenditures lead to the high cost of cement.  This study was therefore to investigate alternative source of raw material for the production of cement.\n\nThese investigation was geared towards industrial waste and Agricultural residues.  Agricultural residues are composed of organic constituents such as cellulose, lignin, fibre and small amounts of crude protein and fat.  In addition, they contain a rage of minerals which silica, Alumina and iron oxide.  The residue itself cannot be used as cement replacement and it is the ash that is obtained form the preprocessing that is of interest.  Two factors require for constituents of the ash.  The ash content is important because it indicates the amount of reside which need to be burnt; that is the yield. D..J COOK (1980) states that rice husk have shown by far the greater yieled of ash than other plants like sorghum, corn leaf blade, Bamboo nodes, (Inner portion) bangasse, lantana leaf and stem and rice straw.\n\nFor every 1000kg of rice husk burnt, 200kg of ash are produced.  Hence it is not surprising that rice husk emerged as the agricultural that with the greatest potential as cement replacement material.\n\nOne the other hand, lime is a by product of gas companies.  It is readily available at no cost.\n\nThe utilization of these raw material for cement product production is very altercative in developing countries like ours.  This is because it does not only reduce demand on Portland cement but it also provides cement in rural areas of the country especially in rice growing areas which rice husk is found in large quantities and constitute environmental nuisance.\n\n1.2       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe present high cost of cement and the exorbitant cost of residential house occasioned by high cost of raw material exploitation, energy, population explosion and development have necessitated intensification into the search for alternative raw material for the production of this product.  The aim of this project therefore was to bring down the cost of cement by the use of alternative raw materials form industrial and agricultural waste.\n\n1.3       SCOPE OF THE PROJECT\n\nThe intention was to \n\n1)                  Source and analyze the following raw materials rice husk lime (waste product from Niger gas company) Ukpo clay, Nsu clay and pulverized fuel Ash (PEA)\n\n2)                  Obtain the best condition for preprocessing.\n\n3)                  Compounding the raw mix.\n\n4)                  Burning\n\n5)                  Peterning the physical characteristics.\n\n1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nOn completion of the study, the result would be of importance to the  Government and Entrepreneurs who may wish to go into the production of cement.  The increased investments in this area will bridge the gap between demand and supply and bring down the cost of cement the reduced price of cement will catalyze infrastructure development and majority will be able to own a living house.\n\nAnother importance of the project is that it will serve as the starting point for the production of other types of cement known as blend cement.  The study will also help to provide cement in rural areas typically of those traditionally deprived of cement.  In this way small-scale businesses possible.\n\nSince the industrial and agricultural waste are waste which causes environmental pollution and create problem with disposal its utilization would not only control environmental employment opportunities to our young school leaver.\n\nThe research would also be of immerse benefit to future researchers and student who would have the interest of studying similar subjects.\nALTERNATIVE RAW MATERIAL SOURCES FOR CEMENT PRODUCTION",

The metal generally concerned with soap production are sodium (Na) and potassium (k), which produces water-soluble soap.\n\nSoap belong to a class of the products that have the ability for cleaning materials/substances. It obtains the its useful cleaning characteristic from the combination of a long chaim hydrocarbon, which has good solvent action on others hydeocarbon, and its high water solubility.\n\nSoft soap such as toilet soap, uses higher quality fat with water content reduced to about 10% or less. This soap is could and flaked, and passed through a hot air drying oven to reduce the water content prior to milling. Trace constituents are metered at the milling stage, since the soap is dried and higher pressure are required and subsequent plodding, the properties of the soft soap produced depends mainly on the alkali (potassium) and the fat/oil need. Due to this properties, it can be dissolved in water easily with high formability which makes it easy for washing soft soaps also contain additives such s perfumes, dyes, and antiseptic like sodium Tripoliphosphate (STPP).\n\nThe main difficulty with soaps is that in hard water which typically contains calcium (ca) ions, the soap propitiates as an insoluble calcium salt and this creates various problems particularly in laundering cloths. Soap contains a basic  cleaning agent called a “surfactants or  surface active agent”. The surface active agents consist of molecules that attach themselves to the dirt particles. The molecules pull these dirt particles out of the materials and hold them in the wash water until they are rinsed away.\n\nSuccessful improvement in the production of soap industries have made it possible for the soap to receive public patronage as a result of certain materials that were added, vix alky/benzene sulphanate (ABS), which originated from the petrochemicals such as prophlene and benzene. This involves alkylatin of benzene with propylene and consequent suphonation of the resultant alky/benzene with sulphuric acid.\n\nThe alky/benzene sulphnates suffers from a major disadvantage; micro organism cannot degrade them, also the disposal of the waste products of soap causes a serious environmental pollution. As a result of this, in era alky/benzene sulphonate were developed which are more easily degraded by micro-organism.\n\nSoap being derived from naturally substances were developed long before the mechanism of the detergent. There are a number of soaps prepared for special uses. Scouring soaps contain sand, pumice or similar material for abrasive action. Medicated soaps and soaps that smell like sheep dip contain antiseptics, and  tailow is the must important fat for the production of soap, although coconut, babassu and palm-kernel oils are used in conjunction with tallow.\n\nThe term soap is broad enough to include the metal salts of carboxylic acids which are not used for cleaning purposes.\n\nThose include  the aluminum , calcium and aithium soaps used in greases, aluminum soaps used in cosmetics and zinc soaps used in antiseptic powers. Other metal soaps are used for water proofing, as derivers in paints, to kill fungi and as mordents.\n\n1.2       OBJECTIVES\n\n            The objectives of this project are:\n\n    to produce soft soap either from the local potash (Ngu) or from the laboratory grade.\n    To compare the characteristic of the soft soap produced with the characteristics of the either soaps produced from different sources.\n    To provide a means of producing soft soaps in the most economic way for the commercial grade.\n\n1.3                                      ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF SOAP\n\nSoap have many household and industrial beneficial uses. People use these products to wash their dishes and laundry to scrub flours, to clean wall and windows and to do may other household job.\n\nIndustrially, soaps and detergents can be used as cleaners, lubricants, softeners and polishers. For instance tire manufactures apply soap to hot tire to prevent them foom sticking to the moulds used in vulcanizing or hardening rubber. However, therefore, soaps can be used to polish jewelry and to soften leather for shoes and purses.\n\n1.4                                      SCOPE\n\nThe scope of this project work is limited to the production and characterization of the soft soap from the caustic potash for commercial grade.\nPRODUCTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SOFT SOAP FROM LOCAL POTASH (NGU) OR CAUSTIC POTASH LABORATORY OR COMMERCIAL GRADE",

The actualization of the production of polyurethane (fibre) foam was made possible by using the components / chemical raw materials such as polyol (polyurethes resin).  TDI (toluene di-Iso-cyanate, methylane chloride (MC)-(CH2CL).  Silicon oil, stannous octoate, calcum carbonate and water.\n\nAs a result of chemistry of polyurethane foams, properties of foams and fibre materials (physical, chemical, thermal and mechanical properties) gotten from the literature, review including the functions and reactions of the components proper formulation was made and conversions / translation to actual weights also done which lead to the production of the desired product. The experiment was done at ambient temperature of 320c following the normal procedures.\n\nThe foam produced is of very high density, good quality, durable and profitable. The densities of the various samples are 35kg/m3 and 40kg/m3.\n\nAs a result of poor storage conditions of the chemicals mentioned above here in the pilot plant, the stipulated and specified environmental conditions, there is a slight deviation of the foam from the international standard specification of 155. The foam produced are measured to standard and can be used for applied to any field of engineering and technology.

This branch of polymer technology are finding increasing applications in many field of engineering including arts and sciences. Foam was discovered as a result of man’s strong desire in quest to his environment. There are many kinds of foam based on their inherent features such as high rigidity, stiffness per unit weight of polymer thermal and acoustical insulating properties. Cushioning properties or shock absorbency characteristics, low internal stresses of foamed mouldings and ease of forming. As a result of these, extensive range of materials and manufactured articles with different applications are produced from polymer.\n\nThe three types of foams are flexible, rigid and semi-rigid foams. It’s used in many structural applications where they form light weight care. Cellular products contains gas usually air, within their structures, they have lower thermal conductivity and are therefore good thermal insulants. Because foams able to dissipate energy reversible and storage capacity. They are used in cushions and are exploited in upholstery bedding laminated clothing and packaging.\n\nEvery polymer can be produced in cellular form but these that have been extensively used includes, polyurethane, polystyrene, polyethylene, polyethylene, poly- (vinyl chloride), cellulose acetate, phenolies epoxides, urea-formaldehyde resins, silicones naturally rubber e.g. later from which is made from liquid starting material; sponge rubber and expanded rubber, both made from solid materials.  Cellular plastics are basically of two types, flexible foam and rigid or structural foam.  They may also be classified according to density as low density foam (< 100kg/m3), medium density foam (600-1000kg/m3).\n\nCellular polymers may have either an open-cell structure in which the cells are closed separate units (unicellular foams) and may contain gas or air.  Materials with open-cell structures have high permeability’s to liquid and gases but because closed – cell structures contains air, their elastic moduli in compression are higher and they have the best thermal insulations.\n\nPolyethylene foams can be produced by injection moulding or may be processed by special machines designed to measure the required ratio of chemical, mixing them together and dispense the reaction mixture in predetermined amounts.  There has been continuous development of machine for processing along side the development of polyethylene technology.\n\nBased on the environmental impact and protechona, new dimensions to further challenges in the development of polyethylene technology has taken place which have contributed to the increasing application of polyethylene in our daily lives from foam resistant coating.\n\nAs a matter of facts, this research project is centered on flexible foam of higher density and characterization and different types of polymeric reactions could produce different materials like plastics rubber, filmos, fire surface coating and adhesive.  As a result of variation in reaction hydroxyl groups of alcohol and isocyanate, senies of polyethylene products have been produced.  This ranges from flexible soft and revilement material to hard, brittle and rigid.\n\nGenerally, four bare isocyanates and a range of polyol of different molecular weight and functionalities are used in the production of whole spectrum of polyethylene products/materials.\n\nAs the case may be, various types of foams with different characteristics features are produced by varying the medium, mixing ratio etc.\n\n1.1              PROBLEM STATEMENT\n\nBased on the fact that some raw materials are gotten from out petrochenueal industries/chemical industries, these unused materials are property channeled to effective use in producing polymer materials e.g. foam, such materials are toluenemdi-isocyanata, polyether, resin, polyol, etc.\n\n1.2              AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT\n\nThis project/research is aimed at producing polyethylene foam that could be used or applied in various fields to satisfy human wants in Nigeria particularly and the world in general.\n\nIt is expected that if this research project is successful, a medium-layer scale industries would be established to best foam production.\n\nThirdly, an employment opportunity would be created for many Nigerians and would also bring foreign exchange to the country and also attract foreign investors to come into Nigeria.\nPRODUCTION OF HIGH QUALITY FOAM\n",

In this work, effort was made to point out the required steps taken in solid waste management.   \n\nSegregation at the source was done to get either the vegetable waste separated from the plastic waste; metallic waste from plastic waste. Segregation at the source was carried out to avert difficulties associated with waste (solid) handling, separation and in general the management of waste.\n\nMore still, the biodegradable more further treated as in composting; and non biodegradable treated as in recycling of metals (Aluminium) or plastics; all geared towards ensuring that wastes (litters) were not towering to an outrageous extent, such that the stench would not upset public health. The waste can be incinerated or burnt as in combustion. \n\nThere are various use to which the solid wastes are put; use as manure to increase and supplement the soil nutrient requirement; the gas (methane) effusing from the compost could be tapped and sold on a domestic gas; while combustion facilities burn municipal solid waste at a high temperature reducing waste volume and generating electricity.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENT\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.1       INTRODUCTION                \nCHAPTER TWO\n\n2.1         SOLID WASTE MGT.

        "content": " THE KINETIC STUDY ON HYDROLYSIS OF CELLULOSE (SAW-DUST)\n(Chemical Engineering Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\nABSTRACT\nThis research project studied on the kinetics of hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose. The steps employed to achieve this project involved extraction of cellulose from sawdust and subsequently, hydrolysis of starch to simple sugar. This was followed by glucose analysis. Different experiments were conducted during acid hydrolysis to study the various acids on the hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose. The saw-dust was extracted from the wood by grinding using saw. The process used in the hydrolysis was acid hydrolysis in which two major inorganic acids (Hydrochloric and Sulfuric) were used at constant temperature of 80oC. During this experiment, it was observed that Hydrochloric acid hydrolyzed most, followed by Sulphuric acid. Finally, sugar analysis was carried out to determine the acid with the highest yield of glucose and the best acid for the hydrolysis. It was noticed that the yield of glucose was relatively high from HCl at 1.280% concentration, followed by H2SO4 at 0.940%. It was also seen from the graph that the absorbance yield increases as the glucose concentrations increases in terms of HCl. Therefore, the best acid for acid for acid hydrolysis is HCl.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n1.1 INTRODUCTION\nCellulose is a naturally occurring polymeric material containing thousands of glucose-like rings each of which contain three alcoholic OH groups. Its general formula is represented as (C6H10O5 )n. The OH-groups present in cellulose can be esterified or etherified, the most important cellulose derivatives are the esters. Cellulose is the name given to a long chain of atoms consisting of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen arranged in a particular manner. Cellulose is found in nature in almost all forms of plant life, and especially in cotton and wood. A cellulose molecule is made up of large number of glucose units linked together by oxygen atom. Each glucose unit contains three(3) Hydroxyl groups, the hydroxyl groups present at carbon-6 is primary, while two other hydroxyl are secondary. Cellulose is the most abundant organic chemical on Earth more than 50% of the carbon in plants occurs in the cellulose of stems and leaves. Wood is largely cellulose, and cotton is more than 90% cellulose. It is a major constituent of plant cell walls that provides strength and rigidity and presents the swelling of the cell and rupture of the plasma membrane that might result when osmotic conditions favor water entry into the cell. Cellulose is a fibrous, tough, water-insoluble substances, it can be seen in cell walls of plants, particularly in stalks, stems, trunks and all woody portions of the plant.\n2\nCellulose is polymorphic, i.e there are a number of different crystalline forms that reflect the history of the molecule. It is almost impossible to describe cellulose chemistry and biochemistry without referring to those different forms. Cellulases are gotten from cellulose, cellulose is also found in protozoa in the gut of insects such as termites. Very strong acids can also degrade cellulose, the human digestive system has little effect on cellulose. The word cellulose means β-1,4-D-glucan, regardless of source because of the importance of cellulose and difficulty in unraveling its secrets regarding structure, biosynthesis, chemistry, and other aspects, several societies are dedicated to cellulose, lignin, and related molecules.\n1.2 SOURCES OF CELLULOSE\nCellulose for industrial conversion comes from wood and scores of minor sources such as kenaf paper and rayon are now made mostly from wood pulp. cotton rings were historically important for paper making, and cotton linters (short fibres are used to spin yams) are now used in high quality writing and currency papers.\nCellulose forms very tightly packed crystallites, these crystals are sometimes so tight that neither water nor enzymes can penetrate them; cellulose consists of two cellulose molecules;\n3\nCrystalline and amorphous cellulose. The crystalline cellulose is insoluble because of the inability of water to penetrate cellulose, On the other hand amorphous cellulose allows the penetration of endogluconase, another subgroup of cellulose that catalyze the hydrolysis of internal bonds. The natural consequences of this difference in the crystalline structure is that the hydrolysis rate is much faster for amorphous cellulose than crystalline cellulose.\nSome cellulose comes from the hairs (trichomes) on seeds, example: cotton, kapo and milk weed. A commercial bacterial cellulose product (cellulon) was introduced by Weyerhaeuser(22) for use in foods, the product is called primacel and is available from Nutrasweet kelco. Recently, cellulose from sugar belt pulp and from citrus pulp has aroused interest for use as a fat substitute.\n1.3 HYDROLYSIS\nHydrolysis of cellulose is the process of breaking the glucosidic bonds that holds the glucose basic units together to form a large cellulose molecule, it is a term used to describe the overall process where cellulose is converted into various sweeteners. Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction during which one or more water molecules are split into hydrogen and hydroxide ions, which may go to participate in further reactions.\n4\n1.4 SUGAR\nSugars (also called saccharides) are compounds containing an aldehyde or ketone group and two or more hydroxyl groups. Sugar can also a sweet crystalline substance obtained from sugar-cane and sugar beet. It includes sucrose, glucose and fructose.\n1.5 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\nThe clamour for the diversification of Nigerian economy through low quality products has motivated researchers to explore the numerous domestic, industrial and economic importance of one Nigeria`s major product (cellulose) which forms the bedrock of this project.\nSugar is a commodity of high demand for both domestic and industrial applications on daily basis in homes, small and medium scale industries e.t.c. this is why Nigeria government spends huge sums of money on importation of sugar and sugar products to meet the demand of citizens. Among the many processes of sugar production, is acid hydrolysis of (cellulose) has proved to be a process which encourages the production of high quality with minimum skill and materials. This work is therefore an effort to encourage industrialists, researchers, and students to carry out more intensive studies on production of sugar from cellulose for production of sugar and enhanced economic resources for the nation.\n5\n1.6 RELEVANCE OF THE STUDY\nNigeria is the largest producer of cellulose for which paper wood is made. A large percentage of produced cellulose is consumed as paper, textiles, newspaper and containers in form of writing, reading e.t.c.\nThe method of acid hydrolysis of cellulose:\n It creates job opportunities, hence, reducing unemployment in the country.\n It helps to know the best acid for the hydrolysis of cellulose.\n It establishes the industries for government to contribute immersely towards the country economy.\n With the methods of glucose and cellulose production, the cost of glucose and cellulose will reduce.\n It produces research workdone on the digestion of cellulose into glucose which I will engage on it after my graduation.\n1.7 OBJECTIVES.\nThe research project covers the processes, operations and pathways involved in the Acid hydrolysis of cellulose to produce (glucose) sugar. The research study aims at:\n6\n Quantifying and calculating the yield of glucose from the hydrolysis of cellulose using two different acids.\n The hydrolysis of cellulose into sugar using different concentration of hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid.\n7\nTHE KINETIC STUDY ON HYDROLYSIS OF CELLULOSE (SAW-DUST)",

Because of the problem encountered during the process.  Industrial equipment are being designed from experience rather than the fundamental theory because of the high dependency on the effective mixing of fluids and solids in unit operation process.\n\nThe term mixing, is applied in preparation of uniform combination of two or more material, which may differ in degree of homogeneity of mixed material.  The product from the process may be homogenous or heterogeneous.\n\nIn most chemical industries, factories even homes, two or more substances are expected to be properly mixed for a specific purpose.  To enhance these process, experimental agitation were developed to serve a broad practical and basic fluid mixing problems.  In process operation, he action of agitation enable one to predict the performance of a full equipment or help in establishing more general correlation in fundamental studies.\n\nThe application of propeller agitator is common in low viscous liquid which is commonly used in confectionary industries, liquid food drinks e.g five-alive, bottled drinks and canned beer.\n\nMixing machine (propeller egitator) is therefore indispensable to humanity and nutrition based industries.  However, varied method of material mixing are applicable in some cultural setting to form a homogenous product.\n\nThere are varieties of mixers, but in selecting a mixer for a purpose, some basic factors are put into consideration such as process requirements, equipment cost, flow properties of the process fluid.  The constructional material to achieve high level and the equipment chosen to meet all purpose requirements.  A good mixer is however the one which provides a well mixed product at lowest cost.\n\n1.1                   SCOPE AND OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT\n\nThe scope/objective of constructing a propeller agitator that is versatile in application in small scale, laboratory and domestic purpose which is usually of low viscous fluid.\n\nFrom literature survey on mixing constructed propeller agitator is not used for continuous process.  The components which are shaft blade and the impeller are for effective mixing.\nCONSTRUCTION OF PROPELLER AGITATOR",

A fresh palm wine was ated which was obtained  from Emene in Enugu State.  The characteristics that was tested before and after fermentation were; specific gravity, refractive index and PH value of the fermentated palm wine was first determined, after which samples were formulated for fermentation.  The yeast that was used in the course of fermentation process was the baker’s yeast (sacchromycess Cerevisae).  10 samples of 400ml each of the palm wine were used for the fermentation process, with variations in their yeast content and days of fermentation.  These were done under aerobic condition.  After fermentation, the samples were respectively distilled after fermentation with their corresponding values of; specific gravity, % by volume % by weight concentration and density of the distillates determined and recorded respectively.  Further more, the distillates obtained were separated and added together accordingly to be re – distilled. Thus, their corresponding values of % by volume, % by weight, specific gravity of the re – distilled products were determine3de and recorded accordingly.  From the result obtained, it shows that the minimum volume of alcohol obtained is 27.52% while the standard volume of alcohol required is 37% minimum.  This standard volume of alcohol was gotten from standard organisation of Nigeria (SON).\n\nTABLE OF CONTENT.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0       Introduction\n\n1.1       Objective of the study\n\n1.2       Scope of the work\n\n1.3              Significance\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\n2.0       Source of palm wine\n\n2.1       Nature or composition of palm wine\n\n2.2       Micro – organism in palm wine and its effect on alcohol production.\n\n2.3       Fermentation process\n\n2.3.1    Biological theory of fermentation\n\n2.3.2    Fermentation of carbohydrate to produce ethanol\n\n2.3.3    Factors that affect fermentation of palm oil\n\n2.4       Properties and uses of ethanol (ethyl alcohol)\n\n2.4.1        Physical properties of ethyl alcohol\n\n2.4.2        Chemical properties of ethanol\n\n2.4.3        Uses of ethanol\n\n2.5.0        Distillation: A separation process\n\n2.5.1        Batch distillation\n\n2.5.2        Flash distillation\n\n2.5.3        Continuous/Rectification distillation\n\n2.5.3.1              Fractionating operation\n\n2.5.3.2              Rectification and stipping combination\n\n2.6.0        Multi component distillation\n\n2.6.1        Two forms of multi component distillation\n\n2.6.1.1              Azeotropic distillation\n\n2.6.1.2              Extractive distillation\n\n2.6.2        Companion of Azeotropic and extractive distillation\n\n2.7.0        Low – pressure distillation\n\n2.8.0        Factors to consider in selecting a solvent during distillation operation\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\n3.0              Experimental Analysis\n\n3.1              Collection Of Palm Wine Sample\n\n3.2              Experimental determination of variables during fermentation\n\n3.3              Experimental method\n\n3.4              Experimental result\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\n4.0              Discussion\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\n5.0              Conclusion\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\n6.0              Recommendation\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\n7.0       REFERENCES\n\nAppendix I\n\nAppendix II\n\nAppendix III\n\nAppendix IV\n\nAppendix V\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0              INTRODUCTION\n\nThe manufacture of alcohol by fermentation has bee3n known since amtignity, the4 main purpose being the preparation of alcoholic beverages like beer, wine etc, the raw material is palm wine and any feed stuffy rich in carbohydrates, e.g wheat, barley, cassava, grapes, yams, apple, corn,  rich, potates, banana and   plantains.   Palm wine is made from the gap at the raffia palm or the oil palm which contain fermentable carbohydrate in solution.  It owes its white appearance to a suspension of yeast.  It’s fermentation therefore does not require the addition of yeast from an outside source.  Fermentation is in fact very rapid at ordinary te4mperaturein tropical countries with the production of alcohol and acids, especially ethanoic (i.e acetic) acid and large quantities of carbon dioxide.  Because of the large volume of carbon dioxide released during fermentation, fresh palm wine cannot be kept nor transported in sealed containers.  Fresh palm wine is sweet, because of the high content of in fermented sugar, It is consequently low in alcoholic content and hence only very neatly intoxicating.  On standing, however, fermentation proceeds rapidly, as a result of which the wine rapidly loses  its’ sweet taste due to a fall in the sugar content, it also becomes more sour and more intoxicating owing to a rise in the alcoholic. Content.  When fully fermented, it is very sour and strongly alcoholic.  The alcohol produced here is of course mainly ethanol.  However, the strides of fermentation using the production and characterization of alcohol from fermentated palm wine are necessary to form an understanding of any fermentation process.  In the beginning the only source for ethanol was from fermented starch or sugar, but later it was discovered that ethanol could be produced from the crude oil.  In the 20th century the production of ethanol from fermentation nearly disappeared when the crude oil became relatively cheaper.  But now it seems that this development has stopped and clock is now again moving backwards, faster and faster to the original source of ethanol which is from fermented starch or sugar.  Many fermentation processes are in direct competition with strictly chemical synthesis.  Alcohol, acetones, butyl alcohol and acetic acid produced by fermentation have largely been superceded by their synthetic counterparts .  Almost all major anti – biotic are obtained from fermentation process.  Dextrin is another fermentation product.   The micro biological production of vitamins has also becomes economically important.  Thus, alcohol being the major product of fermentation has contributed a lot in technological advancement.  The use of alcohol in motor vehicles is not a new technology.  When the first “otto motor” was produced, it was designed and constructed to use ethanol as fuel.  In countries like Brazil, the ethanol served as fuel.  In fact it has been used continuously since the twenties, though in some years in many small amount.  But even in the United States of America ethanol plants were operated during the second word war to produce motor fuel and explosive for the Army.  Now the crude oil prices are increasing with an unknown speed this more or less for gotten technology is awakening.\n\n1.1       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe aim of this research work is to produce ethyl alcohol of high quality from fermentation of palm wine. Both natural and industrial yeast6s will be used for the fermentation process.  It is believer that a pure and high quality of ethyl alcohol will be produced having its same physical, chemical and characteristics properties.  This research work will be of help in knowing the days of fermentation and quantity of ye4ast to be added using palm wine as a source of material.   Unemployment can be reduced by being creative, more espe3cially in making use of this research work.\n\n1.2       SCOPE OF THE PROJECT\n\nThe production of ethyl alcohol involves the use of palm wine, raphia wine and oil palm.  The wine to be used is palm wine.  The yeast to be used is industrial saccharomyces cerevisae (baker’s yeast), which helps to facilitate fermentation process.  The characteristics to be tested before and after fermentation includes, PH, specific gravity, temperature, volatility etc.  This work will not cover some areas due to material, time and financial constraints.  Areas t6hat would not be covered include; blending of alcohol by the use of additive, colour ants and flavou4r; bottling of the product, labeling, corking of the product and pasteurization method etc.  This research work will be restricted to the use of palm wine only, other and sources of carbohydrate such as cassava, potatoes, sugar cane could not be covered .\n\n1.3       SIGNIFICANCE\n\nThe significance or important of alcohol cuts acroos many sectors of our economy and it is used industries and domestically in the following ways:\n\nEthanol is an important solvent used to dissolve resins, varnishes , lacquer, soap, perfumes, dyes, druges and flavouring extract.\n\nEthyl alcohol is a raw material used in the manufacture of many important compound such as ethanol, ethyl ester, halides, ettoxy – ettane and trichoroethanol (chloral).\n\nEthyl alcohol is used as a fuel, either by itself mixed with petrol in racing cars and in rockets.  Because of its low freeze in automobile radiators.\n\nFinally, ethanol alcohol is present in many alcoholic beverages such as beers, wines, and spirits.\nFORMULATION AND PRODUCTION OF ALCOHOL FROM PALM WINE\n",

        "content": " INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT TECHNOLOGY IN PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL INDUSTRIAL\n(Chemical Engineering Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIndustrial wastewater treatment covers the mechanisms and process used to treat water that have been contaminated in some way by anthropogenic industrial or commercial activities prior to its release into the environment or its re-use.\n\n        Water is a natural and inorganic solvent with the composition of hydrogen and oxygen only (H20).  When there is addition of other organic or inorganic, substances (high levels of nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorous) in water which may come as a result of weather change domestic, waste, industrial waste, lack of awareness and ignorance, then the water is known as waste water which cause a disease called water borne diseases. \n\n        Wastewater is very dangerous especially to human beings and should be treated to avoid these dangerous diseases.\n\n        There are many method of treating waste water and they include:\n\n-              Primary Method\n\n-              Secondary Method\n\n-              Tertiary Method\n\nThe primary method  involves many treatment process such as;- screening process, skimming process and sedimentation process.\n\n        The secondary method of treatment also involves such treatment process such as aerated lagoons process, trickling filters process etc.\n\n        The tertiary method is the final method that involves disinfections process.  This process is used to polish and bring back the quality of water which include: PH value, hardness, flories, taste suspended solid, colour etc (Uche, 2011).\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0    INTRODUCTION\n\nWater is essential for the survival of any form of life.  On an average, a human being consumer about 2 litres of water everyday.  Water accounts for about 70% of the weight of a human body.  About 80% of the earth’s surface (ie 80% of the total 500 million hectares in area) is covered by water.  Out of the estimated 1,11 million km3 of the total water present on earth, only 33,400m3 of water is available for drinking, agriculture domestic and industrial consumption.  The rest of the water is locked up in oceans as salt water, polar ice caps and glaciers and underground. Owing to increased industrialization on one hand and exploding population on the other, the demands of water supply have been increasing tremendously.\n\n        However, consideration, part of this limited quality of water is contained by sewage, industrial waste and a wide array of synthetic chemicals.  The menace of water-borne diseases and epidemics still threatens the well being of population, particularly in under-developed and developing countries. \n\n        Thus, the quality as well as the quantity of clean water supply is of importance for the welfare of mankind (cheremissinof 1981).\n\n1.1    INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER\n\nAn industry is a place or an establishment for the production or making of things (products) in factories or companies. Industry uses large volume of water in its manufacturing and supporting operations.  Indeed, the chemical petroleum and other industries uses  a large volume of water that fare exceeds the combined volume of other raw materials, finishing operation generally draw appreciable quantities of water.  But it is not the water entering industrial works that actually becomes part of the manufactured product, a small fraction of the water is consumed or lost by evaporation while the larger fraction is not used or is employed non-consumptively.\n\n        The water that is employed non-consumptively becomes spent water and many contain mainly waste (Pollutants or contaminants) and that is the reason it is called wastewater.  When untreated wastewater accumulates and is allowed to go septic, the decomposition of the organic matter it contains will lead to nuisance   condition including the production of mal-odorous gases.  It can also contain pathogenic micro organisms that dwell in the human intestinal tract and nutrients which can stimulate the growth of aquatic plant and toxic compounds that potential may be mutagenic and carcinogenic.  For these reason, the immediate and nuisance free removal of wastewater from its source of generation, followed by treatment, reuse or disposal into the environment is necessary to protect public health and the environment.\n\n1.2    DEFINITION OF WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT    \n\nwastewater treatment is the collection, processing, treating, recycling or disposal of waste material in water (usually waste produced by human activities) in order to reduce their effect on human health and the environment.\n\n        Industrial wastewater, treatment covers the mechanism and processes used to treat waters that have been contaminated in some way by anthropogenic industrial or commercial activities prior to its release into the environment or its re-uses.\n\n        It can also be defined as the application of scientific and advanced methods in the recycling or disposal of unwanted water or combination of liquid removed from factories or companies like chemical and petroleum industries (Bachok et al, 1967).\n\n1.3    TO TREAT, REUSE AN DISPOSE WASTE WATER, IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE FOLLOWING\n\ni.      constituent of wastewater.\n\nii.      Effect of these constituent when water is dispersed into the environment.\n\niii.    The transformation and long-term fate of these constituents in the treatment processes.\n\n iv.    Treatment methods that can be used to remove the\n\nconstituent found in the wastewater.\n\nv.     Methods for beneficial use or disposal of the solid generated by the treatment system.\n\n1.3.1 CONSTITUENT OF WASTEWATER FROM CHEMICAL AND PETROLEUM INDUSTRIES\n\nChemical industry comprise the companies that produce industrial chemicals while a petroleum industry is an industry or company that refines oils and petro-chemical products.\n\n        The component of their waste can be classified into the following:\n\ni.             Organic waste such as oxygen demanding waste, disease causing waste, synthetic organic compounds, and oil pollutant/ waste.\n\nii.            Inorganic waste: this comprise of mineral acids, inorganic salts, finely divided metals, or metal compounds, trace elements, cyanides, sulphate, nitrates, etc.\n\niii.          Suspended solids and sediments are mostly contributed by soil erosion by natural processes, agricultural development, strip mining and construction activities.\n\n1.3.2 Effects of these constituents\n\nOxygen demanding waste causes depletion of dissolved oxygen (2.0) from the water and these is harmful to aquatic organisms.\n\n        Disease causing waste such pathogenic microorganism cause dangerous water borne disease like cholera, typhoid, dysentery and polio. Synthetic organic compounds such as peticides, insecticides and other chemicals are very toxic to plants and animals and humans.  Some of them causes offensive, odours and tastes in water.\n\n        Oil waste cause reduction of light transmission through surface waters thereby reducing photo synthesis by marina plants.  Also, it reduce the dissolved oxygen (D.O) in water and endangers water birds, coastal plants and animals.\n\n        In organic waste stimulate algal growths in water and metal toxicity in aquatic ecosystem.\n\n        It causes chromosome damage and interfere with the process of heredity in man.\n\n1.4       WATER QUALITY\n\nThe three parameters for assessing water quality are: physical, chemical and biological characteristic of water (Uche, 2010).\n\n1.4.1 PHYSICAL WATER QUALITY PARAMETER\n\nPhysical parameters analyze those characteristics of water that respond to the sense of sight, touch, taste, and smell.  Suspended solids, turbidity, colour, odur and temperature are the main factors that asses the physical water quality.\n\n1.4.2 CHEMCIAL WATER QUALITY\n\nThe chemical properties necessary for water quality management are; total dissolved solid (TDS), PH (alkalinity) hardness, fluorides, metals and organic compounds.\n\nI.           TOTAL DISSOLVED SOLIDS (TDS): Dissolved solids are the materials remaining after the filtration in which the suspended solids are separated and discarded.  The dissolved materials results from the solvent action of water on solids, liquids and gases.  Like suspended materials, dissolved substances may be organic or inorganic in nature.  Inorganic substances which can dissolved in water are minerals, metal and gases.  The sources of contact with these substances are in the atmosphere, on surfaces within the soil. Some of the common organic dissolved constituents of water are material from decay products of vegetation, organic chemicals and organic gases.\n\nII.        PH(Alkalinity):  Alkalinity is described as the quantity of ions in water that will neutralize hydrogen ions.  Alkalinity is simply the ability of water to neutralize acids.\n\nThe constituent of alkalinity in neutral water systems are C02-, 0H-, HSi03-2, H2B032-, HPo = HS etc.  The presence of these compounds in water in through dissolution of mineral substances in the atmosphere and within the soil.\n\nIII.       HARDNESS\n\nThis is concerned with the concentration of multivalent metallic cations is solution.  At supersaturated conditions, the hardness cations will react with anions in the water to form a solid precipitate.\n\nIV.       Fluorides: Flourides ions are among the few chemical substances that are needed to enhances the water at a small quantity.  At large quantities, fluorides is toxic to men and animals.  The floride concentration of approximately 1.0mg/L in drinking water help to prevent dental cavities in children.\n\nV.          Metals: The sources of metals in natural waters are through dissolution from natural deposits and discharges of domestic, industrial or agricultural wastewater.  All metals are soluble to some extent in water.  While excessive amounts of any metal may present health hazards, only those metals that are harmful in relatively small amount are commonly regarded as toxic.\n\nVI.       Organic: Most natural organics are the decay products of orgnics solids, while synthetic organics are usually the result of waste water discharge or agricultural practices.  Dissolve organics in water are usually divided into two broad categories, biodegrade and non-biodegradable.  Biodegradable material consists of organic that caneb utilized for food by naturally occurring micro-organisms within a reasonable length of time.  They include: starches, fats proteins, esters and adelydes.  Non biodegradable organic are materials that are resistant to biological degradation, they include; tonnic and liquid acid, cellulose and phenols which are most often found in water.\n\n1.4.3         BIOLOGICAL WATER QUALITY\n\nWater serves as a medium, in which most of the micro organisms reside.  Aquatic organisms range in size and complexity from the smallest single cell micro –orgnism to the largest fish.  All members of the biological community are to some extent serving as water quality assessment as the presence or absence may indicate in general term the characteristics of a given water body.\n\n1.5    TREATMENT METHOD \n\nThe method of treating wastewater are classified into the following:\n\ni.             Primary Treatment\n\nii.            Secondary Treatment\n\niii.          Tertiary Treatment\n\nPrimary Treatment\n\nThis is a types of treatment that involves the removal of materials that can easily be collected from the raw wastewater and a physical operation usually sedimentation is used to remove the floating and settlable materials found in the wastewater.  Examples of materials that can be removed during primary treatment include; large objects, rags, goit, fats, oil and grease and floating materials.\n\nSecondary Treatment\n\nThis involves the use of biological /chemical processes in removing most of the organic matter.\n\nTertiary (Advances) Treatment\n\nThis involves the use of physical and chemical process in removing residual suspended solids and constituents that are not reduced significantly by conventional secondary treatment.  It is aimed at polishing the effluent from the secondary treatment process in order to improve the quality of the water.\nINDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT TECHNOLOGY IN PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL INDUSTRIAL",

The wheelbarrow at the axle, the serve applied at the handles and coal or resistance between the two in the body.  It is used by laborers, farmers, gardeners and others for transporting loads too heavy or bucky to be carried by hand and is similar to hand trucks used by warehouse men and industrial workers expect that the latter has two wheels.  Modern wheel barrow are made of wood or of a light metal, such as aluminum, and have a rubber fire on the wheel.  A two-wheel vehicle for carrying garden materials is more properly called a garden cart.\n\nThe purpose of the production of this machine is to reduce alleviate and possibly eliminate the sufferings, time, money, wastage of man-power and more especially the need for technological break-through and self reliance, which has been a major concern of the federal government.\n\nMoreover, this project at hand has delved into simplicities and the construction of this machine that can be used to carry different types of heavy load to any distance.\n\n1.2              ORIGIN AND HISTORY\n\nThe wheelbarrow like any technology in the common place, was a story to tell.  The west was very slow to invent the wheelbarrow.  Do the earliest known European wheelbarrow gleams down from a stained glass windows in charless cathedral.\n\nBut the Chinese have had wheelbarrow for millennia.  They celebrate a half-mythical inventor named K0 Yu.  It is not know when he lived but since then, the Chinese have shaped wheelbarrows in enormous variety.  They’ve used them for every kind of task.\n\nIt migue help to consider just what an industrial wheelbarrow is.  It combines the advantages of both the wheel and the leveler.  The load is centered behind a single wheel that way, you have to lift only a small part of the load.  The two handles give an intimacy of control you don’t have with a four-wheeled cart.  If you ever had to use a wheel barrow, you know its easy with the load in the right place.  It can be back breaking when the load’s too far behind the wheel.\n\nChinese armies made the first use of the wheelbarrows.  It give them such an advantage in moving goods that it was kept secret.  Early Chinese writings talk about wheelbarrows in code.  K0 Yu, one ancient text tells us built a “wooden goat” and rode away into the mountains on it.  They called a wheelbarrow with handles in front a “wooden ox” one with handles at the back was a “glinding horse”\n\nLong ago, the Chinese invented wheelbarrows with sails that were no idle experiment said – driven wheelbarrows became a well-developed and widespread technology.  And the sails were prefect miniatures of the ones used in junk. \n\nAnd we, with all our vaunted technology, have yet to build wheelbarrows with the grace, balance, variety and features of these in China.\n\n It was not until the seventeenth century, when direct contact was made between European and China, as a result of trade, each area had it own distinct form of wheelbarrow, although by this time both were frequently modified to serve other needs than those for which they were designed.\n\n1.3              IDENTIFICATION OFFERED\n\nThe purpose of the production of this machine is to reduce difficulties and probably eliminate the suffering time, money, cost of man-power and most especially the need for technological break through and self-reliance which has been a major concern of the human being.  Carrying of load on human head has been a tiring problem in the society from this commercial especially towards our loco-parenthesis.\n\nIt helps eradicate those problems; this project write up has been delivered into simplifications and the constructions of this machine that can be used in carrying different types of this machine that can be used in carrying different types of heavy objects to different areas.\n\nWheelbarrow is a machine that makes use of a bowel, made of metal used in carrying loads or is a simple machine that helps us life, pull, increase direction of heavy things change the direction of force and increase force.\nCONSTRUCTION OF WHEELBARROW",

It is still however true to say that the bulk of current commercial plastic are modified organic chemical, and that the inorganic polymers and the organic-metallic are limited in production and used only for special purpose .plastic form a group of high polymers which have a fair range of deformability and mould ability particularly at high temperature. In plastic, the polymer formed don’t have the same molecular weight and since the polymer are not amenable to the ordinary method of separation. Injection molding process, of all other process such as, calendaring, casting , forming,expanding, coating decorating etc, was used  because of its applicability in the production of  several different types of products. It also reduces loses due to mouilding.The process involves the use of authomated injection machine which consist of two major part: injection section and clamping section . The injection section consist of the section pump which enable the feed (pellets of mixed co-polymer raw material and the colours) to be introduce into the feed hopper. It also has the hopper part that allows the fed pellets to enter into the ram chamber where it is pushed into the heating cylinder where the pellets are melted in the presence of high heat generated by the electric heat. The movement of torpedo backward and forward aids the inlet of the pellets, as it goes forward .  On moving backward , the molten plastic enters the injection nozzle which pushes the molten plastic into the mould which is detachable, and also attachable depending on the type of product to be produced. The mould is aided with a cooling film that allows the molten moulded plastic to be cooled, and formed the shape of the mould.\n\nThe shaped molton plastic could come in form of either a seat, table, bucket, cup etc. the products will have some durable characteristics such as colour retainability, because of the anti-ultravident rays added to oppose the action of the ultra violent rays from the sun that causes the colour fade in some plastic. Several other additives were added such as plasticizers, extenders, lubricants, stabilizers, fillers, pigments and other miscellaneous additives, so as to obtain the best qualities such as flexibility, smooth, electric insulation and strength. The cost of this production is quite enormous considering the cost of raw materials and the colours, the cost of all the additives, the cost of the injection machines and moulds and other costs such as: transportation, installation of the machine, electricity and other overhead costs. Research cost and labour costs are not overhead. Utility cost (water, power and fuel) are also included.\n\nDue to the liquid qualities introduce, such as machinability, low density, durability even in the presence of sun and chemicals, high creeping factor resistance even in the presence of heat, its inability to crack and graze in the presence of stress from environmental and its considerable strength, we affirm that the product is of high rating.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS CHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWHAT ARE PLASTICS?\n\nTYPES OF PLASTICS\n\nCHAPTER TWO\nLITERATURE REVIEW\n\nPLASTIC  FABRICATION:\n\n2.1.0.

These materials are still very much in evidence today, but in many instances they have been replaced by the new wonder materials called PLASTICS. Through the magic of the chemist, we now have plastics that can meet almost every engineering requirement.\n\nThe first man-made plastic was nitrocellulose. It was developed by chemist in both America and Europe who had been trying to find new uses for cellulose, the basic substances for wood and cotton. They finally succeeded in synthesizing the new chemical by treating the cotton fibres with nitric acid. In 1970, a young painter named John Wesley Hyatt and his brother Isaiah added camphor to nitrocellulose to form the first commercially successful plastic, which they called celluloid. The new materials was used to make combs, bashes, photographic film, and early automobile windows and safety glass. But celluloid has two inherent weaknesses that have severely curtailed its use in modern times.\n\ni.                    It is highly flammable.\n\nii.                  In the form of clear film, it yellows upon aging.\n\nThe second plastic to appear on the market was called Bakelite. It was developed by Dr Leo Baekland in 1909. Dr Baekeland had been searching for a synthetic coating material to replace shellacs. He began experimenting with two chemicals, phenol and formaldehyde, the two was combined with catalyst to form the new material. Bakelite was also used for moulding, casting, adhesive bonching and electrical insulation.\n\nWHAT ARE PLASTICS?\n\nMost plastics are man-made materials with the ability to flow, take shape and solidify. They are made from chemicals extracted from substances such as petroleum, coal, air, water and agricultural by-products. The production sequence starts with the manufacturer of raw materials who combines the various chemicals to form meltable solids and syrupy liquids called resins.\n\nUnlike metals, plastics are light in weight, pleasant to touch and easy to form .complicated shapes are easily reproduced by molding , casting .because they are do not allow electricity to pass through them , they are used extensively in dielectric application . they are also poor conducts of temperature which accounts for their use as pot handles ,electric iron handles refrigerator housing and thermos bottles .\n\nPlastics are very versatile materials .some have great optical clarity ,and most can be colored in a wide range of colures shapes . one plastics ,acrylic is even clears than glass e.g. lens .because the dyes for colored plastics are mixed with the raw materials , the completed p need never be painted . plastics surfaces are also free from the atmospheric corrosion that is prevalent with some metals .the light weight of plastics is still another advantage over metals, like polypropylens, are lighter than water and therefore float on water.\n\nThe ability of plastics to be foamed has led to a completely new concept of lightweight construction. Rigid urethane foams are already fericling wide use in furniture and other structural applications. The strength of a rigid urethane foam panel weighing 816/ cup is something to behold, especially when one considers the fact that water weighs 62.4 u per cuft. Another extraordinary development is light weight structure is the combining of plastics binders and adhesive with honey comb and farcing materials to form panels with out standing weight – to- strength ratios. Honey comb application have in waded such basic fields as transportation, architecture, illumination air craft and gaicted missiles, electronics , materials handling home appliances and instrumentation . Indeed, both the engineer and the architect are in constant search for materials that will improve , economy , weight – to – strength ratio and ease of fabrication with no sacrifice in performance .\n\nMany plastics can be coated with a thin metal film to change their appearance or meet a functional requirement bright, glossy , chromium – coated plastics are especially popular. They are difficult to distinguish from solid metal unless lifted by hand, at which time the much lighter plastics is very discernable . pumping fixtures and toys are among the more popular applications of metallized plastics .\n\nAn important breakthrough in surgery has been the use of plastics as implantations in the human body strong, tough, Ron allergic plastics are finding increased use as replacements for effective blood vessels and other damaged parts of the body . the softer silicone rubbers are also used for implantation , but mostly for cosmetics purpose .\n\nPlastics products are now being produced more quickly and in larger volumes , thanks to the tremulous stickles made in injection , compression and transfer molding .improved mechanization of automatic and semiautomatic machines plus improved molding materials have brought about shorter cure cycles and a reduction in handling operations .\n\nMany plastics can be used in specialized chemical resistant application . with few exception (such as the fluorocarbons ) , most plastics materials are attacked by one or more chemicals .By careful materials selection, light weight, unbreakable plastics can be used to replace glass and stainless steel as chemical containers . In many instances, plastics have replaced stainless steel as  industrial clouting used to carry away chemical vapor .\n\nPlastics have replaced paper in many packaging applications plastics-foam packing materials provide more protection for boxed products than crushed paper does. Many product, particularly delicate electronics equipment , are packed in foamed plastics inserts that got the shape of the item exactly.  Plastics wraps have many uses. They preserve foods longer than paper wraps can.\n\nPlastics have also replaced wood and stone in many applications. Furniture makers use plastics to produce cabinet doors and table tops that look like wood but are easier to clean and do not warp . Plastics have also replaced wood in boat hulls, boats are stronger than wooden ones and require less maintenance.\n\nThe textile industry used plastics to replaced such natural fibers as cotton , silk and wood.  Plastic fibers have such qualities as strength, curability and resistance to stains and wrinkling .plastics are also used to create synthetic leathers\n\nTYPES OF PLASTICS\n\nThere are two main groups of plastics:\n\n    thermoplastics\n    thermo set\n\nThermoplastics are materials that remain permanently feasible. this means that they will melt when exposed to sufficient heat . For each thermoplastic, there is a specific temperature at which the material will start to distort. this is known as the heat distortion point . Most raw materials used in the production of thermoplastics products are melt able solids in the form of granules and powders such as those used for injection molding and extrusion . they are simply heated and melted into specific shapes though thermoplastics melt readily , they do have a high melt viscosity and require pressure in addition to heat to force them into molds . the shape of the mold being produced and resolidification takes place when the mold is cooled below the heat distortion point of the materials .\n\nThermo set raw materials are supplied in an uncured or partially cured state and are fully cured during the fabrication operation by the action of a catalyst or other curing agent .all require a form of heat to initiate the chemical change . the heat can come from an oven ,press , lamb or in some cases , from just the curing agent alone as it reacts with the resume . once cured , thermo sets becomes permanently infusible which means they cannot be melted down like thermoplastics and are used primarily in reinforced plastics . inherently, they are somewhat brittle but are combined with reinforcements such as fiber glass to form composites of great strength , some even surpassing metals in a weight – to strength ratio . when a thermo set is heated , it undergoes a chemical reaction called cross- linking , which binds its polymer chains together . this reaction is similar to the hardening of an egg when it is boiled . Product made from thermosetting plastics include pot handles , trays for sterilizing medical instruments and parts for airplanes and spacecraft . Manufactures and prefer to use thermo sets for such products as plastic seats on buses instead of thermoplastics because some thermoplastics tend to lose their shape when exposed to constant pressure over a long period of\n\nThermoplastics are those plastics formed by addition polymerization which is capable of repeated by softened by heat , remolded and hardened by cooling some typical thermoplastics are a acrylic (repex), acryonitrile (nylon) , polyethylene (polyethylene) , poly-propylene, polyvinyl Acetate (PVA), polystyrene\n\nThermo set are plastic formed by condensation polymerization which cannot be remolded by heating some typical thermo sets are bakelite , epoxy , melamine polyester ,polyurethane , phenolics amnions alkycls      .Thermoplastics differs from thermo sets in that thermoplastics do not cure or set under heat but thermo sets do\nPRODUCTION OF PLASTIC MATERIALS",

Many people suffer from all sorts of diseases as a result of air pollution and un-kept environment.\n\nThe use of disinfectants and air fresheners (deodorant) proceeded the scientific understanding of their action and seems to have arisen from the observation that certain substances stopped the putrefaction of meat or rotting of wood and even control of pollution.\n\nThe term deodorant (Air freshener) was first used by Pringle in 1950 to describe substance that prevent awful smell or odour from the environment. The idea was eventually applied to the treatment of odours from a piggery arenas. However, it was not until the nineteenth century that “Air freshener” came into general use. \n\nThe corner-stone of modern air fresheners was land by the end of the last century. By then the growing coal-tar industry was already producing phenol, phenolsulphonate, pyrethrin, cresol, creosote fractions and it was found that efficient deodorant could be made by using the ethyl or isopropyl alcohol.\n\nIn 1903, a third type of deodorant made its appearance, a coloured oil fluid (light blue) deodorant made by moral which was an emulsions of high aromatic chemicals. The fluid contained about 30 – 40% of phenols. A part from their much higher germicidal coefficients they were miscible in sea or very hard water without breakdown or loss in germicidal efficiency for this reason, they were largely indented for by the ‘Royal Navy’  in preference to other deodorizers.\n\nIn the pursuit of these deodorant that perfume emerge; which tends to pave way for liquid air fresheners.\n\nOnly occasionally has a new original odour been developed, such as old spice, which immediately won spontaneous and favourable response from consumers. Not many persons realize how complex the creation of an acceptable fragrance has become; it requires professionals knowledge, skill and experience, coupled with specialization in synthetic chemistry technical problems followed by consumer panel testing.   \n\nAir re-freshener takes times to act. The inherent rates of action of deodorants vary enormously; some powerful chemicals are effective in few seconds but must powerful chemicals requires minutes, hours and even days. A higher temperature, a higher concentration of air re-freshener and a smaller number of organism to be killed decreases the time required.   \n\nSome air re-fresheners are more active in acid, others in alkaline environment. All air re-fresheners are to some extent neutralized by organic matter. The power of penetration is important in enabling an air freshener reach organism protected by organic matter, and odour etc.\n\n1.1       MOTIVATION\n\nIt has been said by the Head of States and even passed into law, that importation of foreign goods must be stop. And that Nigerians as a whole should embark on made in Nigeria goods. The need arises for its production from locally raw material in order to reduce cost of buying from abroad and subsequently importation into the country.\n\nThis project is designed towards providing alternative sources of raw materials for production of liquid deodorants. This will in very production of liquid deodorants. This will in very large measure and in minimizing, if not stopping entirely, the present syndrome which does not only constitute a severe drain on our economy but has also turn our country into a fertile dumping ground for both low quality and out dated liquid deodorant and it will also create job opportunities for the producers in the country.\n1.2         OBJECTIVES\n\nThis work is aimed at developing an economical and indigenous way of producing liquid deodorant using locally raw materials in the best interest of small-scale industries thereby conserving their foreign exchange earnings.\n\nBut in Nigeria, over ninety percent of the liquid deodorant in use are imported either as finished or semi-finished product. Even the very little produced locally are still based on synthetic raw materials, which are also imported. This is rather unfortunate considering that numerous natural sources locally available form which the basic raw materials for the production of liquid deodorant can be obtained.\n\nIn cognizance of these facts, it becomes necessary and indeed of paramount importance that alternative sources of raw material be sought.\n\nEven if the raw materials become locally available in commercial quantities and at reasonable cost, and with other to achieve a certain richness and natural character in liquid deodorants.\n\nAlthough study processing of materials and reconstructing them by synthesis, the moment is far when gravity, solubility, refractive index, optical rotation, acid value, extra-value and among others knowledge of these physical characteristics helps in the designing of the quality of the eventual product obtained.\n\nFinally an attempts is made at formulating specific brands of liquid deodorants from different oils using standard procedures.\n1.3         CONCEPT OF ODOUR\n\nOdours whether emanating from a sweet-smelling gardenia or a rank sweat sock are volatile chemicals that can kill olfactory neukons. Odour can induce bad mood, interfere with falling asleep, disturb sleep induce headche, nausea, fit of coughing, interfere with reading and thinking, interfere with recreation, induce vomiting, and interfere with bad breathing.\n\nWe smell by a chemical and physiological process. The keys to this process have only recently been discovered. Smells are carried on objectives, air and water. We smell by certain molecules dissolving onto hair-like cilia receptors that extend down from the olfactory bulb of the brain and into the nasal cavity.\n\nThe nose can distinguish more than 10,000 different odours in nature with only about 1000 different odour nerve receptors available in the nose for that purpose.\n\nWe detect odours by using at least a thousand different special genes that are active exclusively in the cells of our odour nerve receptors. These special genes help our odour nerve receptors paint a picture for each colour. Any slight change in the molecular “picture” can charge a sweet smell into a foul one and vice versa.\n1.4         ELECTRONIC NOSE\n\nScientists have endowed computers with eyes to see (digital cameras) ad ears to hear (via microphones and sophisticated recognition software). Now they are taking computes further into the realm of the senses with the development of an “Artificial Nose”.\n\nAn electronic nose must be “trained” to recognize an odour abnormality. Electronic noses combined with artificial neural (ANN) technology allow these instruments to be trained. ANNS are artificial intelligence Networks which, like humans, can “Learn” through exposure to stimuli.\n1.5         Benefits of electronic noses The benefits of electronic noses include compactness, portability, real-time analysis, and automation. In some instances, electronic noses can be used to argument or replace panels of human experts. In other cases, electronic noses can be used to reduce the amount of analytical chemistry that is performed in food production especially when qualitative results will do. An electronic nose has applicability as a diagnostic tool. An electronic nose can examine odours from the body (eg breath, wounds, body fluid etc) and identity possible problems. \nPRODUCTION OF HIGH QUALITY LIQUID AIR REFRESHER\n",

These raw materials are found to be very much in abundance. Some are materials sourced from the ground and others are from agricultural wastes.\n\nThree different types of ceiling boards were produced, their difference being in the type of fibre that was used. The fibres used for this different type includes; cellulose fibre obtained from pulped carton, saw dust and rice husk.\n\nThe raw materials used for the production of the different ceiling boards includes, cement, calcium carbonate (CaCo3), Kaolin, starch and water.\n\nThe first type produced is from pulped carton. First, the cartons were collected, size reduce, soaked in a large quantity of water for 24hours, strained to remove the water and the milled by grinding using a motar and pestle. The quantity to be used was weighed out. The other raw materials which include starch, powdered kaolin, calcium carbonate and water were all measured. The pulped carton was poured and thoroughly mixed. The CaCo3, kaolin and starch and water were all measured. The pulped Carton was poured into the reactor; next cement was poured and thoroughly mixed. The CaCo3, kaolin and starch was added one after the other while stirring continued. Finally, water was added sparingly and gradually until a very smooth slurry was obtained. This was then poured into a mould and smoothened out using a roller and was left to dry. It took 7days for it to get dry.\n\nThe next produced was ceiling board from sawdust. The sawdust was first sieved, soaked for a day and then strained to remove the water. The quantity used was measured as well as all the other raw materials that was used. The same procedure was repeated as that of the first method and it was allowed to dry. It took three days to dry.\n\nFinally, ceiling board using rice husk was produced. The rice husk was sieved, materials to be used weighed out and procedure repeated again in this case and allowed to dry. It took 5 days for it to dry. Drying was done with solar energy for all cases.\n\nThe three different types were subjected to different test. This includes; moisture content test percentage humidity, bursting strength. The weight of the wet samples and dry samples was obtained as well as the density and volume.\n\nFinally, the different ceiling boards were coasted. Ceiling board from cellulose fibre (Sample A) costs N186.00 for the production, that of sawdust costs N184.00 while that of rice husk costs N185.00.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENT\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0       INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1       Aims and Objectives of the Project\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW\n\n2.0       History of Ceiling Board\n\n2.1       Types of Ceiling Board\n\n2.1.1        Asbestos Cement Ceiling Board\n\n2.1.2        Acoustical Ceiling Board\n\n2.1.3        Gypsum Ceiling Board\n\n2.1.4        Gypsum Fibre Celling Board\n\n2.1.5        Cement Fibre Ceiling Board\n\n2.2              Raw Materials Used For The Production Of Ceiling Boards\n\n2.2.1        Cement\n\n2.2.2        Fibre\n\n2.2.3        Starch\n\n2.2.4        Calcium Carbonate\n\n2.2.5        Kaolin\n\n2.2.6        Additives\n\n2.2.7        Pigments\n\n2.2.8        Fludifiers\n\n2.3              The Study Of Thermal Properties Of The Ceiling Boards\n\n2.3.1        Thermal Comfort\n\n2.3.2        The Principles Of Thermal Insulation\n\n2.3.3        Typical Thermal Properties Of Some Ceiling Boards\n\n2.3.4        Conductivity Of Porous Materials\n\n2.3.5        Surfaces Coefficients\n\n2.4              Study Of Acoustic Properties\n\n2.4.1        Acoustic Properties\n\n2.4.2        Sound Absorption\n\n2.4.3        Basic Factors In Acoustic Design\n\n2.4.4        Manufacturing Process\n\n2.5              Manufacturing Process\n\n2.5.1        The manufacture of wood wool cements ceiling board.\n\n2.5.2        Production Of Ceiling From Various Types Of Fibred\n\n2.5.3        Production Of Ceiling Board From Paper\n\nCHAPTER THREE.\n\n3.0              Manufacturing Process\n\n3.1       Apparatus and Equipment Used For the Production\n\n3.2              Chemicals And Materials Used For The Production\n\n3.3              Composition Of Materials Used For The Production\n\n3.4              Preparation Of Raw Materials\n\n3.5              Production Procedure\n\n3.6              Dying\n\n3.7              Trimming\n\n3.8              Analysis Of The Samples\n\n3.8.1        Introduction of the samples\n\n3.8.2        Composition of sample sheet\n\n3.8.3        Test and result of test\n\n3.8.4        Rate of drying\n\n3.8.5        Bursting strength\n\n3.8.6        Moisture strength\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\n4.0              Costing\n\n4.1       Cost of Raw Materials\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\n5.0              DISCUSSION\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\n6.0              CNCLUSSION/RECOMMENDATION\n\nReference\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA ceiling board is a horizontal slab covering the upper section of a room or internal space. A ceiling board is generally not structural but is a shell concealing the details of the structure above. However, the ceiling might be holding up building materials such as heat or sound insulation.\n\nIn modern buildings, electric lights, smoke detector, security cameras and signage are commonly attached to ceilings.\n\n            This project however, is based on the production of ceiling board from local raw materials. These local raw materials include cement, fibre cellulose, fibre obtained from ground paper, mainly waste paper, water and some other additives.\n\n            There are different types of ceiling boards. These include;\n\n1)      Gypsum ceiling boards;\n\n2)      Acoustical ceiling boards;\n\n3)      Gypsum fibre ceiling boards;\n\n4)      Cement fibre-ceiling boards. Etc\n\nThese types of ceiling boards are grouped in accordance to the raw materials used for the production. Gypsum ceiling boards are produced from gypsum, Acoustical ceiling boards are obtained from mineral wool, gypsum and small amount of paper and starch. Gypsum fibre ceiling boards are produced from gypsum and fibre to reinforce the ceiling board.\n\n            This study however will be based mainly on the production of fibre cement ceiling boards. This consist essentially of an inorganic binder usually calcium silicate formed by the chemical reaction of a siliceous material and a calcareous material. This is reinforced by organic fibres, fillers and pigment compatible with the fibre reinforced cement to form a ceiling board.\n\nIn the past, ceiling boards were produced using Asbestos a fibre present naturally in rocks. It was used because of its high tensile strength, poor heat conductivity and high fire resistance. However, asbestos causes asbestosis, which leads to cancer. As a result of this problem, manufacturers of ceiling boards went into research to find out substitutes that can be used in the production of ceiling boards.\n\nThis substitute includes shredded wood, cellulose fibre agricultural waste etc.\n\nRather than industrial products (glass-fibre, iron fillings) and man-made\n\nmaterials, the fibres best suited to the socio-economic circumstances of developing countries are natural fibres.\n\nThis project therefore, is based on how these natural fibres can be used in the production of ceiling boards in order to reduce cost and as well comparing the product with that which has been produced naturally.\n\n1.1       AIMS AND OOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT\n\n1.                  To study the possibility of making use of local raw materials for the production of ceiling board.\n\n2.                  To produce a board with good acoustic and thermal insulating properties.\n\n3.                  To produce a board with reduced cost to discourage importation there by saving Nigeria her foreign exchange and booting her economic status.\n\n4.                  To reduce environmental pollution caused by indiscriminate litering of papers and the pollution of the air resulting from burning these waste.\n",

The local raw material were subjected to various processing conditions in order to obtain purified perfume.  The methods generally used in this work include expression steam distillation and solvent extraction.\n\nDuring the production of vapourized and liquid perfume the modern solvent for blending and holding perfume materials is highly refined ethanol mixed with more or less water according to the solubilities of the oils employed.  This solvent with its volatile nature helps to project the scent it carries, and it is fairly inert to the solute and is not too irritating to the human skin.\n\nThe slight natural odour of the alcohol   is remove by deodorizing of the alcohol.  This is accomplished by adding a small amount of gum benzoic or other resinous fixatives to the alcohol and allowing it to mature for a week or two.  The result is an almost odorless alcohol, the natural rawness having been neutralized by the resins.  Other vehicles added to this includes benzene which is a solubilizer and methanol in their required proportions.\n\nFor vaporized perfumes , it has light quantity benzene while the liquid perfume has little   or no of benzene and it contains more of the fragrance than the vapourized perfume.\n\nHowever, it can be concluded that liquid and vapourized perfumes can be produced using local raw materials.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nCHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION Motivation\n\nObjective of the project\n\n2.0              CHAPTER TWO LITRETURE REVIEW\n\n2.1       Brief description of perfumes\n\n2.2              Historical background of perfumes\n\n2.3              Classification of perfumes\n\n2.4              Uses, application and general\n\nImportance of perfumes\n\n2.5              Raw material used in perfumery\n\n2.6              Chemical composition and chemistry of perfumes\n\n2.7               Quantity standards and physical characteristic\n\n2.8              General method of isolating essential oil\n\n2.9              Formulation procedure of perfumes\n\n3.0              CHAPTER THREE EXPERIMENTAL\n\n3.1       Raw material\n\n3.2              Equipment and general process description\n\n3.3              Exaction procedures\n\n3.4              Perfumes compounding and formulation\n\n3.5              Characterization  of perfume\n\n4.0              CHAPTER FOUR RESULT AND DISCUSSIONS\n\n4.1       Results\n\n4.2              Analysis and discussion of result\n\n5.0       CHAPETR FIVE COCLUSION AND RECOMMANDATION\n\n5.1              Conclusion\n\n5.2              Recommendations\n\n5.3              General recommendations\n\nReference\n\nAppendix\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe word perfumes take its name form the latin word perfumery (to fill with smoke) since in its original form, it was incense burner in Egyptian temple early it was found in a mixture of finely ground spices help together by Mgrrh or storax.\n\nIt occur in certain spices and flowers were steeped in fat or oil, the fat or oil would retain a portion of the odoriferous principle which can be blended  by a constitutes like vehicle a solvent and fixture.\n\nIt also occur in some leaves, seals fruits and grasses.  It first production data back to the 6th century BC when God gave Moses an instruction to make an acter of twin incense and Aaron shall burn there on sweet morning (ref  Exodus 30:23)\n\nEarly incenses was merely mixture of finely ground spices held together by myrrh or storax.  The next advance was the discovery that, if certain spices and flower were steeped in fat & oil “Avicenna” the Arabian physician discovered steam  distillation of volatile oils during his search for medical petion, he found that flower boiled in an alembic with water gave up some of their essence to the distillate.\n\nHence, the quest for sweet smelling substance (perfume) was born perfumery look it genesis from the midst of antiquity, and in present day’s till maintains its ageless quality “sweet smelling fragrance”\n\nMOTIVATION\n\nDue to the various uses of body perfume in the country, the new arises for its production from locally raw material  in trade to reduce cost of buying from aboard and subsequent important into the country.\n\nThis project is therefore towards providing alternative source of raw material for the production of perfume.  This will be in very large measure aid in minimizing, if not slopping entirely, the present important syndrome which does not only constitute a sever chain on our economy but has also turn our country into a fertile dumping ground for both low quality and out dates perfumery and it will also create job opportunities in the countries.\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nThis work is aimed at developing an economical and indigenous way of producing body perfume using locally raw material in the best interest of small scale industries there by conserving their foreign exchange earnings.\n\nBut in Nigeria over ninety percent of the perfumes in use are imported either as finished or semi finished product.\n\nEven the very little produced locally are still based on synthetic raw material, which are also imported.  This is rather unfortunate, considering that numerous natural sources locally available form which the basic raw material for the production of perfume can be obtained.  In cognizance of these facts, it become necessary and indeed of paramount importance that alternative source of raw materials be sought.\n\nEven if the raw material locally available in commercial quantities and at reasonable cost, and with other advantage, natural product must be used in other to achieve a certain richness and natural character in perfumes. Although study is progressing material and in reconstructing them by synthesis the moment is still far of when gravity, solubility, refractive index, optical rotation, acid value, ester value, iodine value and among other.  A knowledge of these physical characteristics help in the designing of the quality of the eventual product obtained. \n\nFinally, an attempt is made at formulating specific brands of perfume from different oils using standard procedures.\nPRODUCTION OF LIQUID AND VAPOURIZED PERFUME\n",

Polish has being of immense importance in protecting leather surfaces and enhancing their beauty.\n\nTo produce a standard polish, hard waxes such as carnduba wax, candelhla wax and palm wax; semi-hard waxes which include, paraffin wax and ozokerite; solvents like tupentine and naphtha; dyes and dryers are essential. In this research project, paraffin wax, turpentine; paraffin oil,. Cobalt and lead dryers, vanish, black and brown pigments were used to obtain the desired result.\n\nThe apparatus was set up as can be seen in fig1. Using the measured quantities of the ingredients, the production started with heating to about 90oc to melt the wax and cooling to about 600c. This was preceded by the addition of the solvent, the colorant, dryer and vanish. As this was being done, there was continuous agitation. After obtaining a homogenous mixture, the product was filled into 50ml cans and allowed to cool. The best formulation was obtained from 45.2%, 24%, 21%, 2%, 2%, 2% of turpentine, paraffin wax,  paraffin oil, drier, vanish and colorant respectively. The major problem encountered were that of coverage and gloss or surface shine produced by the trial formulations. They were blamed on the particle size of the pigments and the absence of some other ingredients like hard waxes to blend the paraffin wax; and naphtha which could not be found dispite all effort made. Happily, these were reasonably improved by using finer pigments particles and vanish respectively.\n\nFrom tests and evaluations, the research project was a success with a good produce formulation; importantly, a production. And packaging cost (for the formulation) on fourty one naira, thirty three kobo (N41.30) per 50ml polish content was carried out with the sum of six thousand eight hundred and forty naira (N6,840.00)\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT\n\nTHE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nSCOPE OF THE PROJECT\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW\n\nHISTORY\n\nSOME CLASSES OF SURFACE ENHANCING PRODUCTS\n\nLEATHER POLISH\n\nCAE WAXES\n\nFORMULATION OF SHOE POLISH\n\nWAXES\n\nIMPORTANT WAXES IN THE MANUFACTURE OF SHOE POLISH\n\nSOLVENTS FOR POLISH PRODUCTION\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\n\nCOLLECTION AND PREPARATION OF RAW MATERIALS\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULT\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\nCONCLUSION AND RECDOMMENDATION\nCONCLUSION RECOMMENDATION\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAPPENDIX I\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe emergence of polish technology in engineering is apparent offshoot of complexities resulting from the induction of substances that produce desired gloss and provides a protective coating for the surface of the materials, changing it to a dry adherent film. Therefore, polish is a substances usually wax based, which when applied to a sequence was based, which applied to sequence protects, makes it smooth and shiny.\n\nIt has been discovered that shoe polish industries in Nigeria are at minimum even though the polish industry is economically very important due to its widespread usage. Shoe polish industry  as a surface coaling provider in a very important venture.  The manufacture of surface coaling materials of which shoes polish is a part, has been estimated with swales of more than 10,000 million yearly.  This in essence means that its usage is wide spread and in teams of employment, gives a lot of  opportunities.  The economic consequences as highlighted above have4 in turn spu7rred many into a continuous struggle for a good quality product.\n\nTherefore, in a bid to reduce the degree of unemployment by establishing small scale industries, this research project is embark upon.\n\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT\n\nThe aim and objective of this project among other things include;\n\n1                    To produce shoe polish which will suit the weather of this country.\n\n2                    Produce polish of high quality at minimum cost5\n\n3                    To conserve foreign exchange and help solve the problem of balance of payment resulting from, the importation of polishes  to offset the unnecessary.\n\n4                    To help complement the efforts of existing factories toward meeting the rising demand of product.\n\n5                    To create employment opportunities by establishing polish industry.\n\n6                    To reduce the depending on government for emplyment by having individual investment and becoming self reliant\n\nTHE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nConsidering the fact that there are few or practically no functional polish industry in the country, and the imported polish most atimes do not meet up with the local weather conditions, this research project will help to find solution to these problems.  And at the same time offer local alternatives to these imported products.  It will equally be an avenue for finding means of increasing our domestic national product.\n\nImportantly, exploiting the benefit offered by this research work will help in improving the qualities of polishes produced.  This will help in making the polish industry a viable venture, whose product could be exported thereby serving as a foreign exchange earner for the country.\n\nSCOPE OF THE PROJECT\n\nThe research project covers feasibility study, scouting and acquisition of the necessary raw materials required for the production, formulations research and the production of the polish samples.  Other areas are, analytical test of product qualities as compared with some commercial brands, evaluation of the project, discussion, conclusion and recommendations.\nPRODUCTION OF BLACK AND BROWN POLISH",

The production then was by trial and error with no standard principle and little or no regard to the quality of the final product.  With the application of science in the production of paint, product of high quality is now possible.  This time, not only to give appearance but more importantly for surface protection.  Thus, modern paint industry firm a small but important part of the chemical industry.  It is closely related to the plastics, and petroleum industries and like then is based on modern knowledge of chemistry, physical and engineering.\nTHE PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT RESEARCH WORK\n\nThe purpose of this work is to make use of available source materials in the production of Emulsion Paint, test the properties of the paint and its performance against weather, and thus set a standard for future works.\nTHE SCOPE OF PROJECT RESEARCH\n\nPaints is classified according to its application and functions ie. Varishers, leaguers, fillers etc.  Emulsion  paint which is a water based paint is principally used for external and internal surface coatings, mostly in building for appearance and as a surface protector.  Apart from their protective action, vanushers, and leaguers increases the protective action of manufactured goods.\n\nThe process involved in paint production, qualities and performances of emulsion paint in particular are largely dependent on the properties of its constituents and the ratios of these constitutions include pigments, pigment extenders, additives and vehicles.  Failure to make proper formulation before production causes deterioration and film degradation.\n\nEmulsion paint production from available materials must meet the present need for a high standard of performance so as to cater satisfactorily for the needs of the society, at a particular paint in time and to demonstrate a credible record of an ability to challenge external and future influences.\n\n  TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nUsing our service is LEGAL and IS NOT prohibited by any university/college policies\n\nYou are allowed to use the original model papers you will receive in the following ways:\n\n1.

        "content": " PRODUCTION OF CASSAVA FLOUR USING TRADITIONAL PROCESSING METHOD AND MODERN PROCESSING METHOD\n(Chemical Engineering Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe production of cassava flour by the method of traditional processing method (sun drying) and modern processing method (oven drying) was carried out using cassava sliced cubes or peeled cassava.\n\nIndeed, the traditional Nigeria techniques of cassava flour production was studied with a view of achieving same product mechanically. Result of this studies show that the processing time can  be much reduced if mechanized.\n\nThe effects of variations in the processing parameters on the productions were discussed. It was also observed that the percentage of moisture was highest in the sun drying at 18% followed by oven drying at 9%, this was due to the fact that the higher the moisture content, the longer the drying time. Also, while the optimum drying temperature varied for sun drying but it was 800c for oven drying process used respectively.\n\nBased on the work, the colour of sun dried sample was brighter compared with mechanized sample. It is therefore recommended that for good production of cassava flour with good flour mixture, appearance and taste, the flour should be enriched with protein and vitamin additive to increase the nutritional values, thus improving the health of millions of Nigerians whose consumption of cassava flour are high in the areas of bread baking.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0              INTRODUCTION                            \n\n1.1       Aims and objective of the research work      \n\n1.2              SCOPE OF PROJECT                                              \n\n1.3       LIMITATION                                   \n\n1.4       LITERATURE AND METHOD OF            \n\nPRODUCTION                                 \n\n1.5              Traditional method of cassava flour production        \n\n1.6              Modern method of cassava flour production            \n\n1.7              Oven drying method                                      \n\n1.8              Uses of cassava flour                         \n\n1.9              Large scale purpose                                        \n\n1.9.1        Small scale purpose                                        \n\n1.9.2        Characterization of the flour products.                      \n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\n2.0       LITERATURE SURVEY/REVIEW            \n\n2.1              Cassava                                                                      \n\n2.2              Characteristics of cassava      \n\n2.3              Cassava growing                                \n\n2.4              Culture                                                           \n\n2.5              Importance of cassava                                               \n\n2.6              Utilization and production statistics              \n\n2.7              Reasons for drying in cassava flour   \n\n2.8              Classification of dryers                                              \n\n2.9              Batch drying                          \n\n2.9.1    Continuous drying                             \n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\n2.0              MATERIALS AND EXPONENTIAL\n\nPROCEDURES                                            \n\n3.1              Material / equipment used                              \n\n3.2              Experimental procedures                   \n\n3.3              Sun drying and oven drying method \n\n3.4              Analytical procedure              \n\n3.5              Flow chart for sun drying method                 \n\n3.6              Flow chart for oven drying method   \n\n3.7              Cyomide content determination                                \n\n3.8              Moisture content determination         \n\n3.9              Determination of ash content            \n\n3.9.1        Protein content determination                                   \n\n3.9.2        Results                                                                       \n\n3.9.3        Results for oven drying at optimum temp.    \n\n3.9.4        Result / data analysis                                                 \n\n3.9.5        Calculation for % moisture content (oven drying)\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\n4.0              DISCUSSION (SUN DRYING)                              \n\n4.1              Establishing of optimum drying temperature\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\n5.0       CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION                  \n\nappendix:\n\n1.

It largely involves simultaneous heat and mass transfer, fluid flow, material handling. The significance of drying operations in chemical allied industries cannot be over-emphasized. Some of these include: to increase the shelf life of the material, to lesson the transport cost, space and weight requirement for easy packaging etc.\n\n1.1       AIMS AMD OBJECTIVES OF THE RESEARCH WORK\n\nSince traditional Nigerian techniques of cassava flour production have been studied with a view to mechanizing the processes. The results of the this research work show that the processing, time can be much reduced if mechanized. Their various findings also show that drying is an essential and crucial procedure in the cassava flour processing. The effect variation is processing parameters on the production shall be discussed in datail.\n\n1.2       SCOPE OF TE PROJECT\n\nAlthough cassava flour ca be produced using drying equipment and using sun drying but the difference will be in the colour, taste and texture and of course nutritionally one is heavier than the other upon consumption. Invariably, in order to achieve the laid down standards/ objectives, an insight is generally needed to the whole project work.\n\nAt the end of this project, we will show the significance of the cassava flour production using drying equipment, advantage of mechanized production as well as recommendation for its improvement.\n\n1.4       LITERATURE ON METHOD OF PRODUCTION\n\nBasically, cassava flour production method is classified under the ld method / traditional processing method and the modern processing method.\n\n1.5       TRADITIONAL METHOD OF CASSAVA FLOUR PRODUCTION UNDER SUN DRYING METHOD.\n\nThis method specifically made use of natural sunlight as the drying medium, here, the peeled washed cassava cubes or sliced tubers is put into perforated plastic ware.\n\nThe tubers is then dried by placing it outside for the sun to dry it up and the moisture content is checked for every showers depending on the intensity of the sunray until it stabilized.\n\nUpon obtaining a bone dry level, we dry milled it into fine powder and it was later sieved using the multi sieve to obtain uniform size gardings and to remove any form of impurities. At this level, an instant cassava flour had been produced.\n\n1.6       MODERN METHOD OF CASSAVA FLOUR PRODUCTION\n\nThe modern method of cassava flour production are thus: Oven Drying Method and Rotary Drying Method.\n\n1.7       OVEN DRYING METHOD\n\nThis method employed the use of oven drying equipment (from food science & Technology department). In this case, oven drying is similar to sun drying but the difference here was that the oven dryer was employed to do the drying process.\n\nHere, the sliced cassava tuber were placed in the oven at various temperature to check the optimum temperature which was obtained at 800c and moisture content was checked for every 10 minutes till it stabilized. And after 200 minutes (about 3hrs, 30mins), a bone dried cassava is obtained. All other processes of obtaining cassava flour is carried out here as done in the case of sun drying method.\n\n1.8       USES OF CASSAVA FLOUR\n\nThe flour obtained from cassava is characterised into two broad scale depending on how they are put in usage namely: on large scale use and (2) on Small scale usage.\n\n1.9       LARGE SCALE OR COMMERCIAL PURPOSE\n\n1.                  Cassava flour are used in pharmaceutical; industries.\n\n2.                  Cassava flour are used in food processing industries for bread making, biscuit making etc.\n\n3.                  Cassava flour is used as self raising flour\n\n1.9.1    ON SMALL SCALE PRODUCTION\n\n1.                  Cassava flour are used in the production of locally made or process stable food common in the southern region called AMALA\n\n2.                  Used in the production of locally made cake                                                                                                                                                                                     \n\n1.9.2    CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FLOUR PRODUCTS\n\nThe flour product can be grouped into the following depending on the purpose in which the flour is to put into use.\n\nBREAD MAKING PRODUCTS:\n\nThey are flour products used in bread making, eaten in Nigeria, will from a dough capable of satisfactory, leaving action.\n\nBISCUIT:\n\nFor making of biscuits (cooking in Nigeria) a weak flour is required that makes a dough having more extensibility but less spring than that of a bread dough. Many have been reduced to a soft fine powder.\n\nSELF RAISING FLOUR PRODUCT\n\nThis is used for puddings cakes and pastry. The raising agents that produced the carbon dioxide gas required for distension are an alkaline body, bicarbonate of soder and an acid body generally acid calcium phosphate (A.C.P)\nPRODUCTION OF CASSAVA FLOUR USING TRADITIONAL PROCESSING METHOD AND MODERN PROCESSING METHOD",

The oil these seeds were in Enugu using solvent extraction method.  Two different solvents were used in the extraction namely: Ethane and order to compare their yield, physical and chemical properties.\n\nThe extraction was carried out using 32og of size-reduced groundnut with 100ml of 17-hexane while 1.5litres a 15ooml of ethanol was used on 480g of size reduced groundnut seeds.  Ta the end of the extraction operation, the amount of oil-extracted using17-hexane was observed to be far more greater than the amount of oil extracted using ethanol.\n\nThe chemical and physical properties of the oil were determined by analysis of the oil.

This unit operation, one of the oldest in the chemical industries, here been given many names, depending to some extent upon the technique used for carrying it out extraction of oil form groundnut seeds can be carried out using any of the two solid-liquid extraction methods namely: mechanical extraction method or the used of solvent other- wise called mass-transfer method. The yield of the second method is higher but contains more impurities than the first method and it requires another unit operation (distillation) in purity it better.\n\nThe success of an extraction and the technique to be used will vary frequently depending upon any prior treatment which may be given to he solid.  In some instance small particles of the soluble material are completely surrounded by a matrix of insoluble matter.  The solvent must then diffuse into the mass, and the resulting solution must diffuse out before a separation can result.  Crushing and grinding of such solids will greatly alliterate the leaching action, since then the soluble portions are made more accessible to the solvent.\n\nSeeds like groundnut seeds and other vegetable seeds are cellular in structure, and the natural products to be leached form these material are usually found inside the cells. if the cell walls remain intact upon exposure to a suitable solvent, the leaching involves osmotic passage of the solute through the cell walls.  This may be slow, but in is impractical and sometime undesirable to grind the material small enough to release the contents of individual cells.\n\nOil constitutes a well-defined class of neutral organic substance, which are essential constituents of all forms of plant and animal life.  They are soluble in other and organic solvents but not in water.  Commercial oils are however from a relatively few member of the plant and animal kingdom available forms. They are primary a product of agriculture although these is also a considerably production from uncultivated tropical plants and from mature animals. Oil can be grouped into edible and non-edible depending on the amount of unspecified matters and impurities. Owing to the fact that the use of oil from crop seed as a major raw materials has increased in recent yeses their has been the need for extended and numerous research works based on the extraction of these oil.  Form its seeds as economically efficiently as possible.\n\nThe only possible way of obtaining large quality of oil from oil being vegetable or plant materials is by extraction and this could best be achieve using leading process. This process can be accomplished by a variety of ways but as might be expected its efficiency depends to an extant an obtaining intimate contact between the liquid solvent and the solid containing he solute.  Leaching reduces the oil content in the residue to about 0.5-1.5 percent as compared.\n\nWith about 5-9 percent by mechanical process. The types of solvent available for leaching include 17-hexane, petroleum ether benzene ethyl ether etc which are high petroleum fractions.  The choice of a solvent for extraction is a function of its volatility and relative volatility for easy separation by distillation.\n\nGroundnut oil is used primary in homes for cooking and also as an industrial raw material for other usefully products.\n\nSCOPE AIMS/ OBJECTIVES FO THE PROJECT\n\nThe scope of this research project is to extract oil from groundnut seeds and compare  the yields obtained using different solvents and to standard.\n\nAlso the project is aimed at characterizing the extracted oil by determining the physical and chemical properties of the oil.\nEXTRACTION OF OIL FROM A LOCAL SEED (GROUNDNUT SEED) AND CHARACTERIZATION\n",

        "content": " ALTERNATIVE RAW MATERIAL SOURCES FOR CEMENT PRODUCTION\n(Chemical Engineering Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIt is generally known that cement id produced from limestone, mar/clay and gypsum by the following three basic process- wet semi- wet aid dry process.\n\nThe cost of exploiting the limestone: the major raw material constitute about 50% of the production cost which results in the high cost of cement.  It therefore becomes imperative to bring down the cost of cement by investigating into alternative source of raw material for cement production and hence this project.\n\nFrom literature, rice husk ash, Ukpo day,& Nsu day contain the basic mineral constituents which limestone has.  Rice husk was burnt temperatures of 5000c,   6000c,   7000c, and 8000c.  The best ash was obtained at a temperature of 7000c,.  the above material were also analyzed to determine their mineral constituents.  The result shown that rice husk contains little aluminum (Al203) and no lime (Ca0).  To make up for these mineral constituents, Upo day which is rich in aluming was blended with lime(Ca0)-a bye product from gas plant and the three minerals were blended using the method of lime saturation factor.  A blending ratio of 70% lime 20% PHA and 10% Alumina mixture (Ukpo day)  was used.  The mixture was mixed dry by dry process and burnt in a furnace at a temperature of 12000c.  the resulting mass known as dinker  was ground  with 5% gypsum.  The cement obtained gave a comprehensive strength of 2N/mr2.\n\n  DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nOPC    -           Ordinary Portland cement\n\nLSF     -           Lime saturation factor\n\nQuicklime        -           Calcium oxide Ca0\n\nRaw meal        -           Secondary raw material that is fed into the kiln for burning\n\nRaw mill          -           A tube like machinery where the grinding of raw material\n\ntakes place.\n\nASTM -           American society for testing materials.\n\nHydraulic modulus     -           The ration of lime (Ca0) to silica, Alumina and ferric\n\n oxides.\n\nClinker            -           Intermediate raw material and the product from the kiln.\n\nC3S      -           Tricalcimn silicate\n\nC2S      -           Dicalcium silicate\n\nC3A     -           Tricalcium Aluminate\n\nC4AF   -           Tetra calcium Alumiroferite\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nCement is a complete mixture of mineral substances that gradually harden when mixed with water.  It is the product of the reaction of lime with the oxides of silica alumina and iron.  It is used in the construction of industry as a blending material.  Some builders regard it as the key engineering material for construction purposes.  many allied construction materials such as asbestos, culverts concrete seals, concrete poles, cement blocks etc are derived from cement and they also play very important roles in the construction industry. \n\nFor the average Nigeria, a major life ambition is to own a living house cement, a key raw material has ruined to ‘Gold’ as has become a topical issue.  Just like iron, steel and petrochemical, cement is equally a major spring board for industrialization.  This quest for industrialization has resulted to increase in demand with the consequent increase in the cost of cement.\n\nOne of the reasons adduced for the exorbitant cost of cement is the scarcity of raw material.  This situation arises as  a result of its fast depletion which is not replaced.\n\nAnother reason adduced for the exorbitant cost of cement is the high cost of the exploration and exploitation of the raw material.  To mine the chief raw material for the manufacture of cement- limestone requires a lot of machines, plants and explosives.  A lot of money is also paid as compensation to the communities that own the land.  All these expenditures lead to the high cost of cement.  This study was therefore to investigate alternative source of raw material for the production of cement.\n\nThese investigation was geared towards industrial waste and Agricultural residues.  Agricultural residues are composed of organic constituents such as cellulose, lignin, fibre and small amounts of crude protein and fat.  In addition, they contain a rage of minerals which silica, Alumina and iron oxide.  The residue itself cannot be used as cement replacement and it is the ash that is obtained form the preprocessing that is of interest.  Two factors require for constituents of the ash.  The ash content is important because it indicates the amount of reside which need to be burnt; that is the yield. D..J COOK (1980) states that rice husk have shown by far the greater yieled of ash than other plants like sorghum, corn leaf blade, Bamboo nodes, (Inner portion) bangasse, lantana leaf and stem and rice straw.\n\nFor every 1000kg of rice husk burnt, 200kg of ash are produced.  Hence it is not surprising that rice husk emerged as the agricultural that with the greatest potential as cement replacement material.\n\nOne the other hand, lime is a by product of gas companies.  It is readily available at no cost.\n\nThe utilization of these raw material for cement product production is very altercative in developing countries like ours.  This is because it does not only reduce demand on Portland cement but it also provides cement in rural areas of the country especially in rice growing areas which rice husk is found in large quantities and constitute environmental nuisance.\n\n1.2       PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe present high cost of cement and the exorbitant cost of residential house occasioned by high cost of raw material exploitation, energy, population explosion and development have necessitated intensification into the search for alternative raw material for the production of this product.  The aim of this project therefore was to bring down the cost of cement by the use of alternative raw materials form industrial and agricultural waste.\n\n1.3       SCOPE OF THE PROJECT\n\nThe intention was to \n\n1)                  Source and analyze the following raw materials rice husk lime (waste product from Niger gas company) Ukpo clay, Nsu clay and pulverized fuel Ash (PEA)\n\n2)                  Obtain the best condition for preprocessing.\n\n3)                  Compounding the raw mix.\n\n4)                  Burning\n\n5)                  Peterning the physical characteristics.\n\n1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nOn completion of the study, the result would be of importance to the  Government and Entrepreneurs who may wish to go into the production of cement.  The increased investments in this area will bridge the gap between demand and supply and bring down the cost of cement the reduced price of cement will catalyze infrastructure development and majority will be able to own a living house.\n\nAnother importance of the project is that it will serve as the starting point for the production of other types of cement known as blend cement.  The study will also help to provide cement in rural areas typically of those traditionally deprived of cement.  In this way small-scale businesses possible.\n\nSince the industrial and agricultural waste are waste which causes environmental pollution and create problem with disposal its utilization would not only control environmental employment opportunities to our young school leaver.\n\nThe research would also be of immerse benefit to future researchers and student who would have the interest of studying similar subjects.\nALTERNATIVE RAW MATERIAL SOURCES FOR CEMENT PRODUCTION",

During this process, both male and female palm inflorescence were compared for maximum alkali production and it was observed that the female palm inflorescence produced highest quantity of alkali than the male palm inflorescence. Based on this, the female palm inflorescence was used in performing the experiment.\nAlso, experiments were carried out to determine the optimum temperature and time for maximum alkali recovery. After the analysis and analytical calculations it was found that the optimum temperature for maximum alkali production is 4500c and the corresponding time for the production is 90 minutes.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nOver the years, alkali has been of prime importance as raw material both for industrial and laboratory purpose. Alkali as a word was derived from an erabic word, which mean ashes. Ashes could be wood ashes, Ngu ashes or any other type of ash sourced by burning a given material. Alkali is said to be the basic hydroxide, which is soluble in water.\nThe compounds of alkali metals are so soluble that they tend to be leached out of the soil by rainwater end hence carried by streams and rivers to the sea. Based on this, sea water contain about three percent (3%) by weight of alkali salts.\nAlkalis are produced both industrially end locally. The local production is mainly by the use of palm inflorescence or plantain peels. It involved burning of the palm inflorescence and subsequently leaching out of the alkali with water. When the produced alkali is sourced, potassium hydroxide is much in quantity then sodium hydroxide. About 45% of alkali is obtained using the female palm inflorescence of the oil palm tree.\nThe quality of the leachate obtained depends on the following.\ni. Ashing condition\nii. Solvent used\niii. The type of plant ash used\niv. Method of leaching\nOne of the major raw materials for soap production is alkali. The alkali may be a hydroxide, a carbonate of hydrogen carbonate. The cations most commonly used are those of sodium and potassium. At the time of saponification, they denote metal ions, which form soap with fatty acid. Hence\n\n0 \nH2 C - C OR1\n0 \nH C - C - OR11 + 3xY 3RC00x + CH2 Y\nCH2 Y\nH2 C - C - OR111 CH2 Y\nWhere x is a metal ion\nMany of the alkali has gained wide application some of them are sodium hydroxide (Na0H), sodium carbonate (Na0 C03), potassium hydroxide (KOH), sodium hydrogen carbonate and potassium hydrogen carbonate (KHC03).\n\nTHE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT RESEARCH\ni. Establishment of the best and optimum method of producing high quality alkali locally.\nii. Development of a flow process to obtain the optimum temperature and time needed for the maximum recovery of the high quality alkali and specification of its concentration at this optimum condition.\niii. Preparation of the detailed process flow diagram.\n\n1.1 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RESEARCH\nIt is important to state that production of alkali locally is very much encouraged. This is because soap which is one of the numerous products produced by the use of alkali finds extensive usage both in domestic and other general laundry activities.\nIn order to sustain the industry in dear need of alkali as a major raw material, there is the need that alkali should be locally produced, more especially at this period of time that the federal government has placed ban on importation of some of the basic raw materials needed in soap and soap related industries.\nFor there to be continuity of these industries, alkali which is a major raw material must be source locally. This can be obtained by the use of palm inflorescence of oil palm (Eleasis Guineasis). The production of alkali through this means, makes 17 possible for soap industries and other related industries to obtain one of their major raw materials.\nOwing to the fact that this production process is relatively cheap, it prevents the expenses incurred in the importation of alkali for soap production and other uses which subsequently reduces the cost of the final products. Hence, this research project is geared towards harnessing the somewhat neglected Nigerian’s agricultural prowess in the preservation of the vest palm trees found in her rich forest, and then make appropriate use of its palm inflorescence in the production of alkali.\nPRODUCTION OF ALKALI USING LOCAL RAW MATERIAL",

It was then activated into two different samples. Firstly, the basic sample was activated using anaphoric acid (H2 s04) while the other was activated by just heating as a control for the experiment; both at a constant temperature of 5000c and approximate time of 2hours.\nThey were both size reduced into fines and sieved into particle 3ye of 150um portion of the crude palm oil was degummed and neutralized for bleaching. Each interval of bleaching with both the acid activated and the ordinary activated charcoal was 8mins and temperature of 1500c over a hot plate, and subsequent filtration of the solution.\nA spectrophotometer was used to measure the absorbance of the oils (crude and bleached) at selected wave length of 480Um. This was converted as the degree of colour reduction expressed in percentages.\nResults obtained showed that optimum quantity of the charcoal for bleaching is 5% by weight, of the oil, which gives a percentage colour reduction as 97. 14% for the acid activated and 93.57% for the calcinated sample.\nAlso, the characterization of both the original oil and the bleaching oil showed that the later has appreciable properties. Hence colour reduction was observable by naked eyes.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n1.1 PREAMBLE\nPalm oil is one of the various types of vegetable oils, belonging to the group called liquids, because of its fatty acids content.\n\nThe majority of the fats contains some colouring matter either as a natural constituent or discoloration produced during the processing. Natural pigments present in vegetable oils are mainly the carotenoid, giving yellow and red colours, and the chlorophylls which give green colours. Colour deterioration can also take place during the extraction process, especially in the local method of extraction used in the most parts of the Eastern region in Nigeria.\n\nRemoval or reduction of colours and other components, otherwise called ‘Bleaching” is necessary not only because a pale-coloured fat has an appeal of ‘purity’ but also because the colours of the fat can influence the appearance of prepared food and even more importantly, the pigment present may affect the flavour and stability of the fats and food made from it.\nThe decolouration (bleaching) could be achieved by chemical treatment, heat treatment and adsorption methods. The most effective and widely used being the later. Thus, in this research project, bleaching by adsorption is carred out using an “Activated charcoal” (an adsorbent), a kind of active carbon, to substitute the use of local clays and the imported ‘Fuller’s Earth – in Palm Oil bleaching, which are rather expensive.\n\nThe charcoal can be produced from different sources as from, coal, wood, bone, coconut shell, etc. It would be verified the most suitable form and type of charcoal for effective bleaching and the most favourable condition at which the “activated charcoal could be used, which in them affects the bleach ability’ of the Palm oil itself.\n\n1.2 OBJECTIVE\nThe objective / aim of this research project is to verify the effectiveness of ‘Activated charcoal’ in the bleaching of palm oil. It will also expose the improvement in the use of local raw material (charcoal) in a chemical process (bleaching), in lien of the imported fuller’s Earth or other adsorbents which more expensive.\n\n1.3 SCORE OF THE STUDY\nBasically, this, study dwells on the colours reduction of Palm oil, using an Activated charcoal as an adsorbent (bleaching agent). The major raw materials, Palm oil and charcoal were locally sourced, and information as regards the process were obtained form the literary and other resourceful materials (texts) that treats ‘Adsorption’ as a chemical process.\nBLEACHING OF PALM OIL USING ACTIVATED CHARCOAL",

ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1     BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\nPalm wine is an important alcoholic beverages resulting from the spontaneous fermentation of the sap of which has been attributed to years and bacteria (Okafor, 1978).\n\nPalm wine is consumed in parts of Africa, Asia and South America. In Nigeria, the two principal sources of sap for palm wine. Fermentation is the oil palm (Ecaeis guineesis) and the Raphia palms (Raphia SPP). It is highly perishable liquid consisting mainly of water, sugar, vitamin and mainly of aroma and flavor components in every small amount. Palm wine have several nutritional, medical, religious and social uses which have been reported elsewhere (Faparvunis, 1966). Odemiymi1977; (Ikenebomeh and Omayunil 1988; Uzogara et al., 1990, Iheonu, 2000).to have increasingly enhanced the demand for this natural product.\n\nFermentation begins immediately after collection as a result of natural yeasts in the air and wine within two hours, the alcoholic content reaches approximately 4%.\n\nAt this stage, the product is sweet while mildly intoxicating aromatic beverages continued fermentation for up to 24hours and sour white drink. This palm wine can also be distilled into whisky –like drinks with higher alcoholic content (up to 40%) beyond a certain threshold; the wine no longer gains alcohol (Adam, 1995).\n\nMany factor including the species of the tree, the season of the year, time of day at harvest and type of soil impact the alcoholic content of the wine. In-fact, these factors play a key role in the characteristics of the final product as rudimentary storage and production facilities do little to preserve to avoid fermentation of micro-organism which can affect the pH values, sugar content, alcoholic content, refractive index and specific gravity. These can be affected due to micro-organism and bacterial that has contaminated with the product. If it carefully preserved, it will retains all nutritional values and last for a short periods of time, days and weeks.\n\nPreservation can be achieved in the difference ways either by physical or chemical method, preservation method of palm wine has perfected locally, it involves pasteurizing and bottling of the palm wine which increase its shell life to over six months.\n\nThis method of palm wine preservation makes it more hygienic and consequently more attractive to the city dwellers (Rangana, 1986).\n\nPhysical preservation entails process such as refrigeration, drying, pasteurization,sterilization etc.\n\nPreservation additives reduce the risk of product borne infection, decrease microbial spoilage and preserve fresh attributes and nutritional quality.\n\nSome physical techniques include dehydration, U.V.C radiation, freezing, drying, refrigeration, pasteurization, sterilization etc. (Ran Gana,1986).\n\n1.2     STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nPalm wine is an alcoholic beverages created from the fermented sap of various palm trees. It is collected (or tapped) from tall palm tree or raffia tree which is shorter and thus more accessible. There are reports that some people also collected sap from oil palm tree(Elaisguineenis). However, sap from a palm tree (Raffia tree) is milkier and sweeter. When palm wine is tapped fresh and not fermented, it is considered a fruit juice or drink as it contains no level of alcohol% which makes it highly nutritious and beneficial to the body.\n\nFermentation of palm wine begins immediately after collection as a result of natural yeasts in the air  and wine.\n\nWithin two hours, the alcohol content reaches approximately 4%. At this stage, the product is a sweet while mildly intoxicating aromatic beverage continued fermentation for up to 24hours results in a more alcoholic acidic, sour and bacteria.\n\nFormation of bacteria can be achieved by by preservation of palm wine using different method like physical which includes ultraviolet radiation, freezing and pasteurization, and chemical methods which involves introducing a chemical in the palm wine.\n\nThis research work seeks to x-ray the preservation of palm wine using UV radiation.\n\n1.3 AIM/OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n\n       The aim of the study is to preserve palm wine using      ultraviolet rays.\n\nThis aim will be achieved through the following    objectives.\n\n1.  To study the characteristics properties of the raw fresh palm wine.\n\n2.  to study the effects of process parameters like time, pH, specific gravity, alcoholic content,  refractive index on the preservation.\n\n3.  To study the characteristics properties of the palm wine after the preservation.\n\n1.4     SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following areas will be covered in the research.\n\n1.  Collection of palm wine\n\n2.  Characteristics of the palm wine\n\n3.  Preservation of the palm wine using ultraviolet rays.\n\n4.  Characterization of the palm wine after preservation.\n\n5.  The use of ultraviolet radiation for palm wine preservation leads to poor penetrability.\n\n6.  There is the possibility of a decrease in the taste and flavor of the palm wine after preservation.\n\n1.5 METHOD OF RESEARCH\n\nThe information on this research project was gotten from chemical Engineering journals, chemical Engineering textbooks, internet exploration, and resource consultants in the field of knowledge as well as practical/experimental work.\n\n1.6     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe following are the contributions of this research:\nPRESERVATION OF PALM WINE USING ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION",

From a historical perspective, it is evident that the fascination for plants is as old as mankind itself. The plant kingdom represent a rich store house of organic compounds, many of which have been used for medicinal purposes and could serve as lead for the development of novel agents having good efficacy in various pathological disorders in the coming years.Plants are the richest source of drugs for traditional medicine, modern medicines, nutraceuticals food supplements, folk medicine, pharmaceutical intermediates and chemical entities for synthetic drugs (Hammer et al., 1999). The use of plant product as medicines could be traced as far back as the beginning of human civilization. The earliest mentioned medicinal used plant in Hindu culture is found in “Rigveda”, which is said to have been written between 4500-1600 B.C. and is supposed to be the oldest repository human knowledge. The active principle isolated, have provided leads in the development of several life saving drugs, which are in use today (Rastogi and Mehrotra, 2002).\nThe isolated active compounds of the plants are secondary metabolites chemical compound that occur naturally in plant with no nutritional value to human life. These active compounds are generally called\n16\nphytochemical. These phytochemicals play protective roles in plants, each chemical labeled phytochemical works in different ways, not all are the same for human, and not all come from the same plants. Some have shown more promise than others in fighting disease and illness in humans. There are some basic types of these active compounds that are found in different fruits and vegetables. We have some of them like antioxidants, they are present in onions and some other fruits and tea, they act as preventive measure for premature cell death and some forms of cancer and aging. Isoflavones or plant estrogen; they are found in soy and soy products; they are helpful in the year just before and after menopause. Capsaicin is found in hot pepper and it has been shown to significantly reduce prostate tumors in size, at least in mice. Taking capsaicin on a regular basis by eating spicy foods with hot peppers may prove an excellent preventative agent to prostate cancer and benign growth of prostate (Ahmedabad 382- 481). This experiment was carried out on moringaoleifera and Azadirachtaindica leaves.\nMoringaoleifera, or the horseradish tree, is a small or medium-sized about 10 m high perennial softwood tree with timber of low quality pantropical specie plant that is known by such regional name as benzolive, drumstick tree, kelor, marango, mlonge, mulangay, nebeday, saijhan and sajan. Over the past two decades, many reports have appeared in the mainstream scientific journals describing its nutritional\n17\nand medicinal properties (Akerele, 1993).Moringaoleifera is the most widely cultivated species of a monogenetic family, the moringaceae that is native to the sub-Himalayan tracts of India, Pakistan Bangladesh and Afghanistan, it also now naturalizes in West Africa and Nigeria as a whole.\nAzadirachtaindicaon the other hand is a very useful traditional medicinal plant in the sub-continent and each part of the tree has some medicinal properties. The plant is native to Asia, but has now naturalized in West Africa and is widely cultivated in Nigeria as an ornamental as well as medicinal plant.\n1.2 Phytochemicals\nPhytochemicals are non-nutritive plant chemicals which occur naturally in plants that have protective or disease preventive properties. They are nonessential nutrients, meaning that they are not required by the human body for sustaining life. It is well-known that plant produces these chemicals to protect them but recent research demonstrates that they can also protect humans against diseases. There are more than thousand known phytochemicals. Some of the well-known phytochemicals are lycopene in tomatoes, isoflavonesin soy and flavanoids in fruits.Alkaloids (examples are Caffeine, Theobromine,\n18\nTheophylline).Organosulfides(examples are Allicin,Glutathione,Indole-3-Carbinol,Isothiocyanates).Tannins, steroids, Glycosides etc.\n1.2.1 Activity of phytochemicals\nAntioxidant - Most phytochemicals have antioxidant activity and protect our cells against oxidative damage and reduce the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Phytochemicals with antioxidant activity includes:allyl sulfides (onions, leeks, and garlic), carotenoids (fruits, carrots), flavonoids (fruits, vegetables), polyphenols (tea, grapes).\nHormonal action - Isoflavones, found in soy, imitate human estrogens and help to reduce menopausal symptoms and osteoporosis.Stimulation of enzymes - Indoles, which are found in cabbages, stimulate enzymes that make the estrogen less effective and thus couldreduce the risk for breast cancer. Other phytochemicals, which interfere with enzymes, are protease inhibitors (soy and beans), terpenes (citrus fruits and cherries).\nInterference with DNA replication - Saponins found in beans interfere with the replication of DNA cell, thereby preventing themultiplication of cancer cells. Capsaicin, found in hot peppers, protects DNA from carcinogens.\n19\nPhysical action - Some phytochemicals bind physically to cell walls thereby preventing the adhesion of pathogens to human cell walls. Proanthocyanidins are responsible for the anti-adhesion properties of cranberry. Consumption of cranberries will reduce the risk of urinary tract infections and will improve dental health.\nPhytochemicals are naturally present in many foods but it is expected that through bioengineering new plants will be developed, which will ontain higher levels. This would make it easier to incorporate enough phytochemicals with our food.\nPHYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF MORINGA OLEIFERA AND AZADRICHTA INDICA LEAVES\n",

        "content": " COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF COAL, FUEL OIL AND NATURAL GAS FOR CEMENT PRODUCTION\n(Chemical Engineering Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\nABSTRACT\nThis study is a comparative analysis of the use of coal, fuel oil and natural gas for cement production noting their physical and chemical properties, cost and availability, impact on the environment and human health. Out of the seven cement manufacturing industries in Nigeria, three industries use these fuels were selected for the study. The industries are NigerCem –Ebonyi state, Dangote cement –Benue state and UniCem -Cross river state. Questionnaires were used to gather information on the three fuels. The likert 3- scale model was adopted, using 2.0 as the cut off mark. Based on the analysis of the study, it was observed out that amongst these three (3) fuels, fuel oil is presently expensive though available, while coal and natural gas are cheap but coal is not available due to the closure of Nigeria‟s coal mine. In terms of environment and health, coal and fuel oil emit much harmful gases to the environment and cause more health problems to cement worker but natural gas emits less of these harmful gases to the environment and cause less health problems to workers. The study therefore shows that natural gas is the best fuel because it is cheap, readily available and creates fewer problems to the environment.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\n1.1 BACKGROUND OF STUDY\nEnergy is commonly defined as the ability to do work or to produce heat.\nNormally heat could be derived by burning a fuel (i.e. a substance that contains internal energy which upon burning generates heat). (IEA, 2004).\nThe energy system today is highly dependent on fossil fuel with coal, fuel oil and natural gas accounting for about 80% of world primary energy demand. (Kul, 2001).\nFuels are the major source of energy for industries and cement industry is not an exception. However, the energy source to be adopted will have to meet the varying needs of different countries and at the same time enhance the security of each against the energy crisis that have taken place in the past. The selection/ choice of fuel type depend on various factors such as environmental pollution, ease in processing, storage and handling, availability and cost of the fuel.\nCoal, fuel oil and natural gas are the most commonly used energy carrier in cement industries. The energy use for cement production is distributed as follows:-\n 92.7% for pyro-processing\n 5.4% for finishing grinding and\n 1.9% for raw grinding (Choate, 2003).\n11\nThe choice of fuel use entails the level at which green house gases (GHG) are emitted, the cost of cement and the quality of the cement produced.\nThis research work will help in selecting the best fuel and techniques to be use in order to attain a high quality product at a lower cost with lesser green house gas emission to the environment.\n1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM\nThe choice of fuel is attained by comparative analysis of coal, fuel oil and natural gas in cement production. In comparing these fuels, the following problem arises:-\n Knowledge of the physio- chemical properties of coal, fuel oil and natural gas.\n Knowledge of the green houses gases (GHG) emitted by each of these fuel, their level of emission and their effects on the environment and humans health (esp. cement workers).\n Knowledge of the cost and availability of coal, fuel oil and natural gas.\n1.3 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF STUDY\nThe aims of this research work is to;\n Study the physical and chemical properties of coal, fuel oil and natural gas.\n Gain knowledge on the green house gases (GHG) emitted, their effect on the environment and humans health and the level of emission from each fuel.\n Study coal, fuel oil and natural gas in relation to cost and availability.\n12\n1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nWith the growth in industrialization today, this study will offer numerous values both to the cement industry and staff, the environment and society at large.\nIt will choose an economical and less hazardous fuel and techniques for cement production.\nAlso, it will help in the selection of techniques /fuel that will reduce the emission of green house gases (GHG) from cement industries to the environment. This gases emitted causes acid rain, smog etc. which can cause cancer to human and destroys plant lives.\nIn terms of infrastructural development, an economical fuel for production will lead to a reduction in the cost of cement, thereby encouraging the development of buildings and Government in development of roads, bridges, and other construction- oriented projects.\nThis study will also give students of chemical engineering and other related courses an insight of these fuels with their different environmental implications, properties and choice of fuel when combustion of fuel is required.\n1.5 SCOPE AND LIMITATION\nThis study would have covered all the Nigerian cement industries but due to time and cost of analysis, it is limited to three(3) cement industries namely:- Dangote Cement in Gboko -Benue State, United Cement Company in Calabar – Cross River State(UniCem), and Nigerian Cement Company in Nkalagu -Ebonyi State\n13\n(NigerCem) of which each uses Fuel oil, natural gas and coal respectively as energy source.\nThe intention of the study is to cover the effects of coal, fuel oil and natural gas in the production of cement with reference to cost, storage and handling, availability, product quality and environmental impact.\n14\nCOMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF COAL, FUEL OIL AND NATURAL GAS FOR CEMENT PRODUCTION",

True centrifugal pumps were not developed until the later 17th century, when Dennis Papin made one with straight vanes. The curved vane was introduced by the British inventor called John Appold in the year 1851.\n\nA centrifugal pump uses a spinning impeller which normally has backward swept blades that directly push water outward. Like most pumps, a centrifugal pump converts mechanical energy from a motor to energy  to energy of a moving fluid, some of the energy goes into kinetic energy of fluid motion, and some into potential energy, represented by a fluid pressure or by lifting the fluid against gravity to a higher level.\n\nThe transfer of energy from the mechanical rotation of the impeller to the motion and pressure of the fluids is usually described in terms of centrifugal force (a force which makes things move away from the centre of something) especially in older writtens before the modern concept of centrifugal force as a fictions force in a rotating reference frame was well articulated. The concept of centrifugal force is not actually required to describe the actions of the centrifugal pump. In the modern centrifugal pump, most of the energy conversion is due to the outward force that curved impeller blades impart on the fluid. Invariably, some of the energy also pushes the fluid into a circular motion, and this circular motion can also convey some energy and increase the pressure at the outlet. The relationship between these mechanisms was described with the typical mixed conception of centrifugal force known as that time, in an 1859 article on centrifugal pumps thus:\n\nTo arrive by a simpler method than that just given at a general idea of the mode of action of the exterior whirl pool in improving the efficiency of the centrifugal pump, it is only necessary to consider that the mass of water revolving in the whirl pool chamber round the circumference of the wheel, must necessary exert a centrifugal force, and that this centrifugal force may readily be supposed to add itself to the outward force generated within the wheel, or, in other words, to go to increase the pumping power of the wheel. The outward force generated within the wheel is to be understood as being produced entirely by the medium of centrifugal force if the vanes of the wheel be straight and radial; but if they be curved, as is more commonly the case, the outward force is partly produced through the medium of centrifugal force and partly applied by the vanes to the water as a radial component of the oblique pressure which in consequence of their wheel for impelling the water outwards becomes purely centrifugal force, and the more nearly will the pump become what the name ordinarily given to it would seem to indicate – a purely centrifugal pump. When, however, a centrifugal pump with vanes curved backwards in such forms as are ordinarily used in well constructed examples of the machine, is driven at a speed considerably above that requisite merely to overcome the pressure of water, and the cause lifting or propulsion to commence, the radial component of the force applied to the water by the vanes will become considerably, and the water leaving the circumference of the wheel will have a velocity less than that of the circumference of the wheel in a degree having some real importance in practice. The statement the mass of water … must necessarily exert a centrifugal force” is interpretable in terms of the reactive centrifugal force – the force is not an outward force on the water, but rather an outward force exerting by the water, on the pump housing (the volute) and on the water in the outlet pipe. The outlet pressure is a reflection of the pressure that applies the centrifugal force that curves the path of the water to move circularly inside the pump (in the space just outside the impeller, the exterior whirl pool as this author calls it).\n\nOn the other hand, the statement that the “outward force generated within the wheel is to be understood as being produced entirely by the medium of centrifugal force is best understood in terms of centrifugal as a fictional force in the frame of reference of the rotating impeller the actual forces on the water are inward, or centrifugal, since that is the direction of force needed to make the water move in circles. This force is supplied by a pressure gradient that is set up by the rotation, where the pressure at the outside, at the wall of the volute, can be taken as a reactive centrifugal force. This is typical of 19th and early 20th century writing, to mix these conceptions of centrifugal force in informal descriptions of effects such as that in the centrifugal pump.\n\nDiffering conceptions and explanations of how a centrifugal pump works have long engendered controversy and anima diversion. For example, the American Expert commission sent to the Vienna Exposition in 1873 issued a report that included observations that “they are misnamed centrifugal, because they do not operate by centrifugal force at all; they operate by pressure the same as a turbine water wheel; when people understand their method of operating we may expect much improvement”. John Richards, the editor of the San Francesco – based journal industry, in his in-depth essay on centrifugal pump, which also down played the significance of centrifugal force in the working of the pump remarked. This extra-ordinary reports stands printed in a Government publication, signed by men who were or are, eminent in mechanics, and we can only deplore the stupidity, as well as presumption of the commission who thus disposed of a subject that had twenty years before been carefully investigated by such men as sir John Rennie, professor Cowper, Mr Whitelaw, Dr. James Black, professor Rankine, and many others. The most astonishing part is, however, that this report was passed and signed by men who can hardly suppose would fail to perceive its absurdity. Modern sources say things like that the fluid “flows radially under centrifugal force”, or “centrifugal force flinge the liquid outward”. Others counter that :there is no force at all, and a great deal of confused thinking”.\n\nSome are more careful, attributing the outward force to the impeller, not to centrifugal force, “The impeller case. This centrifugal action is what creates the pressure”. Even serious texts that explain the working of the pump as one in which the mechanical energy is converted into pressure energy by means of centrifugal force acting on the fluid.\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\nRepair and refurbishment of a centrifugal pump.\n\nAIMS/OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\nIt was aimed that upon completion of this course, the particular pump will not only be put back in good working condition for future practical purposes, a training certificate will also be received indicating the ability to:\n\n-              Identify different types of centrifugal pumps and their parts\n\n-              Understand pump case repair methods,\n\n-              Develop a pump maintenance program,\n\n-              Troubleshoot, install and lubricate bearings,\n\n-              Understand  shaft alignment techniques,\n\n-              Identify different pump drivers and their uses,\n\n-              Trouble shoot wetted end pumps,\n\n-              Understand vibration measurements,\n\n-              Assemble and disassemble an ANSI Pump etc.\n\nSCOPE AND LIMITATION\n\nThe scope of the study includes\n\n-              The electric motor\n\n-              The wire connection\n\n-              Painting\n\nHowever, due to financial difficulties experienced as a result of having spent much money on part of the pump replaced, research and laboratory practical undergone, coupled with limited time had due to other departmental works that needs to be done, the two bearings from the electric motor was merely greased with oil instead of replacing it with  new ones.  \n\nMETHOD OF RESEARCH\n\nMost of the information was gotten from the internet from different websites, while others was gotten from the school and National Library, workshop/laboratory and consultations or interviews made.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nThe significance of the study is to restore and renovate a centrifugal pump to its normal working condition by adopting a corrective maintenance program.\nREPAIR AND REFURBISHMENT OF A CENTRIFUGAL PUMP",

Extraction of perfume from various plants resources is of ancient origin. Infact the natives from different tropical regions of the globe have long been extracting oil from numerous oil bearing plants. Human since the ancient time have known how to extract oil from their natural resources. Vegetable oils are naturally occurring esters of higher fatty acids and glycerol. They are widely distributed in nature and were first consumed as food. Later oils were discovered to be used as renewable raw materials for variety of non food production, for instance perfumes, disinfectants, inks to mention but a few. 1.2 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\nSeveral thousands of plants distributed throughtout the world contain a group of odiferous, fragrance, oily products that are highly volatile organic substances collectively known as essential oils. ―Essential‖ does not mean ―most necessary‖ but rather the concentrated characteristics or quintessence of a natural flavor or fragrance raw material (Coulson et al,\n2\n2003). Therefore, perfume may be from essential oils of vegetables or plant origin. It is a complex mixture of aldehydes, ketones, hydrocarbons, alcoholic acid and short chain esters. The existence of perfume on certain plants has been known for thousands of years. They can be found in leaves, flowers, stems, barks, and roots. Ancient Egytians extracted essential oils from plants tissues by steam distillation (Ogbu,2005). Other methods of isolating essential oils includes solvent extraction, expression, cold plate or enfleurage. Some of these methods have been adopted by essential oil extracting industries. Information on perfume when the essential oils have been extracted from plants are of different type of oils and these will ultimately influence the smell of perfume over time namely:\n1. The base oil (Base notes)- this will produce the scent that stays longest on the skin and for this reason it is usually added to the mixture e.g vanilla, ginnamon, sandalwood, mosses etc.\n2. The middle oil (middle notes)- this also influences the smell of the perfume for quite sometime but not as long as the base note does e.g lemon grass, Yalang Ylang etc.\n3. Top oil (top notes)- this is added to the mixture after the middle notes and may then be followed by some other substances which will help to\n3\nbridge the scents together e.g orchard, rose, bergamount, lemon,orchid etc.\nA formulation or recipe that rightly blend with the oil or fragrance is used and the reason perfume differs is due to the formulation or recipe that will give pleasant odour. It is necessary to choose a good recipe of formulation. Alcohol is added to the fragrance or essential oils as a primary solvent to reduce the strays of the oils. Fixatives are also used with the other ingredients like water, essential oils and alcohol to lower the rate of evaporation of the fragrance of essential oils. The reason why a perfume losses its fragrance faster than normal is because only a little amount of fixative was used when preparing the perfume. 1.3 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM There is a high demand of essential oils for various purposes such as medicinal, perfumery, soap making, insecticides to mention but a few have opened up wide opportunities for global warming.\nImported essential oils are very expensive to meet the demand of our local consumer industries, therefore it becomes necessary to source and extract these oils from local source. In particular perfumes that are usually imported can be produced locally from a vast variety of oil\n4\nbearing plants yet to be explored. It has also been observed that high concentration of perfumes in the epidermal tissues can cause skin irritation or peeling due to poor formulation. This problem will be explored on this project. Solvent extraction is the safest method for extracting high quality oil because some herbs and spices cannot be extracted from enfleurage method but it has the disadvantage of having residual solvents in the essential oils. The research is conducted in order to use hydrodistillation as one of the applicable methods to extract essential oils. Hydrodistillation has the advantage of no solvent residues as an alternative to conventional extraction techniques. This research will reveal the difference in yields by the methods.\nEXTRACTION OF FORMULATION OF PERFUME FROM PLANT",

        "content": "     \n\nTHE PRODUCTION OF YAM FLOUR\n(Chemical Engineering Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Background Of The Study\nYam (dioscorea spp.) is a multi-species crop that originated principally from Africa and Asia before spreading to other parts of the world (Hahn et al.,1987). It belongs to the family of dioscoreae within the genus dioscorea and serves as a staple crop in west Africa.(Asiedu et al., 1992). There are many cultivars of yam, though only six are important as staple foods in the tropics. the economically important species grown are Dioscorea rotundata(white yam),D.alata (yellow yam),D.bulbifera (aerial yam), D.esculenta (Chinese yam) and D.dumenterum (trifoliate yam). Yam tubers which is the most important part of the plants can be stored longer than other root and tuber crops. This ensures food security even in times of general scarcity. Yam is the third most important tropical root and tuber crop after cassava and sweet potato (fu et al., 2005). West Africa is the leading producer of yam and grows over 90% of the worldwide production (40 tonnes fresh tuber/year) followed by the west Indians where Jamaica is the leading producer (FAOSTAT,2004). Nigeria is the world’s largest producer of yams followed by Ghana, ivorycoast and togo (FAO,2003). Both fresh tubers and yam flour are now exported from Ghana and Nigeria to developed countries such as united kingdom and united states of America. These are mostly patronized by emigrants from growing regions according to the Nigerian export promotion council (NEPC) Nigeria realized N56 billion in 2007. Sustainable production and utilization of yam are important steps in enhancing food security and alleviatind\n2\npoverty particularly in west Africa where it is estimated to provide more than 200 dietary calories each day for over 60 million people (Nweke et al.,1991., FAO 2002).\nYam is consumed in different forms,mainly boiled,fried or baked.tubers are often dried and milled into flour for various product,boiled yams,poundes yams and amala are the forms of yam mostly consumed in west Africa especially Nigeria and benin (Akissoe et al.,2001). Yam production faces many constraints among which are production cost (mainly planting material and labour cost),post-harvset losses(low yields). Water yam (Dioscorea alata) posses a higher multiplication ratio and tuber yields as well as better storability than the preferred indigenous species such as D.rotundata, D.alata is popular and prevalent abakaliki agro ecological zone of ebonyi state Nigeria where it is called ‘Mbala or Noula’ (igbo names) (Udensi et al.,2008) even though D.alata is also eaten boiled,it is less preferred to D.rotundata varieties. D.alata can also be processed into flour and reconstituted into fufu though generally D.alata contains less sugar and has an extended shelf-life (Raemackers,2001) which ensures availability in times of scarcity.it is also known for its high nutritional content,with crude protein content of 7.4%,starch content of 75-84% and vitamin C content of ranging from 13.0-24.7mg/100g (Osagie.1992).breeders are therefore kein to improve the food quality of the species as it has good agronomic characteristics.\n3\n1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS\nThe principal problem in yam production that has been identified is the high cost of seed yam, high labour requirement, diseases, pest as well as high post harvest losses(Orkwor 1998).another constraint to yam production is the limited processing technology. About 30% of harvested yam tubers are lost to waste. The bulkiness of fresh transport and low margins for both farmers and traders are thus a matter of serious concern in the urban market (Cooke et al.,1988).\nDuring the processing of yam through sun-drying method,the problem encountered is the loss due to potential contamination of the product variability in drying time, rain damage and so on. Ohweever, D.alata fresh texture is usually not firm as the D.rotundata (white yam) and less suitable than other species for the preparation of the most popular food product from yam in the west Africa region(Wireko-manu et al.,2011).\nFinally, during the production of flour from yam, in the western part of Nigeria (the yorubas), the yam flour produced which is called “AMALA” is normally brownish in colour and dark in nature, hence does not have a good quality and colour. Technologies therefore have been discovered to bring about the production of yam flour that has a high quality and a good colour and texture.\n4\n1.3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY\n1.3.0 MOTIVATION\nThe growing need for the variety of food in Nigeria has become a primary concern for the urban and rural households in Nigeria. In recent times, the concern has raised much researcher’s interest to do related studies. As reported in many different studies around the world, food security is a common problem.\n1.3.1 OBJECTIVES\nThe present study aims at carryout an experiment on fresh yams, optimize the drying parameters and investigate the effect of drying conditions on the quality of the yam. To result to this, the present study which will address particular issues food drying could stimulate producers, farmers, agriculturists, educational practitioners on the phenomenon of drying to enhance the quality of yams to solve past harvest losses.\nTHE PRODUCTION OF YAM FLOUR",

        "content": " THE BLEACHING OF PALM OIL USING ACTIVATED CHARCOAL\n(Chemical Engineering Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\nABSTRACT\n\nThis project work is on the bleaching of palm oil using activated charcoal.\n\nThe charcoal used for this work was made from pieces of animal bone by carbonization method.  It was then activated into two different samples.  Firstly, the basic sample was activated using anaphoric acid (H2 s04) while the other was activated by just heating as a control for the experiment; both at a constant temperature of 5000c and approximate time of 2hours.\n\nThey were both size reduced into fines and sieved into particle 3ye of 150um portion of the crude palm oil was degummed and neutralized for bleaching.  Each interval of bleaching with both the acid activated and the ordinary activated charcoal was 8mins and temperature of 1500c over a hot plate, and subsequent filtration of the solution.\n\nA spectrophotometer was used to measure the absorbance of the oils (crude and bleached) at selected wave length of 480Um.  This was converted as the degree of colour reduction expressed in percentages.\n\nResults obtained showed that optimum quantity of the charcoal for bleaching is 5% by weight, of the oil, which gives a percentage colour reduction as 97. 14% for the acid activated and 93.57% for the calcinated sample.\n\nAlso, the characterization of both the original  oil and the bleaching oil showed that the later has appreciable properties.  Hence colour reduction was observable by naked eyes.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nChapter one\n\n1.0              Introduction\n\n1.1       Preamble\n\n1.2              Objective\n\n1.3              Scope of study\n\n2.0              Literature Review\n\n2.1.0        Chemical composition of palm oil\n\n2.1.1        Carotenes\n\n2.1.2        Phosphatides\n\n2.1.3        Gums\n\n2.1.4        Compositions and standards of palm oil\n\n2.2.0        Spoilage factors of palm oil\n\n2.2.1        Preventive measures\n\n2.2.2        Inhibitors\n\n2.3.0        Refining of creebe palm oil\n\n2.3.1        Degumming\n\n2.3.2        Neutralization\n\n2.3.3        Bleaching\n\n2.3.4        Deodorization\n\n2.3.5        Chemical bleaching method\n\n2.3.6        Accretion bleaching\n\n2.3.7        Bleaching by adsorption\n\n2.4.0        Adsorption\n\n2.4.1        Uses of adsorption\n\n2.5.2        Physical adsorption\n\n2.5.2        Chemisorptions\n\n2.6.0    Adsorbents\n\n2.6.1        Bauxite\n\n2.6.2        Decolourising carbons\n\n2.6.3        Gas-adsorbent carbon\n\n2.6.4        Molecular screening activated carbon\n\n2.6.5        Synthetic polymeric adsorbents\n\n2.6.6        Silica Gel\n\n2.6.7        Alumna\n\n2.6.8        Bone char.\n\n2.7.0        Charcoal\n\n2.7.1        Properties of charcoal\n\n2.7.2        Activated charcoal\n\n2.7.3        Methods of charcoal activation\n\n2.7.4        Properties of activated charcoal\n\n2.7.5        Chemical properties of activated charcoal\n\n2.7.6          Physical properties of activated charcoal\n\n2.7.7        Uses of activated charcoal\nCHAPTER THREE\n\n3.0              Experimental method\n\n3.1.0        Materials\n\n3.1.1    Material treatment\n\n3.2.0        Charcoal activation using acid\n\n3.2.1        Charcoal activation by heat treatment\n\n3.3.0        Degumming of Palm oil\n\n3.3.1        Neutralization\n\n3.4.0        Bleaching of palm oil\n\n3.4.1        Experimental set-up\n\n3.5.0        Characterization of palm oil\n\n3.5.1        Specific gravity\n\n3.5.2        Iodine value\n\n3.5.3        Free fatty acid\n\n3.5.4        Saponification value\n\n3.5.5        Esterification value\n\n3.5.6        Process flow chart\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\n4.0              Experimental result\n\n4.1.0        Effect of bleaching sample\n\n4.2.0        Effect of temperature on bleaching\n\n4.3.0        Colour observation at absorbance\n\n4.4.0        Concise table for characterization\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\n5.0              Discussion\nCHAPTER SIX\n\n6.0              Conclusion\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\n7.0              Recommendation\n\nReferences\n\nTable of nomenclature\n\nAppendices\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1              PREAMBLE\n\nPalm oil is one of the various types of vegetable oils, belonging to the group called liquids, because of its fatty acids content.\n\nThe majority of the fats contains some colouring matter either as a natural constituent or discoloration produced during the processing.  Natural pigments present in vegetable oils are mainly the carotenoid, giving yellow and red colours, and the chlorophylls which give green colours.  Colour deterioration can also take place during the extraction process, especially in the local method of extraction used in the most parts of the Eastern region in Nigeria.\n\nRemoval or reduction of colours and other components, otherwise called ‘Bleaching” is necessary not only because a pale-coloured fat has an appeal of ‘purity’ but also because the colours of the fat can influence the appearance of prepared food and even more importantly, the pigment present may affect the flavour and stability of the fats and food made from it.\n\nThe decolouration (bleaching) could be achieved by chemical treatment, heat treatment and adsorption methods.  The most effective and widely used being the later.  Thus, in this research project, bleaching by adsorption is carred out using an “Activated charcoal” (an adsorbent), a kind of active carbon, to substitute the use of local clays and the imported ‘Fuller’s Earth – in Palm Oil bleaching, which are rather expensive.\n\nThe charcoal can be produced from different sources as from, coal, wood, bone, coconut shell, etc.  It would be verified the most suitable form and type of charcoal for effective bleaching and the most favourable condition at which  the “activated charcoal could be used, which in them affects the bleach ability’ of the Palm oil itself.\n\n1.2              OBJECTIVE\n\nThe objective / aim of this research project is to verify the effectiveness of ‘Activated charcoal’ in the bleaching of palm oil.  It will also expose the improvement in the use of local raw material (charcoal) in a chemical process (bleaching), in lien of the imported fuller’s Earth or other adsorbents which more expensive.\n\n1.3              SCORE OF THE STUDY\n\nBasically, this, study dwells on the colours reduction of Palm oil, using an Activated charcoal as an adsorbent (bleaching agent).  The major raw materials, Palm oil and charcoal were locally sourced, and information as regards the process were obtained form the literary and other resourceful materials (texts) that treats ‘Adsorption’ as a chemical process.\nTHE BLEACHING OF PALM OIL USING ACTIVATED CHARCOAL\n",

It is also used by farmers, loads that is too heavy or bulky to be carried by hand and is similar to hand truckds used by warehouse men and industrial workers, except that the latter have two wheels. Moderns wheel barrows are made of a light metal, such as aluminum, and have a rubber five on the wheel. A two wheel machine for carrying garden materials is more property called garden cart.\n\n          The purpose of the production of this machine is to reduce, alleviate and probably eliminate the sufferins, time money, wastage of man power and more especially the need for technological break through and self reliance, which has been a major concern of the federal government.\n\n          Therefore, carrying of head pans of sand, grovel, concrete and heavy load on human heads has been a tiring problem in the society, from time immemorial especially  towards our loco-parenthesis. To help eradicate those problems, this project at hand has delved into simplicities and the construction of this machine that can be used to carry different types of heavy load to any distance.\n\nORIGIN AND HISTORY\n\n          The origin and development of the barrow hold on important place in the history of invention, not because in itself it represent a major technological innovation, but because it clearly illustrates a phenomenon known as independent invention.\n\n          Thus, the wheel barrow has more than a single source of origin and was developed for different purposes.\n\n          The earliest form of wheel barrow was developed in china shortly before AD 200 and traditionally its design is attributed to a general in the imperial army, although this is probably more enough to suggest how it originated. The single wheel is large often three or four feet in diameter and usually has a dozen or more spokes. It is set between the shafts at a considerable distance from the front end of the barrow, while a boxing or wooden frame is built up form the shaft to encase the upper half of wheel.\n\nPlatform projected from the shaft on both sides.\n\nThe goods to be carried are loaded on these platforsm and on the upper surface of the boxing.\n\nIf the burden are correctly placed not only would it weight balances on both sides of the wheel barrow but it would also balance before and after the exile of the wheel. The weight of the load is hence almost supported by the wheel and the man pushing the barrow could used his energy solely for moving it and maintaining its balance.\n\n          This kind of barrow appears to have been developed from a two wheeled hand ccart in which, with modification, the pair of wheel wet, rice growing, area, field boundaries are often no more than narrow embracement, the tops barrow, therefore seem to be on adoption of the hand cert designed to allow it to more along narrow paths. Indeed early illustration of Chinese wheel barrow and formed placing apart from pushing and balancing has to left a large parts of the burden. It was totally unsuitable for shifting goods over long distances.\n\n          Until the seventh century when direct contact where made between European and China, as a result of trade, each area had it own distinct form of wheel barrow, although by this time both were frequently modified to serve other needs than those for which they were designed.\nCONSTRUCTION OF INDUSTRIAL WHEEL BARROW",

The material used for the construction of the machine is mild steel sheet. During the construction of the machine, the various parts of it were constructed separately using the mild steel sheet before finally coupled.  It is constructed in a way that when the handle is moved the fruits are crushed to give juice.\n\nThe fabrication of the machine start with transferring of the information contained in the engineering drawing on the blank material from which the part is to be produced.  The engineering drawing are presented on paper with the use of pencil and meter rule while marking out involves drawing of lines on a metal surface with the use of scriber, meter rule etc to indicate the profile or outline of the finished components.\n\nManually operated juice extractor machine was an outstanding low cost, easy to maintain.  It is also easy to operate and good efficiency for small scale production.  The machine encourage students to be self employed and reliant.  It was discovered that the manual juice machine help for easy transportation of materials, easy separation of impurities through mechanical process, easy formation of solution through extraction etc.\n\nDue to the fact that the machine is constructed manually with local material, it is not up to standard.  That is to say that it may not be durable since juice is liquid in nature, it has a good amount of moisture in it, which would enhance the corrosion of the mild steel frame. And once corrosion takes place it will lead to weakness of the machine.\n\nIn fact, the manual juice extractor is at low cost and easy to operate.  It is not as costly as that of electric juice extractor.  It cost us only twenty-three thousand naira (N23,000).  It is the cheapest equipment used to start up a small-scale production.\n\n TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nCHAPTER ONE \n\n1.0    INTRODUCTION                                         \n\n1.1        BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY                       \n\n1.2        STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM                      \n\n1.3        PURPOSE/AIM/OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY     \n\n1.4        SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY        \n\n1.5        METHOD OF RESEARCH                                       \n\n1.6        SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY                      \n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\n2.1    LITERATURE REVIEW                                  \n\n2.1.1 HISTORY OF CONSTRUCTION AND\n\nUSES OF SIZE REDUCTION EQUIPMENT/\n\nMACHINE                                                  \n\n2.2    THEORY OF OPERATION OF SIZE REDUCTION\n\n2.3    FACTOR THAT AFFECT THE EFFICIENCY OF\n\nSIZE REDUCTION MACHINE                         \n\n2.4    TYPES OF SIZE REDUCTION EQUIPMENT        \n\n2.5    CRUSHES                                                 \n\n2.6    APPLICATION OF REDUCTION EQUIPMENT\n\nLIKE FRUIT JUICE CRUSHER/EXTRACTOR       \n\n2.7    FACTORS AFFECTING JUICE CRUSHING EXTRACTOR/MACHINE                                  \n\n          CHAPTER THREE\n\n3.0    CONSTRUCTION METHODOLOGY                   \n\n3.1    SELECTION OF MATERIAL FOR CONSTRUCTION\n\n3.2    CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURE                                  \n\n3.21  MAKING OUT OPERATORS                           \n\n3.22  EQUIPMENT USED FOR MAKING OUT                \n\n3.3    CUTTING OPERATORS                                    \n\n3.4    PRESS SIZE REQUIREMENT FOR CUTTING         \n\n3.5    PUNCHING/DRILLING OPERATION                    \n\n3.6    WELDING JOINING OPERATION                       \n\n3.7.1 ARC WELDING                                               \n\n3.72  ELECTRODES USED IN WELDING                      \n\n3.73  SPECIFICATION OF WELDING ELECTRODES      \n\n3.8    SEQUENCE OF OPERATION                             \n\n3.81  THE  ROTATING SHAFT AND CONVEYOR\n\nHOUSING                                                    \n\n3.82  HOPPER                                                              \n\n3.83  SQUEEZE CHAMBER                                            \n\n3.84  PLATE GAP AND ADJUSTMENT SCREW           \n\n3.85  STANDING                                                 \n\n3.86  DRIVEN PULLEY/PRIME MOVER                     \n\n3.86  SURFACE FINISHING AND COATING              \n\n3.87  SAFETY OF THE OPERATION                         \n\n3.91  PRECAUTIONS                                                   \n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\n4.0    RESULTS ANALYSIS                                            \n\n          CHAPTER FIVE \n\n5.1    DISCUSSION                                                     \n\n5.1.1  PRECAUTION                                                    \n\n5.1.2  MAINTENANCE                                                    \n\n5.2    CONCLUSION                                                     \n\n5.3    RECOMMENDATION                                            \n\n        REFERENCES                                                      \n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0          INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1    BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY\n\n        Fruit have been cultivated for the last 2000 years in Southern China and South-East Asia, one variety the citron and south-east was carried to the middle east sometime between 400 and 600 BC. Arab traders transported different kinds of fruit like orange to eastern Africa and the Middle East sometime between 100 and 700 AD and during the Arab occupation of Spain, Citrus fruits first arrived in southern Europe from there they were carried to the new world by explores where they spread to fluoride and Brazil (By the sixteenth century by 1800 citrus fruits achieved world wide distribution). In the 1890s, the demand for them greatly increased because physicians discovered that drinking the juice of organs or other citrus fruit could prevent survey, A vitamin deficiency disease.\n\n        The popularity of orange juice dramatically increased again with the development of the commercial orange juice industry in the late 1920. In its early day, the juice industry primary relied on salvased fruit, which was unstable for regular consumption because it was badly colored in 1944 scientist found a way to concentrate fruit juice in a vacuum and freeze it with destroying the flavour or vitamin content.\n\n        After World War II most Americans stopped squeezing their own juice and concentrated because the predominant for, with the increase in home refrigeration, frozen concentrate became even more popular. In 1985 when reconstituted and NFC juice first out sold the frozen type. Today commercial aseptic packaging allow RTD juice to be marketed without refrigerated storage the current world wide market for orange juice is more than and $2.5 billion with the biggest area being the biggest in United States (USA) followed by Canada, Western Europe and Japan.  \n\n1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\n\n        Fruit Juice over the year, has been successfully used in the production and manufacturing of the edible refined juice using machine which were fabricated and constructed to large scale production, industrialization and large capital requirement.\n\n        This make the extraction of fruit juice a fantasy to local and small-scale industrial establishment. Furthermore, the major ways by which the suckle in which fruit juice has been enjoyed over the years has been by the employment of teeth in biting off the mind and chewing up the internal tissue. When this is achieved, the juice would then be extracted and sucked in the mouth. The grossness of this procedure trends to put the human teeth in duress, imagine if it to be consumed in large quantity, if also led to low scale production of the fruit by the farmers.\n\n        At present, the construction of the coltage industry for fruit juice extractor has been facilitated to cushion these problem so far.\n\n1.3    PURPOSE/AIMS/OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n\n        Because of the great demand for juice produce a higher quantity and grade today brought about the need for this project.\n\n        The objectives of this project are;\n\ni.                 To reduce the bulkiness of the fruits in terms of size\n\nii.                To ease transportation in terms of size maximum quality of juice from the produce or fruit used.\n\niii.

For the purpose of our basic concern – construction of stove, we will be limited or streamlined to metals alone.\n\nAfter considering the various material properties and its associated factors, the following are selectively considered; low carbon steel, medium carbon steel, high carbon steel, galvanized steel, stainless steel and metallic rod.\n\nThe use of kerosene store at homes and industries a source of heat and for heating substances has played a vital role in the fulfillment of man’s existence; that is had performed specific functions.\n\nUntil the recent development of technology which lead to the refining of crude oil into various fraction – kerosene, the use of firewood, coal and other fossile fuels materials has been the only source of cooking or heat energy in Nigeria.\n\nThe design and construction of cooking stove is made in such a way that it provides the four basic elements of combustion without which purpose for construction cannot be maximized.\n\nIn order to provide for the basic element of combustion, the system is built to contain many components the most important being the burner.\n\nKerosene serves as the main component of aviation fuel for jet engines. In many developing countries, kerosene is the next to fire wood in domestic application.\nCONSTRUCTION OF KEROSENE COOKING STOVE\n",

These raw materials are found to be very much in abundance. Some are materials sourced from the ground and others are from agricultural wastes.\n\nThree different types of ceiling boards were produced, their difference being in the type of fibre that was used. The fibres used for this different type includes; cellulose fibre obtained from pulped carton, saw dust and rice husk.\n\nThe raw materials used for the production of the different ceiling boards includes, cement, calcium carbonate (CaCo3), Kaolin, starch and water.\n\nThe first type produced is from pulped carton. First, the cartons were collected, size reduce, soaked in a large quantity of water for 24hours, strained to remove the water and the milled by grinding using a motar and pestle. The quantity to be used was weighed out. The other raw materials which include starch, powdered kaolin, calcium carbonate and water were all measured. The pulped carton was poured and thoroughly mixed. The CaCo3, kaolin and starch and water were all measured. The pulped Carton was poured into the reactor; next cement was poured and thoroughly mixed. The CaCo3, kaolin and starch was added one after the other while stirring continued. Finally, water was added sparingly and gradually until a very smooth slurry was obtained. This was then poured into a mould and smoothened out using a roller and was left to dry. It took 7days for it to get dry.\n\nThe next produced was ceiling board from sawdust. The sawdust was first sieved, soaked for a day and then strained to remove the water. The quantity used was measured as well as all the other raw materials that was used. The same procedure was repeated as that of the first method and it was allowed to dry. It took three days to dry.\n\nFinally, ceiling board using rice husk was produced. The rice husk was sieved, materials to be used weighed out and procedure repeated again in this case and allowed to dry. It took 5 days for it to dry. Drying was done with solar energy for all cases.\n\nThe three different types were subjected to different test. This includes; moisture content test percentage humidity, bursting strength. The weight of the wet samples and dry samples was obtained as well as the density and volume.\n\nFinally, the different ceiling boards were coasted. Ceiling board from cellulose fibre (Sample A) costs N186.00 for the production, that of sawdust costs N184.00 while that of rice husk costs N185.00.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENT\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.0       INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1       Aims and Objectives of the Project\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW\n\n2.0       History of Ceiling Board\n\n2.1       Types of Ceiling Board\n\n2.1.1        Asbestos Cement Ceiling Board\n\n2.1.2        Acoustical Ceiling Board\n\n2.1.3        Gypsum Ceiling Board\n\n2.1.4        Gypsum Fibre Celling Board\n\n2.1.5        Cement Fibre Ceiling Board\n\n2.2              Raw Materials Used For The Production Of Ceiling Boards\n\n2.2.1        Cement\n\n2.2.2        Fibre\n\n2.2.3        Starch\n\n2.2.4        Calcium Carbonate\n\n2.2.5        Kaolin\n\n2.2.6        Additives\n\n2.2.7        Pigments\n\n2.2.8        Fludifiers\n\n2.3              The Study Of Thermal Properties Of The Ceiling Boards\n\n2.3.1        Thermal Comfort\n\n2.3.2        The Principles Of Thermal Insulation\n\n2.3.3        Typical Thermal Properties Of Some Ceiling Boards\n\n2.3.4        Conductivity Of Porous Materials\n\n2.3.5        Surfaces Coefficients\n\n2.4              Study Of Acoustic Properties\n\n2.4.1        Acoustic Properties\n\n2.4.2        Sound Absorption\n\n2.4.3        Basic Factors In Acoustic Design\n\n2.4.4        Manufacturing Process\n\n2.5              Manufacturing Process\n\n2.5.1        The manufacture of wood wool cements ceiling board.\n\n2.5.2        Production Of Ceiling From Various Types Of Fibred\n\n2.5.3        Production Of Ceiling Board From Paper\n\nCHAPTER THREE.\n\n3.0              Manufacturing Process\n\n3.1       Apparatus and Equipment Used For the Production\n\n3.2              Chemicals And Materials Used For The Production\n\n3.3              Composition Of Materials Used For The Production\n\n3.4              Preparation Of Raw Materials\n\n3.5              Production Procedure\n\n3.6              Dying\n\n3.7              Trimming\n\n3.8              Analysis Of The Samples\n\n3.8.1        Introduction of the samples\n\n3.8.2        Composition of sample sheet\n\n3.8.3        Test and result of test\n\n3.8.4        Rate of drying\n\n3.8.5        Bursting strength\n\n3.8.6        Moisture strength\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\n4.0              Costing\n\n4.1       Cost of Raw Materials\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\n5.0              DISCUSSION\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\n6.0              CNCLUSSION/RECOMMENDATION\n\nReference\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA ceiling board is a horizontal slab covering the upper section of a room or internal space. A ceiling board is generally not structural but is a shell concealing the details of the structure above. However, the ceiling might be holding up building materials such as heat or sound insulation.\n\nIn modern buildings, electric lights, smoke detector, security cameras and signage are commonly attached to ceilings.\n\n            This project however, is based on the production of ceiling board from local raw materials. These local raw materials include cement, fibre cellulose, fibre obtained from ground paper, mainly waste paper, water and some other additives.\n\n            There are different types of ceiling boards. These include;\n\n1)      Gypsum ceiling boards;\n\n2)      Acoustical ceiling boards;\n\n3)      Gypsum fibre ceiling boards;\n\n4)      Cement fibre-ceiling boards. Etc\n\nThese types of ceiling boards are grouped in accordance to the raw materials used for the production. Gypsum ceiling boards are produced from gypsum, Acoustical ceiling boards are obtained from mineral wool, gypsum and small amount of paper and starch. Gypsum fibre ceiling boards are produced from gypsum and fibre to reinforce the ceiling board.\n\n            This study however will be based mainly on the production of fibre cement ceiling boards. This consist essentially of an inorganic binder usually calcium silicate formed by the chemical reaction of a siliceous material and a calcareous material. This is reinforced by organic fibres, fillers and pigment compatible with the fibre reinforced cement to form a ceiling board.\n\nIn the past, ceiling boards were produced using Asbestos a fibre present naturally in rocks. It was used because of its high tensile strength, poor heat conductivity and high fire resistance. However, asbestos causes asbestosis, which leads to cancer. As a result of this problem, manufacturers of ceiling boards went into research to find out substitutes that can be used in the production of ceiling boards.\n\nThis substitute includes shredded wood, cellulose fibre agricultural waste etc.\n\nRather than industrial products (glass-fibre, iron fillings) and man-made\n\nmaterials, the fibres best suited to the socio-economic circumstances of developing countries are natural fibres.\n\nThis project therefore, is based on how these natural fibres can be used in the production of ceiling boards in order to reduce cost and as well comparing the product with that which has been produced naturally.\n\n1.1       AIMS AND OOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT\n\n1.                  To study the possibility of making use of local raw materials for the production of ceiling board.\n\n2.                  To produce a board with good acoustic and thermal insulating properties.\n\n3.                  To produce a board with reduced cost to discourage importation there by saving Nigeria her foreign exchange and booting her economic status.\n\n4.                  To reduce environmental pollution caused by indiscriminate litering of papers and the pollution of the air resulting from burning these waste.\nMANUFACTURE OF CEILING BOARD USING LOCAL MATERIALS",

This substance is essential and has universal applications. Thus the aim of this research work is to produce it using cassava starch as a base binder. Starch is also used in industries to produce ethanol and glucose for textile industries, laundry and paper adhesive industries.\n\nIt is of great importance to paper, wood and furniture industries and the need to produce a more stable adhesive locally to minimize cost remains the investigating factor for embarking on this research work.\n\nThe method of wood adhesive production used in this work was the questionnaire work was the geletinization method. In the production, the optimum geletinization temperature was found to be 800c while the optimum temperature of dextrin formation is 1400c. The production involves the souring of the starch from cassava, determination of the various additives employed in the production. The materials used in the production works were sourced in line with the objectives of the research. The following components were used: starch extracted from cassava which is responsible for the adhesion force that holds two bodies together, calcium carbonate (CaCo3) for viscosity improvement, formaddehyde as preservative, natrosol cellulose as a thicker and water as solvent.\n\nExperimental analysis was based on all the factors that influence the stability of an adhesive example pH values, viscosity, tack time, boarding strength etc. the values obtained were compared with the standard brands and were found to compare favourably with other standard adhesives.\n\nFormulation B showed the most desirable characteristics and hence is the optimum sample.\n\nAn adequate cost analysis was also carried out to determine the feasibility of the project on a commercial venture. Thus, a locally sourced product (wood adhesive) that can complete with similar product in terms of properties but at a much reduced cost was produced. The shelf life and teak time of the product were determined and found to be good. The wood adhesive was established to be water resistant.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1              Historical background (preamble)\n\n1.2              Meaning of adhesive\n\n1.3              Aims and objectives\n\n1.4              The scope of the project\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW (SURVEY)\n\n2.1              Historical report on adhesives.\n\n2.2              Starch adhesive.\n\n2.3              Adhesives\n\n2.4              Classification of adhesive.\n\n2.5              Factors considered when selecting a wood adhesive.\n\n2.6              Advantages and limitations of the adhesives with respect to mechanical fasteners.\n\n2.7              Adhesion and cohesion.\n\n2.8              Components of adhesives\n\n2.9              Starch.\n\n2.10          Physical properties of starch\n\n2.11          Chemical properties of starch\n\n2.12          Degr isolation of starch\n\n2.13          Adation of starch\n\n2.14          Gelatinisation of starch.\n\n2.15                 Cassava Starch\n\n2.16                 Maize Starch\n\n2.18          Components Of Starch Adhesives And Their Functions\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nMATERIALS AND DMETHOD FOF ANALYSIS.\n\n3.1                Source of materials\n\n3.2                This research work involves.\n\n3.2.1           Extraction of starch from cassava.\n\n3.2.2           Production of wood adhesive from cassava starch.\n\n3.2.2.1                          Procedure\n\n3.2.3    Analysis\n\n3.2.3.1                          Bonding Strength Determination\n\n3.2.3.2                          Melting Point Determination\n\n3.2.3.3                          Spreadability Test\n\n3.2.3.4                          Solid content determination\n\n3.2.3.5                          Ph determination\n\n3.2.3.6                          Moisture content determination\n\n3.2.3.7                          Resistance to moiture.\n\n3.2.3.8                          Shelf life test.\n\n3.2.3.9                          Viscosity test\n\n3.2.3.1 Tack time determination\n\n3.2                                      Packaging and storage\n\n3.3                                      Comparing the product with the standard set\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nRESULT AND DISCUSSIONS\n\n4.1              Experimental Results\n\n4.2       Comparative with Standards: Parameters for Ranges of Wood Adhesives.\n\n4.2.0                                Discussions\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\nCONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n5.1              Conclusion.\n\n5.2              Recommendations\n\nReferences\n\nAppendix\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.5              HISTORICAL BACKGROUND (PREAMBLE)\n\nTechnology has played an important role in man’s development and thus, has helped to shape the world as it is seen today. This could be seen in all facets of industrial ventures, hence the introduction of new products into the market.\n\nMan’s growing desire to hold two or more substance together by surface attachment so that they can be used a s a single piece coupled with the technological advancement has given birth to a broad range of adhesive production to serve this purpose.\n\nThe technique of adhesive bonding has come of age. It is not possible to say when the practice was first developed and used. From history, history made us to believe that the first adhesive even made or used by man was probably clay, animal glue and resinous exudates from trees, of which is known to go back a very long way over 3300 years ago.\n\nThe Egyptians used vegetable glue adhesives in wood works and in the production of Papyri. It was during the 19thcentury that there was technological advancement which led to the sourcing and production of varieties of adhesive. In 1912, F.G Parkins found out that starch could be converted by mild caustic soda solution into a liquid glue that was stable at room temperature.\n\nMost of the popular adhesive currently in use in the country are imported as such the clamour for adhesive that are locally produced has been on primary concern for embarking on this project. It is the aim of this project to produce wood adhesive from local raw materials using maize or corn or cassava as the case study or reference study. Though starch can be extracted from plants for example corn, barley, wheat and potatoes and cassava but for simplicity sake have to be reduced to maize and cassava.\n\n1.6              MEANING OF ADHESIVE\n\nThere is no universally accepted definition of adhesive, however an adhesive is defined by its usage. It could be defined a substance capable of holding materials together by surface attachment.\n\nThe need to hold two or more substances together by surface attachment so that they can be used as a single piece without damage done to the adherents and with more uniform distribution of stress calls for the production of adhesive. Adhesive development has evolved into a field practically on its own, where the market for more specialized adhesives has emerged.\n\nThey are now used for a variety of purposes ranging from packaging materials, book binding, hold wood together, brake lining, where they would have reduced surface to surface contact required. The reasons for joining these surfaces is the get a composite is to effect every handling and create a better outlook.\n\nThe working properties of the different adhesives vary therefore various methods were used to obtain an adhesive to serve a defined purpose.\n\n1.7              AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\na.                   Because of the growing need for adhesive in our industries, it is the aim of this project to produce wood adhesive from local raw materials.\n\nb.                  It seeks to utilize our available resources that are abundant in nature and cheap to secure.\n\nc.                   It is also aimed at producing wood adhesive for our industries so that we can achieve self and economic reliance by reducing our dependence on imported variety or foreign adhesive.\n\nd.                  It also helps to create employment for unemployed youths since adhesive industry does not require complex machinery.\n\n1.8              THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT\n\nThe research work involves the extraction from a locally sourced material for simplicity sake, adhesive formulation under different production condition, to determine the effects of varying production composition on the production. The project would also involve the analysis of the formulation gotten. It also determines the cost of production per annum of small scale plant.\n\nComparison between standard (wood adhesive gotten from the market) and that produced from this project. It is done by detailed analyst of the production properties.\nPRODUCTION OF WOOD ADHESIVE",

        "content": " EXTRACTION OF OIL FROM LOCAL SEED (GROUNDNUT SEED) & CHARACTERIZATION\n(Chemical Engineering Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis project “Extraction of oil from a local seed (groundnut oil) and Characterization” was carried out using ten cups of groundnut seeds that was purchased from a local market in Enugu metropolis.  The oil these seeds were in Enugu using solvent extraction method.  Two different solvents were used in the extraction namely: Ethane and order to compare their yield, physical and chemical properties.\n\nThe extraction was carried out using 32og of size-reduced groundnut with 100ml of 17-hexane while 1.5litres a 15ooml of ethanol was used on 480g of size reduced groundnut seeds.  Ta the end of the extraction operation, the amount of oil-extracted using17-hexane was observed to be far greater than the amount of oil extracted using ethanol.\n\nThe chemical and physical properties of the oil were determined by analysis of the oil.  The physical appearance of 17- hexane extract is light yellow in colour this; true colour of groundnut oil while that the ethanol extract has a light bown colour.  The colour of ethanol on pigments in the size-reduced groundnut seed.\n\nFrom  the result obtained, it was deduced that 17-hexane remains the best solvent for oil extraction while ethanol is not a good solvent for oil extraction.\n\n CHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nExtraction other-wise called leaching is the preferential solution of one or more constituents of a solid mixture by contact with a liquid solvent.  This unit operation, one of the oldest in the chemical industries, here been given many names, depending to some extent upon the technique used for carrying it out extraction of oil form groundnut seeds can be carried out using any of the two solid-liquid extraction methods namely: mechanical extraction method or the used of solvent other- wise called mass-transfer method. The yield of the second method is higher but contains more impurities than the first method and it requires another unit operation (distillation) in purity it better.\n\nThe success of an extraction and the technique to be used will vary frequently depending upon any prior treatment which may be given to he solid.  In some instance small particles of the soluble material are completely surrounded by a matrix of insoluble matter.  The solvent must then diffuse into the mass, and the resulting solution must diffuse out before a separation can result.  Crushing and grinding of such solids will greatly alliterate the leaching action, since then the soluble portions are made more accessible to the solvent.\n\nSeeds like groundnut seeds and other vegetable seeds are cellular in structure, and the natural products to be leached form this material are usually found inside the cells. if the cell walls remain intact upon exposure to a suitable solvent, the leaching involves osmotic passage of the solute through the cell walls.  This may be slow, but in is impractical and sometime undesirable to grind the material small enough to release the contents of individual cells.\n\nOil constitutes a well-defined class of neutral organic substance, which are essential constituents of all forms of plant and animal life.  They are soluble in other and organic solvents but not in water.  Commercial oils are however from a relatively few member of the plant and animal kingdom available forms. They are primary a product of agriculture although these is also a considerably production from uncultivated tropical plants and from mature animals. Oil can be grouped into edible and non-edible depending on the amount of unspecified matters and impurities. Owing to the fact that the use of oil from crop seed as a major raw materials has increased in recent yeses their has been the need for extended and numerous research works based on the extraction of these oil.  Form its seeds as economically efficiently as possible.\n\nThe only possible way of obtaining large quality of oil from oil being vegetable or plant materials is by extraction and this could best be achieve using leading process. This process can be accomplished by a variety of ways but as might be expected its efficiency depends to an extant an obtaining intimate contact between the liquid solvent and the solid containing he solute.  Leaching reduces the oil content in the residue to about 0.5-1.5 percent as compared.\n\nWith about 5-9 percent by mechanical process. The types of solvent available for leaching include 17-hexane, petroleum ether benzene ethyl ether etc which are high petroleum fractions.  The choice of a solvent for extraction is a function of its volatility and relative volatility for easy separation by distillation.\n\nGroundnut oil is used primary in homes for cooking and also as an industrial raw material for other usefully products.\n\n1.2     SCOPE AIMS/ OBJECTIVES FO THE PROJECT\n\nThe scope of this research project is to extract oil from groundnut seeds and compare the yields obtained using different solvents and to standard.\n\nAlso the project is aimed at characterizing the extracted oil by determining the physical and chemical properties of the oil.\nEXTRACTION OF OIL FROM LOCAL SEED (GROUNDNUT SEED) & CHARACTERIZATION",

        "content": " SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL SYSTEMS\n(Chemical Engineering Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis seminar topic “Solid Waste Management and Disposal system” is based on the research on what solid waste is all about, how it is managed and its methods of disposal systems. Research on this topic enable us to know that solid wastes are discarded solid materials such as scraps of plastic, rubbers nylon, paper, etc. Also, the collection and processing of these wastes as well as disposal constitute the management of solid wastes. The disposal systems tell us the methods of disposing solid wastes and where they are disposed as well as the transportation of the collected materials. From this seminar,solid wastes are separated into various components and recycled to produce good and usable products. The effective waste management and disposal system result into a clean and healthy environment for living, reduces the spread of diseases and aids the growth of the economy.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWHAT IS SOLID WASTE?\n\nThe United States Environmental protection Agency defined a solid waste as any uselss, unwanted or discarded material with insufficient liquid content, EPA (1975). Because of its sticky nature, a solid Waste has the quality of accumulating, and physically insulting the environment. Omuta (1988), defined a solid as plastic, rubber, paper, glass, etc arising from domestic, trade, commercial, agricultural and industrial activities. Moreso, solid matter that are created by human or animal activities and which are disposed because they are considered useless are known as solid wastes. Most of the solid wastes like plastic, robber, etc. are non. Biodegradable which means that they do not get broken down through organic processes thus, when they accumulate, they pose a health threat to the people. According to Eze (1995), a solid waste means any refuse, gabbage and other discarded materials resulting from community, agricultural and industrial operations.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF SOLID WASTES\n\nAccording to Umeh (1991), solid wastes have potential to cause harmful effect if not properly managed. He classified solid wastes into the following.\n\n-              Garbage: decomposable wastes\n\n-              Rubbish: non-decomposable wastes such as plastic, Rubber,etc.\n\n-              Ashes: residues from combustion of solid fuels\n\n-              Dead animals.\n\n-              Large wastes: Wastes from construction and demolition of structures.\n\n-              Industrial wastes: such materials like scraps of plastic, rubber etc.\n\n-              Agricultural wastes: farm animals manure and crop residues.\n\nHowever, according to Bernade (1987), solid waste can be classified into different classes depending on their sources:\n\n-              Household waste which is generally classified as municipal waste.\n\n-              Industrial waste as hazardous wastes\n\n-              Biomedical waste as infections waste.\n\nSOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT PRACTICES\n\nSolid wastes management practices can be divided into two namely:\n\n1.  The management of the wastes in the areas  where they are generated.\n\n2.  The management of the wastes at dumping grounds.\n\nSolid wastes management practices include the issues that are related to wastes generation, storage, collection and removal from collection points. Moreso, solid wastes management practice is an issue that cuts across every sector of the economy. It is an aspect that has been generating concern in the Chemical Industry which has become a challenge to the Chemical Engineers. Advocates of Environmental protection Agency have drawn the attention of the national policy –maker to the health hazards and potential dangers to natural resources caused by the inadequate management of wastes, Anard (1999). There  is a wide variation in both the physical and chemical nature of wastes generated as one goes from one household to another or one industry to another.\n\nFurthermore, waste management is a serious environmental problem that has been the subject of several studies, conferences, strategic meetings and debates. According to Tanaka (1998), the purpose of waste management is to preserve the living environment and improve public health through the restriction of wastes discharge, appropriate sorting, storage, collection, transport, recycling, etc. of wastes and conservation of clean living environment. Thus, wastes management practices are expected to contribute significantly to the conservation of the living environment and maintenance of a high standard of public hygiene.\n\nSOLID WASTES COLLECTION METHODS\n\nThe methods vary widely among different countries and regions. These includes:\n\n1.          CURBSIDE COLLECTION: In this method, every urban domestic household is provided  with three bins. One for recyclables, another for general wastes and the third for garden materials. These bins may be provided by the government if requested or individuals.\n\n2.          ENVAC COLLECTION: This is the convey of refuse via under ground conduits using a vacuum system.\n\nMoreso, domestic wastes collection services are often provided by local government authorities or by private companies.\n\nDISPOSAL SYSTEMS\n\nThe issue of waste disposal has become one of the most crucial matters confronting the society. Public concern on this issue continued to be expressed daily through the medial such as news paper, magazine, radio and television, Anon (1995). The scientist has spent much time to analyze various stages of waste control systems which are applicable to today’s waste generation and disposal means. The indiscriminate dumping of refuse by many or individual on unapproved or unauthorized areas such as the ground, street corners constitute a big problem to the society. This refuse emits bad odour that is harzardous to man’s health. Moreso, the disposal of waste is a problem. This problem continues to grow with the growth of population and development of industries. Disposal of wastes in open pits have become routine in majority of places some of the methods of disposal systems include incineration, recycling, sustainability, biological reprocessing, energy recovery and avoidance & reduction method.\n\nFurthermore, the problem of solid waste disposal is as a result of increasing urbanization coupled with colonial policy on urban planning. It was observed that before our contact with the Europeans that each household was responsible for keeping its immediate environment clean. Today, traditional dumps have disappeared and the open space converted to housing. However, alternate arrangement has been made for proper solid waste disposal which includes composting, land filling, incinerations and recycling.\n\nSOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES\n\n1.     WASTE HIERARCHY: The waste management hierarchy refers to “3Rs which means, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. This classifies waste management in terms of waste minimization. The waste hierarchy remains the cornerstone of most waste minimization strategies. The aim is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of wastes. The hierarchy diagram is shown below.      \n\n                       \n\n2.    POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE: This is a principle where the polluting party pays for the impact caused to the environment. Also, a waste generator pays for the disposal of the wastes.\n\n3.     TALORIES DECLARATION PRINCIPLE: This is a declaration for sustainability concerned with unprecedented scale and speed of environment pollution, degradation and depletion of natural resources.\nSOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL SYSTEMS",

        "content": " THE EXTRACTION OF OIL FROM LOCAL SEED\n(Chemical Engineering Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe seminar topic, “Extraction of oil from local seeds” is based on the study of palm oil and groundnut oil from palm fruits and groundnut seeds respectively, which are the local seeds. Oil is an organic substance which is an essential constituent of plants and animals. Extraction is a technique used for collecting oil from local seeds. The three major methods of extracting oil from local seeds are; Rendering, mechanical pressing of Extraction of oil fro local seeds involve, grinding, boiling denusking, and skimming off of the oil. The factors that affect the rate of extraction of oil from local seeds include Temperature, particle size, nature of solvent and Agitation. Oil can be produced on a small scale using the traditional method which involves dehusking, cooking and skimming off while the production on a large scale involves the use of machines such as Expellers, Ghania, etc. The adoption of a traditional method is tedios and time consuming while the mechanized method saves time and reduces stress. The oil Extracted can be used for making soaps, as an ingredient in other foods such as baked or fried goods. Finally, the palm kernel is used in making P.K.O The waste from the groundnut oil extraction can be used for making a snack-like food called “kulikuli” while the chaff from the palm oil extraction can be use as a source of fuel ie to ignite the burning of firewood.\n\n CHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWHAT ARE OILS?\n\nAn oil belongs to a general organics group called “lipid”. It is a well-defined class of an organic substance which is an essential constituent of all forms of plants and animals. Oils are soluble in organic solvents such as ether but insoluble in water. Oil can be grouped into edible and non-edible depending on the amount of specified matters and impurities it contains. Owing to the fact that the used of oil as a raw material for the production of different useful products such as soap, margarine, etc. has increased tremendously, calls for the need for a seminar report on the extraction of oil from a local seed such as groundnut oil from its seed.\n\nNATURE OF EXTRACTION\n\nThis is defined as a technique in which a solute distributes itself between two immiscible solvents as a result of its different solubilities in the two solvents. It is the prefential solution of one or more constituents of a solid mixture by contact with a liquid solvent. This is a unit operation which is one of the oldest in the chemical  industries. The success of an extraction and the technique to be used will vary frequently depending upon any prior treatment which may be given to the solid. In some instance, small particles of the soluble material are completely summoned by a matrix of insoluble matter. The solvent must then diffuse into the mass, and the resulting solution must diffuse out before a separation can occur. Crushing and grinding of such solids will greatly enhance the extraction action, because the soluble portion will now be make more accessible to the solvent.\n\nMoreso, seeds like groundnut seeds are cellular in structures, and the natural products to be extract from this materials are usually found inside the cells of the seeds. If the cell walls remain intact upon exposure to a suitable solvent, the extraction will involve osmotic passage of the solute through the cell walls. This may be slow, but it is impractical and sometime undesirable to grind the material small enough to release the contents of individual cells.\n\nMETHODS OF OIL EXTRACTION\n\nThere are three basic methods by which oil can be extracted from oil bearing seeds.\n\nThey include:\n\ni)            Rending\n\nii)          Mechanical expression\n\niii)        Solvent extraction\n\nRENDERING\n\nThe crudest method of rendering oil from seed which is still practiced in some developing countries such as Nigeria involves heaping up the seeds in piles and exposing them to sun in order to collect the oil that exudes. This method is used in the preparation of seeds of high oil content such as olive and palm oils.\n\nMECHANICAL PRESSING\n\nIn this case, the walls of the seeds are broken by crushing, flaking, rolling, cooking or pressing under high pressure to liberate the oil. This method is utilized to recover the major portion of the oil from many seeds with high oil content.\nTHE EXTRACTION OF OIL FROM LOCAL SEED",

        "content": " OPTIMIZATION OF ACTIVATED CARBON PREPARATION FROM CORNCOB WASTEWATER TREATMENT\n(Chemical Engineering Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\nABSTRACT\n\nCorncob Activated Carbon (AC) was produced via chemical activation with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) for the hydrolysis step and potassium hydroxide (KOH) for the impregnation step. In this work, optimization and development of the model equations for the preparation conditions of AC, Design Expert 6.0.6 Stat-Ease, Inc USA software was used. For the optimization of the AC preparation conditions, a Central Composite Design (CCD) was used to investigate the effect of independent variables on the yield and adsorption capacity of the activated carbon samples. The independent variables used in this work were, phosphoric acid concentration, potassium hydroxide concentration, activation temperature (oC) and activation time (minute). Response Surface Methodology (RSM) technique was used to optimize the preparation conditions (H3PO4, KOH, temperature and time); with percentage yields of hydrolysate and activated carbon and adsorption capacity of AC as the targeted responses. The optimal conditions for the preparation of AC using CCD software were 358.15 oC, 116.90 minutes, 0.29 mg/l H3PO4, 0.09 mg/l KOH. This set of conditions gave hydrolysate yield of 76.9339 %, while activated carbon yield and Methylene Blue (MB) adsorption capacity were 21.84 % and 1.98 mg/g respectively. The specific surface area of the AC using Sear’s method was 314.2 m2/g. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for hydrolysate yield, AC yield and adsorption capacity showed the developed models equations were significant. The experimental and predicted values of the hydrolysate yield, AC yield and adsorption capacity of adsorbent on adsorbate MB were in close agreement and the correlation coefficients R2-values of 0.9688, 0.9358 and 0.9134. The surface areas of selected ACs were 259.8 m2/g (AC8), 215 m2/g (AC9) and 314.2 m2/g (AC14) gave adsorption capacities of 1.92 gm/g, 1.97 mg/g and 1.98 mg/g of MBrespectively. The Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) analysis of the AC samples produced showed the presence of O-H, C-H, C-Br, N-H, C-C, C-N, C=C and C≡C functional groups which aid in adsorbing adsorbate onto the adsorbent. Adsorption isotherm data were used to model the following Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms; the adsorption of Chromium ions on the selected AC produced was predicted by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models with R2 value of 0.9974 and 0.7691 respectively. The percentage chromium removal increases with increase in adsorbent dosage. The activated carbon samples produced can be effectively used for wastewater treatment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\n1.1                Background of Study\nActivated Carbon (AC) is a versatile derivative of biomass predominantly amorphous (crystalline) solid that has extra ordinary large internal surface area and pore volume (Jamaludin, 2010). The unique structure of AC gives rise to its application ranges from liquid to gas phase because of their adsorptive properties.\nIndustrial ACs can be produced from any cheap material with a high carbon content, low inorganics as precursors such as coal, wood, coconut shell, corn cob, almond shells, peach stones, grape seeds, apricot stones, cherry stones, olive stones, peanut hull, nut shells, rice husk, oil palm shells, sugar cane bagasse (Tsai et al., 1997, and 2001; Jamaludin, 2010;\nDiya’udeen et al., 2011). Palm shell, rattan, mango stem peel, and corn cob (Mohd et al., 2011); canarium schevein furthii nutshell (and Ajayi and Olawale, 2009), groundnut shells, Palm Kernel shells, coconut shells, bamboo, wood chips, corn cob, seeds and saw dusts (Oloworise, 2006).\nAC has been the most popular and widely used adsorbent in liquid and gas treatment throughout the world. Charcoal been the pioneer of AC has been recognized as the oldest adsorbent known in waste water treatment.\n\nAC is produced by a process consisting of raw material dehydration and carbonization followed by activation. \nOPTIMIZATION OF ACTIVATED CARBON PREPARATION FROM CORNCOB WASTEWATER TREATMENT\n",

By extension, energy accessibility and cost is a determining factor for the economical, political and social interrelations among nations. Considering energy sources, human society has dramatically increased the use of fossil fuels in the past 50 years in a way that the most successful economies are large consumers of oil. However, geopolitical factors related to security of oil supply, high oil prices and serious environmental concerns, prompted by global warming, the use of petrol for transportation which accounts for one-third of greenhouse gas emissions (Wyman, 1996), have led to a push towards decrease in its consumption. Indeed, the world's strongest economies are deeply committed to the development of technologies aiming at the use of renewable sources of energy. Within this agenda, the substitution of liquid fuel gasoline by renewable ethanol is of foremost importance. Biomass – derived ethanol represents one of the more promising commodities for long term sustainability of transportation fuels (Chum and Overend, 2001).\nPRODUCTION OF BIOETHANOL FROM ELEPHANT GRASS (PENNISETUM PURPUREUM) STEM\n",

        "content": " SYNTHESIS OF BIOLUBRICANT FROM VEGETABLE OILS\n(Chemical Engineering Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\nABSTRACT\nThis thesis aimed at the production of biolubricant from vegetable oils. The first stage produced methyl ester of the oil and in the second stage; the methyl ester was transesterified with Trimethylolpropane (TMP) in a ratio of 3.5:1 at 1500C to produce the biolubricant. The pour points biolubricant and its blend were significantly improved when compared to that of raw oils. The pour point for Jatropha oil improved from 6.5 to -8 to -13, Moringa oil from 6 to -8 to -15, Castor oil from 5 to -4 to -30 and Cotton seed oil from 4°C to -6°C to -16°C respectively. Similarly the viscosity index of Jatropha oil reduced from 220.70 to 216, Moringa oil from 224.70 to 197.75, Castor oil from 96.42 to 88.32, and Cotton seed oil from 213.12 to 198.57 respectively. As the temperature increased from 300C to 100 the viscosity reduces by 37.97, 53.46, 69.58 and 39.32 cSt. The GC-MS result shows that the oils contained more of unsaturated ricinoleic, and linoleic acid than saturated fatty acid of caproic, capric, palmitic and stearic acid. It was found that the biolubricant produced was comparable to the ISO VG-32 and VG-46 commercial standards for light and industrial gears applications respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\n1.1 PREAMBLE\nThe environmental threats posed by the fossil fuels are currently a major global concern. Fossil fuels are increasingly associated with the emissions of greenhouse gases, majorly CO2, leading to climate change, emergence of drought, spread of diseases and variation in population sizes of both plant and animal species (Lashof and\nAhuja, 1990). The depletion of the world’s crude oil reserve, increasing crude oil prices, and issues related to conservation have brought about renewed interest in the use of bio-based materials. Fossil fuels such as petroleum, coal and natural gas, which have been used to meet the energy needs of man, are associated with negative environmental impacts such as global warming (Munack et al., 2001; Saravanan et al.,\n2007). Supply of these non-renewable energy sources is threatening to run out in a foreseeable future (Sambo, 1981; Munack et al., 2001). It has been widely reported that not less than ten major oil fields from the 20 largest world oil producers are already experiencing decline in oil reserves.\nThe contact pressures between devices in close proximity and moving relative to each other are usually sufficient to cause surface wearing, frictions and generation of excessive heat without protector (Hassan et al. 2006). These friction, wear and excessive heat have to be controlled by a process or technique called lubrication. Lubrication is the process or technique employed in reducing wear or tear of one or both surfaces in close proximity and moving relative to each other by interposing a substance called lubricant.\nSYNTHESIS OF BIOLUBRICANT FROM VEGETABLE OILS",

The yams were peeled and washed, 100grams samples coded sample A to G were subjected to two different drying conditions. Some were dried using the sun drying method while the others were dried through oven drying method kept at constant temperature of 500C, sodium bi-carbonate was added to some of the samples, all these were done to obtain a flour with the best colour and texture quality. From the results obtained, it was observed that sample B (yam boiled with sodium bi-carbonate and dried with oven) gave the best result and quality when tested with hot water, this was as a result of the drying condition used, the constant temperature maintained and the presence of the sodium bi-carbonate used which helped in achieving the result. Generally, the samples dried through the oven drying method at 500C gave better colour and result of the yam flour when tested with hot water more than other samples dried by sun drying and this was due to the stability in temperature in the oven drying method used.\nCHAPTER ONE\n1.0       INTRODUCTION\n1.1         Background Of The Study\n\nYam (dioscorea spp.) is a multi-species crop that originated principally from Africa and Asia before spreading to other parts of the world (Hahn et al.,1987). It belongs to the family of dioscoreae within the genus dioscorea and serves as a staple crop in west Africa.(Asiedu et al., 1992). There are many cultivars of yam, though only six are important as staple foods in the tropics. the economically important species grown are Dioscorea rotundata(white yam),D.alata (yellow yam),D.bulbifera (aerial yam), D.esculenta (Chinese yam) and D.dumenterum (trifoliate yam). Yam tubers which is the most important part of the plants can be stored longer than other root and tuber crops. This ensures food security even in times of general scarcity. Yam is the third most important tropical root and tuber crop after cassava and sweet potato (fu et al., 2005). West Africa is the leading producer of yam and grows over 90% of the worldwide production (40 tonnes fresh tuber/year) followed by the west Indians where Jamaica is the leading producer (FAOSTAT,2004). Nigeria is the world’s largest producer of yams followed by Ghana, ivorycoast and togo (FAO,2003). Both fresh tubers and yam flour are now exported from Ghana and Nigeria to developed countries such as united kingdom and united states of America. These are mostly patronized by emigrants from growing regions according to the Nigerian export promotion council (NEPC) Nigeria realized N56 billion in 2007. Sustainable production and utilization of yam are important steps in enhancing food security.\nTHE PRODUCTION OF YAM FLOUR FROM YAM CHIPS\n",

Hence, this work studied the kinetics and combustion of light crude oil in-situ the reservoir to understand their potentials for high-pressure air injection (HPAI) enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Advanced thermo-kinetic simulation and Pressure-Volume-Temperature tools (AKTS and PVTsim) were coupled with non-isothermal Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements and Accelerating Rate Calorimeter (ARC) for the studies. The combustion and kinetics of three (3) light crude oils obtained from Offshore of Newfoundland, Canada were precisely described by the methods. It was observed that the crude with the lowest API of 30.214 had the lowest enthalpy change of 10.9 J/g and the highest onset oxidation temperature of 220 oC, while the crude with the highest API gravity of 46.963 had the highest enthalpy of 24.6 J/g and the lowest onset oxidation temperature of 140 oC. Effect of 10% water saturation of one of the crude samples (Sample A) was studied and it was observed that there was increase in the onset oxidation temperature by 40 oC and lowering of the enthalpy change by 9 J/g. These findings provided evidence that the versatile Differential Scanning Calorimetry thermograms when coupled with kinetic simulation technique can yield reliable results with respect to oil recovery with high correlation coefficient (r > 0.9). This reliable information such as onset, peak and endset temperatures with their respective heat flow patterns, could then be used to provide precise thermo-kinetic parameters. Kinetic triplets such as activation energy, pre-exponential and the reaction model necessary for reservoir screening in an air injection EOR process can also be accurately determined. Mine tailings containing high pyrrhotite content were then used as catalyst to study its effect on the onset oxidation temperature of the crude oils using ARC. An amount of 20% tailings in crude oil lowered the average onset oxidation temperature from 148 oC to 116 oC. It also had the widest oxidation temperature range of 63 oC between the onset and endset temperature, as well as the highest pressure drop of 2.4 bar, which signifies high conversion in the crude oil oxidation reaction as well as production of miscible flue gas which favoured enhanced oil recovery process. Products of air combustion products in-situ was studied as an injectant in a light oil Nigerian reservoir using a simulated slim tube experiment and was observed than flue gas products from air oxidation at high temperature and pressure favoured enhanced oil recovery.\n\n1.1 Preamble\n\nEnhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) is a tertiary recovery process which is normally applied after primary and secondary recovery, to mobilize oil trapped in pores by vicious capillary forces. Thermal, chemical, solvent and gases are the most common form of various EOR process (Isco, 2007). Due to the decline of oil reserves caused by the rising oil production, and clamours for environmentally friendly practice in EOR techniques, petroleum engineers are currently driving EOR projects towards more efficient techniques. One of such efficient technique is the Air/Flue gas injection which is motivated by inexpensive source of air as well as environmentally friendly carbon-dioxide sequestration. The motivation for the use of air as an injectant in the EOR project is because of its abundance, availability and low cost. It can simply be supplied by the use of a compressor, with overall project having low initial and operating cost in comparison to other EOR methods (JOGMEC, 2011).\n\nAir for increasing oil recovery from reservoirs dates back to the 1940’s and early 1950’s (Hvizdos et al., 1983) and by the 1960s and 1970, about forty (40) in-situ full field or pilot projects had been undertaken throughout the world with North America topping such projects (Pwaga et al., 2010). This technique, apart from laboratory studies has been implemented in fields such as West Hackberry in Louisiana, Horse Creek North and South Dakota, Zhongyuan and Liaoche oil fields in China, H field in Indonesia, South Bridge in California and other countries such as Romania, United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, India, Argentina, Venezuela have maintained laboratory and field studies too (Sakthikumar et al., 1996; Ren et al., 1999; Mendoza et al., 2011; Niu et al., 2011; Iwata et al., 2001; Xia et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2001). Air has also been used in heavy oil recovery and enhancement of this technique can lead to significant light oil production (Surguchev et al., 1998).\n\nAn alternative to air injection is the flue gas (which contains nitrogen and carbon-dioxide) produced from the combustion of oxygen contained in the air to sweep oil. This EOR technique, when applied to light oil is known as light oil air injection while in heavy oil reservoir, it is called in-situ combustion. (Kuhlman, 2004; Teramoto et al., 2006; Turta et al., 2007; Li et al., 2009).\nAIR INJECTION STUDIES FOR ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY",

        "content": " DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF MAIZE CORN ON COB TRAY DRYER\n(Chemical Engineering Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\nABSTRACT\nThis study was carried out to generate a design data, design and fabricate a maize corn-on-cob tray dryer used by maize farmers. Ripped maize corns with husks were bought from the market and preserved to retained its moisture content, dehusked and thereafter, dried to a given percentage moisture content of 15%. This was done by laboratory dryer. The drying rate data was generated and the high rate of 2.0g/hr was used afterwards to design and fabricate the corn-on-cob dryer. From the results, drying of a sample of maize corn-on-cob by the laboratory dryer took a period of three days and six hours to reach the 15% moisture content (wet basis) needed. A test run was carried out on the fabricated dryer and seventeen hours was used to dry a sample of maize corn-on-cob to the same 15% moisture content. This implies that design data is satisfactory as its application in the fabrication of the dryer resulted in an increased flow rate of air in the dryer thereby increasing the rate of drying at the same drying temperature of 40oC.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n4\nINTRODUCTION\n1.1. BACKGROUND OF STUDY\nCereal grains have been and will continue to be a major source of food for humans and animals throughout the world. Amongst all cereals, the most important is the maize grain. (Leonard et al, 1963). Maize corn and products can be used for various purposes; human food, alternative medicine, chemicals, bio fuels, ornamentals, fodder, to mention but a few (Leonard, Warren H., and John H. Martin). Maize crop is intensively and extensively cultivated in all the geo-political zones of Nigeria. Early maize is planted between late March and late May while the late maize is planted between August and September. The harvest time for the early maize is usually between late July and September. During this period, corns are harvested fresh and cannot be preserved by drying owing to the unavailability of sunshine during the rainy season. It is usually roasted or cooked fresh. This practice does not encourage maize farmers as they would sell the maize corn at a give-away prices and this does not guarantee returns on their investment. In addition to this, dried maize grains will guarantee food sufficiency during the scarce period. Notably, corn of high moisture content does not stored very well and is usually vulnerable to damage due to deterioration, molds, and insects during the period of storage.\nHowever, open air-sun drying as practiced in most rural areas often yields poor quality dried corn, since the product is not protected against dust, moisture,\n5\nwind, rodents as well as other domestic animals while carrying out the drying. As a result, they are often contaminated with pathogens. Another common practice in maize corn-on-cob drying is drying over a fire place. This has its own problems as the maize grains are contaminated with smoke. Moreover, the temperature of drying is not properly controlled such that grains become dead after drying. There are various research works that have been carried out on grain drying (Zare et al, 2006; Mellmann, et al 2011; Adzimah and Seckley, 2009). These works were silent on drying and dryer design for maize corn-on-cobs.\nThere are four major drying techniques; open air sun drying, fire wood /fuel drying, electrical drying and solar drying(Anyanwu et al 2006, Scanlin 1997 and Whitefield 2000). This research project will address these problems associated with postharvest handling of maize corn-on-cobs, in particular drying, by designing and fabricating electrically operated tray dryer that will be simple but very robust in operation.\n1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\nMaize corns are usually stored when dried to certain percentage moisture content. In Nigeria, maize corn drying is done in dry season because of low humidity of atmospheric air and adequate sunshine. However, it is a common place to see peasant maize farmers dry their maize corn-on-cobs over fire place, but this practice contaminates the dried maize corn with smoke and usually\n6\nsmall quantity of maize corn-on-cob are dried. The reverse is the case during the rainy season. Unfortunately, bulk of the maize corn is harvested in the rainy season and farmers can not dry the fresh maize corn rather they sell them at very cheap prices to corn roasters and for other delicacies. To give value to farmers and also to guarantee maize corn sufficiency during scarce period, it becomes necessary that a simple but robust corn-on-cob dryer should be designed and fabricated to assist farmers have good returns on their investment especially during post-harvest handling of maize corn during rainy season.\nDESIGN AND FABRICATION OF MAIZE CORN ON COB TRAY DRYER",

        "content": " CONSTRUCTION OF A WOODEN BOOK SHELF\n(Chemical Engineering Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\nABSTRACT\n\n          A bookshelf is a component fabricated for the purpose of storing or packaging books, files and other important documents.\n\n          The main aim of constructing this project is to produce a wooden bookshelf which will provide a lasting solution to the problem facing libraries, offices, churches and homes in packaging and storing book items and other items.\n\n          In search for storage facilities for books, and other important documents in libraries, offices, etc, a concept to produce durable bookshelf was initiated.  Therefore, the construction of this shelf will help the prospected user(s) to be packaging their documents well an safe.         There are different kinds of engineering materials which could be used in this type of construction apart from wood.  These are: metal, plastic, and glass.\n\n          The construction was facilitated by some simple machine (tools) such as harmmer, saw, tape, scriber, jack plain, sandpaper, sprayer and materials such as nails, hinges and gums.  As a matter of fact, different operations were performed sequentially to realize the finished product (bookshelf).  Such processes are: making out, cutting/sewing; planning/smoothening; grooving and sunking (where necessary); joining; spraying.  \n\n          Mahogany wood was utilized in the construction.  The wood was cut with sawing machine having measured it with tape to rescuer the desired measurements thus: 48 inches height: 42 inches length: 12 inches breadth. It was then smoothened to give a nice outlook.\n\n          With gum the skeleton was formed before nailing.  The skeleton was so formed before partitioning so that it would support and create reinforcement to the shelf and make it stand firm at the expected position while nailing and fixing the doors with hinges.\n\n          Sequent to this, it was appropriately nailed and gum was blended with sawdust to smoothen rough and gapped places on the shelf before sandpaper and sprayed with sprayer.\n\n          Conclusively, the glass doors were fixed which embellished the job exceedingly.\n\n          As a matter f fact, the construction was designed to meet the requirement of Nigerian Standard Organization (NSO) in the construction of bookshelf.  This is for the fact that the materials used were the high quality ones.  Not only this reasons, the standard measurement was also employed as indicated above.\n\n          It is necessary here to summarize the costing of the project as given in detail in recommendation part of this write up.  Thus, cost of material was nine thousand nine hundred and severity naira (N9,970.00).  Running cost was one thousand and two hundred naira (1,200.00) where as workmanship was three thousand eight hundred and thirty naira (N3,830.00) to total the sum of fifteen thousand naira (N15,000.00).\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n          There are two important questions that requires an answer before an engineering material is chosen for any purpose.  They are, what function does the component have to perform, what are the essential requirements of the component in order that it can fulfill those functions.    The engineering materials can be broadly grouped into two main categories metals and wood.  These materials are used for different purposes either as individual material or a combination of materials for a certain requirement of the desired finished product.\n\n          Hence, the construction of an engineering component like the workshop material that can serve the purpose for which the bookshelf is fabricated.  Thus a wood, specifically mild wood is chosen for this project due to a number of properties as regards to the analysis of its function and requirements which are considered based on common characteristics as follows: center of mechanical properties such as strength, hardness, fatigue resistance etc.  Certain behaviour in specific environment eg. Corrosion free, ability to be formed or fabricated to desired shape and dimension, as well as its cost factor.\n\n          However, there can be other requirements which though not essential, are desirable for instance the surface finished of the component must be alternative, which might be accomplished by painting or spraying using a quality paint or spray that resists certain environment impact of behaviours.\n\n          Nevertheless, the choice of fabrication process depends on a number of factors possibly in:- the quantity of the items required.  The dimensional accuracy.  The surface finished required the size of the item.  The cost factors, etc.\n\n          As a result of these consideration, the method chosen for the workshop bookshelf fabrication is a simple wood joining process, which incorporates: cutting, marking out, nailing, spraying and various fastening system:\n\n          Furthermore, the basic components and properties, fabrication factors and also cost factor of the basic material (fine wood) for workshop bookshelf construction are fully illustrated in the subsequent sectarian. Other material which are employed for specific purposes are saw, hammer, nails, scriber, tape, gum, sprayer, handle and key, down drawer and glasses.\n\n          This write up hence has the primary objectives of guiding and providing students, designers on fabrication engineers with the idea of the property requirement of a material or the construction of a workshop bookshelf on regards to making a prudent choice to enable one achieve a desired component with adequate services requirement and durability.\n\nCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF HARD WOOD\n\nCorrosion Resistance:   This is the ability of the mild hard wood to resist corrosion in a chemical reaction of a material with air in the presence of mixture and chemicals.

Therefore, the construction of this shelf will help the prospected user(s) to be packaging their documents well an safe.         There are different kinds of engineering materials which could be used in this type of construction apart from wood.  These are: metal, plastic, and glass.\n\n          The construction was facilitated by some simple machine (tools) such as harmmer, saw, tape, scriber, jack plain, sandpaper, sprayer and materials such as nails, hinges and gums.  As a matter of fact, different operations were performed sequentially to realize the finished product (bookshelf).  Such processes are: making out, cutting/sewing; planning/smoothening; grooving and sunking (where necessary); joining; spraying.  \n\n          Mahogany wood was utilized in the construction.  The wood was cut with sawing machine having measured it with tape to rescuer the desired measurements thus: 48 inches height: 42 inches length: 12 inches breadth. It was then smoothened to give a nice outlook.\n\n          With gum the skeleton was formed before nailing.  The skeleton was so formed before partitioning so that it would support and create reinforcement to the shelf and make it stand firm at the expected position while nailing and fixing the doors with hinges.\n\n          Sequent to this, it was appropriately nailed and gum was blended with sawdust to smoothen rough and gapped places on the shelf before sandpaper and sprayed with sprayer.\n\n          Conclusively, the glass doors were fixed which embellished the job exceedingly.\n\n          As a matter f fact, the construction was designed to meet the requirement of Nigerian Standard Organization (NSO) in the construction of bookshelf.  This is for the fact that the materials used were the high quality ones.  Not only this reasons, the standard measurement was also employed as indicated above.\n\n          It is necessary here to summarize the costing of the project as given in detail in recommendation part of this write up.  Thus, cost of material was nine thousand nine hundred and severity naira (N9,970.00).  Running cost was one thousand and two hundred naira (1,200.00) where as workmanship was three thousand eight hundred and thirty naira (N3,830.00) to total the sum of fifteen thousand naira (N15,000.00).\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n          There are two important questions that requires an answer before an engineering material is chosen for any purpose.  They are, what function does the component have to perform, what are the essential requirements of the component in order that it can fulfill those functions.    The engineering materials can be broadly grouped into two main categories metals and wood.  These materials are used for different purposes either as individual material or a combination of materials for a certain requirement of the desired finished product.\n\n          Hence, the construction of an engineering component like the workshop material that can serve the purpose for which the bookshelf is fabricated.  Thus a wood, specifically mild wood is chosen for this project due to a number of properties as regards to the analysis of its function and requirements which are considered based on common characteristics as follows: center of mechanical properties such as strength, hardness, fatigue resistance etc.  Certain behaviour in specific environment eg. Corrosion free, ability to be formed or fabricated to desired shape and dimension, as well as its cost factor.\n\n          However, there can be other requirements which though not essential, are desirable for instance the surface finished of the component must be alternative, which might be accomplished by painting or spraying using a quality paint or spray that resists certain environment impact of behaviours.\n\n          Nevertheless, the choice of fabrication process depends on a number of factors possibly in:- the quantity of the items required.  The dimensional accuracy.  The surface finished required the size of the item.  The cost factors, etc.\n\n          As a result of these consideration, the method chosen for the workshop bookshelf fabrication is a simple wood joining process, which incorporates: cutting, marking out, nailing, spraying and various fastening system:\n\n          Furthermore, the basic components and properties, fabrication factors and also cost factor of the basic material (fine wood) for workshop bookshelf construction are fully illustrated in the subsequent sectarian. Other material which are employed for specific purposes are saw, hammer, nails, scriber, tape, gum, sprayer, handle and key, down drawer and glasses.\n\n          This write up hence has the primary objectives of guiding and providing students, designers on fabrication engineers with the idea of the property requirement of a material or the construction of a workshop bookshelf on regards to making a prudent choice to enable one achieve a desired component with adequate services requirement and durability.\n\nCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF HARD WOOD\n\nCorrosion Resistance:   This is the ability of the mild hard wood to resist corrosion in a chemical reaction of a material with air in the presence of mixture and chemicals. Corrosion makes the materials to fade quickly leading to failure.  But by the ability of mild wood to resist this chemical reaction makes it desirable for the workshop bookshelf fabrication where it gives optimum resistance to corrosion attack.\n\nFABRICATION FACTOR\n\n          Fabrication forming or area process of making the wood into the desired shape, and retains its properties.  As indicated earlier, the choice of forming or fabrication process depends on a number of factors more importantly the cost of the process.\n\n          In general, this material (wild wood) and the fabrication method are chosen on the basic of the lowest total cost ie fabrication and material cost which is consistent with the required level of performance for the component.\n\n          Also, the commercial form of supply of materials eg wood sheet etc which affects the used together with the materials also affects the choice of material and fabrication process. \n\n          Thus, of the two main methods of producing a component, namely forming and wood joining, the letter is preferred because of the various involvements with other materials as well as for specification and dimension amongst other factors which are no doubt sort of cover, a wood sheet with a higher thickness was chosen for it so that it can with stand attacks by insects and can accept a strong treatment which mighty be given to it.\n\n          The frame is the skeleton of the whole system, this frame was first erected together before the sheets of the sides, back and partition which withstands the stress that will be exerted on it by the sheet and the load.\n\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT\n\n          The objectives of the project cannot be over emphasized since by its name, the uses are obviously remarkable.\n\n          Nevertheless, the workshop bookshelf helps the users to packing their books at the end of their uses.

        "content": " EXTRACTION OF OIL FROM LOCAL SEED (GROUNDNUT SEED) & CHARACTERIZATION\n(Chemical Engineering Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis project “Extraction of oil from a local seed (groundnut oil) and Characterization” was carried out using ten cups of groundnut seeds that was purchased from a local market in Enugu metropolis.  The oil these seeds were in Enugu using solvent extraction method.  Two different solvents were used in the extraction namely: Ethane and order to compare their yield, physical and chemical properties.\n\nThe extraction was carried out using 32og of size-reduced groundnut with 100ml of 17-hexane while 1.5litres a 15ooml of ethanol was used on 480g of size reduced groundnut seeds.  Ta the end of the extraction operation, the amount of oil-extracted using17-hexane was observed to be far greater than the amount of oil extracted using ethanol.\n\nThe chemical and physical properties of the oil were determined by analysis of the oil.  The physical appearance of 17- hexane extract is light yellow in colour this; true colour of groundnut oil while that the ethanol extract has a light bown colour.  The colour of ethanol on pigments in the size-reduced groundnut seed.\n\nFrom  the result obtained, it was deduced that 17-hexane remains the best solvent for oil extraction while ethanol is not a good solvent for oil extraction.\n\n CHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nExtraction other-wise called leaching is the preferential solution of one or more constituents of a solid mixture by contact with a liquid solvent.  This unit operation, one of the oldest in the chemical industries, here been given many names, depending to some extent upon the technique used for carrying it out extraction of oil form groundnut seeds can be carried out using any of the two solid-liquid extraction methods namely: mechanical extraction method or the used of solvent other- wise called mass-transfer method. The yield of the second method is higher but contains more impurities than the first method and it requires another unit operation (distillation) in purity it better.\n\nThe success of an extraction and the technique to be used will vary frequently depending upon any prior treatment which may be given to he solid.  In some instance small particles of the soluble material are completely surrounded by a matrix of insoluble matter.  The solvent must then diffuse into the mass, and the resulting solution must diffuse out before a separation can result.  Crushing and grinding of such solids will greatly alliterate the leaching action, since then the soluble portions are made more accessible to the solvent.\n\nSeeds like groundnut seeds and other vegetable seeds are cellular in structure, and the natural products to be leached form this material are usually found inside the cells. if the cell walls remain intact upon exposure to a suitable solvent, the leaching involves osmotic passage of the solute through the cell walls.  This may be slow, but in is impractical and sometime undesirable to grind the material small enough to release the contents of individual cells.\n\nOil constitutes a well-defined class of neutral organic substance, which are essential constituents of all forms of plant and animal life.  They are soluble in other and organic solvents but not in water.  Commercial oils are however from a relatively few member of the plant and animal kingdom available forms. They are primary a product of agriculture although these is also a considerably production from uncultivated tropical plants and from mature animals. Oil can be grouped into edible and non-edible depending on the amount of unspecified matters and impurities. Owing to the fact that the use of oil from crop seed as a major raw materials has increased in recent yeses their has been the need for extended and numerous research works based on the extraction of these oil.  Form its seeds as economically efficiently as possible.\n\nThe only possible way of obtaining large quality of oil from oil being vegetable or plant materials is by extraction and this could best be achieve using leading process. This process can be accomplished by a variety of ways but as might be expected its efficiency depends to an extant an obtaining intimate contact between the liquid solvent and the solid containing he solute.  Leaching reduces the oil content in the residue to about 0.5-1.5 percent as compared.\n\nWith about 5-9 percent by mechanical process. The types of solvent available for leaching include 17-hexane, petroleum ether benzene ethyl ether etc which are high petroleum fractions.  The choice of a solvent for extraction is a function of its volatility and relative volatility for easy separation by distillation.\n\nGroundnut oil is used primary in homes for cooking and also as an industrial raw material for other usefully products.\n\n1.2     SCOPE AIMS/ OBJECTIVES FO THE PROJECT\n\nThe scope of this research project is to extract oil from groundnut seeds and compare the yields obtained using different solvents and to standard.\n\nAlso the project is aimed at characterizing the extracted oil by determining the physical and chemical properties of the oil.\nEXTRACTION OF OIL FROM LOCAL SEED (GROUNDNUT SEED) & CHARACTERIZATION",

        "content": " SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL SYSTEMS\n(Chemical Engineering Project Topics & Materials)\nPreview Only\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis seminar topic “Solid Waste Management and Disposal system” is based on the research on what solid waste is all about, how it is managed and its methods of disposal systems. Research on this topic enable us to know that solid wastes are discarded solid materials such as scraps of plastic, rubbers nylon, paper, etc. Also, the collection and processing of these wastes as well as disposal constitute the management of solid wastes. The disposal systems tell us the methods of disposing solid wastes and where they are disposed as well as the transportation of the collected materials. From this seminar,solid wastes are separated into various components and recycled to produce good and usable products. The effective waste management and disposal system result into a clean and healthy environment for living, reduces the spread of diseases and aids the growth of the economy.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWHAT IS SOLID WASTE?\n\nThe United States Environmental protection Agency defined a solid waste as any uselss, unwanted or discarded material with insufficient liquid content, EPA (1975). Because of its sticky nature, a solid Waste has the quality of accumulating, and physically insulting the environment. Omuta (1988), defined a solid as plastic, rubber, paper, glass, etc arising from domestic, trade, commercial, agricultural and industrial activities. Moreso, solid matter that are created by human or animal activities and which are disposed because they are considered useless are known as solid wastes. Most of the solid wastes like plastic, robber, etc. are non. Biodegradable which means that they do not get broken down through organic processes thus, when they accumulate, they pose a health threat to the people. According to Eze (1995), a solid waste means any refuse, gabbage and other discarded materials resulting from community, agricultural and industrial operations.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF SOLID WASTES\n\nAccording to Umeh (1991), solid wastes have potential to cause harmful effect if not properly managed. He classified solid wastes into the following.\n\n-              Garbage: decomposable wastes\n\n-              Rubbish: non-decomposable wastes such as plastic, Rubber,etc.\n\n-              Ashes: residues from combustion of solid fuels\n\n-              Dead animals.\n\n-              Large wastes: Wastes from construction and demolition of structures.\n\n-              Industrial wastes: such materials like scraps of plastic, rubber etc.\n\n-              Agricultural wastes: farm animals manure and crop residues.\n\nHowever, according to Bernade (1987), solid waste can be classified into different classes depending on their sources:\n\n-              Household waste which is generally classified as municipal waste.\n\n-              Industrial waste as hazardous wastes\n\n-              Biomedical waste as infections waste.\n\nSOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT PRACTICES\n\nSolid wastes management practices can be divided into two namely:\n\n1.  The management of the wastes in the areas  where they are generated.\n\n2.  The management of the wastes at dumping grounds.\n\nSolid wastes management practices include the issues that are related to wastes generation, storage, collection and removal from collection points. Moreso, solid wastes management practice is an issue that cuts across every sector of the economy. It is an aspect that has been generating concern in the Chemical Industry which has become a challenge to the Chemical Engineers. Advocates of Environmental protection Agency have drawn the attention of the national policy –maker to the health hazards and potential dangers to natural resources caused by the inadequate management of wastes, Anard (1999). There  is a wide variation in both the physical and chemical nature of wastes generated as one goes from one household to another or one industry to another.\n\nFurthermore, waste management is a serious environmental problem that has been the subject of several studies, conferences, strategic meetings and debates. According to Tanaka (1998), the purpose of waste management is to preserve the living environment and improve public health through the restriction of wastes discharge, appropriate sorting, storage, collection, transport, recycling, etc. of wastes and conservation of clean living environment. Thus, wastes management practices are expected to contribute significantly to the conservation of the living environment and maintenance of a high standard of public hygiene.\n\nSOLID WASTES COLLECTION METHODS\n\nThe methods vary widely among different countries and regions. These includes:\n\n1.          CURBSIDE COLLECTION: In this method, every urban domestic household is provided  with three bins. One for recyclables, another for general wastes and the third for garden materials. These bins may be provided by the government if requested or individuals.\n\n2.          ENVAC COLLECTION: This is the convey of refuse via under ground conduits using a vacuum system.\n\nMoreso, domestic wastes collection services are often provided by local government authorities or by private companies.\n\nDISPOSAL SYSTEMS\n\nThe issue of waste disposal has become one of the most crucial matters confronting the society. Public concern on this issue continued to be expressed daily through the medial such as news paper, magazine, radio and television, Anon (1995). The scientist has spent much time to analyze various stages of waste control systems which are applicable to today’s waste generation and disposal means. The indiscriminate dumping of refuse by many or individual on unapproved or unauthorized areas such as the ground, street corners constitute a big problem to the society. This refuse emits bad odour that is harzardous to man’s health. Moreso, the disposal of waste is a problem. This problem continues to grow with the growth of population and development of industries. Disposal of wastes in open pits have become routine in majority of places some of the methods of disposal systems include incineration, recycling, sustainability, biological reprocessing, energy recovery and avoidance & reduction method.\n\nFurthermore, the problem of solid waste disposal is as a result of increasing urbanization coupled with colonial policy on urban planning. It was observed that before our contact with the Europeans that each household was responsible for keeping its immediate environment clean. Today, traditional dumps have disappeared and the open space converted to housing. However, alternate arrangement has been made for proper solid waste disposal which includes composting, land filling, incinerations and recycling.\n\nSOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES\n\n1.     WASTE HIERARCHY: The waste management hierarchy refers to “3Rs which means, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. This classifies waste management in terms of waste minimization. The waste hierarchy remains the cornerstone of most waste minimization strategies. The aim is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of wastes. The hierarchy diagram is shown below.      \n\n                       \n\n2.    POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE: This is a principle where the polluting party pays for the impact caused to the environment. Also, a waste generator pays for the disposal of the wastes.\n\n3.     TALORIES DECLARATION PRINCIPLE: This is a declaration for sustainability concerned with unprecedented scale and speed of environment pollution, degradation and depletion of natural resources.\nSOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL SYSTEMS\n",
